Russian President Vladimir Putin signed the Law on Administrative Responsibility for Violations of Time and Order of Payment of Goods (Works, Services) in Procurement for Public and Municipal Needs.
This law is designed to address the very serious problem of failure to fulfil its obligations by contracting parties in the implementation of public and municipal procurement.
Two years ago, the situation where entrepreneurs were unable to receive payment under the existing public and municipal contracts was widespread.
At that time, the President of Russia had instructed the Office of the Prosecutor-General of the RF to take over the issue of special control.
Because businessmen themselves could not deal with poor clients who had entered into unfunded contracts, tried to withdraw from their payment obligations and included illegal terms in the contracts.
The problem was systemic in general in the country.
Since 2015, 9.7 thousand submissions have been made by the Public Prosecutor ' s Office to protect the rights of entrepreneurs and, as a result of their review of disciplinary responsibilities, 4.5 thousand officials have been brought to administrative 533, 75 cases have been brought to the investigation bodies for the organization of procedural checks, 46 of which have been initiated.
As a result, the debt to entrepreneurs amounted to over 66 billion rubles.
These huge amounts were accumulated far from due to the non-payment of multibillion-dollar contracts.
Basic debts have resulted in numerous, systematic delays in the payment of services to entrepreneurs, where they have a lower amount.
That's a typical case.
The manager of the small company won a competition for several million rubles in social transport services.
Man has invested all his working resources, has fully fulfilled his obligations, but has not received the money within a period of time.
The result is an increase in the financial debt of one of the employees, taxes, and loans that would have led to bankruptcy if the employer had not applied for assistance from the prosecutor's office.
In a number of regions, the problem has now been solved as much as possible.
Nevertheless, as of the first half of 2017, the total debt by public and municipal contracts identified by the prosecutors of the Russian Federation amounted to around 27.4 billion rubles.
In regions where debt rates continue to reach critical values, the Prosecutor ' s Office is working under a hand-held anti-crisis management system.
The Attorney-General shall hold meetings with representatives of the local authority, which shall include, as a matter of fact, all alleged violations by the prosecutors and measures to eliminate them immediately.
Such operational meetings have already been held in Yaroslav and Ekaterinburg this year.
To improve the payment discipline of public contractors will be able to implement Federal Law No. 189-FZ on the amendment of the Russian Federation Code on Administrative Offences in the Administrative Responsibility of Officials of the Contractor for the violation of the time and order of payment of goods (work, services) in procurement for public and municipal needs, which was signed last week by the President of Russia.
The draft law was developed by the Russian Mineconomy Development on the initiative of the Gender Procuratorate.
The new Act will supplement the Russian Federation Code on Administrative Offences, which provides for a fine of between 30,000 and 50,000 rubles for the violation by the official of the time and order of payment of goods, works and services in public and municipal procurement.
If the official has already been subjected to administrative punishment for a similar offence, he is required to be disqualified for a period of one year to two years.
All prosecutors of the Russian Federation have already been commissioned to ensure the application of these legislative novelties in practice.
The Civil Rights Protection Group announced a warning on the movement in Missouri
The National Association for the Promotion of the Advancement of the Colorful Population has issued a warning to colouring people travelling to Missouri because of the discriminatory policies of the state and attacks on racist grounds.
The Group ' s statement reads: “The prevention for travellers of the National Association to promote the progress of the colouring population, valid until 28 August 2017, calls for African-American travellers, visitors and citizens of the state of Missouri to be particularly careful and to exercise increased caution when travelling by state in connection with a number of suspicious incidents on a racist basis recently occurring throughout the state and brought here”.
According to the National Association for the Promotion of the Advancement of the Colorful Population, the recent law adopted in Missouri has led to a more difficult challenge for people to win claims related to discrimination, as well as the disproportionate choice of state law enforcement authorities by their minority representatives.
“You have people who violate human rights.
They are kept on the streets because of the colour of the skin, killed and killed," said the Kansas City Star newspaper Rod Chapel, president of the National Association for the Promotion of the Advancement of the Colored People of Missouri.
“We often hear complaints as never before.”
This is the first warning of this kind announced by the United States.
The group referred to incidents such as the humiliation of black students on racial grounds at the University of Missouri and the death of twenty-eight thousand-year-old Tori Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in suspicious circumstances earlier this year after he had finished gas during his trip to the state, and the state police arrested him without charges of crime.
The warning also mentions the recent report of the State Prosecutor ' s Office of Missouri that the possibility of being stopped on the road for black drivers is 75 per cent higher than for white drivers.
“The aim is to warn people about the situation and to warn their relatives and friends and colleagues about what might happen in Missouri,” Chapel said.
“People must be prepared in such a way as to take money for the hostage or tell their relatives that they are travelling in the territory of the State.”
According to the latest FBI programme on hate crimes, there were 100 hate crimes registered in Missouri in 2015, making it the sixteenth State of such violations.
The prevention of movement is also a response to the new law of the state of Missouri, after which it will be more difficult to bring a case against a legal person in connection with housing or labour discrimination.
Earlier, the American Union for the Protection of Civil Liberties (ACLU) had announced warnings to Travellers in Texas and Arizona after these states had adopted new immigration control laws that local law enforcement authorities had been ordered to arrest people for violations of immigration laws, which, according to ACLU, had to increase the number of racial checks.
Movement prevention is usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but recent public organizations have resorted to this in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Two people were killed as a result of a police patrol shot in Egypt
The unknown were shot by a police patrol in the Egyptian city of Igna, Reuters reported with reference to the Ministry of the Interior of Egypt.
At the time of the shooting, two people, including one police officer, were killed, three injured.
All wounded were delivered to the hospital.
According to the agency, the police stopped the car, and two men in the armed men ' s car were fired on firearms.
One of the criminals was arrested, the other was able to hide.
Rustourism supports the law on the cancellation of free baggage for non-return aircraft
Oleg Safonov's Rosturisma Head said in an interview with the RBK TV channel that "good" refers to the adoption of the law on the cancellation of free luggage in non-return aircraft.
"It is necessary to create conditions in which a person with no luggage can buy cheap tickets rather than a person with a luggage," he stressed.
Mr. Safonov noted, however, that, despite the concerns of the citizens, there would be no need to pay for the carriage of the upper clothes and the mobile phone in the hand bet.
"It would be right to calm down all our citizens and tourists and say that it's to the top of our clothes, to the zontics, to the mobile phone, to the epidemic, or even to a computer that has nothing to do with it," said the head of Rosturism.
Former Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law providing for the right of airlines to rule out the free movement of baggage when a non-return aircraft.
The point is that airlines can themselves determine the number of places and weights of baggage included in the non-return tariff.
Vladimir Putin commissioned to eliminate the pollution of the Bike
President Vladimir Putin of Russia at the Baikal Protection Meeting reported that in recent years significant lake areas have been subjected to extreme pollution.
It has commissioned the identification of sources of funding, plans and implementation for the elimination of pollution.
Mr. Putin also commissioned a full recovery of the contaminated territories.
“It is also necessary to deal with the facilities that continue to work here, most of them have been exported,” the President's RIA quoted as saying.
He also added that the General Prosecutor ' s Office of Russia should carry out an environmental check.
In his view, there were problems in the lake area with natural waste and a number of environmental violations by recreational organizers.
"I want to emphasize this: not all the orders are to be checked, but the measure must also be known here, but it is illegal and environmentally harmful activities and appropriate measures," he stressed.
Earlier, the Office of the Attorney-General had reported a reduction in fish stocks in Lake Baikal and had proposed an increase in the number of facilities subject to environmental supervision.
On 15 June, Vladimir Putin, in a direct line, stated the need to amend legislation to ensure the rights of citizens living in the natural territories of the special security regime.
The people of the island of Olhon, which is part of the Bikel Natural Territory, told him about the problems of economic activity.
The Head of Nature Sergey Donsky immediately proposed to address the problem by clarifying the boundaries of the Baikal water protection zone, but in the Government of Buratia it was recalled that such a change was not sufficient because the restrictions were linked to a number of regulatory acts.
Earlier in the Mineconomy, it was proposed to address the problem by amending the Land Code and the Environmental Protection Act.
A New Temple in the U.S.
In the village of Soswa, members of the community from the indigenous small peoples of the North Rachtinya, together with the inhabitants of the Berzesov region, participate in the construction of the Orthodox temple in honor of the saint Nikolai Cudodravtz.
Its location is on the river bank, and the temple is well seen from far away, so it will serve as a means of transport for the fishermen.
According to community representatives, the construction work will be completed this year, now the dome has been established, there are church bells.
The Game Reb of the fleet provided transportation.
The temple is named in honor of St. Nicholas the Wonder, because it is regarded by the Orthodox Church as the protector of passengers, including fishermen.
In the Soviet Union, the fishing industry gives the settlers jobs and feeds them.
Locals are waiting when the temple opens its doors, and children are even writing about it as a local merit in school.
Designland with the death penalty.
Why do the laws in Singapore apply?
I'm talking to a local businessman, Chang, sitting in the breakfast room in the open air.
Commenting on the situation in Singapore, Chang smokes one cigarette after another, the hooks accurately make a box of iron from his office.
After the interview, the businessman is directed to the nearest urn, a hundred metres away, and sends out the bees.
Penalties for garbage in public places -- $500 local, says Chang.
You know, I've only had a reflex since I was a kid: you can't throw a fancier from a confectionery to a bridge, they're getting hurt right now.
And now all over the video cameras.
And indeed, Singapore's roads in the center of the city are clean, as it is in the museum.
Chang relates: Three months ago, his 18-year-old son carved out the wall of an old colonial building.
The court found the man guilty of vandalism and sentenced him to death.
What?
Imagine yourself.
He was hit ten by a wooden stick on his pillows and spent a week in prison.
We don't have any kind of physical punishment.
As Singapore combines the highest standard of living and incredibly strict laws, the viewer “AIF” has been identified.
No one here intends to cancel the death penalty, explains lawyer Victor Lee Hong.
And the Government has long been in favour of both the Euro Union and the United States in this regard.
If a person carries a large batch of drugs or trades them, he is a scapegoat.
In 2002, a 22-year-old citizen of Australia was detained at Changi Airport, taking 400 g of cocaine.
The Australian Prime Minister took action to protect him, threatening sanctions, international human rights defenders and even the Pope of Rome.
However, the guy was still hanging.
After that, our country's drug dealers are taking a hard look at the side.
The case is this: Singapore states that the laws are binding on all people in order, not just the humble and the poor.
No matter who you are, you're a millionaire, a deputy prime minister, a famous artist or a citizen of the European Union.
The only option in this case is that if you get half the cocaine, you'll be hung up.
When you go to Singapore, and you meet a bunch of warning dogs everywhere, you're just wondering how much bans are in this city.
For example, chewing powder is sold only in pharmacy and can be bought strictly by a doctor.
Tourists don't take their chewing gums when they arrive, but they're gonna have to put a "resin" in the subway, they're gonna get a fine of $1,000.
In four days, I met two people with white plates on my neck, "I'm fucked."
In addition to the fine, past the oven, they often refer to the “link in the yard”: a week to clean the parks and beaches.
6 thousand rubes the “criminal” who forgets to wash the water in the public toilet, and when trying to meet the small need in the elevator of the home, a special detector is working, blocking the door and sending a signal to the police.
Among all exotic laws are bans on the feeding of pigeons on the street, public performance of songs and even excessive drinking of room vegetation (!): it is believed that the water is attracting mosquitoes.
In order to avoid fires, fires can not be carried in the subway, otherwise they will be fined to 5,000 Singaporen basses.
In general, it seems like you're trying to break something.
That's not true, but I'm trying to find out about Muhammad Kabir-Kajaria, the owner of the local tour agency.
In particular, fantastic laws exist only on paper, and in the last twenty years I haven't seen anyone get involved in their violation.
Why are they staying?
So that the citizens don't get relaxed.
Compliance with the basic rules is closely monitored.
Let's say if they sell cigarettes to a minor, they'll be punished by the chain: the store's owners will pay a huge sum, the offender himself will be hit by sticks on the back, and the seller will also build and put in jail.
It is because of such strict laws of crime in Singapore that it is very rare.
Is that true?
As early as the 1970 ’ s, we had road chaos, and motorists ignored the lights, drove as they wanted, and drank.
After the fines had been imposed, everything was calmed down for a year.
Now the driver, drinking a portion of whiskey, knows that if they stop, the police will not let them go for a bribe, they will charge a fine of the value of the apartment, and they will go for years.
Many foreigners in South-East Asia seem to have a variety of conclaves.
In 1993, American writer William Gibson called Singapore "Disnyland with a death penalty" - guests from the U.S. threatened the general wealth of the population, the "fearing clean airport" and the "cultural nature".
The board, like these things are unnatural, looks artificial, and should not, in principle.
The first days in Singapore and you're really afraid to throw a paper on the sidewalk, you get caught if you get on the subway with the frozen.
But then you come to the Little India area, and the second is "the break-up of the model": the bus stop has plastic bottlenecks.
"How's that?" you're surprised.
That's right, the Singaporens are smiling.
Everything's going on.
Not for every crime like this will be captured, but you should know that if they count you, you will not get rid of them, for you have broken the law.
Most of all, it is enough for a person to behave normally.
Of course, the power in Singapore is entirely authoritarian.
But you know what?
In the Vietnamese Hoshimin, I made a very cautious move, and motorcyclists often come out of the hands of tourists from smartphones and cameras.
In the centre of Paris full of dirty bombs and beggars.
We're not all trying to dump garbage on our streets, either.
Singapore, however, has become the most peaceful, clean and secure city on earth as a result of the combination of draconian fines and cruel (including the death penalty).
You're thinking.
Such a human nature: remember, and in Russia no one has stepped in till they are fined.
Although Singapore is not a fine, it is a voluntary law enforcement.
And it should be thought that we in Russia would also be happy to have clean streets, lack of garbage in the subway, and welcome the arrest of those who drive a public toilet elevator.
Those are the punishments of the flesh. Thank you.
In the rest of Singapore's laws, at least there is a need to look after them.
Nothing sacred?
Now the White House of Trump has focused on the Statue of Freedom.
The most reliable sign of the regime's change is when it starts fighting the statues.
The Americans do not see this as worse than all the others - from here deliberately the theater of the statue of Saddam Hussein at Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologies of the Tramp Government, no doubt knew what he was doing when he brought a symbolic storm over the Statue of Freedom during a fierce dispute with CNN journalist Jim Acastan on the President's proposals for a sharp reduction of legal migration.
Let's be honest, Miller didn't try on his own.
The officers of the masters of sailing ships and artists representing the Statue of Freedom would have licked it if he had tried to do so.
But he tried in her sense, and especially in the sense that she was assigned in 1903, 17 years after the monument was completed when the texts of Emma Lazarus were added to the Pedestal.
As Miller was working on Akista, "I don't want to go deep into history here, but the Statue of Freedom is a... symbol of American freedom, which is the world's dawn.
The invention you are talking about was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Freedom."
Miller correctly explained the facts, but as he himself said, it's really not about history.
This is about the current sound of the shocking words of Lazarus, the only ones in which the State invites not all immigrants, but the poorest: "Your insanity, your poor, your people who dream of breathing freely, your unhappy discards of your vast shores."
"unlucky dumps" have never been seen on our screens.
Miller didn't do literature - he made it clear that these people weren't waiting in America.
This issue of the meaning of the statue is part of a broader political and cultural war: it is indeed a dispute of the meaning of America.
Lazarus - and her friends, who were struggling to put her words on a statue after her death, were very well aware that they were doing a totally political act.
Imaginary sculptures should have been linked between the French and American republics by means of a banishable classic figure, a female image of freedom.
Lazarus changed her mind: The female figure is no longer abstract, and she has a voice.
And she got a completely different name: Mother of the evicted.
The combination of poetry and image was a brilliant feminist move and a devastating attack on American nativity.
And as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, they were entitled to change it back.
The huge Rash Limbo, of his kind John the Baptist, who announced the arrival of Trampa in 2010, argued that Freedom does not invite anyone, rather it is an early neo-conservator carrying the flame of America in the darkness of peace: "Freedom goes forward.
It is a faction of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
Fake doesn't need to light up the way to the U.S.."
Limbo's habit really got in the way.
The meaning of the statue depends solely on the perspective.
The great creative achievement of Lazarus was to see her as exhausted, unhappy, but full of hope on the decks of ships after a long and often heavy voyage.
It literally means looking at the world in the eyes of people who seek refuge and a chance for a better life.
We answer to them by saying the hope and hospitality they wish to hear.
And, of course, it's not the prospect that Miller and Trump will ever want to admit.
They don't need to light up the path, but to light up hatred, which is the only source of their strength.
2017 World Championship: The Nile Blake is honored by the Scottish members of the United Kingdom Assembly.
Elid Doyle remembers the time when there were only two Scottish people in the United Kingdom
Neil Blake, director of the Federation's game by the British Light Athletics, said that a 16-person Scottish part of the World Championship will make a "significant contribution to the team's game".
The record number of Scottish light athletes was selected for the 2017 London Championship on Friday.
Blake believes that in Scotland “something special is born” and the Federation of Light Athletics of the United Kingdom must take this into account.
"We know that and we're trying to understand it and we're going to support it as long as they have the potential," Blake said.
"I spoke to people at the Scottish Sports Institute, and they think it's about what they did.
The Scottish Federation of Light Athletics thinks that what they did has to work.
The British Federation of Light Athletics: with what they did, they had to work.
And people on the street think the same way.
I don't know why the circumstances were that way, but it's so brighter."
Some of the Scottish light athletes claim medals, including Laura Moore and Andrew Bachert, who will compete with Sir Mo Farah at a distance of 5,000 metres; and Elid Doyle has chosen his captain.
"Eylide is modest.
Her captain's speech was great," Blake says.
"Many light athletes, whether they are or not, and from where they live or are trained, have left this room feeling proud and eager to win.
The passion and sincere feelings that Elid had put into it were remarkable."
The owner of the Silver Medal of the Commonwealth Championship, which will run 400 m from its fifth World Championship with obstacles, says that 16 Scottish people in the British Assembly are "incredibly".
The previous record of the number of Scottish World Championships was equal to seven in 1983 and 2005.
Laura Moore, who specializes in running at medium distances and who hit five British and two European records last year.
She'll run at 1500 and 5,000 meters.
Chris O'Hare, who will participate in the 1500m race, is another Scottish man who is to be remembered: behind him is a successful season in which there have been victories in British rallying and annual competitions.
Doyle remembers his first world champion when, apart from her, the only Scottish team was Lee McConnell.
The captain of the team says that she is "incredibly proud" because so many of her associates have not only entered the rally, but in some cases they will claim medals and fight for the final.
"The captain of the assembly elects other members of the team, so it was a great honor at all, but to know that your associates voted for you and chose you -- it's a very special thing to me," she added.
"Finally, I'm very proud of all the Scottish people who have entered the assembly.
This shows how much we have achieved.
And they're all the easy-to-go athletes who'll try to get on the pedestal.
What about my captain's speech?
Yeah, I think she was good.
I just drew attention to the fact that we were very lucky to host the World Championship home.
So it's just about how important it is to get support from the sick and take advantage of what we're going to be at the Olympics again.
I've got another chance to go out on his stage and participate in the competitions, and the atmosphere will be just amazing."
Lockdown on Facebook: You don't have to go to public unless you're willing to listen to criticism from voters
The founder of our country understood that this was a critical press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but that didn't stop them from criticizing him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
The criticism of him, of course, made him angry.
But he did not shut his mouth to criticism.
Because still in 1783, Washington said: "You can take away the freedom of speech and we, the deaf and the lame, will behave like sheep to the battle."
Now I'm going to go to Governor Maryland Larry Hogan, who should try to be more like Washington.
The Hogan subordinates have blocked and killed at least 450 people who have expressed their views on his official Facebook page.
And this week, the American Union for the Protection of Civil Liberties has put him in court for this.
The subordinate governors called this claim worthless, and the comment on the Internet was written in a spirit of "well and what."
"It's just Facebook," many will say.
But that's also important.
And that's especially important when it comes to the Hogan guy.
He is an amazingly popular Republican governor in the democratic advantage of the state.
He is in second place in the country ' s 50 governors ' approval rating.
Hogan's not a top-up reaction.
He demonstrated his strong hand in the administration of the State and his commitment to his principles.
It also uses Facebook as the primary way of communicating with its voters and with jokes demonstrates its weakness on its page after head chemotherapy.
Therefore, blocking people who come on the Governor's page, which has been declared an official public forum and is administered by the administration for taxpayers' money, is unnecessary and ultimately harmful.
In an interview with Washington Post, press secretary Amelia Ches defended the governor's actions, claiming that blocking comments was just their moderating.
But it's too easy to use the images of trolls, spammers and hackers that abuse the Internet.
"Post" spoke to some of the real people Hogan has blocked.
And these are the real people, not the trolls, the teacher, the businessman, the pastor, who's talking to their elected leaders.
They all say that their comments were respectful, substantive and not rude.
The pastor quoted the Bible, appealing that Hogan was a Catholic.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Raman from Bowie, Maryland, did not express hatred, but asked about hate crimes.
"I have written a strong comment that I am disappointed by his lack of response to hate crimes and other recent news," she wrote in the section of comments on the article in Post.
"I also don't like the idea that when many people leave comments on the same subject, some immediately say it's a so-called coup rather than admitting that they have a problem with a large group of discontented citizens."
What the subordinate governors call a “concentrated spam attack”, others would probably call an “active life position”.
In the age of Facebook, it is easy to edit your image by simply blocking critics or squeezing negative comments.
It's much less dusty work than it used to be when people were required to send, collect and burn newspapers with critical advances or to arrest and catch a Protestant mouth.
But that's exactly what's happening right now, just in the figure.
Hogen is not the first officer to be criticized for not wanting to listen to Facebook and other neighbors.
President Trampu's claim was filed by Twitter users who were detained in his Twitter account.
One of the first, reverse decisions on this issue was made this week in Virginia.
According to a U.S. district judge from Alexandria, James K. Casharis, the chairman of the Laudon County Oversight Board violated the First Amendment, delaying the voter in his Facebook account.
In Kentucky, Republican Governor Matt Bevinu filed claims with the American Union for the protection of civil liberties for his behaviour on Facebook and Twitter.
It's not gonna be that hard.
In Washington, D.C., the available mail costs were about the same as the Internet today.
From 1776 to 1800, the number of newspapers grew fourfold, and the authors of anonymous letters severely violated its authority.
And even then Washington was dealing with anonymous trolls.
People under the aliases of "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belzarius" and "Porcius" wrote letters in the newspapers that ridiculed Washington's decision.
According to the historical documents collected by George Washington's online project, his office was seized by petitions criticizing his position under the Treaty on Friendship, Trade and Navigation.
But he didn't try to keep them quiet.
Freedom of speech, inconsistencies and speeches is at the very heart of our State.
And true leadership means agreement.
Ronan Rafferti hopes for home facilities at the Renaissance Club
The former European champion Ronan Rafferti hopes for the next three days when the Renaissance Club in East Latvia will host the twenty-fifth open Scottish golf tournament for older athletes.
The native of Northern Ireland, who led a nearby Archerfield Links club, moved towards the final round last year until Paul Ils, was added to the new place and played the role of a tournament representative on behalf of the founder and director of Jerry Sarvadi club.
“I saw how the Renaissance club was built, and we are watching how it succeeds in this event,” said Rafferti.
“The players will see this field at its best moment, it is in a magnificent state.
Jerry did a great job building this place.
He's a strong commitment to this game and is proud of his achievements here.
This is an excellent demonstration for this field.”
Englishman Ils is looking forward to the opportunity to stand up to the championship for the first time, despite the fact that he won his 32-year career in the European Tour and in the European Challenge Tour.
“It’s really a special feeling,” said a Southport player.
“I couldn’t try to win the Extremadura Open again, because it was removed from the calendar a year after I won it.
Returning to this corner of the world is magical.
It's a great place to play golf.
The memories of last year are coming back, and for me and my wife, Sharon, it was a very special impression to win last year.
It was indeed a special time, and we will always remember it.”
Returns to the struggle on Gary Orr's native land, who joined the European tournament for older athletes after he had completed 50 earlier this year.
This event will be the first public event in Scotland since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"When you play at home, it's always a little more important," said the resident of Helensboro Orr.
“You want to do well, but you feel this extra burden.”
I was very pleased to play again, and I showed a good golf course.
I am pleased with what has been achieved."
The three will be joined by the former winner of the Masters Ian Wusman tournament and the champion champions for the older athletes Paul Brodherst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNally.
Orr and former Captain Ryder Cup Sam Thorns are two of the six Scottish people on the field; the rest are Andrew Oldcorn, Steven Mcalister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Participation in the tournament is free of charge and the park is worth 5 pounds per hour if one person is in the car and 10 pounds if one person is two or more.
All income goes to the British Prosthetic Cancer Fund.
British roads learn to absorb harmful emissions
Self-contained tunnels over highways capable of absorbing carbon dioxide emitted by cars are already being tested on the roads of Britain.
The country ' s transport agency, according to the Autocar publication, reported positive results of the 100-metre tunnel tests established on one of the sixes in the north.
The 6-metre tunnel is built from some of the most recent polymer materials that can absorb harmful substances contained in car exhausts.
However, the creation of a network of such tunnels is only part of the large measures that the British authorities are going to take to improve the atmosphere.
In addition to the network of tunnels, the English are going to expand the network of charging stations for electric cars, implement a number of road traffic reduction activities, expand commercial transport on electric trains, and modernize heavy-duty trucks.
According to official statistics, the fourth of all air pollution is caused by transport and the unsatisfactory quality of air is caused by up to 40,000 premature deaths per year.
Mosgorsud changed the sentence to punish Mamaev's disabled
Mosgorsud changed the sentence of disabled Anton Mamaev, who was sentenced to four and a half years in a colony, to a fine of 200 thousand rubles.
That's what TASS reports.
Earlier, the prosecutor's office had asked the court to replace the term for parole, explaining its request that Mamaev's disease “impeded him to be found in prison”.
Anton Mamaev was sentenced to four and a half years ' imprisonment with the sentence of the general regime in the aftermath of the massacre that was the victim of an ex-combatant.
On 19 July, a court of departure to the SBI released a man from custody.
Poverty and death in the Indonesian “Golden Land”
After lunch, Bardina Degei doesn't use the plate.
It's not even used as a gorilla.
In his wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of Pania County in the southern Indonesian province of Papua, the housekeeper usually simply places a sweet potato called “note” right in the eye.
Half an hour later, the paralyzed club is provided and eaten by impatient, uninhibited hands.
Degei sits on the ground floor – she has no furniture – and this is where she does her homework at home, such as the water of the muddy water from nearby mud.
The cleaning room is served in the living room without a roof.
She was the youngest of four wives to her husband, so she was not assigned to work in the field.
The crowd is scattered here.
Of course, working late may be dangerous: many men from this village are unemployed, many drink, and there are still soldiers.
"No one decides to go to the village after five dinners," she says.
This is a rare opportunity to look at daily life in the high mountain of Papua, the former Dutch colony, which had acceded to Indonesia in 1969 after a questionable referendum, when only 1026 elders had to vote publicly in front of the occupying forces.
The existing movement, which advocated independence from the Netherlands, quickly turned its wrath against the Jakarta Government, which maintained strict control over the region without allowing foreign journalists and human rights defenders.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, while the independent State of Papua New Guinea occupied the eastern part of the island.
Enerothali is a city as far away as abandoned; the road here includes a half-hour flight from Jayapura, the administrative center of the province, in Nabira, and then a five-hour tramp on a hired car.
There's no public transport here.
The town with a population of about 19,000 is made up of wooden houses covered with bamboo fences; the roofs of the ossuary are decorated with rustic beads in a variety of reddish shades.
There were few Indonesians here, no longer talking about journalists, and almost no foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, the popes worshipped the god of Ug Tamea.
There have been other changes.
“It was unusual for us to wear this dress, ” says Degei, pointing to his bright, hundreds of hand turbines, a dark jacket and a bright robe.
“We used to wear only sheets on our bodies.”
Papua is the poorest province of Indonesia, with 28 per cent of its population living below the poverty line, while the level of child mortality and literacy among the worst in Asia.
But it's still Indonesia's gold land.
The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by the Phoenix Freeport McMoran, is located in just 60 miles from Pania, a high-income province about 153,000 people live in New Jersey.
Only in 2015 did Freeport obtain gold and media here for about $3.1 billion.
In addition, Papua can be used as stockpiles of forest valued at $78 billion.
These riches, however, bring an unhappiness to the papuas, guaranteeing that the powerful Indonesian armed forces remain here in their stunning presence.
According to New York Times, between 1998 and 2004, Freeport paid nearly $20 million to local soldiers and units, including up to $150,000 to one officer.
The demands of greater autonomy by the popes threaten the existence of this gold habitat and are unhappily exaggerated.
According to human rights defenders, more than 500,000 popes have been killed by the Indonesian military since 1969 and thousands more have been raped, tortured and deprived of their liberty.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, mass killings in the indigenous peoples of Papua highlands in the 1970s could be considered genocide.
Only last year did the Indonesian police arrest more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region.
“We are losing everything”, the report published in 2016 by the Brisbane Eparchy contains evidence of the atrocities committed in the previous year, such as executions without a court, torture, especially parts, as stated in the other report, rape and lightning, and the brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations.
“It’s hard to count the number of victims, because the incidents are happening every week,” says Andreas Harrison, a researcher in Indonesia for the Human Rights Watch.
Guyki have been delayed because Papua ' s resources have attracted the flow of displaced people from other parts of Indonesia.
The 3.5 million population of the province is 83 per cent Christian, but demographic indicators change as Muslim economic migrants arrive from the densely populated Indonesian islands of Java, Sumatra and Slovenia.
The Japanese lavenders, "warungi", sell a hot chicken and mix a vegetable "gado-gado" given with an arachis sauce.
Locals are trying to maintain competition.
“The migrants began selling chicken and fruit cheaply on the traditional market than the indigenous people of Papua,” explains Abet You, a twenty-four-year-old native of Pania, who moved to Jaapur, the administrative centre of the province, for work.
“Because of this, the indigenous people of Papua – the mother of Papua (the women) – lost their market.”
President Joco Vidodo of Indonesia, known as Jokovi, vowed to address the inequalities and violations of the rights in Papua during his presidential campaign in 2014.
On his way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta, the former shipyard was supported by 27 of the 29 districts of Papua, including Pania.
But there was little change in Papua, and the local people felt loyal.
“Our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokovi, waiting for him to fulfill our hope of restoring justice,” says Jou.
In fact, only two months after the October inauguration of Jockov Pania survived the tragedy.
On 7 December 2014, a group of 11 children were on the street and sang Christmas hymns at the castle in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers were out of the dark on motorcycles.
Fearful children told them that they should turn on the lights.
According to local pastor Javedt Tebai, one of the soldiers injured their tone and returned with four soldiers after a while.
According to the victims and eyewitnesses, soldiers who had been drunk followed the children and were examples of them.
Then one of the soldiers shot a group of children.
One child, sixteen-year-old Julianus Aimo, was so badly beaten that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, someone burned the nearby government building of the electoral commission, and the situation worsened the next day.
About a thousand Papuan men, women and children gathered in the football field before the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice.
They brought with them ritual hunters of bows and filled with whites, the dance of the Papal tribe of Mee Pago — running around and depicting bird pens.
Some Protestants started throwing stones at the police station and military base.
When the situation worsened, internal radio soldiers were ordered: “If the crowd shows resistance more than three times, shoot them,” he said, as stated in the official document that saw the correspondents of the TIME magazine, but which was not published in local media.
Fifty - six - year - old Jeremiah Kayame, head of Kego Koto district in Enarotali, felt a sense of danger and called for peace, asking the crowd to break up at home.
No one wanted to listen to him.
“When I got back, I suddenly got a bullet in my left wrist,” he told TIME magazine, standing on the wing of his brightly decorated wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who shot him, but says the bullet flew by the sherengs of the assembled soldiers.
“There was a crowd, there was a lot of shootings,” he adds.
In the local town of Alfius, Joshua was struck three times, as his twin brother, who witnessed the shooting, relates.
“I ran to him and looked at his body to make sure he was there,” said Johannes, who, like many Indonesians, used only one name.
"I saw he was dead... I kissed him."
General Yotjje Mende, the Chief Inspector of the Papua Police, told reporters that his officers were only "protecting" their base because it was under attack.
“We must protect ourselves when people threaten to kill us”, said Commissioner Pujo Sulistio, a police representative of Papua in 2015.
“This is the question of life and death.”
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and much more injured.
The news of the murders reached Jakarta only the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokovi spoke in Jaapur, expressing his condolences to the families of the victims and taking an oath to address the historical abuses of power in Papua.
"I want this situation to be settled immediately so that it will never be repeated again in the future," he said.
In October 2016, the Minister of Security, Viranto, said that he would establish an injudicial organization to put an end to historical human rights violations.
But we almost got answers right away.
“Most of the violations have occurred a long time ago.
Some of them were in the nineties or at the beginning of zeroes.
It is a matter of course that we want to deal with these violations, but there are procedures to be followed," he said.
Viranto then gave up his words, speaking with the magazine TIME on 5 June in Jakarta, and said that he was not planning to set up an organization to deal with complaints in Papua.
Instead, he said: "This is a matter of decision."
Viranto, who was accused of “crime against humanity” by the United Nations for the deaths of more than 1,000 people during a blood vote in 1999 for the independence of East Timor, said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua had already been committed, including an incident in Panama.
The families of the victims from Pania met with such statements with a gross mistrust.
“For the last three years, I have been questioned four times, but there has been no change at all,” says Johannes.
"I'm tired."
He says years later he's still living in fear.
"I'm scared," he says.
“I am afraid that the soldiers will arrest me, and I am afraid that they will shoot me.”
His brother James also expressed the view that the inhabitants of Pania were afraid to discuss the incident.
He said he was beaten by soldiers after he helped bury four victims.
"After we buried the bodies, the soldiers came after me," he says.
The shooting hasn't stopped.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot villagers in the neighbourhood of Pania County Deya.
During the clash between the village residents and the construction company manager, who refused to help drive a man unconsciously to the hospital, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
A man, twenty - four - year - old Ravianus Douv, who drowned while fishing in a nearby river died on his way to the hospital.
The angry villagers protested before the building site office of the company.
According to the police, the villagers were throwing stones at officers who had responded to the warning.
But locals claim that the mobile brigade (indonesian spell) started shooting at a crowd and killed one man.
“We were in such a panic, we’re afraid of revenge,” said Time magazine, a 20-year-old Domingu Badia, who lives next door to the hospital and sees the injured being delivered quickly.
“I was hiding in my house for two days.”
Parliament demanded that the officers involved in the incident be called upon to respond and that the mobile police unit be removed from the region.
She has always been a sick place for the Indonesian Government.
The lack of significant development is due to the dissatisfaction of the Mea, Moni, Data and Damal tribes scattered throughout the territory of the green areas of the central high mountains of Papua.
Many have joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), a rebel army that claims to protect the rights of the popes by imposing sporadic attacks and raids with kidnappings against Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top leaders of the OPM are from Pania, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Jude Kogya.
As a response in recent years, thousands of people in Panama have been arrested and unjustly detained by the military under the heading “Protection of National Independence”.
Some haven't even returned.
The population of Papua Pania is considered to be “a sad, forgotten place”.
Poverty increases dissatisfaction.
The small portion of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread in the same degree is not available.
People here grow everything they eat: mostly notes, as well as some fruits and leaves.
Agriculture is the work of women, each of whom may have four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
They usually retain most of the harvest for the family and the rest are sold on the local market.
Ten club notes are worth 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities between indigenous Papuans and new migrants have increased, which have reached large numbers since the introduction of new aircraft at Nabira Airport.
Few existing vacancies are usually available to more educated and state-of-the-art migrants.
Papuans rarely have enough money or skills to run their own competitive business.
“Young people don’t want to stay in the village... because there is no work or money here,” says John Gobai, president of the Pania Tribal Council.
The isolation keeps Papua away from the views of the rest of the world.
In addition, restrictions on the work of international media remain harsh.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank Escudy and Basil Lonshan were deported from Papua for “inadequate consistency with the organizations concerned” despite their limited video coverage.
According to Felima China, the Deputy Director of Asia Human Rights Watch, the promises made during the pre-election campaign, to abolish restrictions on media work in order to promote transparency and development have not been fulfilled.
“Now foreign journalists trying to report from the rebel eastern Indonesian provinces, Papua and Western Papua are facing new dangers: visa waivers and blacklisting,” he said in a statement.
A lack of attention by the press means that the international pressure on the Government of Indonesia is mainly limited by the direct neighbours of Papua.
In March six Pacific States — Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands — requested the UN Human Rights Council to investigate “diversity and widespread violations” in Papua, including shooting in Panama.
The same countries in the past supported the OPM.
The representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia Arramana Nasir withdrew from the group statement, informing reporters in Jakarta that “In Indonesia there is still a democratic system and there is a free press, so it would be difficult to hide the testimony of episodes of human rights violations”.
Locals want more foreign Governments to focus on the situation.
When the official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by the Dutch human rights ambassador, Kissom Van Baara, visited Jaapur on 4 May, locals violated silence, begging: “We want freedom”, as the source also claimed, but wished to remain anonymous.
In Indonesia, new presidential elections will take place in 2019, but the popes say that they are hardly voting for Jokovi again.
“Jakovi is a man with good intentions, but he is surrounded by people involved in the shooting in Pania,” says Gobai, president of the tribal council.
He wants Jokovi to know that the inhabitants of Pania, apart from the fact that they live in the shadow of the threats from the greedy army, have become poor, and that education and health are in a bad state.
Gobai says that the people of Pania, like other papuas, consider their vote to be a debt due to Jokovi.
He said, “They do not need money, and they just want justice.”
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the shooting in Pania carried out the last symbolic act of innocence: they buried the body of one of the victims on the ground directly against the police and military site.
Knowing that justice is likely never to offend, at least they will not allow the guilty to forget their crimes.
"They killed a member of our family," says James, without raising their heads.
"What else were we supposed to do?"
Fire for the second time covers the Dubai skyscraper "Fakel"
The fire took over one of the world’s highest skyscrapers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to leave the 70th-century building at a height of 337 metres.
It is already the second fire on the high building, which is named Fakell by coincidence, in two years.
The building was evacuated, the victims were not reported, and there was no operational news about the cause of the fire.
“We slept and woke up from the fire alarm and the screams of people.
We ran down the stairs, and we needed about ten minutes to get down from the fiftieth floor," he told the Reuters resident of the skyscraper named George.
According to the Civil Defence Administration of Dubai, fire squads set fire around 4:00 a.m. (00:00 a.m. on Greenwich) and cooled the building.
The Government reported that it was working on providing asylum to victims.
The event may return to the agenda security issues of materials used abroad by high buildings around the world.
In the post-fire investigation by the Fakela Administration in 2015, it was found that the most affected were the posters - the external panels used to form and isolate themselves.
In the United Kingdom, the police stated that they believed that the isolation system and the Grenfell Tower building panel in London could speed up the spread of the fire that took place there in June, resulting in the deaths of about 80 people.
The growth of the tourist flows in Ida Virumaa in June has been minimal
According to the data received by the correspondent from the Rus.err.ee portal in the Department of Statistics, in June 2017 hotel services in the North-East benefited a total of 20,519 local and foreign tourists, representing 125 people or 0.6 per cent more than in the same period a year earlier.
The number of local tourists decreased, and the number of foreigners grew.
Yes, foreign turbulence increased by 7.3 per cent (544 people) in June to 7994 tourists.
The number of local tourists decreased by 3.2 per cent from 12,944 to 12,525.
The number of Russian tourists in the region increased by 8.9% or by 318 compared to June 2016.
In June 2017, 3885 guests from the FF stayed at Ida Virumaa hotels.
Andrei Malachov gave his understanding to worshipers who were guilty of his neglect
Andrei Malachov put his worshipers in Instagram, who are guilty of his departure from the "First" channel.
So far, he has not commented on any of the hearings, but today he has posted a fragment of the Newspaper for 1 August.
The Malachov photo signed with the tag "boss molocosus".
Article on how to prevent and focus on the worker ' s “distortion”.
If you recall a number of reports that the leader was unable to find a common language with the newly arrived producer, who was able to reformat “Poto Speak”, it becomes clear what he has so transparently pointed out, writes “COP”.
It was reported that Andrei Malachov, the TV leader, was currently on vacation and did not sign a declaration of dismissal from the First Channel.
The situation of dismissal may be clarified in the next few days.
Five soldiers were killed in an explosion in Afghanistan
At least five soldiers have been killed in an explosion in the Afghan province of Gilmand, reports the RIA Novosti.
According to the police, an abandoned car was blown up by the military station at Girishk's entrance earlier this evening.
It's known as 20 dead.
On Friday morning, a new PC occurred in Girishke.
Armed criminals attacked the currency exchange point.
The shooting between the attackers and the security forces continues.
Diver took a video of his shark camera.
Diver and researcher Greg Scomal printed on the video shark that tried his ex-camera GoPro.
Rolik has posted on Facebook the United States Maritime Fisheries Agency in Massachusetts, whose staff is Skomal.
The incident occurred on 2 August at the Cape-Code peninsula in the north-east of the United States, the Necn portal specifies.
The man tried to take the shark off the camera while he was swimming.
When the man noticed that the animal was more than three meters long, he was able to swim.
The shark was willing to bite the camera, but he did not try to attack the scientist.
Skomall explained that the thief had acted in such a way as to determine whether the boyfriend was eating.
The researcher added that the shark could easily destroy the equipment.
He also noted that such behavior of the marine animal has proved to be for news scientists.
A known cause of the mass drink at the Ural War Centre
A working group of senior officers of the Central Military District to investigate the circumstances of the incident came to the Elan Training Centre, where a massive dragon occurred.
Some details of this plague have already become known.
According to this audience, Mash, who appeared on the WKontakte page, contractors of the Ural military part number 31612 were severely injured because of unmanaged bed.
It all began with the fact that a line named Sayan had been demonstrably ignored by the officer ' s order to correct the vibe.
The officer's officers were on the side of the 6th.
Syena supported the first speech.
In half an hour, 140 young boys were smashed into a bedroom and a bedcloth, and glass was thrown out.
More than ten people were affected in the media.
In CWO, the information on footing was rejected.
The study showed that at least one fifth of U.S. passengers carried prohibited items on an aircraft.
The study showed that more than 20 per cent of air passengers were deliberately or accidentally transported into the baggage on board an aircraft through United States Transport Security Administration inspection points, including at least 6 per cent of the aircraft, without having prohibited knives or other sharp objects.
Nearly 1 per cent reported that they later discovered that they had accidentally had firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The study conducted by Stratos Jet Charters, Inc., and involving over 1,000 passengers also showed that young passengers were more likely to violate the rules.
Of the respondents who acknowledged that they were deliberately trying to fly from something forbidden to ATB, 19.7 per cent were millennials compared to less than 15 per cent of X-generation members.
Consciously, food and water are the most common among ATB staff.
More than 3 per cent were recognized as having been specifically subjected to acute testing and 2.2 per cent of female responders and 3.7 per cent of male responders recognized that they had been deliberately subjected to prohibited medications.
The company stated that it had examined passengers across the country to see how many of them had accidentally been smuggled through airport inspections and how many had done so knowingly.
We expect the most often - deliberately or unconsciously - to spread smuggling through the examination of those who fly the most.
According to the company, the rules of ATB are rather complex and confusing.
People often do not know exactly what fluids they can carry and how much.
It is not surprising, therefore, that most of what ATB chooses are prohibited liquids.
Some time ago, people thought that ATB could consider it prohibited to carry a book.
Liquidity is permitted on domestic voyages, but not on international voyages.
CHAPTER EPA Pruitt refuses to postpone implementation of the Oba emission reduction rules
The following day, the head of the Environment Agency requested 15 states to postpone the implementation of the rules adopted by Obama to reduce emissions of air pollutants and power generation.
The Pruitt explained his decision that his agency now had more than previously been subject to the needs of environmental regulators of individual states.
He did not mention the claim against his previous position before the Federal Court of Appeal.
The dispute has spread around the period of 1 October, to which the states are required to comply with the standards of 2015 for ozone at the ground level.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would delay their compliance for one year to give his department more time to study the plan and to avoid “disresponsibility to local solutions or obstacles to economic growth”.
Pruitt, who had been known long before President Trampo was appointed to his current position as Attorney-General of the State of Oklahoma, was a consistent opponent of the strengthening of environmental standards.
After moving to Washington Pruitt, he repeatedly blocked or postponed the introduction of rules that were opposed by the chemical or gas oil industry.
The unexpected change in the course on Wednesday was the regular legal defeat of the Piwitt course back to the previous rules.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington decided that the head of EPA had exceeded its authority by attempting to delay the implementation of the rules adopted by Obama by the administration requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leakages.
In a statement issued on Wednesday evening, Pruitt proposed that, by radically changing the course on ozone standards, he simply fulfilled the EPA ' s obligation to cooperate with States in the integrated process of timely implementation of new standards.
“In the past, EPA administrations were often unable to put in place within the prescribed deadlines, then expected claims from groups of activists and others and discussed the timing of the settlement of the case,” said Pruitt, who filed more than a dozen claims against EPA in his previous post.
"We do not believe in regulation through judicial proceedings, and we are serious about the deadlines set.
We also take seriously our Charter and the authority that it gives us."
However, the EPA statement states that at some point Pruitt can re-use his “powers for deferral and other data by law of authority” to ensure that the “jcyjdfys” rules are clear and accessible.
The Republicans of Congress insist on a broader revision of the ozone rules.
The bill approved by the House last month aims to delay implementation of the 2015 rules at least eight years.
The Senate had not yet voted in favour.
The Attorney-General of New York Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that filed a complaint this week against EPA, said that the group was planning to continue legal pressure.
"The change in the EPA course - after our claims - is an important victory in the fight for health and safety of 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the power of their city," Schneiderman said.
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Man, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, as well as Colombia.
The ground-level ozone occurs when conventional pollutants from machinery, power plants, oil and chemical plants and other sources are in the atmosphere in sunlight.
The resulting power can cause serious problems with breathing in people who are sensitive to it, resulting in thousands of premature deaths per year.
Health defenders and environmental defenders welcomed the unexpected change in the Pruitt course.
"It's hard to think about how much pressure it took to achieve this completely logical step from a person to protect the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Bird from the Center of Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to resist the ideological campaign of the Administration of Trump and the protection of those who pollute the air and their special interests."
Congress IAAF extended the removal of the All-Russian Federation of Light Athletics
The Congress of the International Association of the League of Leasing Federations (IAAF) voted to extend the removal of the All-Russian Federation of Leasing Athletics (WFLA).
The Congress thus supported the IAF Board for the Recovery of WFLA, which issued a report Monday, recommending that the removal be maintained.
For the extension of the removal, 166 persons voted against the 21st TASS.
The report of the IAAF Board said that WFLA had made significant progress towards achieving the conditions set by the Council for the Restoration of Membership, but those conditions had not yet been fully met.
Due to the disqualification of WFLA at the World Championship in London, Russian light athletes were forced to speak under a neutral flag.
There were 19 people on the team who were admitted to the IAAF.
WFLA was permanently disqualified by IAAF in 2015.
At that time, the report of the independent expert of the World Anti-Fraud Agency (WADA) Dick Pounda was published, which referred to numerous violations of the WADA regulation permitted by Russian officials and sportsmen.
For more details on the last report of the IAAF Board, see the “E” item “IAAF has extended sanctions against WFLA”.
Illustrative defeat
During the 3rd tour of the Russian Fonbet Province, among the PFL teams, the new-Moscian Chemicals took a march against the Kaluga FC.
To hear more than 10 days ago, rivals were playing together in a Russian cube, but this time the game was quite different.
"Chemical" has nothing to do with the opponent, but a second of relaxation on the basis of the match has led to a nagging throat and fiasco.
After the recent defeat of the Kalujans with a 0:3 account, many had previously predicted a slight victory of the masters.
However, from the start of the meeting, the New Yorkers were forced to consider themselves and acted on the defence, but on the strength.
In the 1st hour, the vertebrae were more developed and benefited from the ball.
A very high-quality match was conducted by Alexie Sirotin, who several times reflected dangerous blows and assured his partners by his actions.
Unfortunately, in the chemical attack, no efforts and no binding were made to put the Kalugi defense into the deadlock and kill the first target on the way.
After the break, the game began to run on meeting courses.
The New Yorkers were more active in the attack.
The alarming bells for our team have become defence errors that have allowed the nuns to create a number of sharp moments.
In 10 minutes before the end of the meeting, the chemical seized the territorial advantage and carried out several dangerous attacks.
But Kalujan's experience played his role - they were more literal and colder to finish, and they set out their time to take the door.
After a dangerous attack, the chemical transferred the ball to the corner, which the owner of the field without resistance had turned into a door.
The author of the album was Yury Dubrowin.
At the chemical report meeting, he showed a good game, but he suffered a humiliating defeat.
Our team is waiting for another departure - 11 August at 19 o'clock in Moscow at the Torpedo stadium of Edward Shootz's novelty team will meet with the favorite FC Center Ararat, consisting of Roman Pavlučenko, Marat Izmajlov, Igor Lebedenko, Alexie Rebko.
Come back to support "Chemics!"
Location and time of the meeting of the novelties - 6.30 p.m. next to Magnolia (East, d.2, corp.
Chemical composition: Sirotin, Manochin (k), Romance, Shayunov, Homutov, Gogia (Oreskin), Dodajit, Ryžov, Svetov, Belanin (Adoevcev), Andreichenko (Lygin)

According to the published decryption of telephone conversations, Trump pushed Mexico to pay for the wall at the border
The Washington Post paper published the decryption of telephone conversations between US President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On 27 January, during a telephone conversation with Mexico's President, Enrique Penney Nyeta Trump insisted that he stop publicly declaring that he would not pay for the planned wall at the border.
The President of the United States begged him for his public statement against the wall and, according to the information he had received, said, “You can’t say this press.”
The tramp began its pre-election campaign with a promise to build a wall along the southern border of the United States and swore that it would force Mexico to pay for the project.
The release of his first phone conversation with Prime Minister Malcolm Ternbull also revealed a hot redundancy.
Trump told Ternbull that an agreement under which the United States was to accept refugees sent to Australia was “silly”, “deceptive” and “stupid” and insisted that because of the agreement concluded by the Obama administration, it would look like an idiot, as it was intended to end the migration of refugees to the United States.
Trump finished the conversation, said Ternbull that “it was the most unpleasant conversation of all day”.
The bodies of the dead in Abkhazia the tourists flew from Sochi to Petersburg
A plane belonging to the Russian airline on board the bodies of Russians who were killed in Abkhazia flew from Sochi to St. Petersburg at 20:15 in Moscow time, TASS transmits.
At the end of the checkpoint, the board will meet ritual agency staff, as well as representatives of the city's Mary, who told reporters the Deputy Minister of Courts and Tourism of Abkhazia, Astamir Ahba.
Earlier, representatives of the Republic of the Republic of Macedonia stated that all costs associated with the return of the body to Russia had been incurred by the Government of Abkhazia.
In addition, the official Sukhum intends to pay compensation to the families of the deceased in the amount of 500 thousand rubles.
According to Ahba, Abkhazia ' s leadership was willing to pay relatives who had been killed as a result of the outbreaks of tourist travel and residence in the Republic, but the relatives sent only confidence in the right of local authorities to act in accordance with the prescribed order.
On 2 August, about 16:20 a day in Moscow, two explosions broke out in the village of Primorsk Gudaut, at the Ministry of Defence's missile-artillery warehouse, and then the large-caliber rifles and other ammunition were detonated.
As a result, the storage space has been burned, which has caused uncontrolled explosions of rockets of various modifications.
As a result, two Russian citizens, Elena Polakova, were killed in 1970 and Elena Timofeev, born in 1962, who were on vacation near a servo-born source.
64 people, including 35 citizens of the Russian Federation and 29 citizens of Abkhazia, were brought to medical institutions in the Republic with various severity injuries.
Currently there are seven persons left in the station.
The study of Russian influence on the American elections will be undertaken by a large jury
The Russian Special Prosecutor Robert Muller convened a large jury in Washington, D.C., to study Russia's influence on the U.S. presidential election in 2016, reports The Wall Street Journal and the Reuters Agency.
The majority of the jury is a group of ordinary citizens who collect evidence of potential criminal offences and have the right to question witnesses under oath.
The collected materials will be examined by the Special Prosecutor and will decide whether they are sufficient to be charged.
Calling a large jury gives Muller additional evidence authority.
One of those investigations by the jury of jury members, who started work a few weeks ago, would then become details of the son's meeting, then another candidate for President Donald Tramp with Russian lawyer Natalie Wesselnikka.
To verify the details of this meeting, held in June 2016, Muller promised himself.
They've already been studied by the FBI.
At the end of July, it was reported that Donald Trump, the youngest, had expanded the status of his lawyers.
The Trump-younger had earlier said that he was expecting a compromise at the candidate's headquarters from the Hillary Clinton Department, but no disclosing documents had been presented, and the result was adoption.
At the beginning of August, a number of media reported that a statement by the young trampa about a meeting with the party had been written against the elderly trampo.
In the White House, it was clarified that the President did not dictate anything but simply used his authority, which any father would do.
Deputy Mayor Penza was detained at work.
The Deputy Head of Administration of Penza Irina Shirshin is detained for 48 hours at the request of the Investigation Committee at its workplace, reports the RIA Novosti.
Official communications from law enforcement agencies have not yet been received, but the S.O.S.S. Press Service assured that they will soon follow.
There's no comment yet on what happened in the Mary Penza.
Irina Shirshina is one of five deputy heads of the Penza administration.
It has promoted urban issues and land relations since April 2015.
She had worked for a long time in the management of Gosjylstörtechnique in the Penzensk area.
Irina Shirshina is raising three minors, and it is noteworthy that on another occasion she became a mother a year ago, she gave up her job and returned to work.
Of course, there's no spacecraft or rockets in Mexico.
But there is a space agency established in 2010 and a desire to develop its own space programme.
And the installation of Yuri Gagarin's compass is a tribute to the first person in space.
Unlike the Soviet period monuments that bear in some countries, the Gagarin monuments, on the other hand, are “walking on the planet”.
In 2012, the monument was established in Houston, U.S.A., near the former NASA headquarters.
In London, the memory of the Royal Observatory was established in honor of the 50th anniversary of the first flight to space.
There is a monument to Gagarin in Germany in the city of Erfut, where our cosmonaut took place in 1963.
The memorial in Karlovovov Varah (Czech Republic) escaped in 1992 through public protests and was transferred from the city centre to the airport in front of the local airport.
In the 1970s, the monument of Yuryus Gagarins appeared in Riga.
So the name and surname of the first cosmonaut is Latvian, and it looks like he's 70 years old.
Morse Ford's murder: Activists lose Lynch's courts on stage to call for justice
"Ford Mercuri" in 1948 passed by viewers in the village of Monroe in the state of Georgia.
When a car with four black passengers and a white driver went to the bridge, a group of white men with roses had crossed her way.
The main man in the middle of the year in a thin striped suit looked up and looked through a glass of wind.
Those sitting inside were afraid.
"We need this nigger, Roger!" said the man.
"Get him out of the car!"
The pernicious waves broke down the silence when a young black man was pulled out of the front seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene, which was played on 22 July, was only a scene.
But when Roger's neck was brushed down, almost all the viewers were really hiding their breath.
Since 2005, activists have returned to the Morse Ford Bridge to replay the night when the dolls were lynching two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcolm and George and May Murray Dorsey, in 1946.
No one was convicted of these murders.
"Of course, in all these years no one has been arrested - although we see them next to us; though we know who they are," said Tyron Brooks, who helped organize the decision.
"It's Friday in our history and it's the stone in our souls."
The 71-year-old Brooks is a former member of the Congress of Georgia, which has fought for human rights for the rest of its life.
To him, the spectacle was a dramatic call to action and an annual reminder to the people of Monroe that injustice had not been corrected.
"We want investigation, we want completion, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we need justice," he says.
"We can't go to healing and reconciliation until we get justice."
The coroner covers the simple body of one of the lynching victims at Mors Ford on 27 July 1946.
According to information received by the FBI, over 50 people in Monroe and neighbouring counties were suspected of being involved in lynching.
But no one was charged.
While the suspects for decades remained at liberty, human rights defenders said that the city was always well aware of the two related motives of linguists: politics and sex.
In April 1946, the Supreme Court's ruling for the first time allowed black citizens to vote for the primacy that had to be held that summer.
About the same time, according to the FBI, black user Roger Malcolm hit the dragon with the knife of Barnett Hester, a white landowner - apparently because of women.
Brooks says that Hester slept with Malcolm Dorothy's wife, and that the child she had to give birth was not from her husband.
According to the FBI, on 25 July 1946 Loy Harrison, the great white landowner, paid $600 to release Malcolm from prison.
He went to prison with Dorothy and their cousins, May Murray and George Dorsey.
But when they left the prison and went to the Morse Ford Bridge, a crowd of linguists surrounded the car.
"It is clear that he has organized and ordered the killings of Harrison," such a conclusion is made in one of the reports of the FBI.
"It is clear that there has been a conflict between state and city law enforcement authorities who not only took part in the killings but also destroyed the evidence and hid the witnesses."
Brooks calls it short.
"It was an attempt on electoral rights," he says.
They were all killed to send a message to the black man in the city. If you register and vote, it will be the same to you."
Almost ten years ago, Cassandra Green headed for the annual show, producing this leashing at the Morse Ford Bridge.
Her performance is supervised, he captures the viewer and tells of the deep racism that many would like to see in America no longer.
It's hard to see and turn, but Green thinks it's the main thing.
"We don't want to talk about Lynch's courts because they show us our own birthplace," she says.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't listen to me or if you don't hear what I've been through."
This year's performances began in June, and on the first day of almost 30 actors -- a dozen whites, the others blacks -- gathered in the room and listened to the play review over the years.
Wade Marbo was a director with Green.
He had been a leading member of the clan for several years, but he said the role had not become easier.
"I don't think I've got it, because it's not the man I am," says Marbo.
"But I think it's very important to remember this story because we don't want to come back at that time."
In the room of the actors Darryus Bradshaw and Nick Ruscon, who play Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester, repeat their roles.
The show is starting with Malcolm, who's upset that Chester's sleeping with his wife, Dorothy, yells and pushes him.
"I said, nigga, get out of my house!"
Cricket Ruscon in response.
It's a blow.
And at the same time, all (at least all black actors) are whacked.
Green laughs at everyone's noise.
"What's the matter?" Asks Ascona.
He's worried and upset.
Am I playing again?
"No," says Green through laughter.
"I just don't think the whites used to say 'nigga'."
"Yes," he laughs at one of the black performers.
"You've got to break a solid 'r'."
Also, energy in the room changes: discomfort changes the sense of company.
Everyone has to do everything right, not only for the play, but also for the memory of the four killed.
The scene starts first.
This time, when Ruscona says the word "n", it gets clear and sharp.
No one laughs.
The show ends fast and fast.
Crickies, shots, and then silence.
A woman in a sad black dress is standing over the bodies of actors and playing a sad song by Billy Holliday Strange Fruit.
Her voice is interrupted by a word.
In a hundred yards of it, hundreds of viewers tear their tears and down.
Among the viewers are almost equal to the number of black and white.
One couple came from Itaki, New York, to see the presentation; many lived quite close.
They were all almost eight hours patient with the heavy spirit of Georgia while Brooks led them into the delinquents of Malcolm and Dorsey.
So far, the murder has remained only history, but now that they're standing at the same place where people were licking, their ghosts seem to live here in the air.
When the last note of the song is closed, Green invites people to come closer and look at the bodies.
Children are drawn to their heads, attracted to a blood image, and still bodies and whisper something to each other.
"They're not really dead," said one little boy, as if to remind himself.
A few minutes later, Green thanks the audience, and it's all over.
The actors remove the ropes from the neck and tear out the tears.
Bradshaw includes Marbo, the man in the suit who played the main doll.
Nick Ruscona includes two other actors, and he weeps and falls into their ranks: the emotional load of the show finally fell on him.
"All right," is a woman's whisper.
"We know you have a good heart.
You had a reason for this."
Later, the spectators will have dinner with the actors.
At one table, a white couple from Atlanta are livelyly discussing a black couple they have just met.
Denise Daplinski is hard to find words to describe how she feels after the show.
"It's hard to hear these horrible, bitter words and actions... people who look like you and who do it because they look like you," she says.
"After that, I think the lynchings are still happening," she adds, "it's just now called the police shooting."
In the other corner, Tyron Brooks took general attention, which reminds him of his work as a human rights defender.
He said that he had already begun to plan a presentation next year.
"We are encouraged by the situation because it not only describes the horrors of what we have experienced but also teaches us," he says.
"Because if you don't learn from this lesson, it can happen again.
Those who do not study their history are doomed to repeat it."
The Court of Justice fined Vavali for violations of the “aggression subbot”
The Moscow Simon Court fined Alexei Avalyus for 300 thousand rubles for violating the order of the meeting.
The opposition was found guilty of an administrative offence provided for in section 20.2 of the RF 'Re-infringement of the rules of procedure of the meeting.
Former Judge of the Simonov Court of Moscow, Hizir Mussakaev, has completed the review of the administrative case with regard to Leonid Volkova, head of opposition chief Alexei Vavali, who was responsible for the same article as Navali.
The wolves were found guilty and sentenced to a fine of 300 thousand rubles.
In that amount, Judge Mussakaev assessed the distribution of leaflets to the “agitation subbot”, which was carried out by the supporters of Avail in Moscow from 8 to 9 July.
In view of the agitmaterials that followed by the participants of the sub-station, police thought that the organizers of the event had deliberately concealed its true public action (to which prior authorization must be sought from the capital authorities).
Leonid Volkov and his lawyers Ivan Zdanov and Aleksandr Pomazujev applied for the termination of administrative proceedings because of the absence of an offence and indicated that the police had allowed certain mistakes in the preparation of the protocol.
Volkova did not delay the "agitation subbotnik" itself, but he received an agenda that required him to appear at the police station to tell about the event during his active participation.
The same events were received by Nawalni himself and another rival opposition leader, Nikolai Laskin.
In Mordovia, a shooting bride and three wedding guests were arrested
The court in Mordow arrested a local resident who shot four people at the wedding, including the bride.
This was reported in the Republican Administration of the Committee of Inquiry.
The incident took place on the evening of 29 July.
During the horrific 42-year-old Saranska was shot several times at the visitors to the village to get rid of.
Three women and one man were injured.
A criminal case has been brought under article 213 FMR, article 30, paragraph 3, and article 105 FMR, paragraph 2, "e", and "i", article 105 FMR.
The local media reported that the man had opened a shot because of the fact that the guests had decided to redeem themselves and had passed through his area to the water.
Minergo is tightening the requirements for turbine suppliers for power stations
The Ministry of Energy will update the rules for providing information to suppliers of critical equipment, in particular turbines for power plants.
At the start of gas turbines, GHG turbines, oil pipelines and oil supplies, equipment suppliers will be required to share access data with the Minener and the Federal Technical and Export Control Service.
The draft Government decision has already been prepared and discussed.
The new requirements only concern “critically important energy equipment” provided to Russia.
The paper identifies potential threats, such as information and access to foreign expertise management, criminal elements and structures, non-profit partners and hackers.
The Euro Union has extended anti-dumping sanctions for Siemens
The Euro Union Press Service stated on 4 August that anti-Russian sanctions had been extended due to a scandal around the supply of Siemens turbines in Crimea.
This has been reported earlier on "The Arguments of the Week."
The EU Council Press Service stated that sanctions against the FP were increased because of the Siemens production turbine scandal that was allegedly delivered to Crimea in the course of the sanctions.
Today, the Council of Europe is considering all possible complaints and proposals by member countries for an increase in anti-Russian sanctions.
It was previously announced that the final decision would be taken by the end of the current day and that sanctions against Russia had been extended.
Person reduces 3,000 more jobs and reduces dividends to bring the business back to life
On Friday, the British Educational Group of Pirson announced that it would reduce another 3,000 jobs and reduce the amount of preliminary dividends by 72 per cent due to the start of the regular restructuring programme aimed at combating the problems faced by their businesses.
These reductions in jobs, which, according to John Fellon's head, will occur mainly at the end of 2018 and early 2019, will be added to 4,000 jobs reduced in previous restructuring.
Person announced that he was planning to reduce the cost of an additional $300 million (US$394 million) in May during the third cost reduction programme to try to return to the business that had hit the rapid transition to digital learning.
Last month, the company agreed to sell its share in the edition of the Penguin Random House to its partner, Bertelsman, said that its forecasts for the year remained unchanged after it announced an increase of 1 per cent in the first half of the year to £2.05 billion.
Conviction attack in Kabul: Private Nato killed as a result of an explosion of the killer
According to information from official sources, the death bomber attacked a military convoy in the capital of Afghanistan, Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others.
Five soldiers and translators were wounded, as NATO reports.
According to unverified data from local sources, three civilians were also killed as a result of an incident in the city of Karabakh.
This explosion is the last of Afghanistan's massacres this month: on Tuesday, more than 30 people died as a result of an explosion in the Guerat mosque.
On Monday, a terrorist killed two people outside Iraq's embassy in Kabul.
According to NATO, an explosion that took place on Thursday evening occurred when a joint convoy with the Afghan army was attacked by a “transportable person with an explosive device”.
According to the report, all wounded are in a stable condition and are treated at the U.S. military hospital at the Bagram airport.
Correspondents report that the growing power of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in Karabakh is a major source of concern to NATO forces located near Bagram.
In the first half of 2017, the United Nations reported that at least 1662 civilians had been killed in Afghanistan, and about 20 per cent had been killed in the capital.
At the end of July, a terrorist bomb on the car caused at least 30 deaths in the Shia area of Kabul.
The Taliban said they had made an attack.
On 31 May, more than 150 people died as a result of a massive explosion in the city centre, the most serious of human casualties in the country since the United States forces removed the Taliban from power in 2001.
Violence emphasizes the inconvenient situation in Afghanistan, while US President Donald Trump assesses whether the number of United States military forces assisting troops and police in the country should be increased.
According to the correspondents, the attacks in Kabul during the past few weeks have also created a public confidence crisis with the Government, its conduct, and especially with the reputation of President Ashraf Gani.
The Agency for the Protection of the Environment from Trials revokes the decision to defer the adoption of the Air Pollution Act
The U.S. Environment Agency has annulled the decision to postpone the adoption of the Obama Age Act, which states must limit emissions of air pollution within the day after 15 states have been brought to court because of this step.
On Wednesday evening, the Environment Agency announced its decision to implement the so-called “zone measurement 2015”, stressing that this step shows the Agency's willingness to cooperate with the states.
“We believe in dialogue with our partners in the states and responsiveness to them,” said Scott Pruitt, Director of the Environment Agency.
In June, Pruitt announced the intention of the Environment Agency to postpone ozone measurements where existing air pollution is measured in different parts of the country to determine where it needs to be reduced to meet more stringent air purity standards for one year until October 2018.
On Tuesday, a group of 15 states, mostly democratic, together with the Federal District of Colombia, filed a claim claiming that the intention was illegal.
President Trampa's administration is attempting to reverse the wide range of environmental protection regulations introduced by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader programme aimed at, according to Trampa, rising economic growth.
However, action in this regard has led to resistance from democracies and environmental organizations concerned with the possible impact of large emissions on public health.
The Environment Agency’s website says that use of ozone-containing air can “decreas easily and exacerbate respiratory symptoms” such as asthma.
European Business Association against New Anti-Visibility Sanctions
The European Business Association expressed disagreement with US economic sanctions against the FP.
In the opinion of AEB, such measures may lead to a serious reduction in production and the number of jobs.
The AEB statement states that business is one of the important linkages between countries and people, so the principles of free trade cannot be restricted.
The European business brings together more than 500 companies from the countries of the European Union and the European Free Trade Association.
The Association calls on the Heads of State and Government of the EU, the United States and Russia to develop a new line of conduct that would enable them to separate business from politics and find a common, mutually acceptable solution in a spirit of peace and agreement.
Deputies ask the police to restrict the movement on the coast in Pskova
The Pskov people ' s voters referred to the head of the UMVD in the city of Sergei Surina on the problem of the movement on the Great River.
The proud Members of Constantin Bolotin, Grígorija Partienkov and Valerija Lesnikov believe that drivers prevent people from playing and resting in this place.
In their view, driver control will help make this territory more peaceful and secure.
The problem is that the offenders ignore the sign of the “Walkway” and are free to land on the coast.
It is achieved that the capital repairs and well-being have been carried out.
Sports and children's seats are getting uncomfortable because of cars.
As the Pskovsk Information Agency notes, PPS and wives are patrolling the Central Coast Guard at dinner.
They reduce the number of passing cars, but they do not stop moving completely.
Putin asked the investigating authorities not to take out hard drives
President Vladimir Putin of Russia suggested that the investigation authorities should not take any servers and hard drives from business computers.
The Head of State stated that this was the subject of a meeting on investment programmes for the development of the Far East.
According to the President, it is necessary to “disallow the application of measures to prevent business activities, including the removal of hard drives from work computers and servers”.
Putin noted that if investigators have such a need, “it is enough to remove copies, assure them and use them during the investigation”.
The Head of State added that “the conditions that prevent the business from continuing until it is impossible to pay taxes” could not be created.
Olga Busza told her how much she wanted to call her ex-husband
The TV director, Olga Buzza, admitted that she was eager to call former footballer Dmitry Tarasov.
At present, celebrities are in the United States where they are working.
Olga was literally in Las Vegas, then decided to post her post on the Instagram social network.
She reported that she had not been married, that she had not made new tattoos, or that she had not named her former wife with the words that she had saved her life, although she was eager to do so.
Buzza reported that she would remember this visit forever because she was very happy.
British actor Robert Hardy's death
British actor Robert Hardy, who played the Minister of Magic Cornelius Faj in the screenplay of the novel series about Harry Potter, ended in the 92nd year of life.
That's what the Independent newspaper reported on Thursday.
His relatives told him about the actor's death.
According to them, he lived “a huge life with success in cinema, theatre and television for 70 years of his career.”
Hardy was born in 1925 in the English resort town of Cheltenham.
In 1959 he played with Lawrence Olive at the Royal Shakespearen Theatre in the Tragedy of Coriolan.
Hardy also recalled several times the role of Prime Minister Winston Churchill, including one of the screenplays by Agata Christi about Miss Marple.
He was awarded the British Academy of Cinema and Television Arts (BAFTA) Award for the role of Churchill in the Bi-bi-si teledrama "Winston Churchill: The Wilderness Years" (1981).
Robert Hardy also had to play the role of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt of the United States.
Something went wrong in the Danish State: Prince Henrik, and in fact Henri Marie Jean Andre, Count de Labord, refused to be buried with his virtuous wife, Queen Margaret.
This year, it's a "golden" wedding, but on the agenda, it's not a party preparation, it's a battle.
His highness denied the title of the Prince Consort, and he joined the Queen, who never regretted the title of the Queen Consort.
Henrik lives in France, although he remains officially the wife of the Queen.
Mid-Russian called for Washington to stop Shelming on Moscow
In the middle of Russia, Mother Pens, who accused Moscow of trying to destabilize the Balkans, responded.
The relevant statement was circulated by the foreign policy department a while ago.
In his comments, MID indicated that the United States was increasingly using cold war stamps that were not adequate for modern reality.
In addition, the Russian diplomats called on the American authorities to stop the FF shelm.
As Argument Weeks wrote earlier, U.S. Vice-President Mike Pens accused Moscow of trying to destabilize the Western Balkans and organize an unsuccessful coup in Montenegro.
Mikey Garcia and Vasily Lomachenko first meet, discuss the possibility of a decisive individual
Vasili Lomačenko and Mikey Garcia, who, in their opinion, are constantly moving towards holding the most captivating boxing game of up to 147 pounds in the near future, met for the first time on Thursday.
They occupied separate rooms in the office rooms of the ESPN channel in Los Angeles, until Garcia, an invincible champion in the easy weight of the World Boxing Council, walked on the corridor to welcome Lomačenko, a World Boxing Organization champion in the second half of the weight.
After the single victory of Garcia over the former world champion in four categories of weight, Erien Broner on Saturday at the showtime channel both are among the top five fighters regardless of weight.
Garcia stretched his right hand and said, "What's up, champ?
Good luck to you."
Lomachenko protects his belt with Miguel Marriago on Saturday at seven o'clock in the ESPN channel.
When the boxers called for a photo, manager Lomačenko Egis Klimas noticed that a potential decisive fight between them would be the same.
"I used to be in slow weight," Garcia reminded me.
“I went up to the category for the Bronzer [up to 140 pounds], but I’m not that big.
I'm a kid for 140.
I want to go down slowly.
And he needs to get up to a slow [up to 135 pounds], and then we're going to build a unit.
This is what the sick want.
Let's set this up."
Lomachenko agreed.
"The Boxes need this unit."
Klimas asked whether the fight should be broadcast through the PPV service as part of his strategy that Lomačenko was expected to carry out his debut fight in the summer 135 later this year to mark the next summer meeting with Garcia (37-0.30 knockouts) who was also interested in fighting with the winner of the single match between Jorge Linarez and Luke Campbell after their fight for the title of the world champion in the lightweight for the Forum Arena on 23 September.
“Bow may be on the PPV because all the sick people asked for it,” said Garcia, expressing their willingness to fight on the channel that would offer the best financial conditions.
“We are the main names.
No other name will cause such interest.
As soon as they're ready...»
Garcia said that Lomachenko was considered a “striking boxer” and might visit his Saturday unit.
But Lomachenko didn't just start praising Garcia, and he said that he thought the three-weight champion from Riversaida looked “a bit slow, sorry, Mikey... you were wondering about the knockout.”
Garcia said he was focused on showing the force of the strike and then the boxing.
They both said that they felt the tension rising in front of their own individual.
“This fight must take place.
No other fight has caused so much interest and conversation.
I'm more than happy to work on it," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: "I was expecting some of the football boxers, and here he is, Mikey.
That will be a great fight."
On several central streets, Moscow covers the exits
In these exits, on 5 and 6 August, the movement will be limited in the capital on the Twerke Street from the Nastasian Street to the Triumphal Square, as well as on the 1st Twerke-Yam Street.
In addition, the tour will be closed in the Leningrad Perspective, from the Third Transport Ring to the 1st Twersky-Yam Street.
In all areas, the overlap will operate on both sides, reports the Moscow Department of Transport.
The streets will cross from 5 August to 5 a.m. on 7 August due to their well-being.
The exits will also be closed in the Moscow Coastal area.
There's still the establishment of the Zarement Park.
Putin ordered the Genprocurator's office to check the bike
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, commissioned the Office of the Prosecutor-General of the FF to carry out a verification of the Bikal territory for illegal and environmentally harmful activities.
"I would ask the Genprogariat to check the bicyclal territory for facts of illegal and environmentally harmful activities," Vladimir Putin said at a meeting on environmental development in the region.
In addition, the Russian leader requested that measures be taken if the facts of the violations were identified.
New results of tests were published to assess the age of asylum seekers in Sweden
The recent results of the testing of asylum seekers in Sweden, which have been subjected to a new age assessment, show that more than 80 per cent of those tested were assessed as persons over the age of 18, but not all believe the accuracy of the results.
The Swedish National Agency for Judicial Medicine (Rätsmedicinalverket) began testing earlier this year.
They were designed to assess the age of asylum in a more accurate manner after the Swedish Migrationswerket argued that it could not determine the present age of some refugees who claimed to be minors.
To date, Migrationwerket has sent 6,880 trials and the Medical Agency has now published 2,481 trials between mid-March and 31 July 2017.
Eighty per cent (2002) of those tested were evaluated as persons 18 years of age or older, and in another 25 cases, the judicial agency assessed that the person tested “probably 18 years of age or older”.
In the case of 432 cases, the conclusion stated that the person “probably less than 18”.
Tests shall only be carried out when the human age is questioned.
According to Johan Garanson of the Medical Agency, the results correspond to the results of the past months.
“We don’t see much difference with statistics in the last few months, numbers are quite relevant,” he said to the portal “The Local”.
The high proportion of cases in which people were assessed as having reached the age of 18 did not necessarily indicate that asylum seekers were lying about their age.
In May, the Agency published the results of the 581 tests and reported that in 442 cases “mostly 18 years of age tested”.
However, after considering 581 published results, Svenska Dagbladet found that in 243 cases, people openly stated that 18 were being fulfilled this year.
The method of medical evaluation of the age of X-rays of wisdom and knee tomography and analysis to dentists and X-rays has also led to criticism in some instances.
One of the skeptics is an endocrinologist from the Caroline Institute, Claude Marcus, whose work is to assess the biological maturity of people in order to determine whether they have passed through sexual intercourse sooner or later.
“I had reason to think about it, and I don’t think we need to use the methods of measurement that are being used now.
The biological age is thus defined as very inaccurate.
If we can't determine it with certainty, we don't have to do what we can," he said, "Metro."
However, Garansen from the Medical Agency said in favour of the accuracy of the tests: “In general, it can be said that the risk is wrong to take a child for an adult.
We face the greatest risk when a person is about 18, in which case he is about 10 per cent.”
I wonder if I'm going to fight for the president's office.
During his work trip to Buratija Vladimir Putin, he was upset that he was willing to consider whether he would be involved in the post of President of Russia in the 2018 elections, he said, "Interfax".
This statement was a response to the request of the inhabitants of the village of Cheremuški in the Buryat region.
During a video conference on the elimination of fire in Burma and the Irkutian region, the interviewer addressed Putin with the words: “Vladimir Vladimirovic, we have to ask you: when the following presidential elections will take place, we are all asking you to fight again for this post.”
"Well, I think, thank you," the President replied.
On 28 July, Russian President Dmitry Peskov, a press secretary, commented on the statement by some media that the pre-election headquarters of Vladimir Putin would be headed by President Anton Weinno.
The sands called these assumptions “no sound, hypothetical arguments on anything”.
"Until there are no headquarters, until the establishment of headquarters is far away, until the election campaign is far away," said Peskov.
"Not yet on the agenda," said Peskov.
The Governor of West Virginia stated that he was moving to another party
The Governor of West Virginia, the representative of the Democratic Party, Jim Justis, announced on Thursday at a meeting with President Trampa, which is moving to another party.
"You like it or not, but the Democrats have gone away from me," said Governor Justis.
“Today I speak to you with many prayers and many thoughts... today I speak to you, the people of West Virginia: I can no longer be of use to you as a democratic governor.”
The meeting was blown up by applause.
"That's why I'm going to change my registration tomorrow," Justice added.
"As a coach, I'd tell you that it's time to play with each other."
Tramp had earlier promised that an important statement would be made at the meeting in West Virginia.
Trump won a 42 per cent move in West Virginia, and Justice did not support the Democratic Party candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justis, according to Forbes, was elected as the only billionaire in the state in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states because he inherited the coal business from his father.
Its status is estimated at $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, on Thursday evening, the National Committee of the Republican Party issued a statement that “Governor Justin’s move to another party is another blow on the Democratic Party, which is more likely to interfere with making our country big again”.
“In view of all 15 governors and the control of the smallest number of state legislatures in history, the statement by Governor Justis is just another refusal from a party that has no leaders above the bottom and is unable to find a positive, unified communication”, reported CBS News representative of the National Committee of the Republican Party Ron McDeniel.
Mr. Krasawczyk found the house by means of the socites
The Pittsboro, North Carolina, U.S.A., put up a cat named Mr. Krasavčick weighing more than 20 pounds [14 kg] after becoming famous for the Internet.
That's what Mashable reports.
At the end of June, a photo of the cat was posted on Facebook in the account of a psychiatrist, asking him to find his owner, because "it's probably someone who fed him earlier."
In the comments, users noted that the expression of the animal ' s morgue could become a new meme.
The publication received more than 3.2 thousand likes and 15,000 comments.
In commentaries, ten people expressed a desire to accommodate Mr. Krasawczyk.
As a result, he was handed over to Angela Frazee (Angela Frazee), who promised to take over his weight.
In an interview with the WNCN radio, the American reported that she had already had this experience: she took a cat home weighing about 10 kilograms, and now it is more than five.
In July, Reddit’s users drew attention to an Australian basket with unusually long laps.
The animal photo post collected more than 68,000 visits.
The commentators noted that she could make a career in model business.
Kou commended Russia ' s “excitely” apology for the doping scandal
The international athlete Sebastian Cou commended on Thursday that he had made sincere apologies from Russia for the doping scandal, but reiterated that it was now an inappropriate time to allow the country to participate again in sports competitions.
The Russian representative of the Federation of Light Athletics Dmitry Schlachtin reported at the International Association of Light Athletics Congress, which had preceded the World Easy Athletics Championship, that the removal of his country from sports competitions was fair and that he was determined to fight doping.
He apologized “for all the athletes who had stolen gold and silver medals at the competitions”.
Despite his comments, the Congress of the International Association of Light International Federations voted in favour of maintaining the removal imposed in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) published a report on evidence of the State-funded application of doping.
“I found that today’s response, today’s report was very sincere,” he told reporters of the President of the International Association of the Light International Federations of the Cou.
“All the Council and Congress liked... that the Russian Federation itself recognized that it was experiencing extremely hot times and is now making every effort to take care of the restructuring of the federation.”
Cou said that he also “appreciated” that Russia had agreed to the criteria for its restoration.
“I think it was a very constructive day and that we are moving forward, but the Congress supports the recommendations of the special commission, according to which it is not time to restore Russia to rights now,” Kou said.
“In the next few months, we have to do everything we can to deal with this situation.
Our guiding principle was our desire to separate clean athletes from the tight system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes, meeting the strict criteria of the International Association of Länder Federations, will participate in the World Championship on Light Athletics, which will begin in London on Friday.
The Head of the Special Commission of the International Association of Leasing Federations, Rune Andersen, said Monday that a number of requirements still needed to be met to restore Russia.
As he reported to reporters in London after the report made by the International Association of Läcoatlet Federations, drug testing is still not done in sufficient volume, and removed trainers are still doing their work peacefully.
The court arrested a Ukrainian journalist suspected of egotism
The detained Ukrainian Security Service (SBU) journalist Vasili Muravicki was arrested for two months, handed over to the SBU.
The official of the Journal of Jitomir is suspected of public change by placing his publications on Russian sites and in violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity.
Russia does not support the Ukrainian authorities' actions against the journalist, considering this to be a barbaric policy against the media.
Two years after the peak of the migration crisis in Europe, Italy decided to undertake a limited military operation in the Mediterranean.
Commander Borsini's patrol ship entered Libya's territorial waters to then stop the flow of illegal migrants along with the WIC.
The decision to initiate the operation was taken by the Italian Parliament on Wednesday.
Rome agreed with the internationally recognized Government of Libya, which, however, does not control most of the country ' s territory.
The opposition cabinet and the Libyan Parliament based in Tobruk accused Italy of violating the sovereignty of Libya.
The commander of the Libyan National Army, Feldmarshal Haftar, gave his command to oppose the Italian ships.
In Rome, however, they said they did not believe these threats and intended to send another military vessel to Libyan territorial waters.
The situation was discussed last week at the talks of Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni and the head of the recognised European office of Faiz Saraj.
The authorities of Italy went to establish a maritime mission to combat illegal migration after statistics of illegal immigrants from Libya were reported in July: 95,000 since the beginning of the year.
The Government stated that resources for the reception of migrants had been exhausted.
A massive failure occurred in Skype
The global failure of the Skype service was recorded right now in several countries of the world.
Users began to complain to programme developers on Thursday, 3 August.
In Microsoft, it was stressed that specialists are already actively working to address the problems faced by the people of Europe and North America, explains the RIA "News".
Remember, in June of this year, the work of Skype also failed.
Users could not receive and send messages for some time.
Two leaders of Ukraine's Light Athletics Assembly have been removed from membership of the CM
Olga Zemlák and Olesa Povch, who specializes in the short-range run, are excluded from Ukraine's membership for the 2017 World Cup in London.
This is reported on the Federation's Light Athletics website (FLAU).
Such a decision was taken by a panel of organizations in connection with the establishment of the International Association of Läcoatlet Federations (IAAF) of disciplinary proceedings in respect of Läcoatlet.
Trainer Sergey Basenko was also excluded from the Ukrainian delegation.
According to Sportarena, IAAF suspects sportsmen using doping.
Povh is the bronze stager of the 2012 Olympics and the 2011 World Championship, the Europe-2010 Championship at 4 to 100 meters, the Earth winner of the 2012 European Championship at 4 to 400 meters.
The London Light Athletics Peace Championship will take place from 4 to 13 August.
How the financial rules of football affect the transfer of Neimar to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unrestricted costs from European football clubs do not interfere with the world record of the transfer of Neimar from the Spanish "Barcelona" to the French "Pari San-German".
Whatever the consequences may be in the chain, for Pari San-German, by UEFA, the leading body controlling European football, in which the authorities prohibit teams from participating in the prestigious League of Champions tournament.
Under the Financial Fairfield Regulations introduced by UEFA in 2011, it should be shown that, in the end, the PSC will be able to show that the transfer of Nimara was funded without significant losses.
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ($262 million) only to free Brazil from the contract, and Nimar will receive a claim of tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neimar ' s move to France.
The PSC may well be tempted to hire Neimar and add it to the galaxy of other stars if it takes into account the financing of the team by the rich energy of the Qatari family.
Clubs have the right to spend large amounts on the acquisition of toys, but they have to balance them with legitimate sources of income in order to achieve the threshold of profitability in their football business.
The FFP introduced Michel Platini after his election as President of WEFA in 2007.
The former French footballer believed that clubs that were in huge debt in their pursuit of success were essentially gulping and risking destruction if banks or owners stopped financing.
In 2011, FFP stopped focusing on clubs and instead turned to tracking their losses.
As a result of this change, the business model that Roman Abramovic originally used in Chelsea in 2003 – buying a club with good potential and then seriously spending to improve the team and create a world brand – has become a difficult plan.
During the current three-year evaluation period, which covers 2018, clubs may suffer losses of 30 million euros.
And despite Platinum's defeat from the presidential post in 2015, his successor at UEFA, Alexander Cheferin, is still determined to stop excessive traffic.
“The FFP is of course alive, and we will step forward to tightening the rules,” said Andre Traverso, who controls FFP in UEFA last week.
Although the SGEI will pay the purchase of the Nimar contract simultaneously, it may allocate that amount to account for the entire duration of its contract.
Neimar has signed a five-year contract, so the transfer value can be shown in the annual accounts as costs of EUR 44.4 million over the next five years.
During the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, more severe sanctions were applied to PSCs, as well as to Abu Dhabi Manchester City.
A fine of €60 million was imposed on PSCs (the course was $82 million), which was later reduced to €20 million, and it was prescribed to limit the membership of its team to the Championship League during the 2014-1015 season by 21 players instead of ordinary 25.
WeEFA is tracking clubs that may try to speed up its financial inspections by disbursing their income for the company-related companies.
Although a Qatari company would be able to propose “PSC”, if the amount of funding was higher than the standard market prices, UEFA would not allow it to be considered as a legitimate income.
That is exactly what happened in 2014 when WeEFA decided that the financing of PSC by the Qatar Tourist Office was broken down.
It was reported that the part of Neimar ' s earnings in the PSC could have been paid by the 2022 Peace Championship Organization Committee in Qatar.
But the PSC and Qatar-2022 deny that Neimar will be the ambassador of the world's champion, and such a maneuver could easily be found by WEFA inspectors.
The previous sanctions imposed on PSCs mean that WEFA will be more closely monitored by any attempt to circumvent the rules.
As reported on Thursday by people familiar with the situation, UEFA did not hold preliminary discussions with PSC on the transfer of Neimar.
They contacted the Associated Press agency on terms of anonymity, as it was not authorized to discuss the position of the PSC.
According to the latest published report, in 2015-1016, more than 10 million euros were received in traffic of 542.4 million euros.
The accounts for the last financial year have not yet been published.
The PSC expects the arrival of Neimar to be a good ground for sponsoring transactions, selling attributes and team logos.
At the club, traffic is expected to grow by at least 30 per cent as a result of the recruitment of a new player.
The Spanish League has undoubtedly been concerned about the departure of one of the best footballers, and has tried to prevent the transfer of Neimar, stating that the PSC will violate the financial fair-play.
“This is an obvious case of “financial doping”, with the club and the State,” said Spanish newspaper “AS” President La Ligi Javier Tebas, meaning that the final owner of “PSZ” is Qatar.
Arsenala coach Arsen Wenger, whose club belongs to the American sports magnet, shares La Liga's doubts about the funding of the club by the State.
“This is all the consequences of partial participation, and this has completely changed the football landscape over the past 15 years,” Wenger said on Thursday.
“When the club belongs to the country, maybe everything.
It would be very difficult to respect the financial fair, because the country could have many ways and many reasons to be represented by such a serious player.
Order and venue of the oath shall be determined by the President
Where and as new Russian citizens will swear allegiance to the RF, the President will determine, such amendments to the second reading of the law in question have been developed by the Committee of the Government on Law and Law-Making.
Another week ago, the MPs planned to directly determine the procedure for making an oath in the law.
From the birth of a solemn vow, children under the age of 18 will be released, as well as disabled, should be included in the revised text of the amendments to the draft Law on the nationality of the FP (is available under the “Reports”), which the Committee will consider before the second reading at its meeting on 11 July.
The idea of taking an oath when entering the citizenship of the RF instead of formally signing documents was supported by President Vladimir Putin on 6 June at a meeting with the Speaker of Mr. Vácheslav Volodin.
The MPs formulated this idea in the form of an amendment to the second reading of the bill, which provides for the annulment of a decision on the extradition of nationality to those who were subsequently convicted of a number of terrorist or extremist crimes: for example, public calls for terrorism or its public justification in the media or on the Internet (art. 2 art. 205.2 CFC RF), as well as for aircraft, train or water transport, but only if this is related to terrorism (art. 4 art. 211 CFC RF).
According to the bill, the logic of it was this: by drawing up documents for citizenship, a person is under promise to comply with Russian law - a stand-up on the road to extremism, he violates that promise.
The bill was introduced in April by the leaders of the ruling factions Vladimir Vasiliev ("One Russia"), Gennadius Zuganov (COPF), Vladimir Girinovski (LDPR), Sergey Mironov ("Just Russia") and spokesperson for Mr. Vácheslav Volodin.
On 19 May, the Members adopted it at first reading.
Last week, the DG Committee on Management and Legislation approved the draft law for second reading, but now it has been recast.
It now states that the procedure for making an oath will be established by the President of the FF.
Earlier Parliamentarians were going to describe the procedure directly in the Law on the Citizenship of the RF, indicating that the ceremony should take place in a solemn setting before the State Herb and the flag of Russia in the presence of the representative of the IMF.
However, the text of the bill did not make it clear where such an event would take place - the list of places where the FF herb could be located, was regulated by the relevant federal constitutional law.
These include the courts, offices of heads of government of entities, municipal education, judges, prosecutors, heads of federal executives, etc.
Most likely, it could be the ZAGS.
To make a solemn vow to obtain the nationality of the FF will be after officers check their documents.
But the Russian passport will only be received after an oath has been made, as is the case with the revised text.
A week ago, the project said that the oath should precede the signing of the order.
The updated text says that the Russian oath will be 18 years old, not 14.
There was still a rule on which the oath would be exempt from failure or limited power, as well as those who could not pronounce, read or sign the oath text on their own.
In addition, the President of the FF has the right to be exempted from this procedure and from “other persons”,
The updated bill also included a special procedure for admission to Russian citizens of Ukrainians who are considered Russian-speaking.
They will have to formally renounce Ukrainian citizenship by making a statement to the competent authority of Ukraine for that purpose.
A notary certified copy of the statement will have to be submitted to Russian officials.
Abstention from “foreign” nationality, as it is now, will not be necessary if it is provided for by an international treaty or if it is impossible “for reasons other than the person”.
The relevant amendment to the law was proposed by a group of MPs, including the first Deputy Speaker of DG Ivan Melników (KPRF), Natalya Poklonski, Pavel Krašeninikov and Irat Farrahov (all: "One Russia").
I think many of you know that getting a report from Ukraine is unrealistic, just impossible.
Consequently, many people look forward to deciding their fate on the nationality of the RF, as explained earlier by the head of the thought committee on the construction and legislation of Paul Krašeniniki (ER).
In addition, the text made it clear that restrictions on the employment of certain posts for foreigners would not apply to those who had given up their “other” nationality in writing and who had given up their former passport to the Russian MVD, but “for whatever reason” had not ceased to be regarded as a national of another country.
Foreigners are now prohibited from positions in the municipal service, being admitted to work on facilities and in organizations related to the security of Russia.
Nor can a person with dual nationality or residence in another country become a Member of the House or a member of the Council of the Federation.
It is planned that the law should enter into force as from 1 September 2017 and that necessary legislative acts should be prepared by that time.
Nostalgia is becoming a nerd in the "Bar American Summer" and "Deputy of Detectives."
The present history iteration is nostalgic at the same time as the glorious days of characters in the 80s; the age of granja in the 90s (about the time when professors David Wayne and Michael Schovalter made a comedy of "State" for MTV); and the year 2001 itself, before her stars such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poller and Paul Radd became more serious.
As a fact of culture, it is at the same time an exaltation and inspiration of our era with its constant reminders from Facebook.
But as a Frenchman, she seems to be an anachronism.
"The first day of the camp" was a surprise, not just because of the absurdistic humor (including the original story about the talking bank of the fruit that H. John Benjamin sounded).
The result is double the main joke: middle-aged actors play sexually concerned children who have only reached adulthood; this makes it impossible to return to being part of the joke.
"Ten years later," where adults have already played adults, has less deep emotional roots, and its paradoty is more system-wide and includes riffs from the steel films of the 1990s, like "Hands That Stumble".
In one episode, the personage receives Apple Powerbook, four-wheeled wheelchairs, and "a bunch of other things since 1991".
Many summary steps are the same.
Now the writer, Shoulter, has not yet gained mutual respect from Katie (Margerite Moro).
Victor (Ken Marino) has not yet broken up with virginity.
And there is still a foolish and false conspiracy involving Ronald Reagan (also Schowalter) who is now instigating George Bush-Old (test parody in the performance of Michael Jan Blake).
As always, the best part of French is the deviation from it.
It's especially fun to see a young Radd who sings Matt Dillon's song from the "Odinochek", whose character, the former great man Andy now looks old.
This Frenchman could be successful by accident in the spirit of the recursion series Seven Up, until it comes to its logical conclusion: "The hot American summer: twenty years later," where in the last scene the whole company would go to the movie premiere "The hot American summer."
The "Deputy of Detectives" in the Amazon refers to another type of nostalgia: the memories of the Cold War of the Americans, the Explosive Blonde or even the Lightning with its images of East and West struggle.
This comedy by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, directed by Riz Thomas, depicts a telefilm: the Romanian police drama of the 1980s about two police officers in Bucharest who fight for the truth, atheism and Marxist-Lenin road.
The main roles of Gregor and Joseph's idealist were Florin Piersik-younger and Cornelius Ulic and their dialogues in English were Chenning Tatum (the same executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's just an idea.
There are several visual jokes (the police spend time watching a chess game as Americans might watch football).
The team of well-known votes -- among them Jenny Slate, Nick Oferman, Mahershal Ali and Chloe Seviny -- makes it interesting to play in "put your voice."
But "Deputy of the Detectives" is so much inconceivable of the unscrupulous propaganda drama -- there's even a killer in Ronald Reagan's mask -- which often looks like her.
Six long episodes are delayed, and it's not very often funny.
If it were to be done in a short time, the "Deputy of the Detective" could better deal with its satire in the spirit of an agitist prop; for example, whenever Gregor and Joseph come to the American embassy, there are two fat men sitting in the west, swallowing a bunch of hamburgers.
This image to the imaginary viewer-communist tells us that Western culture is capable of doing whatever it takes to make a drink.
The Romanian authors of the film are not so wrong: we do so even with our own recent history, and so with them.
The Russian Super-Cube Football Award Fund between Spartacus and Locomotive is about 30 million rubles.
The President of the Russian Football League (RFPL) informed Sergei Pradkin of this at the press conference.
According to the RFPL chapter, the winner will receive 70% of that amount, according to RT.
He also added that so far the tickets for the match were almost gone.
Spartacus match - Locomotive will take place on Friday, July 14, at 21:30.
As the TASS notes, Spartacus is the current RF champion and Locomotive is the owner of the country's Cube.
Two young ants cleaned the furniture for 200 thousand rubles
During the days, a 37-year-old security officer with a furniture company visited the police.
The man said that he stole expensive tools from the shop, which had caused serious damage to his production.
The paper was made of tools of a total value of almost 200 thousand rubles: two wired apparatus, perforator, hydraulic, lever.
The guards began searching for criminals and soon arrived at the inhabitants of the Bashcortostan area, friends 23 and 24.
According to the media services of the Republic, communications penetrated the territory of the enterprise, breached the entrance door and issued instruments.
Immediately after that, the guys sold stolen the first car service.
With regard to them, the case of theft has already been initiated, and rightholders have been able to return only part of the stolen instruments to the rightful owner.
Mr. Medvedev commented on the relationship between RF and US
The United States and Russia should be able to work with each other.
This statement was made by the official representative of Mr. Hizer Nauert in response to the words of Prime Minister Dmitria Medvedev regarding the relations of two States.
The head of the Russian Government had previously stated that, following the adoption of new anti-Russian sanctions, the United States had put an end to the hope of improving bilateral relations and had declared the FM a full-fledged trade war.
In commenting on these words, Nauert acknowledged that Russian-American relations were “low”, but noted that there was a need to seek “areas for interaction”.
"Look at the peace in the south-west of Syria, which has been observed for almost a month."
"And this is an example of good cooperation between the United States and Russia," says the diplomat RIA Novosti.
The representative of the foreign political agency refused to comment on the statement by the Russian Prime Minister that sanctions were equivalent to trade war.
The draft new sanctions law on Russia, Iran and the Canadian President of the United States, Donald Trump, signed in the past Wednesday.
He acknowledged, however, that the document was unsuccessful and contrary to the American Constitution.
Dior has grown roses from amethysts and quartz
The Dior - Dior Joaillerie, a jewelery of the French fashion house, has completed the Rose Dior Bagatelle and Bois de Rose collections.
There were five new wheels and three wheels on barter belts.
The Rose Dior Pré Catelan series released two new rings and a balloon from amethysts, pink quartz and brilliants performed in gliptic technique (hand cut on stone) and respect for 70-year-olds at home.
The head of Dior Joaillerie Victoria de Castellan was inspired by the roses that grew in his room in Granville by Christian Dior, and by the Paris gardens of Bagatel and Pre-Cathelan.
Tramp found guilty of a deterioration in relations with Russia
The President of the United States, Donald Trump, took a sharp criticism of the members of the congress.
According to the American leader, their actions have led to a deterioration of relations with Russia.
Our relations with Russia are at a low and dangerous level.
"You can thank Congress, these same people can't even give us medicine," the president wrote on Twitter.
Before that, Donald Trump signed the new sanctions law against Russia, Iran and the PRC.
In particular, they will be affected by Russian banks and energy companies.
The White House subsequently circulated the President ' s statement that the law would not allow the United States to engage in profitable transactions and would further bring RF, China and North Korea closer together.
Belarusian entrepreneur refused to buy a Ukrainian daughter Sberbank
An entrepreneur from Belarus, Victor Prokopenja, withdrew an application from the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) for the purchase of a subsidiary of Sberbank.
The businessman explained his decision to RBC with the intention of “focusing on other planned investments and projects that we are working on”.
Mr. Prokopni said that such a step would be "a better investment of time", despite the attractiveness of the investment of Sberbank's daughter.
Mr. Prokopenja became the main bidder for the purchase of a Russian bank unit in Ukraine after the NGO rejected the application of the NorvikBank consortium Güsselnikov and the Belarusian company Said Gücerieva in July.
The Russian banks began to leave the Ukrainian market after President Petr Poroshenko imposed sanctions on their subsidiaries in March.
One such financial organization -- apart from the TBB and the Non-Economic Bank -- has become Sberbank.
Novak called the cause of the blackout in Crimea
In the Ministry of Energy, the RF called the cause of the blackout in Crimea.
The head of the department, Alexander Novak, gave an explanation of what had happened.
He said that the peninsula had lost electricity because of a road accident in Krasnodar territory.
As a result of the electric transmission of the truck into the DTP, the Cuban and associated Crimean Networks were switched off.
The electrical failure of major Crimean cities was recorded last week.
Specialists have eliminated the disturbances for several hours.
Originally it was reported that the cause of blackout could have become an abnormal heat.
Bank of England will maintain interest rates at 0.25%
It is expected that the Bank of England will later declare that interest rates will not change after weak economic growth and weakening inflation have caused the hearings of possible increases.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth would remain constant, leaving interest rates unaffected by increasing pressure on family income.
The Specialists of the Bank's Money Policy Committee (MPC) voted with effect from 6 to 2 to maintain rates of 0.25%, with fewer members of the Committee expressing a higher rate this month, as weak economic growth had weakened support for increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank limited its forecast to an increase of 1.7 per cent in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 and warned that family income pressure would continue, while still expected to rise to about 3% in the autumn.
However, the Bank warned that increases in rates over the next few years would be necessary to control the sharp inflation and stated that borrowing costs would probably have to be higher than expected in financial markets.
The members of the Committee also voted to reject part of the overall package of measures to develop the economy launched a year ago as a result of the breakup.
From the next February, the bank will close the emergency financing plan that it provides banks with cheap loans, although it has announced that it is now due to provide up to 115 billion pounds under the plan.
In the rate decision-making protocol, the bank said: “The main forecast of the MPC is that gross domestic product (GDP) growth remains slow in the near future, while the pressure on real family income continues to affect consumption.”
On the issue of rates, he reiterated that, in order to stop inflation, there would be a need for “some financial policy tightening” to “a slightly greater extent” than expected by markets.
At this point, the markets predict the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another one in 2020.
But the bank stressed that all increases would be “steps” and “limited”.
The Bank ' s projections for the increase this year and next year are lower than those made in May, which were 1.9 per cent and 1.7 per cent.
The Bank left its forecast unchanged at 1.8% in 2018.
After this news, sterling fell with respect to the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5 per cent to $1.31 and by 0.4 per cent to €1.11.
The decision not to change the rate was made after the recent negative growth rates had weakened the expected increase; GDP had then risen by 0.3 per cent in the second quarter to 0.2 per cent in the previous three months.
According to the Bank ' s representative, growth is expected to remain at the level of 0.3 per cent in the third quarter, although it will begin to increase slightly by the end of the year.
The last report of the Bank on inflation gave little reason for the happiness of households that had been hit by high inflation and a very small increase in wages: according to the Bank, pressure would be increased before falling.
The Bank added that financial policy “cannot prevent” earnings success in the next few years, but expected that “significant” wages would be restored by the end of its three-year forecast.
The economy is also geared towards growth as a result of increasing demand for British goods due to a low pound price that compensates for part of the reduced consumer costs.
The decision was taken a year after the rates had been reduced to 0.25 per cent last August following the shocking results of the Euro-Union withdrawal referendum.
It is expected that it will take four years to fully influence prices and the economy.
Before the bank reached its last rate decision, there was a growing noise around the expected increase in rates, as inflation was increasingly undermining and undermining domestic pressure: three experts in the Committee requested to increase rates to 0.5 per cent in July.
Last month, inflation fell to 2.6% from 2.9% in July, although the bank reported that it was expected to fall and was recompensated in the coming months.
According to the Bank, a higher rate compared to the projected 2 per cent is the result of a low pound rate.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco's Mortgage Brokers, said: "If we take into account the recent decline in the Soup courses, the mortgage market will become even more competitive again, as creditors require business opportunities and expect a good year's end.
The market is particularly favourable for those who are approaching the end of their existing treaties, since refinancing of loans often becomes more popular than ever, with the possibility of a lack of commission and a low rate.”
The Public Health Service will prescribe HIV-response medicines for 10,000 people
As of September, patients will have access to a “revolutionary” post-HIV prevention drug in the High Court on funding from the Public Health Service.
The National Health Service of England announced that the pre-exposure HIV prevention (PREP), a pre-exposure pill that was proven to reduce the risk of infection for persons at risk by an average of 86 per cent, would now be provided by the health service over the initial three-year trial period of approximately 10,000 people.
She agreed to finance the trial after the Court of Appeal supported the High Court ' s ruling last year, which claimed that the National Health Service had the opportunity to pay the PREP, despite her statement that it should be financed by local authorities.
This step, announced on Thursday, was called “the most important innovation” by the president of the National Health Service of England Simon Stevens, and the National AIDS Control (NAT) called it “a turning point”.
Prior to the full launch of the entire English programme by April 2018, Veneerological Dispersors in London, Briton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will begin to register for the first time, and even more dispersors will join the programme in October.
Pre-exposure prevention (PREP) is a course of HIV products taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
According to studies, the PREP significantly reduces the risk of HIV infection among people at risk.
When the PREP is administered before sex in the human body, a sufficient number of specific medicines are available to prevent HIV infection.
Such preparations may be taken daily or no later than two hours before sex.
Patients with the right to a medicinal product are homosexual and bisexual men, transgenders and people whose partners are HIV positive and who do not receive successful treatment.
Distributors will select appropriate participants who have agreed to participate in the study, including men, women, transgenders and persons whose partners are unknown, whether their HIV status is restricted by antiretroviral therapy.
People living and prescribed for general practice in England will also be able to apply for potential participation in the nearest venereal dispenser participating in the programme.
The programme will cost 10 million pounds, and the National Health Service of England signed a pharmaceutical contract this week after the international procurement tender.
The study is designed to assess all possibilities for the PREP to take into account the collection of clinical data on who is the target auditor of the medicinal product, its capacity and its wide application.
“This key innovation should complement and strengthen the widespread and ever-successful efforts to prevent HIV.
This is another milestone for more than three decades of success in combating one of the greatest health threats facing mankind.
Debora Gold, President of NAT (National AIDS Control Office), said: “This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
The PREP, if it is aimed literally at people in need of assistance and at risk, provides an opportunity to change the situation of the HIV epidemic in England.
As of September, people in the HIV risk group will be given access to a new open-ended tool that can be used to control itself without discussing it with a partner, which will lead to the improvement of many lives.
We warmly welcome this news."
Jan Green, president of the Terrence Higgins Fund, said: “The first thing to do is to make sure that the test is carried out quickly throughout the country, and that none of the HIV risk groups are forgotten.
Now, when we are provided with an experimental PREP, we are going to protect more than 10,000 people in the HIV risk zone."
Tenew Minister of Public Health Sharon Hodgson said: “We highly welcome the start of the PREP test, it has been very late due to months of government delays and delays”.
Data show how revolutionary this drug can be as part of our approach to preventing HIV and stopping the transmission of this rock infection.
This test will bring us closer to a full understanding of the benefits of the PREP.
It is now important that the test be developed as soon as possible throughout the country to protect those at risk of HIV and to move us further towards ending the spread of HIV in society.
World Congress Tatar adopted resolution on the support of the Tatarstan and Russia treaty
The Sixth Meeting of the World Congress of Tatar (WCT) adopted a resolution that highlighted the importance of maintaining the President ' s post in Tatarstan.
According to the paper, the post is “good for the recommended form of organization of the highest government in the Republic and expressing the national interests of the whole Tatar people”.
In addition, the Conference stressed in the resolution the importance of the treaty on the separation of powers between Russia and Tatarstan.
According to the document, he “has played a positive role in the ethnocultural, socio-economic and social-political development of Tatarstan and the Russian Federation as a whole”.
It is recalled that since 24 July 2007, a treaty between Moscow and Kazan had been concluded for 10 years.
On 11 July, the representatives of Gossovet Tatarstan requested the President of Russia to extend the agreement and retain the appointment of the head of the region.
Tatarstan is now the only federal entity with a treaty with Russia.
The head of the region is the only one known as the President.
There were difficulties in obtaining international driving rights in Russia
IDBDD units have a lack of international driving licences (IWUs).
In order to obtain such rights, it is necessary to wait a few weeks, which has become a problem for vacationers who want to go abroad on their car or take it by train.
It should be noted that the situation with international driving licences remains contradictory.
ITU was introduced to make it easier for the foreign police to understand what was written in the national certificate, since it explained the information in five languages.
The requirements for international rights are recorded in the 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, but Russian rights are also recognized in countries that have ratified the Vienna Convention.
However, everything depends on specific police or law offices: some require SMEs and some have sufficient national rights.
In order to ensure that international rights are still received, it should be borne in mind that in non-ratified countries (e.g. the United States, Spain, Mexico, Indonesia) the authorities have the right not to recognize national rights or SMEs.
The problem of blanks is now being observed in almost all IBRD units, reports Commersant, conducting a study in a number of regions.
Yes, in Moscow, the UGIBDDs are simply not issued, the blanks are not enough for four months.
It is possible to sign up for reception on the site of the gosnuaries, but it has already grown until mid - August.
In Krasnoyarsk, it is impossible to obtain “technical reasons”, without giving in detail, in the Samara region honestly saying that there are no blanks, a similar situation exists in other cities.
The problem has already been faced by many mosquitoes, and there are more and more reports:
Irina Burmistrova: "What is the reason why international rights cannot be obtained in Moscow?"
That's right, because all the GIBD offices have completed the forms.
Elena Podkolzina: "Ask people who know."
International rights need to be obtained very urgently.
In Moscow, they have always been killed far ahead, and they don't give up at all. (There's a button, but they can't give.)
This is what the portal of the Superintendents shows that in Spb, time is free to go to the fig.
Did anyone try to get in another town?
Does it work?
As explained in the IMF, the requirements for international driving licence forms have changed, so new forms are being delivered by the Gosavto Inspection Unit.
This may be linked to the deficit, but it is not clear what changes are being made before this has been reported.
Blankies purchases the Special Road Safety Designation Centre (CSNBDD) of the MDF and then puts them in the GIBDD unit.
In recent years, all contracts have been concluded with Goznak. In 2014-2015, almost 200 thousand SME forms have been made, 15 thousand forms have been purchased in 2016, 90 thousand in 2017, but the last contract was concluded with the First Printed Court on 18 July.
There is a version that the CNS just failed to conduct a tender on time, which led to a deficit.
However, there are other versions of the gap: because of the crisis, many people have become self-employed not in Europe, but in cheaper Asian countries, China, Thailand and so on.
What rights there are, to the end, is unclear, so people are insured, and therefore there is a curious demand for international short-terms.
It has recently become known that professional drivers will have to pass an examination to confirm their qualifications.
Mintrans made the proposal.
The International Driving Certificate (IMO) of the new model has been in force since 31 May 2011.
The Minister of Justice of Ukraine refused to believe in the construction of the Crimean Bridge
Ukrainian Justice Minister Paul Petrenko said he did not believe in Russia's ability to build a bridge in Crimea.
That's what he said on Friday, August 4, in an interview with the Observer.
No respected international company will even put a bolt or hook there because it risks losing its business in the EU, the United States, Japan, in countries that have joined the sanctions against Russia on Crimea.
"That is, in my opinion, there is actually no prospect of this project," Petrenko said.
He added that Russia considered it impossible to carry out a large infrastructure project on its own.
Russia could not normally build smaller facilities.
I know that after the Olympics in Sochi, the entire stadium was already destroyed.
"Therefore, I believe that the best instrument in this situation is sanctions against companies that have become so remote to join this project," said the officer.
On 31 July, the builders completed the construction of the Crimean Bridge.
A massive collection of the Crimean Bridge Road Ark was completed on the Kerchen coast: it was closed at a height of 45 metres from the base of the construction.
“At the same time, the bridge builders have prepared for the installation of a railway arc,” reported at the project information centre.
In April, the head of Mintrans Maxim Sokolov informed President Vladimir Putin of the establishment of the facility with a schedule.
The Crimean Bridge unites the Crimean peninsula and the Krasnodar border.
In Spain, an officer who had not been in work for 10 years was fired
What English patience (or absolute indifference to public service) was Charles Resio, the chief of the Spanish official?
The permanent gap has grown for 10 years.
However, Mr. Recio was fired.
But not his direct boss.
It's just that bureaucrats don't happen in the world.
The inhabitants seem to have been used to all the chalices of "the people's servants."
Still, officials are always surprised by those whose taxes are not bad.
This time, the "sensation" was sorry about Spain.
There, a member of the Valencian archive, Carles Recio, had been out of work for ten years.
In doing so, he received a regular complaint.
With everything solid, 50 thousand euros a year.
And here's Mr. Recio's weird times are over.
He was dismissed by the Valencian Legislative Assembly.
In the investigation it was found that an angry walker had come to the office every morning at 07:00 to check in the electronic system.
And here I went home.
Once again, he appeared at 4:00 so that he could see again in the system that he had left.
That's 10 years.
It was also known that all the leisure time a hiker devoted himself to drawing comics at home.
The members of the Valencian Legislative Assembly now think how to punish Mr. Resio, a direct officer who could not know how to "actively work" at his workplace by his subordinate.
The Judges propose to protect against the Presidents
The Presidential Human Rights Council (HRC) on behalf of Vladimir Putin has developed proposals to strengthen the independence of the judiciary.
The PSC proposes to limit the powers of the Presidents of the courts and to introduce their electivity.
For the courts of appeal and cassation, the HRS wishes to introduce special districts that will not be linked to the administrative and territorial division of the FF.
The Supreme Court should also submit its proposals under the Presidential Order.
The SPC has completed proposals that will strengthen the independence of Russian justice.
This work was carried out by the SPC on behalf of Vladimir Putin of 3 January 2017, which the President gave after meeting with the members of the Council.
The meeting with the members of the Council on 8 December 2016 was discussed, including individual cases of judicial proceedings, as well as issues of public control in places of detention (see “E” of 9 December).
The overall work of the HICP has become 25 proposals relating both to ensuring the independence of judges and to identifying judicial errors, as well as to financing of courts and legal education.
One of the ideas of Kremlin human rights defenders is to restrict the powers of the Presidents of the courts to increase the independence of other judges.
If a candidate for a judge has successfully passed the competition and has received support from the judicial community, the President of the court shall, in the opinion of the SPC, submit him to appointment without having the right to refuse as the law now permits.
It is also proposed to deprive the President of the right to distribute cases for trial between judges.
In doing so, experts may allow a specially written computer program.
It is also considered that the Chair is not entitled “to determine the results of the judge’s qualification, to initiate his involvement in disciplinary responsibility, to decide on the establishment of additional material payments”.
At the same time, the Presidential Council considers it necessary to move to “elect the Presidents of the Courts by their own judges” and “give them powers for a relatively short period of time with mandatory rotation”.
All the Presidents of the Courts (from the Republic to the District) are now appointed as President of the Supreme Court of the RF for six years.
In order to protect judges from pressure from regional administrations, the PSC proposes to re-organize appeals and appeals in courts of general jurisdiction.
Their structure is now linked to the administrative and territorial division of the RF.
In the SPC, it is said that “it is necessary to ensure that individual courts of appeal and cassation are organized not at the level of the regional judicial authorities in the FF entities, but in the judicial districts”.
The experts shall be based on the practice of arbitral tribunals.
There are “judicial districts” that do not correspond to the administrative division in the FF, but that guarantee greater independence from regional officials who are hampered by the use of “phone law”.
The World Court of Justice of the SHR proposes to strengthen the public meeting to consider some “civil and administrative categories” with their participation.
For example, the deprivation of parental rights, the restoration of work, the protection of honor and dignity, the deprivation of driving rights, etc.
"That's just our proposals," explained U member of the SPC, a judge of the Constitutional Court in resignation of Tamara Morštakova.
She also recalled that the President ' s mandate was not only to the HR, but also to the Supreme Court (HR), which had not yet revealed its proposals.
There is still time to carry out the mandate of the COP (with the executives of the Office of the Attorney-General and the Human Rights Officer in the RF).
To report to Vladimir Putin on the effectiveness of the RF in ensuring the independence of justice, the President of the General Assembly, Mr. Vácheslav Lebedev, shall be required until 1 September.
Living a long life: Semitage and cunning designers have turned this small apartment into a space dwelling in Earls Court
Joan Lee, a former banker who was involved in real estate repair, moved from a space house to Nightsbridge in 2014 to an Earls Court apartment.
The apartment is on the first floor of a nice typical house in the style of Queen Anna, and for the sake of a new design, it says that Joan has not collected her things and has not moved back.
“I used to live with my ex in Nightsbridge in a much bigger place, ” says Joan.
“I was looking for something comparable to my money.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and there were the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her, and I offered her a present on that day.
Since the first visit, the apartment has been completely rebuilt in 1,000 square feet.
Originally, it was a bedroom with one more complex planning – to fall into the bedroom, had to go through the kitchen – and Joanna wanted to add space to store things and half-story to get the maximum benefit from the generous height of the floor.
“I wanted high ceilings, big windows, a lot of light.
Those were my demands," she says.
To this end, she hired Erfan Azadi from the Notting Hill architectural and design studio Duck & Shed to use 12.5 feet high roofs and create a home that would not only be a successful project but would expect Joan to live.
The flood was not high enough to build two spaces above each other, so the architectural task was to create a semi-eating where full growth could be achieved.
Erfan had to think creatively to deal with the briefing.
“Working with permanent structures is very difficult,” he explains.
“We needed to have the rooms so that they were above each other, and we didn’t have to worry.
It was necessary not just to build a simple platform, but to excite structures so that they could be at the right height and allow space to be used up and down.”
This decision allowed Erfan to set up two full-sized rooms above each other in the remote area – and still very interesting.
With a semi-satellite through the vintage honeylight window from Retrovius, there is a look at a spacious guest downstairs.
The gold-plated ceramic furniture, silver accents, and serje muja lighting equipment set the project style.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding visibility, space and light.
The short corridor is covered with mirrors to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the mirror protection panel looks like a window in another room.
At the entrance, the mirror cabinets serve to store Joan's entire vessel.
In order to create a feeling of brighter space, the beauty of the hotel can build up a kitchen when it is not in use.
There's nothing new in the storage kitchens.
The uniqueness of this kitchen is that it moves up the door like in the garage.
“Technical art has been used here,” told Erfan about an armed steel wooden protection door.
“It is equipped with a counterweight, so when you press the door up, it’s very easy.”
Because of the reasonable use of space and storage space, Joan received an additional 16 square metres, an additional bedroom and improved planning.
“At the end of the day, the place of sex is what you will sell, that is, what your real estate is valued for.”
“The real estate agent will come in and make calculations on the basis of sex.”
Here they were able to increase the sex area by using quality materials that contribute to the space of rosemary.
“Materials are what we touch, so they help create an emotional relationship with the home,” says Erfan.
“No one falls in love with the electrical wiring in the walls.
It is important, but it does not strike the strings of our hearts."
This is evidence that a good design and an increased metering of the apartment can become something unusual.
Actually, like Joan, you can decide to stay.
The Government has approved the establishment of a commission on cultural policy
The Government of Russia approved the establishment of a commission on public cultural policy.
The decision is published on the Government website.
According to the document, the Commission's main task will be to develop and adjust strategic approaches to cultural policy.
The Commission will also develop projects of a cultural policy strategy, clarify tasks and prepare new programmes for its implementation.
The Chief Commission shall be appointed Vice-President of the Government of the RF.
The composition of the Commission will be adopted separately.
In 2016, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev adopted a plan for the implementation of the State Cultural Policy Strategy by 2030.
The plan includes 193 activities and provides for measures to increase the influence of Russian culture in other countries, to maintain a single cultural area and cultural heritage, and will also contribute to the creation of conditions for the development of culture in the country.
Inflation in G20 countries decreased to a minimum of eight years
Consumer prices in the G20 countries have declined to a minimum in the last eight years, reports The Wall Street Journal, referring to data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
The OECD estimates that in June 2016 inflation rates were 2 per cent lower in October 2009, when the price growth index reached 1.7 per cent.
In the past, Rosstat reported a decrease of 0.1 per cent in the consumer price index in Russia.
The department therefore recorded the first weekly deflation in 2017.
The inflation target in Russia, according to Minfin, is 4.1 per cent.
Mineconomies, however, believe that the target has already been achieved, in the version of the department, is 4 per cent.
Putin warns against illegal biking
Russian leader Vladimir Putin warned of the illegal destruction of forests during a meeting on environmental development in the natural bicultural territory.
In the course of the work of the Minister of Natural Resources, Sergei Donski noted that the bill had been drafted earlier.
He authorized the logging of the forest during the elimination of fires, and the Government was planning to adopt it in the autumn.
In turn, the President said that the project should be monitored to ensure that “not all order has been cut off” during the cutting process.
Donsky noted that the bill entails control by the PMC and the supervisory agencies.
The media: the U.S.O.S. soldiers secretly negotiate with the Donbass militias
There is a regular telephone link in Donbass.
Fighters of the opposing parties are constantly communicating with each other on mobile phones, and they do not know about this in headquarters.
The U.S. S.A. and the Donbass militias have made communication on hundreds of phones a secret from their high command.
This is reported on 4 August by Strana.ua with reference to the participants of the military operation in Donbass.
According to the publication, the team commanders are well aware of the names of their colleagues on the opposite side of the front and are contacted by telephone each day.
Communication is not at all home: the commanders are trying to reach some “tactic arrangements”.
The result of such discussions is a reconciliation at a certain point in the front.
Journalists were informed of the cases when congratulations were received by an officer on the front line from his formal enemy.
The U.S.A. and the DNR and LNR militia are on the line of separation since spring 2014, when Ukraine launched a war against Donbass.
Midi has hampered the blocking of UNSCR statements of attacks on the FR Embassy
The Russian foreign policy agency was upset by the actions of certain Western diplomatic representatives who blocked UN Soubez ' s statements in the press condemning the terrorist attacks of the RF embassy in Syria.
This is reported by the Russian MID.
The delegation recalled that the territory of the Russian Embassy in Damascus on 2 August the third time a month was undermining by terrorists from Heyat Tahrir Ash-Sham (former Jabhat An-Nuzra, prohibited in FF) and Filek Ar-Rahman.
Bearing in mind that the international community unanimously qualified as a terrorist organization, and UN-SCRs called for countering that structure, the IDF stated that “it would seem to be understood that Nusra's acts should meet a general unconditional and firm condemnation, and that there should be no ambiguity in the assessment of the outcome against diplomatic missions”.
However, as stressed in the diplomacy, “for the third time a month, diplomatic representatives of the United States, the United Kingdom, France and Ukraine in the Security Council, in particular, have blocked the Russian Federation’s proposal to adopt a standard short draft Security Council statement condemning terrorist attacks on the Russian diplomatic mission in the Syrian capital”.
The unwillingness to show diplomatic solidarity with us will allow us to remain conscious of these delegations.
“The most disturbing thing is that the inability of the Security Council to condemn terrorist acts encourages them to new provocations and acts, gives them a sense of impunity,” they said in the MID and added that “it would not be desirable for these barbarians to have the conviction that someone in the Security Council is with them.”
Vladimir Putin spokesperson for limiting the number of out-of-the-way business checks
Russian President Vladimir Putin of the Far East Investment Project Meeting stated that the number of out-of-date checks by entrepreneurs should be reduced to 30 per cent of the planned number, as well as stated the need to limit the time limit for inspections to ten weeks.
“Explanation checks are usually carried out without agreement with the Prosecutor’s Office; only 2-3 per cent agree with the Prosecutor’s Office, all the rest go on their own”, says President TASS.
Vladimir Putin also said that investigators should be prohibited from taking servers and hard drives on businesses.
Moreover, in the view of the President, business associations should have the right to protect the interests of their members in court.
"This will, I hope, give some impetus to dealing with business-related matters or with a violation of the law in the business field," said the head of State.
As reported by “U”, the moratorium on planning inspections is increasing the number of other types of inspections by entrepreneurs.
In May, a survey was conducted by the businessman with the President of Russia, Boris Titova, which revealed that there had actually been a change of plans for extra-planning checks (the proportion of those encountered increased from 21.9 per cent in 2015 to 30.8 per cent in 2016), prosecutors (from 16.9 per cent to 21.8 per cent), judges (from 7.9 per cent to 13.3 per cent) and citizens' statements (from 15 per cent to 19.5 per cent) and administrative investigations (10.8 per cent to 15.5 per cent).
More about the business checks in the "U" material "The small business has gone on the other side".
Brothers fight for the real estate empire worth over $500 million
Two brothers are fighting for one of the largest empires in the state of Victoria in real estate worth more than $500 million, forty years after their Italian ancestors founded the dynasty.
Former director of the Carlton Football Club and founder Colin de Lutis live in the Turkish court through three doors of his younger brother Paul, who filed a claim against him in the Supreme Court for division of ownership and assets.
Paul wants to get out of his family business since 2014, but in the Supreme Court there is a heated dispute about divorce.
Together with their mother, Anna's brothers own 87 objects worth more than half a billion dollars bought since their family bought a store at Smith Street in Collingwood in 1973.
There the family founded Westco Jeans, which grew up in a network of 160 trading points.
It was sold in 1999 for 85 million dollars.
Money was invested in real estate, and the De Luttis family's list today includes office buildings, construction sites in Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments in the Gold Coast and Mount Buller and shopping centers in the suburbs.
In agreement with the late father, Colin, whose Paul describes as "the main driving force and dominant personality" of the De Lutis family, has about two thirds of the company's assets, and Paul is about one third.
According to the court, this means that Colina's property is 316 million and Paul is 176 million.
The division of property and money became the cornerstone for Paul.
"The division proposed by Colin gives him, in my view, the best parts of property," he wrote in his first presentations in 2015.
Last Friday, after several unsuccessful attempts to reconcile, the first hearings were held in the Supreme Court.
The brothers will now dispute who will control the existing business, from which Paul said Colin excluded him.
Colin claims that it is not, but accuses Paul of mismanagement of some objects.
In the evidence given by Colin at the beginning of the process, he said he hoped to resolve the dispute.
"My Italian roots make me consider my family a top priority," he wrote.
Judicial costs are growing as a snowcomb: hundreds of pages of evidence, e-mails and company reports such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer have been added to the case; both parties have attracted the most famous lawyers, including Queen's lawyer Allan Mayers, and the best strikers.
Ms. De Lutis and her late wife, Luigi, were immigrants from Italy; since the late 1950s they managed milk bars and gastronomy and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
Under financial guarantees, they bought a retail store in Collingwood, where Colin opened the first family store of the gins.
Colin says he started Westco when he was "in the last classes of the school, and Paul was then a boy (approximately 10 years old).
Anna De Lutis said that they and Luigi, who died in 2012, were hoping to hand over their possession to their sons without conflict.
"Ludji often told me she didn't want the brothers to be tried," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group; Colina says that Mark received 10 million when he left the business and Luke 26 million.
According to Paul, and Luke, and Mark were “unsatisfied with the financial conditions of their office”.
Colin was not a public figure, although he was a former member of the Board of Directors of the AFL club and, according to Eddie McGir's 2015 biography, the best other television star.
On Friday, Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul and their lawyers.
He only answered Colin with a textual message saying that since the case had not yet been dealt with in court, “I really have nothing to say”.
"I am very sorry that my brother Paul has decided to file a complaint against me and to bring the name of our family before the court," he wrote.
In mid - 2016, Colin wrote in proof that he was trying to meet his brother’s demands.
"Our father wouldn't like to see Paul and I argue in court," he said, adding that "there is still hope for a resolution of the conflict."
On Friday, this hope seemed to be disillusioned.
"The decision on our case will soon be handed down by the court," Colin wrote.
The new head of the trampa unit plans to limit the receipt of information to the President.
Others have tried to do so and have suffered defeat.
Maybe John F. Kelly's gonna make it.
In that case he'll be the first.
Politikko reports that the new head of the White House machine plans to limit the flow of information coming to President Trampu, including news from the media, hoping to keep the boss in a calmer state.
That's what reporter Josh Dozzy reports.
"At a meeting held by John F. Kelly, the new head of the White House, with the lead of the machine on his first working day, he highlighted the main problem in the White House with President Donald Trampe, whom he hopes to resolve: bad channels of access to the President."
Kelly told the staff that the information should go through it, either in paper form or in briefings, because the President would be better able to make decisions if he received the correct information.
Kelly's diagnosis is quite true, but others have already been unsuccessful in trying to calm down the tramp, tracking his income.
President Trampa's relationship with television was set up a few decades ago - and now that he is in White House, his habit of watching TV is still strong.
"When Trump, as a candidate, was upset by the unfair lighting of the campaign, it was helpful to show him that he had received fair light in the publications that could be persuaded," said Sam Nanberg, former electoral councillor, in February.
Tara Palmeri then wrote in "Policy," that "according to the six former members of the electoral headquarters to keep Trampa's habit of writing on Twitter, it was necessary to ensure that the information coming to him was a constant stream of praise."
Okay.
But the idea that Tramp's habit of writing on Twitter was "under control" was funny.
Perhaps these members of the electoral headquarters know something we don't know, for example, that if they didn't, Trampa's tweets would be even more provocative.
We may never know about tweets that Trump hasn't published.
If his staff had saved him from hardship at least several times, their efforts had not been wasted.
But no one's ever been able to keep Trump from blowing oil into the fire.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, divided into rival factions, people are constantly trying to advance their agenda by submitting the Trampu material, whether reliable or not, that confirms their views.
“Politikko” - just before this story - wrote in May about the Council's willingness to constantly raise doubts about the President's information.
Here is an example described by reporter Shein Goldmacher:
"The current and former staff members of Trump say that Trump can react very strongly to negative reports in the press, especially containing dangerous leaks of information, and will not rest until they find who was behind them.
This was the case at the end of February, when someone moved the president to print the article with GotNews.com, the website of the Internet Provocator Charles K. Johnson, in which the deputy head of the Catty Wells unit was accused of “being behind a series of escapes” at the White House.
It is not important that Johnson is forever disturbed on Twitter about aggressive behavior, that he did not present specific facts, or that in the past he started false accusations and then refused them.
The tramp read the article and began asking questions about Welsh."
Goldmacher adds that the then head of the Rains Pribus machine and the secretary of the Rob Porter machine "have tried to build a system to manage and document the flow of papers received by Trump."
How did that work?
Three months later Kelly's trying to do the same.
He may be a more effective manager than Pribus, but Tramp still has an impulsive nature and his assistants continue to fight each other for influence.
These constant factors make Kelly's task very difficult.
The Tumen Procurator's Office is fighting the HIV dissident
The Prosecutor ' s Office has challenged the decision of the Kalinen Court of Tumeni, which ended the criminal case against a local resident in whom the child was killed by HIV.
According to the investigation, the child died because his mother was a HIV dissident and refused treatment.
However, the court released her from responsibility for reconciliation with the injured father.
The Prosecutor ' s Office believes that the crime cannot be left unpunished so as not to create a precedent for other HIV dissidents.
The case concerning the resident of Tumeni was initiated under article 109 of the RF (cause of death by insecurity) in April after her three-year-old daughter died from HIV 4B infection.
According to the prosecutor's office, the mother herself is HIV-infected.
“The woman did not treat herself and refused to treat her daughter, assuming that there was no HIV infection”, explained the Thumeni District Prosecutor.
The criminal case was brought to the Kaliningrad Court in Thumenia, which decided on 25 July to terminate it.
The request was made by the deceased girl's father, explaining that “he forgave the woman, she had no claim, she had done harm and apologized”.
The Prosecutor ' s Office of the Court of First Instance rejected the decision and appealed that the decision to terminate the case should be annulled and referred to the Court for a new consideration.
The girl died, and it's impossible to starve the crime of harm.
The HIV-infected mother, in contrast to the doctor's recommendations, refused to examine the baby and treat her with dangerous infection," the prosecutor's office reported.
In the view of the supervisory authority, she should be punished, otherwise her example would be followed by other HIV dissidents.
As told by the Tumen Center for AIDS, about 12 children with HIV now in the Tumen area do not receive medical care because of their parents ' refusal.
"And this situation has already improved - during the year of the work of the special group, half of the parents who categorically refused to treat children from HIV have changed their view - have allowed diagnosis, have become a drug dealer," said the press secretary of the Centre for AIDS Elena Loseva.
According to her, it was not possible to influence parents in legislation, and not all HIV-infected children were able to be detected; mothers were unable to investigate, hide, and escape from hospitals.
What are the dangers of HIV dissidents?
At the end of last year, the Petersburg sociologists presented the results of the first so-called dissident movement study in Russia.
HIV dissidents call people who deny the existence of HIV and refuse to take drugs.
Doctors and AIDS-servicing NGO activists call such views anti-medicine and see a serious threat to their circulation.
The yellow photo session, which ended in tragedy, took place on Thursday, August 3, at the Greek railway station in Hmelnick.
The merry company of the young people who had rowed across the railways, where the freight train was just standing.
One of the friends had an idea to make an effective self on the roof of the wagon, reported the FACTAM in the police communications sector in the Helmet area.
The guy started coming down from the bridge to the train, but because of his inattentiveness he got stuck behind the electric transmission line and was instantly hit by the current.
Fortunately, this case became known to the station dispatcher, who immediately caused an emergency.
Prior to the arrival of the victim's doctor, they moved to a safe place and then hospitalized in the fire department of the Kmelnic Regional Clinical Hospital.
Men have detected fires of 1 to 2 degrees.
His condition is now assessed as stable.
Law-enforcement officials point out that in recent times, there has been an increasing popularity of extreme self-reliance on the roofs of multi-satellite bridges, bridges that are moving.
The police urged people to be vigilant and not to allow such photos, especially among children and adolescents.
Scientists have allowed the existence of oceans in ancient Venus
In ancient Venus, there could have been oceans.
This is what French scientists have suggested.
Experts have created a computer model that demonstrated the water education process on the surface of the planet, says Science News.
It was found that in Venus, at the beginning of its history, there were oceans where there were 10 per cent more water than there are now on Earth.
Previously, the Sunday Arguments said that according to scientists' hypothesis, the ocean could have existed 4 billion years ago on Mars.
Foreign experts in their research concluded that the water facility was located on the northern hemisphere of the Red Planet.
Three people were wounded as a result of the shooting in the park in San Francisco
Three people were injured in San Francisco as a result of the shooting, transmitted by the Associated Press.
The incident occurred in Dolores Park when there were a large number of visitors.
According to the witnesses, several men on the bridge began shouting threats.
One of them fired a gun and started shooting at people.
The appearance of the evildoers could not be considered, since they had everything but eyes.
Another was provided medical care, after which he was released.
The third injured is a minor, no details of his condition.
The Dolores Park hill is a popular place among locals and tourists.
On 1 July, at least 17 people were injured during a night shooting in Little Rock, Arkansas.
Several more visitors were injured trying to leave the room.

The Louna Rock Group concert will take place in Barnaul on 17 October.
The musicians will present their new album "Wonderful New World", which has become one of the most anticipated releases of the year.
The collective prepares a conceptual show that will become the brightest in the concert history of the group.

The Gypsies overwhelmed and returned to “Million Street”
Some of the most populous settlers in the West Midlands once again conflict with the determined Roma who have been overcrowded by the local authorities to reoccur with their homes.
The Gypsies parked 20 houses on the railways in a field bordering the rich Solihalla street, which was called the 'millionaire street'.
Bringing with them horses, young men and many homes on wheels, they returned after they had been driven no further than in May, and they did not interfere with the robbery of the municipal authorities to prevent their invasion.
This tactical company found a break in the defence facilities and pushed its vehicles through areas that had left unprotected to leave a trap.
The disbanded residents attacked the municipality of Solihalla, saying that he was “incapacitated to solve the problem”.
An anonymous resident said, “They came here on the night of the first day of the month, after they had been driven from the town of Beth-hit, where they used to dig rocks.”
The municipality should be horrified and forced to act because it was totally unable to solve the problem.
The gypsies were here in May, they were chased, and here they are again.
Last night more gypsies arrived, and today perhaps more.
“The Birmingham Municipality knows how to solve this problem, they get long-term court orders to protect their parks,” she added.
I live on Streetsbrook Road, and I don't like to keep paying municipal taxes, and the municipality can't even put an end to this."
And a resident of the city who wished to remain anonymous said, “This is funny – we just saw these gypsies go away the previous time, and this is what is happening.”
This time they have increased, and we have seen how the horses fall on their sides.
The representative of the municipality of Solihalla said: “We know of an illegal camp on the ground next to Streetbrook Road and we are working with the Solihalla police; we are taking the necessary legal action to prosecute them as soon as possible.”
In order to help us collect the evidence, it is very important that locals report as much as possible any anti-social or criminal conduct to the police on phone 101.
This makes it possible to make an opinion on the situation that will be dealt with by the court when we present our case to them.
"New World" is the wine industry of the champagne industry.
The Government of the Republic of Crimea decided to take action by converting the Government of the Republic of Crimea to the OAO, the Minister of Property and Land Relations of Crimea Anna Anuhina.
100% of the company's shares will remain in Crimea.
The statutory capital of the stock company will be 595.5 million rubles and will consist of 5,955 million ordinary shares at the nominal value of 100 rubles each.
The Ministry of Agriculture of Crimea stated that if there were no funds to modernize the plant for the next three years, there would be a threat of stopping the plant.
Substantive exports to enterprises amounted to around 60-70 per cent.
The enterprise needs 1.2 billion rubles to be modernized, and due to its organizational and legal nature, it is obliged to pay 50 per cent of its income in the budget.
What remains is not enough to implement the modernization plan.
"Getting money from the owner is a problem, talking about attracting loan funds from large credit organizations hard," said Minselhos Krim Sergey Petlin in April of this year.
Parliament of Crimea included the company in the 2017 privatisation forecast.
It was proposed that it be held and placed on the market.
The source of Interface in Crimea authorities estimated the potential value of the company's sale of $40 million, and the investor's investment in modernization was still $30 million.
The New World in 2016 increased the production of juridical wines by 2.8 per cent compared to 2015 to 1.52 million bottles.
In 2017, the New World was about to release 1.6 million bottles.
The company was founded in 1878 by Prince Lev Golicin as a winemaking plant in the name of the New World acquired by him.
The plant is located on 11 hectares of land.
Lower-city third-class digs more than 40 graves
GU MVD personnel in the Lower City area have identified individuals who have destroyed 46 graves in the city of Liskovo.
A third - grade student was a criminal.
The first statement that the burial plots were damaged by the unknown occurred in Russia ' s OMVD on the Liskovsk region on 27 June.
In all this, 24 people were contacted by the police.
As a result, a criminal case was initiated under article 244 of the RF “Distortion, Damage or Degradation of burial sites”.
As a result, the police found suspects and two schoolchildren aged 8 and 9 were found.
Juvenile offenders told the police that they were interested in seeing how the memorials fell, and that led them to hooligan acts.
Preventive activities have been carried out with children and their parents.
Italy is tightening the tone for NGOs that save migrants.
Italy warned NGOs belonging to the Mediterranean rescue courts that they would not be able to continue their work unless they were subject to new rules governing their activities.
"If NGOs do not comply with the new code of conduct, it is difficult to say if they can continue their activities," said the Minister of the Interior Mario Minnita in an interview with the Tourism Daily newspaper Stampa.
The warning was issued the following day after the Italian authorities confiscated a ship belonging to the German humanitarian organization Jugend Reettet, suspected that his crew was actually cooperating with human traffickers and facilitating illegal immigration.
The humanitarian organization, which has been working all year round, has refused to comment on the substance of the detailed charges brought against it by the Italian prosecutor Ambrojo Cartosio.
"For us, salvation of human life is and will remain a top priority, so we are very sorry that we cannot continue our activities in the search and rescue zone right now," says a statement by the organization in the neighbourhood.
"We will be able to assess all the charges now filed only after we have collected all the information and are able to assess the situation."
The Italian authorities have been following Jugend Rett's ship since October.
His crew was suspected of taking all the lifeboats on board migrants who were sent directly to them by traffickers and allowing smugglers to leave with boats they could use again.
At least one such meeting was supposed to have taken place at least 1.3 miles from the Libyan coast, as was stated in the indictments published in the Italian media.
The crew is suspected of violating the requirements of the Italian coastal authorities that control rescue operations in this area rather than for any other reason.
The Code of Conduct assumes, mainly, that the Juventa courts will have on board an Italian police officer who will monitor their activities.
While only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations agreed to comply with the Code: Save Children, Maltese MOAS and Pro-Activa Expanded Commitments from Spain.
The last said on Thursday that the new rules were unnecessary but acceptable, provided they did not involve any “significant changes or confusion” in its rescue operations.
Among those who refused to sign are those who received the Nobel Prize for Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Meanwhile, Minniti said that the sharp decline in the number of migrants arriving in Italy as a result of rescue operations indicated that efforts to support Libyan coastal security and cooperation with local mayors bore fruit.
"In the last days we've started to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the Minister.
He reported on the plans for further negotiations with Libyan mayors on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
"In Libya we don't want to associate with either side of the conflict"
The authorities of the RF have recently significantly increased their policies in the Libyan direction, and with visits to Moscow, delegations of the opposing Libyan parties have been frequented.
The Head of the Russian Contact Group on Internal Settlement at MIDR and Gosmund, the Assistant Head of the Chechen Republic, Lev Dengov, told "U", what was the objective of Moscow in the region and on which it made the stake.
The contact group on Libya, which you lead, is almost unknown.
Let's say the contact group in Ukraine knows everything about her.
And here's the secret curtain.
What exactly are you doing? What are your goals?
The Contact Group was established on the initiative of the IDF and the State.
Its activities are headed by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Michael Bogdanov and Adam Delimhanov (Deputy of the Duma of Chechnya. - "U").
The latter is authorized to work in the Lebanese direction by Speaker Gosduma Vácheslav Volodin.
In September 2015, there were 11 people on board.
We've been thinking about how to help the crew.
At that time, a contact group was established from military specialists, representatives of Gosmunda, supported our work by Chechnya Ramzan Kadiro.
And how did you manage to lead her?
Since I have been working in Libya since 2008, I have been asked to lead the group.
Our activities were not limited to the release of sailors from Mechanika Cebotareva.
We have been able to establish contacts with representatives of all major groups opposed to each other in the Libyan conflict - and by Tripoli (where the recognized UN Government is based in the head of Faiz Saradzem. - "U") and with Tobruk (a parliamentary residence that opposes the Government and supports Marshal Halif Haftar, who controls the eastern regions of Libya. - "U").
Thanks to the active participation of Ahmed Metig (the Deputy Prime Minister of Libya, "U"), we were able to quickly agree on the release of Russian sailors.
It was then decided to make more effective use of these contacts, establish a contact group.
Its task is to analyse the situation, identify key factors and players, dialogue with all parties to the conflict.
I would like to emphasize that in Libya we do not want to associate with any of the parties to the conflict, we engage in dialogue with all.
How many are in the contact group, and how many are in Libya?
There are now five people in the contact group.
Among them are those who have experience in active structures, including the Ministry of Defence.
We also wish to include a group of regional experts, representatives of the Middle East Institute of RAN.
There are no permanent staff in Libya, which has not yet been necessary.
Are there Russian military advisers in Libya now, instructors?
And if so, on whose side?
There are no Russian military specialists in Libya.
All discussions and publications on this matter are not valid.
But your contact group includes ex-military...
Yes, and their presence is necessary.
For example, when we visit hot spots.
Or those closed to a certain point for us in the city, such as Misurata (where militias are based on the role played by Libyan leader Muammar Kaddafi in 2011 and significantly increased in the following years. "U").
We arrived in Missouri in January of this year.
We were scared, they said there were Islamists, terrorists.
But it was important for us to assess the situation itself, analyze the actual military potential that is responsible for why such rumors as they are actually the role of Islamists.
In Missouri, we met with all the team members who were involved in the destruction of the IG in Sirte (in December 2016 this city on the Mediterranean coast was defeated by soldiers banned in Russia by the Islamic State, U).
We wanted to see them get acquainted with these people, to verify that they had played a crucial role in the destruction of the IG in Libya, not Khalif Haftar, who had attributed himself to these merits.
And what is your conclusion?
"Islamic State" in Libya won not Haftar?
That's not what he did.
Haftar was operating on another front in Benghazi.
And with IG in Sirte, there were structures that were subordinated to the Government in Tripoli.
And by the way, we have invited Russians to conduct this anti-terrorist operation.
And they came - the visit was extended from 19 to 23 April this year, and the Libyan delegation was accepted by the Council of the Federation, the Duma, the MIDI and the Rosgardia.
You are, as we have understood, living in all the regions of Libya and are likely to represent the moods of local elites and field commanders.
Do you think the ceasefire agreements, the elections reached at the end of July in Paris, Khalif Haftar and Faiz Saradz will be implemented?
Or, again, as has happened many times in the past, agreements will be disrupted, hostilities will be resumed, parties will try to take power unilaterally?
For us, it has already become a good signal that Saradz and Haftar agreed to a regular meeting, not long ago it was impossible.
In the recent past, both leaders have been extremely negative about each other.
And as for the position of Russia...
They often write and say that Moscow actively supports Haftara, many believe in it.
We faced this situation when they were in Missouri, and Haftar was aboard the Russian airline Admiral Kuznetz that very day.
It was a coincidence.
But they didn't believe in Missouri by coincidence.
They said to us, "You are probably very brave people who have come to us today."
But our task is to show that we do not only support Haftar, we engage in dialogue with all key parties to the conflict in Libya.
You and Haftar were in touch.
Does understanding with Russian partners at the human, emotional and emotional level facilitate the fact that he studied twice in the USSR?
And, by the way, does Haftar know Russian?
He's Russian if he knows, it's very relative.
But what we learned from him, of course, makes it easier for us to have a dialogue with him.
And among other things, he's not the only one.
When we communicate with the troops in Tripoli and Missouri, we meet the generals who have learned either in Russia or in the Soviet Union.
And here's what they're talking about in Russian.
And they're drawn to Russia, and they're kind of experiencing nostalgia on it.
Do you consider the likely early abolition of the arms embargo imposed on Libya?
Are your Libyan allies interested in the supply of Russian weapons?
They are interested, of course, but, as I have already said, we do not engage in this conflict on the one hand and do not want to arm each other to the detriment of each other.
We would like everyone to be around the same position.
With regard to the arms embargo, the Libyans are constantly calling for Russia to take it off somehow.
The constitutional process is now being actively promoted in Libya.
We hope that the parties will make compromise decisions and achieve internal consensus.
Then the elections must take place, as was the case at the meeting of Saradja and Haftar.
If elections take place and the legitimate authority is finally elected (and none of the parties now have such status), the issue of the removal of the arms embargo can be raised in the United Nations.
To raise this issue now pointlessly and dangerously will only lead to the escalation of the conflict.
During the days of the media, information has been received that Italy, faced with the problem of African refugees from Libya, feels abandoned to the fate of EU allies.
Can Moscow help the Italian partners in this situation by using their relations with the Libyans?
How realistic, for example, is it that Haftara teams will control the coast and put an end to the smuggling business of immigrants to Europe?
Very timely.
We're working on it.
The Italians need Russia ' s support because Moscow is engaged in dialogue with Haftar, with Saradz and with Missouri and with the South.
In this regard, the tribes in southern Libya play a major role, and they are ready to cooperate with Russia.
Is it about the South to cut the flows of migrants on the far-off?
So, I mean, did they just roll back the buses where Nigerian migrants are going?
We're doing it.
But it's not just that.
Some clans and groups are interested in the continued flow of these flows.
We hope to enable the South to join in the negotiation process between Saradez, Haftar and the tribes in the south.
But for the first time, we would like to see the unity of views on this issue between Haft and Saradze.
The head of the Government in Tripoli, Faiz Saraj, is considered an Islamist, a proponent of the introduction of Sharia norms into the country.
How radical are his views?
Would this not be an obstacle in establishing relations with Russia or the West?
I'll tell you my personal opinion of him.
In my view, he, on the contrary, is an opponent of radical Islam.
But there are Islamists in his coalition.
Yes, but he himself held the position that Libya should be an absolutely normal country -- a moderately Islamic, open world.
And he is also actively fighting terrorists.
How did he get that reputation?
It was created by those countries that were not interested in Russia communicating with Tripoli.
Tripoli is a capital, there is legislative, executive and judicial authority.
There is a national oil corporation, a national bank and other public bodies.
Of course, some countries were concerned that we should not go there.
And we've got them all mixed up and started having an active relationship with Tripoli and Tobruk.
And we are reaping the fruit of this work: Rosneft concluded an agreement on cooperation with the State oil company of Libya - NOC.
Director of the NOC Mustafa Sanalla, with whom head Rosnefti Igor Sechin made a deal, directly from Tripoli.
And two weeks ago, the first shipment of Libyan oil from Rosneft was made.
What will Russia do with her?
I think I'm gonna resell it.
What other economic interests do Russia have in Libya?
Plans to re-subscribe contracts with Muammar Caddafi.
These include earlier transport arrangements (railway construction), energy (electricization) and a number of others.
Do the Libyans have anything to pay?
Well, they have oil.
That's what it's like with Iran about the oil exchange scheme?
I don't know what the plan will be, I don't deal with these issues directly.
Indeed, the economy for Russia in Libya is not the main one.
We're actually doing peace work there.
For us, the main thing is to stop bloodshed, help the Libyans to agree on each other so that they can establish their own order, and Libya has ceased to be an environment conducive to the development of terrorism.
For Russia, this is the main task of helping the Libyan people and of expelling terrorists from there.
Do you have any information on the presence in Libya (now or before) of radical fighters from Russia or other countries of the former USSR?
One of the tasks of our contact group was to clarify this.
I met with the representative of the Libyan Security Committee, who said that there was no Russian and other countries of the former USSR to this day.
He said he had about 50,000 phone records of Islamic and radical groups (in Libya. - "U") and the Russian language did not sound there.
Then which States are these fighters?
I would not like to go into this detail.
Then let's form the question differently.
How many of the Muslim fighters in Libya are the Libyans themselves?
There are virtually no Libyans, no more than 5% of them.
The rest will come.
Can Moscow conduct internal negotiations on Paris?
There are plans.
We are conducting active negotiations with the Libyans, several delegations from Libya have already visited Moscow, and we have expressed our willingness to come to Moscow or to the Grozny.
When can such negotiations take place?
Now it's hard to say.
A few more visits have yet to take place, and then I hope there will be clarity about the time and venue of the negotiations.
In the Czech Museum, the charity collects money for a dear gift to a sick boy
A nine-year-old boy, Sasha Macola, who has a brain hydrocephaly and complete blindness, will receive a gift on August 5th.
The useful presenter will be Saše Minister of Culture of the Moscow Region of Oxana Kosareva and director of the Konstantin Bobkov Museum.
The money for the coach was collected during the charity marathon “Don’t Stop Doing Good”, which took place in Melichova on July 15 in the Czech Memorial Day.
Previously, a marathon was received from Sashi, who lives in the village of Manushino in the Czech Republic, and wrote, "I don't see any eyes, so I asked my mother to write this letter."
"I'd love to get a runway in the gift so my legs could be strong, and I'd feel like I'd learn to walk."
And this is Sachin's dream!
After being handed over to the museum, the Concert-Postscriptum will be a famous pianist who deserves Russian artist Alexander Gindin to fill the dusts of popular classics.
During the charitable marathon in Melihov, the choir of the Vozné David Desert, the belligerent of the master Eli Drozdihin, students of the Moscow Conservatory of the name of P.I. Czech and Russian Academy of the Names of Gnesins, the artist of the Melihov Theatre of the Czech Studio.
For visitors, auctions were held, book fairs were organized and sale of souvenir products with a marafone logo.
The Melikovo Museum has taken the initiative to make the Memorial of the Czech Republic 15 July a one-day charity day in all the museums of Podmovsky.
A 30-year-old resident of Olevska Gjitomir near the local football stadium shot several times at the young people who were there.
According to the suspect, he was upset by the noise, reported to the FACTAM in the communications department of the Police in the area of Gitimir.
After that, the man entered the nearby coffeehouse.
There was a conflict in the building, during which a man used the device to shoot with rifles, wounding one of the visitors.
The 34-year-old is provided with the necessary medical care and there is no threat to his life.
Police and emergency medical assistance arrived at the scene, but the shooter was hidden by that time.
The law enforcement officers established his identity and detained him on the same day as 2 August.
The man could not explain his actions.
He's got a device to shoot the resin pools that was sent to the experiment.
According to this fact, the criminal proceedings under article 296 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine have been initiated.
The detainee is threatened with imprisonment for 3 to 7 years.
In Kiev, on 28 July, a shooting attack occurred in the area of Tatarsky Street.
Michel Carter's sentence for reports of Conrad Roy's suicide
The residents of Massachusetts had been sentenced to two and a half years of imprisonment for having committed suicide by means of text messages and phone calls to their boyfriend Conrad Roy.
Michelle Carter, now 20 years old, will be 15 months behind the grid and another 5 years of trial.
Carter in June was found guilty of the unintended murder of Conrad Roy, who ended up with him on 13 July 2014.
Father Roy said at the hearing on Thursday: "My family was killed up.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to remain free before the appeal.
She was threatened for a maximum of 20 years, but her lawyers said that she and Roy had suffered mental disorders.
Carter, dressed in red blouse and creamy blouse, heard the sentence standing, shaking his hands and taking off his eyes.
"With her actions she killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"She broke his life to improve her.
She didn't recognize responsibility," she said.
"She didn't show a rash."
But lawyer Carter said it was a "tragic case that she deeply regrets."
However, Judge Lawrence Monise said that he felt that her “age, age, or even mental illness had no significant impact on her actions”.
The prosecutor read Roy Lynn Roy's mother's statement, which says, "It's not been a day since I'd been crying for the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and of the way I deal with him - I try to support his sister, despite all the pain that will remain with us forever," he says.
Sister Roy Camdin Roy said that she was being relentlessly harassed by the idea that she would never be able to attend his wedding or become his children's aunts.
"The man who has always been with me since my birth is the pain that will remain with me for the rest of his life," she said.
This case would appear to be a legal precedent because there was no law in Massachusetts that would provide for the responsibility for the advice of a person to commit suicide.
In 2014, when Roy was found in a car with symptoms of carbon dioxide poisoning, Carter was 17 years old.
The case was brought to the attention of the whole country when it became known that it had been forced to commit suicide by Carter's message.
"You can hang yourself, hang yourself from the roof, stab yourself with a knife I don't know how many ways," she wrote in a few messages sent two weeks before his death when he was resting with his family.
In a few minutes before she killed herself, she wrote, "You have to do this, Conrad," and "You just need to turn on the fire, and you're gonna be free and happy."
Judge Monice said that Carter wanted to get attention through Roy's death and banned her from communicating with the press so that she could not get what she wanted.
The views of the lawyers on this matter have been divided.
One of the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 of murdering her British neighbour in Italy two years later.
Ninety-year-old Nox published her special opinion in Los Angeles Times, which stated: "Michel Carter deserves sympathy and help, not prison."
Evgen Godchev: "I let Langford go like a high-flight bird."
One of the best basketball players at the UTB's 33-year-old Kit Langford League left UNIX.
The withdrawal of the U.S. Secretary-General of the News commented on the statement by President Evgeny Bogchev.
Kitt made this decision on family circumstances, said Evgeni Godchev.
He's got a little kid, a woman who didn't want to move to Kazan.
Kit wants to be closer to home.
I decided to see him.
Of course, I could have said no and extended his contract, but he deserved a different relationship.
He played three seasons in UNIX and in each match he showed a high level, which was 100%.
That's why I let him go like a high-flight bird.
We thanked him.
We want him to succeed in his family life and in his career.
Keith Langford won a three-year stake at the Chinese club and won the Silver One League 2015/16.
In the 2016/17 season, he won the most successful Eurology season game.
He scored 21.75 points on average for the match.
This result has been the second since 2004 when this award was established.
Langford, who also won the prize in 2014, became the second player in the history of Eurolica, who won the prize more than once.
In the near future, Langford will sign a contract with Chinese Shenchen, reports Eurohops.
An American is expected to enter into a two-year contract of $5 million.
Langford will be the second European star in July to become a Chinese championship.
Previously, the Chinese CBA moved to the former Pantinaicos Center, Jannis Burrus.
The sun-burning tourist from Podmoskovya evacuated with a helicopter in Adige

Audi is expected to modify up to 850,000 diesel cars
During the day prior to the announcement by Audi, BMW stated that they would propose updating the software to more than 350,000 cars.
The president of BMW said that the company believed that there were “more intelligent ways than driving restrictions”, meaning European cities, including Munich, where BMW was located, which considered the possibility of banning or limiting the use of diesel vehicles.
Daimler said on Thursday that he modified three million Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce their diesel emissions.
None of the companies have called their step back.
European car manufacturers have actively promoted the use of diesel cars in Europe and the United States to facilitate compliance with the rules on carbon dioxide emissions.
But nitrogen oxides that release diesel engines are considered carcinogenic and can cause asthma.
The cost of installing equipment that neutralizes diesel exhaust gases is also increasing and maintaining a competitive price for cars is becoming difficult.
While German car manufacturers are under close attention, the Government of Chancellor Angela Merkel has also accused it of subjugating influential car manufacturers and ignoring the signs of the problem.
The companies are trying not to repeat the errors of Folkswagen, which concealed the use of so-called defeat devices, which during the test could have been able to control the number of emissions of harmful gases to comply with the rules and under normal management.
In the United States, several leaders of Folkswagen were convicted, the others being prosecuted on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, in Germany, the former head of the thermodynamics unit was arrested in the Audi engine development group.
Former manager, Zacqueo Giovanni Pamio, Italian, and therefore not protected from extradition and may appear before a court in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi came under a German criminal investigation involving Folkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of setting up the system for the purpose of circumvention of European emission rules and expanded the investigation that had previously focused on the United States.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation may create serious problems for Folkswagen: the producer of elite cars is a disproportionately high share of Folkswagen's income.
In Astrakhan, the coffee visitor was paid by fake money
The police had received a report from the bank's staff on the recalculation of the money received from the general survey by a suspicious buyer with a nominal of 5,000 rubles.
The study conducted at the Expert Criminalist Centre has shown that it is false.
According to Russia ' s Austrahan region, the banknote was paid by one of the coffee-buying visitors.
It should be noted that the case has not been equipped with an instrument to determine the authenticity of the buyer.
Police are currently establishing individuals involved in the manufacture and sale of a CF CB ticket.
Such crimes are punishable by imprisonment for up to 8 years with a fine of up to 1 million rubles.
The Regional Office of the IMF encourages the inhabitants of the Astrakhan region to be careful in financial operations; it is recommended that trade facilities be set up to verify the authenticity of the funds received.
Astronomers have found an "adsk" planet on which even iron can swim.
For the first time, when we studied the properties of the planet's giant stratosphere called WASP-121b, astrophysics were greatly surprised at its temperature, which was able to evaporate iron and other metals.
Experts have noted that water molecules are so heated by the light of the star that they release infrared radiation.
Hubble's telescope printed a blue water molecule on this gas giant: it's a high temperature that forces water into the planet's atmosphere to light up in the infrared range.
WASP-121(b) refers to the so-called "burning yupiters" - gas giants, in size and mass, comparable to the largest planet of the solar system, but located ten times closer to the parental star.
This year, only 1.3 "earth" days will last on the exhibit, and its gas envelope will reach almost 2,500 degrees Celsius.
Climate change threatens lavage in Provence.
It has become a symbol of Provence and South France, but now there is a fear that climate change threatens it.
Lavanda has grown worse as a result of drought and infectious diseases; this has caused the constant pain of scientists and farmers who are trying to find a solution.
Eric Shes, an expert from the Provence Agricultural Research Institute CRIEPPAM, said: "Lavanda in Provence is indeed under threat because in recent years this plant has experienced the effects of climate change: the spring and especially the autumn of the rain has been much smaller.
This affects the life of the lavender.
And there are still small cicadas on the leaves of insects carrying microbacterials; in very dry weather they become very much."
There's a lot on the map.
Lavanda not only attracts vacationers; lavender oil is very spicy in perfumery and cosmetology.
Eric Shes says, "Instead of very long wheels with a lot of big colors, we have small, undeveloped, weakened or not at all.
That's why we've got less parts containing aerobic oil."
The decisions currently under consideration include improving the distribution of water and slowing the evaporation from the soil, as well as spraying plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the extraction of more dry-resistant varieties.
Ambassador of the Winter University-2019 met with the Red Schoolers
A double world hockey champion, Ambassador of Winter University-2019 Alexander Semin met early with the kick-starters and gave autographs to the sick.
The meeting took place in the Winter University-2019 tent as part of the theme week on chess with chess.

"Hello, there's such a place in Krasnoyarsk as the Winter University 2019 tent, where starters can directly ask team coaches," said the champion.
It is noteworthy that the messengers of the Winter University of 1919 helped to promote student sport and a healthy lifestyle among reds.
The University Charter will be working throughout the summer season until 25 September, reports the Winter University-2019 Press Department.
Medvedev’s comments were made in Mr.
The U.S. Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev's official representative Hizer Nauert, commenting in his briefing on the words of Prime Minister Dmitria Medvedev, said that there was a need to find “areas for interaction” with Russia.
She said that such areas should be found to “improve bilateral interaction”.
As an example of such successful cooperation, Nauert referred to the peace agreement on Syria.
We're two nuclear superpowers.
"And people around the world agree that the United States and Russia should be able to work together," said the diplomat.
However, Nauert refused to comment on Medvedev ' s claim that Russia and the United States were engaged in a war of war.
"If Russia said so, then she certainly has the right to speak, but more on this subject I can't say anything," said the representative of Mr.
Former U.S. President Donald Trump signed a draft law on the tightening of sanctions against the Russian Federation.
Commenting on the new package of sanctions, the head of the Government of RF Medvedev said that Washington had declared Moscow a full trade war, with the hope of improving bilateral relations.
Medvedev also stated that US sanctions would be effective for decades.
In addition, it is the Prime Minister's view that the American establishment "purely won" Trump.
A missing bodybuilder in Sub-Moscow found a missing memory on a foreign décor
Bodibuilder Shamil Hanmetov went off the road in Noginsk on 25 July under very pickup conditions: he left the car room to get into the toilet.
Seven days it was unsuccessfully sought out by familiar and local residents.
And Shamil was found on a foreign daughter in Ramensk.
He was found naked in his master's toilet.
The Dagestan athlete couldn't explain how it happened here and what happened to him.
He couldn't even remember what his name was, and his passport was gone.
The identification of the person helped the announcements of his failure.
The doctors on the outside recorded a partial memory loss and brain injury in Hanmetov, reported the public of Mash.
The athletes are probably waiting for other surprises.
The abusers who captured Shamil may have already been in his apartment, the keys from which he was also stolen.
Gas revenues in July exceeded forecast by 7.4 billion rubles
In fact, the oil revenues received as a result of July 2017 amounted to over 7.4 billion rubles, reports the Ministry of Finance.
The excess, as explained by the department, was mainly due to a higher exchange rate of US$ to rubble compared to the average monthly value of June used for the assessment, as well as to exceed the actual volume of gas production and the volume of oil exports of the projected levels.
“Reduction of federal oil budget revenues from the monthly assessment under the Federal Budget Act 2017-2019 is projected to be +40.2 billion rubs in August 2017,” said Minfin.
Thus, the total amount of funds allocated to the purchase of foreign currency in the domestic currency market from 7 August to 6 September 2017 is 47.6 billion rubles.
Accordingly, the daily purchase of foreign currency is equivalent to 2.07 billion rubles.
The Bank of Russia will be involved in foreign exchange purchases by Minfin Russia.
Every working day during that period, the CB will enter into foreign exchange purchases at the organized trades of the Moscow Stock Exchange evenly during the trading day.
The acquired foreign currency will be recorded in the Federal Treasury account in the Central Bank.
The murder of a journalist emphasizes that Mexico is becoming increasingly dangerous.
Members of the weekly newspaper Riyadh usually meet in the environment to discuss plans to address recent violent crimes in the state of Sinaloa related to organized crime, corruption by officials or continuing war-related drug addicts.
But today, as a result of their own tragedy, they met to talk about security.
They were told that they had to change their habits.
Two senior journalists discussed what seemed to be safer: taking children with them to the office where they had already dropped a grenade in 2009 or leaving their home.
Security experts have written three words on the table in the room: enemies, neutrals, allies.
They asked journalists to name names for each column - no evidence needed, suspicions and internal feelings would be sufficient.
These are drug dealers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of being held by government or cartels, a whole list of fugitives, which makes Mexico's work a dangerous disaster.
Violence does not give rise, and among the troops that are multiplying in the country, more and more journalists: according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, at least 25 since President Enrico Pena Njeto took his office in December 2012, 589 people were under federal protection after attacks and threats; and at least seven people were killed in seven states this year.
Among the last are their publisher and inspiration, co-founder "Riodos" Javier Valdes Cardenas.
"The only big mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Waldès wrote in one of his many books on drug-related violent crimes.
His absence is very intense, although his presence is widespread - the large photo of Valdez showing the middle finger, with the inscription "Justice" hanging on the facade of the building "Riodos"; two reporters in 30 years, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, bear his smile, face in his eyes or his corporate Panama.
The seminar takes place less than two months after his death; journalists discuss their common trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, and paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor ' s office was organized in 2010 to investigate journalists ' cases, only two cases were investigated, according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists.
As with most of the deaths committed every year, thousands of drug trafficking and organized crime are rarely reported by journalists.
Journalists of Rios insist that they will write about the violence in Sinaloa, although they have been killed in the mountains, although around now much more dangerous.
Without information about murderers, without justice from security talks at meetings of little benefit, Ibarra says.
"It's very stupid to spend time at this seminar," he says.
"Until we know the reason, we suspect everyone."
On the morning of May 15, Valdes left the Riodos office in the capital of the state of Kuliakan.
He was able to travel only a few quarters before two men stopped his red Toyota King; pulled him out of the car and shot him 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper, which means "Twelfth River."
The shooter went to his car and smashed it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He's got a wife and two adult children.
Listening usually runs fast on Kuliakan.
But it's almost all about Valdès.
Since Guzman was arrested and issued in the United States in January last year, Sinaloa has become one of the most bloody battlefields in the country, since competing factions are fighting to fill the educated vacuum.
We will not talk about killing one or more people every day on the streets of Sinaloa, or that the yard is filled with beautiful two-edged drug queens who are more than home to many living people.
Let's forget for a minute that the state of "satisfaction" is just when one of the cartels takes control of the state of the sea with important ports and the ways of drug trafficking in the United States.
Despite this and the fact that Valdès was well aware of the dangers of his work, Ishmael Bohorques, 60-year-old co-founder and director of Riyadh, was overwhelmed by the guilt that he could not protect another.
He thinks two mistakes have helped the killer.
First, an interview with Damaso Lopes, leader of one of the rival cartel factions, was published in February with the sons of Guzman.
The publication may have upset the sons; people who were allegedly members of the gang have collected all copies as soon as they were delivered to the kiosk.
The second mistake was that he did not force Waldès to leave the country for his own safety after another newspaper that wrote about the same story had been captured.
Waldès was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder was seen as a regular milestone in the development of violence against journalists in Mexico.
He was so far away from danger, his friends and colleagues thought he would always be.
He was an experienced reporter at Noroeste, and in 2003 he and five colleagues founded Riyadh, selling his 50-dollar shares.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to deal with journalism without touching the subject of drugs," said Bohorkes.
In time, the newspaper earned a reputation for bold and honest publishing, sales, and advertising.
Journalists liked that they could publish bold reports, not fear of censorship, but encouraged readers to read in this publication what no one else dared to write.
Eight years after his foundation "Riodos", she received the prestigious Maria Murs Cabo award for reporting work in Latin America.
That same year, Waldès won the International Press Freedom Prize for Courage in an investigation into Mexico ' s drug trafficking wherever it was headed.
He openly admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said at the CPJ prize.
The drug trade in Sinaloa is "this kind of life," he said last October in an interview with Rompevinto TV.
"You're supposed to take on the tasks that lie on you as a journalist or you're just messing around."
I don't want to be asked, "What did you do when there were so many deaths... why didn't you tell me what was going on?"
The officials of the "Riodos" are bored by Valdes, a bootlegger who was praying, as a trucker in the port, the other, generous for engagements and advice, the teacher who knew how to fit in with the living.
They relied on their own order.
He was always supposed to wear his hat.
He was supposed to go to El Guayabo, bar opposite the office, and always sit there behind the same chair.
Now they ask: Has his love for unity been lost?
His death made them doubt their calculations of how best to do their work and stay alive.
"They don't like it when you understand their wives, children, their legal business and underground airports for drug trafficking.
"These things were in the dark," said Bohorkes.
As a result, even at best, there was a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
You have to trust your instincts.
Keep away from bad smells.
The problem, says editor "Riodos" Andres Villareal, is that "it's possible to deceive... and then what happens to Javier."
The old rules, he and others said, no longer work in Sinaloa - as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, where there is a poisonous mix of profitable smuggling routes, weak government institutions and corrupt officials.
Landshaft is changing all the time.
In the room where the staff of Rios gathered for security training, hundreds of phones were suddenly banned: a few days earlier it was known that spy programs sold exclusively to Governments were used in Mexico to track journalists and social activists.
Two policemen are hiding in the shadow of a 104-degree firehouse (40 degrees Celsius).
They were assigned by the State Government to guard the office of Rios, which is located in a four-storey building in the Kuliakana bourgeois district.
Some reporters asked whether these police officers were among the 50 per cent of the officers who the governor himself said they could not be trusted.
A few months ago, journalists went to a mountain resort that was de facto under the control of drug dealers.
The next issue of the “Riodos ” was based on three main topics.
It's a murder in the Sinaloa brother of the former boxing champion Julio Cézar Chavez.
They still had government expenditures concentrated in the governor ' s hometown.
And there was a group kidnapping in one of the most expensive Kuliacan restaurants in the district of the prosecutor's office.
It was not officially announced who had been kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was needed when it came time to write that everyone in the city knew that it was a favorite restaurant at the same time for drug dealers and authorities.
One of their journalists found out from open databases that the restaurant was registered as a policy of the ruling institutional and revolutionary party (PRI), which dominated at all levels of power during almost the past century.
A recent wave of corruption charges against several PRI governors have been made against them.
Vilarial asked journalists to write about previous incidents at the restaurant, including when the son of El Chapo jumped from the military.
More than a few months ago, readers would have been looking for the Valdes column with the most reliable information on kidnapping.
"We'd already know what happened," says 46-year-old Villareal, for his artistic body called El Flaco.
"Today all channels of communication with our sources are destroyed."
The Waldès Cabinet is now being used as a warehouse for posters and stickers with protests against the killings of journalists, because officers have become what they never thought they would be: activists on behalf of the press.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez took several posters and went to the local prosecutor's office for another journalist the next morning.
El Salvador Adame disappeared in the state of Michoacán in the west three days after Waldès was killed.
They found a burnt body, and the authorities said it was him based on DNA tests.
Throughout the country, journalists began to speak louder, organize protests and write "SOS Press" on the sidewalks and walls of houses.
On that day, Director Bohorkes was in Washington, trying to engage in international support in the demand for justice in the Waldès case.
At a meeting with Governor Sinaloa the next day after the murder of Valdes Ramirez, the authorities accused them of spying on journalists and ordered their killings for telling the truth.
After that, she asked her not to give her more tasks to illuminate the Government ' s activities, fearing that anger would harm her objectivity.
Waldès has said many times that journalists in Mexico are “rounded” by organized crime, its partners in the Government, and the independent society.
In his latest book "Drug Journalists", he wrote that reporters are not just killing gangs of drug traffickers; they are doing so by orders of security politicians and services in connection with organized crime.
The Press Protection Committee, Article 19, considers that half of the attacks on journalists last year were carried out by police and government officials.
"You die in Mexico because they want to shut you up," said Ramirez.
Of course, killings scare people.
Everyone remembers the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Massias six years ago in the northern state of Tamaulipas.
On her body they found a note that was supposed to be written by the person of the Zetas cartel: "I'm here because of my articles."
The computer keyboard and earphones lay next to her head cut off.
Some publications preferred to close up like the newspaper El Norte in the northern state of Chihuahua after her correspondent Miroslav Brich was killed in March.
Others continue to act as El Manjana from Nuevo Laredo after her leader was killed in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Huarez made a public address to drug cartels using the editorial article on the first page entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists left their homeland or even the country.
It's a painful solution.
It is difficult to find work in exile, and they continue to see danger on the streets.
And sometimes they are killed, as it seems, with the photographer Ruben Espinoza, who was killed in 2015 along with four women in a Mexican apartment three months after he fled from Veracruz.
Those who remain and continue to work are balanced between risk decisions on a daily basis.
Ibarra, who once dreamed of being a poet, admits that he was afraid to write about drug trafficking.
"Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a journalist," he says.
Last Friday, at midnight, when the last issue was ready for press, the publishers of Rios sat on the sidewalk next to the office and drank beer when their phones called at the same time.
A series of shootings between opposing gangs and security forces near the resort city of Masatlan left 19 troops behind, as confirmed.
The war continued to burn, as promised in the series of posters found in the area.
Sitting on the sidewalk, they posted news via the mobile phone on the Rios website.
The next day, we had to read the first page.
The sirens have been called near, another shot in the circles.
Bohorques has seen if their police officers are ready to defend.
If they were scared, they wouldn't show it.
Sitting under the huge portrait of the late founder of their newspaper, whose middle finger was exposed to the whole of Sinaloa, the Rios staff continued his case.
"How can you think of closing," said Bohorkes, "if on the very day that Javier was killed, the practitioner asked me to send her to the street to report?"
Dinosaur used camouflage to avoid enemies
At first glance, he looks like an image, even a horrific horror.
The researchers said that the first remains of an incredible substance in the size of the rhino detected by the Canadian miner remained so good that experts called it “Mona Lisa among dinosaurs”.
It was so well preserved that they could even determine that the color of his purple skin was red and brown – and to say that he had, in some way, a “dark past”.
The report published in the journal Contemporary Biology described it as “the only one who remained well from Tireofor for all the history of discoveries and one of the best specimens of dinosaurs in the world”.
It is a recently discovered copy of the nodozavra, which lives in the middle of the mill period, between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
Its incredible good condition has shocked researchers who call it “really remarkable”.
This grassy tyreophor is the most well preserved species in the history of discovery, according to articles in the National Geographic magazine.
He was found by Sean Funk when he worked at the Millenium mine of Sancor near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on 21 March 2011.
He got into something that seemed to be different from the environment, and he decided to take a closer look.
Their discovery was sent to the Royal Tyrellow Paleontological Museum.
For the next six years, there was work to find an animal within the soil with a mass of 2500 ft (1100 kg).
Now that all this hard work has been done, the final result can be demonstrated.
“It’s only easy to get in touch, and it’s almost possible to believe that he is drunk,” said the leading author, Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Paleontological Museum, where he is being established.
“It will be one of the most beautiful and well preserved specimens of dinosaurs – Mona Liza among dinosaurs.”
By studying his skin, the researchers found that it was grassy, although it was covered with pansy and resembled a walking tank, it was apparently at great risk from floating dinosaurs.
This powerful pancier-coated dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators and used a protective technique known as a protective charm that many animals today also enjoy.
This would allow him to merge with the environment more quickly and avoid encounters with enemies, according to experts, assuming that he was being hunted by larger dinosaurs.
This was a significant age of 110 million years for the Nodozav family in May and is now on display at the Royal Tyrellow Paleontological Museum.
Scholars have already studied the animal and named it Borealopelta Markmitcheli in honor of the museum laboratory Mark Mitchell, a group member who spent over 7,000 hours digging it.
The amazing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and the international group of scholars to document the drawing and shape of the shells and pans on his body.
They found a protective decoration, a common method of protection in the kingdom of animals, which means that the upper substance was darker than its lower parts.
Although the protection was well spread, the opening was unexpected, because the size of the Borealopelta dinosaur significantly exceeds the present size of living animals with protection.
It can be assumed that the dinosaur has been so actively hunted by floating dinosaurs that evolution has preferred to mask confrontation as a means of survival.
But most modern animals with protective abrasives, such as oleons, zebras or bronzes, are much smaller and are more accessible, which shows that the nodozavre had to fight seriously for survival.
“The serious threat from predators to the massive, powerful pancers of the dinosaur shows how dangerous were the predators of the Mela period,” said Brown.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in the dinosaur shell also shows that its skin should have been red and brown.
The students continue to study the animal, searching for information about its life, including the contents of its food tract, to find out that it was during its last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, he fell into the river and was taken into the sea, where he sank and back down the bed at the bottom of the ocean.
At that time in Alberta it was as warm as it is now in South Florida, and rivers and oceans probably spread much further into the dryer than they are now.
“This nodozavre is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with the skin that is kept clean, and at the same time it is completely preserved in three dimensions, preserving the original form of the animal,” Brown said.
“As a result, the animal now looks almost the same as it did in the Middle Ages.
There is no need to use the imagination in particular to rebuild it, it is only to be easily shaken, and it is almost possible to believe that it is a question.”
The melodious period is an era when giants, floating dinosaurs, standing on two feet, boarded the Earth.
Although the most remarkable of them, the tiranozav rex, lived millions of years later than Borealopelta, one of his terrible ancestors could be hunted for by the tyreofor.
These include acrocantosar, a monster of 38 feet (11.5 meters) in six tons.
Scholars whose recent openings are published in the journal Modern Biology believe that Borealopelta was introduced into the sea after death and mummified into the sea.
The creature was found by Sean Funk when he worked on the Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on 21 March 2011.
According to museum staff, this is the most well-maintained tyreophore in the world, along with skin and panciers, and it is the goal, from the morse to the thighs.
On average, these substances reached about 18 feet (five meters) in length and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1300 kg).
They were characterized by two twenty-twentieth-inch blades speaking from the shoulders.
The researchers believe that this grassy tyreophore has been hard to believe that it is now Canada until the floodwaters have brought it into the open sea.
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur kept his pancer exactly to the smallest detail.
The stone remains of this particular specimen have been preserved so well that the remains of the skin are still covered by the Bugristian pancreatic plates along the dinosaur skull.
As Michael Fresco wrote in the article for National Geographic magazine, such a level of “rare as you win the lottery. ”
The longer I look at him, the more devastating he seems.
Rocky skin remains have so far covered the bupristian pancreatic plates that sow the animal’s skull.
His right front leg stretched along the side, five fingers on it were turned up.
I can count on his desk."
Mikhail Saakashvili managed to get into Poland without documents
Michael Saakashvili, former head of Georgia and then the Odezian region of Ukraine, flew to Poland.
He did so without documents confirming his identity and nationality.
The arrival of Saakashvili is reported by the Polish newspaper Television Republic, which posted a video on its YouTube channel.
Saakashvili took part in an event in honor of the anniversary of the Warsaw uprising against Hitler's troops in 1944.
Because the politician did not know Polish, although he tried to start speaking in that language, he had to speak English through a Polish translator.
During his speech, the politicians referred to Georgia ' s cooperation with Poland and also talked about Ukraine.
The fact that Ukraine ' s immigration service had deprived its citizenship, the U.S.
As he was able to complete the transatlantic crossing without documents until he knew it.
Former Governor of the Odez Region Michael Saakashvili stated that his signature was signed on a survey to obtain Ukrainian citizenship.
The politician stressed that he had not filled any polls.
Date of the investigation in the case of Weinziher and Olkhovika extended until January
The time limit for the preliminary investigation in the case of the owner of the company's group "Renova" Evgenija Olhovik and the head of the energy holding "T Plus" Boris Wainziher was extended until 2 January 2018.
On Thursday, 3 August, the Bassmann Court considered the extension of the house arrest.
The representative of the SC at the meeting reported on the decision to extend the provisional investigation for the last time.
“The particular complexity and length of the investigation is due to the need for a large number of documents to be seized and tested, as well as the conduct of investigations on the territory of several FF actors”, the investigator said.
He added that the suspects were regularly receiving the Commission ' s direction.
They are estimated to be at least a billion rubles.
According to this investigation, Wainziher, Olhovik, as well as former CEO Michael Slobodin, who led the company Vímpelak until 5 September, transferred to senior officials of the Republic of the Commission the levy for the maximum price for heat and electricity, as well as the establishment of favourable business conditions.
Wainziher and Olhovik were detained, staged in Siktivkar and arrested for two months, Freedom hid from the investigation and was declared a federal investigation.
How did one activist learn the answer to the question “Who are the streets?”
On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to the depths of the soul.
Only the day after arriving in New York as part of a tourist trip to St. Louis, she was sitting on a bed in an apartment rented by Airbnb, watching a Facebook tape on the phone.
She's stuck in someone's high school position.
It was said, "The police have just killed an 18-year-old boy, and he's still lying in the middle of the street."
Noting that no one else in her tape ever borrowed this information from her, she closed her Facebook and opened her Twitter.
She had a lot of user transfers with none @TheePharoah.
Reper from the Greater St. Louis was in real-time light on Michael Brown's death on Twitter, the unarmed black-headed 18-year-old killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He published a photograph of Brown's lifeless body scattered across the street, where it will be for four hours.
"That's wild," thought Ferrell.
But death was nothing new to her and her circle.
She put the phone off, and later in the evening, she came back to tweets about how people are gathering at Canfield Drive.
There were photos of a signal tape and screaming people and people who claimed that he was Brown's father who had a poster saying, "The Ferguson police just killed my son without a gun!"
She saw a direct broadcast as the police officer stood before a group of protesting dogs.
On another video by another cop, she said, "I'll kill you all... animals!"
“It’s a non-standard situation,” Ferrell said.
"This isn't murder like what we used to and we can call typical.
At the time, I felt a lump.
I was angry and cried.
She took a return ticket and flew home the next day.
When she landed at 11 p.m., she took her six - year - old daughter from her father’s house and decided that they would both go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened with Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years has become the theme of the new documentary "Who's Streets?", which will be released on screen on 11 August.
It is a story of survival and protests, of love and loss, of strength and stamina from people living in the community and filling the streets, requiring answers.
While Ferrrell was riding in Ferguson with a daughter dressed in a flower shop and a flower shop, they remembered the talk that had been said before this morning a countless times about “the experience of black people and their situation”.
She said, “Do you remember how I told you about the black people who fought for what they believed?
We're going to Ferguson now because the cop killed an 18-year-old boy, and that was wrong."
"I couldn't take it," said Ferrel later.
“What happens today is the culmination of what happened earlier.
She should know about it, see it, and wake up to it.
It must not only understand the different levels of experience of black people and their situation, but also understand what we must do to be free to be free.
Even if I can provide her with an environment in which she does not personally face obvious racism, she is nothing different from any other black girl.
I feel like I'd give her a bad favor if I bought her out of it."
When they arrived at Ferguson, they made their first stop at South Florisant Road, on the square located along the road from the police station, which became something like a palace camp, while activists were waiting for reports of the alleged innocence of Officer Darren Wilson.
There Ferrell and his daughter joined the local businessman who prepared the chain package.
They collected packages and helped to distribute them to the protestors.
Little by little, Ferrell took the form of a new type of activism.
“My activism changed completely after 9 August”, she said, noting that as a student of the University of Missouri St. Louis, she was the president of the Association of Sanitary Students, representatives of national minorities, and dealt with food justice and health inequalities among black communities.
“I didn’t have the organizer’s experience.
That's all that's happened."
A few weeks later, at the evening demonstration, Ferrell met Sabaa Follian, one of her directors.
Folyan said that she and her main operator, Lucas Alvarado-Ferrer, “just wanted to document” the event.
Ferrell came to his mind and said, "Do you want to document or try to find a story that you can play?"
This skepticism has been used by many people, often white, who have come into the community to benefit from its pain and endurance.
As explained in a recent interview with Folayan, “We heard that the voices of people born and raised in Ferguson are not at the center of attention, and they wanted to do so differently.”
By that time, Folyan had already joined his director, Damon Davis, a local artist known as his death penalty activist.
His participation sparked sympathy for the project at Ferrell and six other locals, with whom the "Who's Street" project team? was in contact over the years since Brown's murder.
"There's no one in this documentary talking about us or with us, that's what we're talking about," said Davis.
“That was the most important thing for me, how these people will be represented, because it is how I will be presented.”
Although the project was intended not to focus on Ferrell's experience, in order to show that the movement “is not about the leader, but about how the community unites,” Folayan said, it was the most open part of the film.
As a result, “Who’s Streets?” shows the unexpected personal aspects of Ferrell’s life, such as how she fell in love and married her wife.
"I felt naked," said Ferrell, laughing about how she first saw the ready product.
“But I realized that when you do this work and humanize black people, there must be some level of vulnerability.”
In addition, the story of Ferrell again discusses and emphasizes the role of black homosexual women in the broader context of the movement “The Black Life Matters”.
Two of the three founders of the movement – those who created the #BlackLivesMatter tag in social networks after the murder of the black girl Travon Martin in 2012 – are attracted to homosexuals.
“Black homosexual women in leadership positions support all this movement,” said Ferrell. “And all because we are constantly fighting on several fronts.
Black homosexual women have to bear all this burden.”
Folayan agreed, noting that “the movement is actually supported by black women and by many homosexual black women”.
However, she insisted that “it was not a positive case of discrimination”, and that Ferrell had not been chosen by the film ' s central character because of its distinctive features.
"She was the man who woke up this energy," she said.
“On the other hand, it’s not a coincidence that it turned out first, because when”
You can feel her energy through the screen."
Meanwhile, Ferguson has not been a cinematographic camera, but there are still complex racial relations between the community and the police.
Ferrell will be on trial for two and a half years during the demonstration.
It describes the social and political atmosphere of the place, which it calls home, simply “Bardak”.
She's still holding on to the story she studied when she went out on Ferguson's street three years ago.
We must fight for our freedom.
We have to win.
We must love and support each other.
Nothing will be lost to us except our chains.’
Two Salvadoran footballers were disqualified for the taste of US players
Soccer footballers Henry Romero and Darwin Seren received long-term disqualifications for unsportable behavior.
During the fourth final match of the Golden Cup of the Confederations of North and Central America and the Caribbean countries (CONCAF) the Salvadorans tasted American players.
Henry Romero was the first to stand out.
The El Salvadoran bite at the attacker, Josie Altidore, and then he bites his chest.
Then, in the case of a fine in his area, semi-protector Seren tasted U.S. defender Omar Gonzalez.
As a result, Romero was disqualified for three matches and Seren for six.
The meeting itself ended with the victory of the Americans with account 2:0, according to Goal.com.
Similarity: The artist creates portraits with the help of the Chelsea Manning DNA
At the center of the hall in the Gallery of Freedman in New York, people are hanging from the back of the curtain -- white, black and brown, everything that's untraceable is like each other.
These 30 portraits were created by the artist Hizer Dui-Harborg from her hair and hair clips sent to Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent out cuts from Fort Levenwart prison, where a former intelligence analyst has a 35-year term for a well-known transfer of confidential diplomatic telegrams to WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which was opened on 2 August, is called "The Rising of the Similarity".
This is the result of a two-year census between Dui Harborg, whose art unites technology, information and art, and Manning, a female transgender and a well-known dissident, who Barack Obama reduced his sentence only three days before the end of his presidency.
By analyzing and using a computer DNA program from Manning to create three-dimensional portraits of people with such a genome, Dui Harborg has created a profound, although difficult to perceive, manifestive, not only about the plasticity of DNA data - the various ways in which they interpret it and the inherent determinism of these interpretations, but also the concept of identity.
Manning, who was born under the name of Bradley Edward, but when she was a teenager, openly said that she considered herself a woman, was sentenced to 20 episodes in 2013, including six violations of the Act on Spionage, computer fraud and theft.
Her photographs in prison were not available, so only one of her photographs was known: a black and white self in which Manning in the platinum depot, apparently feeling uncomfortable, sat behind the wheel of the car; with that photograph, she began to associate.
In 2015, Dui-Harborg successfully completed its 2012 "Visions of strangers".
In it, the artist created portraits of the unknown by means of judicial evidence of the type of insults and curative cutting, separating DNA from this garbage and creating images of what these people might look like.
And then she got an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted a portrait to illustrate the article," explained Dui Haggborg in a preliminary presentation of a new press exhibition.
At the time, Chelsea was unable to visit and photograph, so they contacted her and asked if she wanted to get a portrait of her DNA.
In this unusual way, the artist and her prisoners in the museum became friends on the census and exchanged several letters for two years.
They even wrote a comic book entitled "Repressed Images", illustrated by Sholie Kanungo, who illustrated how the future president will ease Chelsea's punishment and be able to visit the exhibition personally.
What Obama really decided to release Manning just a few days after the book came out of the light was a pleasant surprise after seven years in a military prison in Kansas.
There is something deep and strong and that the exhibition is being opened right now, when Donald Trump announces war on people who reveal secret information in the Government, and invents new ways to light up on Twitter the enemy he is about to alleviate.
When Dui Harborg was asked about the coincidence of all of this for a while, she said that there was nothing wrong.
In an artist's statement written on the wall of the gallery, the huge signature of Manning down (with a heart instead of "i" in her name) calls to put an end to “automatic separation based on sex, race, sexual orientation and culture”.
On the other hand, its mitochondrial DNA, a long cluster of Carandas C, G and A.
With 200 letters (or nucleotides, as a scientificly researched artist) Dui-Harborg hoped to show how amazingly we all look, in any case, according to his biological structure.
"I hope to explain to people that our gene does not determine what we are, how open genetic data is for interpretation and how subjective it is," said Dui Harborg; her 2007 video "False memories" is also shown here.
"DNA data can tell us a lot of different stories, and 30 of these stories here."
The last part of the exhibition in one room is the novel mentioned above in comics.
It features King Kong-style Manning over the U.S. Corrigendum building with a loudspeaker in hand.
"If they kill your word, they will win," it says.
"So never shut up."
"This is a direct quote from the letter she wrote to me," says an artist who welcomes us from Philadelphia.
"I still have skin ants when I'm talking about it."
Manning hasn't seen the exhibition personally -- as it was previewed in comics -- but when she comes, she will be welcomed by masks in the center of the room, her own genomic models gathered, like a crowd of protestors.
This was also done intentionally, as was all at the exhibition up to the height (5"2, growing Manning), where the karandas drew the genetic group.
"I'd have hung them on the walls before, but now I want them to look like a bunch of people," says Dui-Harborg about portraits.
"I wanted them to be like the mass movement that formed around Chelsea, like the movement that stood for her release."
Professor of the North West University and Officer of the Oxford University are investigating the murder charges
According to the police, there is a national branch of Professor North West University and Officer of Oxford University, which is being investigated as suspects because a dead man was found in Chicago's luxury room.
According to the reports of the Cook District Court, orders were issued on Monday for the deliberate murder without the right to be released under the hostage of forty-two-year-old Windham Latham and fifty-six-year-old Andrew Warren in connection with their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton G. James Cornell Duranlo.
According to the documents, the twenty-six-year-old Cornell Duranlo died after he suffered multiple knee wounds.
The warning issued by the Chicago Police Department said that the body had been found on 27 July.
The police received a call, arrived in the Grand Plaza apartment complex and found a victim with several injuries on his body.
According to officials, Cornell Duranlo was declared dead at the crime scene, and now the detectives are investigating death from knife wounds, considering her murder, while the police are actively investigating two suspects.
Latham has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at the North West University since 2007.
Alan K. Kabbadj, Vice-President of the University of Communications, reported in an e-mail statement that Latham was on administrative leave and that he was forbidden to enter the campuses of North West University.
“It’s a criminal case that is being investigated by the authorities, and the North West University is cooperating with the prosecution,” Kabbadj said.
Warren is the Senior Financial Officer of Oxford University.
The representative of the University and Somerville College reported in an e-mail statement: “We have contacted the British police and are ready to provide any necessary assistance to the US investigative authorities”.
The statement also said that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to give up.
The Chief of Communications of Chicago Police, Anthony Gulemmy, said that he strongly advised the suspects to surrender.
“The police have assumptions about their location, but our attempts to find them are intensifying,” Gulemi said.
According to Gulemi, local, regional and federal authorities are helping to find suspects.
According to Gulemi, the police called the manager of the Grand Plaza building, which had just received a secret message that something had happened in number 1008.
The police called the crime scene horrendous.
Gulemi reported that it was unclear whether the incident had occurred on 27 July.
According to him, data from the video camera confirmed that Latham and Warren were in the building.
“We believe that Professor Latema and the victim had relations,” Gulemi said.
The Grand Plaza Guide issued an address to the residents, which reported: “Police is currently working on the timing of the incident, collecting information about the victim and considering a number of reasons, including possible domestic incidents”.
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko: "We will meet the WADA road map shortly"
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that the conditions of the World Anti-Fraud Agency (WADA) for the resumption of the work of the Russian Anti-Fraud Agency (RUSADA) would be met shortly.
“A specific phase of compliance has been achieved, and RUSADA has been granted the right to plan and carry out tests together with the UK Anti-Doping Agency.
The VADA road map was updated accordingly," Mutko said on Thursday.
The Prime Minister commented on the second part of the VADA road map to restore the status of compliance with the Code, which lists the conditions for resumption of the work of RUSADA and has recently been published on the organization ' s website.
According to Mutko, it does not contain anything that could present difficulties for Russia.
"Everything has been announced, everything will be done.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and VADA shortly," he added.
However, one of the requirements contained in the list implies that the Russian Andodoping Structures should publicly acknowledge the results of the VADA investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McClaren, who claimed that the Doping in Russian Sports was controlled by the State.
Regarding this issue, Mutko said: "We are conducting an investigation because our anti-doping system has failed.
All measures have been taken.
But there were no subsystems, and we won't admit what wasn't there."
Mutko repeated the words of Vitalia Smyrnova, head of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Diping Commission.
On the same day, in an interview with the Russian publication "Rsport" Smirnov, he recognized the problems that had occurred in the Russian anti-idoping structures, but added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains certain conflicting positions and situations.
No one will necessarily accept this report," added Smirnov.
VADA removed RUSADA from doping control in November 2015 following the doping scandal.
However, in June this year, he was allowed to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Diping Agency (UKAD).
Following a visit to the Moscow office in July, Director General VADA Olive Niggly said that RUSADA was " moving in the right direction" to restore its work.
Fire extinguished in the 79th floor tower in Dubai
The huge fire that took place in one of the highest residential buildings in the world, the tower of The Torch, is passed on by Reuters.
It is noted that the fire has been able to cope with all fires by 4.00 per local time (3.00 msec).
The local authorities reported that the incident had not affected anyone.
At the time of the fire, the streets were covered with skyscrapers.
The reasons for this are unknown.
It was previously reported that in Dubai there is a 79-storey skyscraper, The Torch, which is one of the highest buildings in the world.
All residents were evacuated on time.
Irresistible Busquake of worshipers: Not Covering Troops
The scandalous leading reality show "Dom-2" by Olga Busza struck the audience at the Europa Plus Live Festival in the Truce.
In the eyes of thousands of worshipers, the newly released duate song with Naste Kudri filled out the song "We Will Be Hot."
Both girls came out on the stage in provocative blouses, so that the lower white songs appeared.
The inscriptions of Buzova and Kudry were made on the skirts.
Earlier it was reported that changes in the appearance of Busovovo were observed by a specialist in one of the Moscow plastic surgery clinics.
Stoltenberg acknowledged the deterioration of relations between NATO and Russia
On Friday, 4 August, the Radio 4 news service reported with reference to foreign media.
He said that the Russian authorities were responsible for the deterioration of relations between the West and Russia.
In an interview with the CNN, the NATO Gensek also criticised Russia for the situation with Crimea and “stabilization in eastern Ukraine”.
Stoltenberg, however, assured that dialogue with Russia was possible and that the further escalation of the situation would not benefit any of its participants.
Earlier Thursday, President of the United States, Donald Trump, said that relations between the United States and Russia were at a dangerous low level, and accused the American Congress of that.
Ekaterinburg Metro adopts a new way of paying
In October, a bank card could be paid for in the Ekaterinburg Metropolis, said OAO's "I-Net" Gen. Pavel Wederniki in an interview with the "Regional newspaper".
Our goal is to introduce to the 2018 World Football Championship the same system as in other major cities: Moscow, St. Petersburg, Lower New York and Novosibirsk.
"We want patients from other countries, guests of the Mundial, to be able to take advantage of the metropolis by using their bank cards without buying chips and not standing in line," he said.
Starts that will help your company not to become a regular Uber
Amy Errett wanted to assess the level of satisfaction among the e-commerce start-up staff, but the interviews were not working.
The answers were often inflexible, useless, or, worse, inexcusable.
And even though she had promised anonymity, some staff members did not trust this process.
“It has never been consistent and objective, ” said Errett, managing a 75-person company in San Francisco, Madison Reed, which is engaged in e-commerce in hair care.
She therefore turned to third parties for help.
A new type of start-up is now emerging in the field of staffing, which helps companies to understand how their staff feel.
The development and licensing of software that is designed to measure staff involvement enable companies to make expressions, address specific teams and demographic groups, offer staff anonymity and hotline for complaints, and in some cases allow informants to pass through the top management and direct to the Directorate.
“We now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit for health monitoring, but where is Fitbit for your company?” says Jim Barnett, co-founder and president of the Glent Start-up from Redwood City whose analytical programs are used by companies to measure staff turnover.
Errett explained that she had gained more understanding of what her staff thought and felt for three years of Glint's use.
In addition to express questions and questionnaires of specific teams, the product offers a company's hot card and shows in a supervisory manner which units have more complaints and which managers have a low approval rating, which allows it to understand why.
Companies are less aware that they need to control the workplace, otherwise they will become the regular Uber, which became involved in the scandal when the former staff member published a blog describing the aggressive situation in which those who expressed discontent were punished.
For startups such as Glint, it is a desire to control the situation - an opportunity for a profitable business.
According to the Internet portal, “Let’s talk about pay”, dedicated financial technologies, the global management, regulation and compliance industry can cost more than $118.7 billion by 2020.
The “Convercent” starting from Denver, Colorado, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, noted a slight increase in interest and activity earlier this year in the background of Ubera’s fall in reputation.
The Converter has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has recently appeared among clients.
Like Glint, Convercent enables companies to send their individual opinion polls, collect confidential responses in real-time and view hot maps of problem areas.
It also provides a hotline for anonymous text messages that enables staff to report misconduct.
And if the top manager is affected, the complaints go straight to the department.
“The public opinion court has seized power from the inspectors,” said Patrick Quinlan, founder and president of the Convercent company.
If it is found that the company is ill-treating or conducting staff members in a non-ethical manner, even if the inspector is not involved, the company may face costly consequences in the form of boycotts by clients, staff flow and judicial claims, Quinlan reported.
Ruby Tuesday, a network of restaurants where more than 25,000 staff are working in 500 institutions, has used Converter for more than a year to ensure that staff are in the course of rules and procedures and to offer a simple way to contact the company ' s headquarters.
Earlier, if the staff member wanted to report the problem, he or she had to search for a telephone number or email from the head office, file a formal complaint and hope that it was serious.
It was often a frightening and awkward experience, said James Vitrano, head of the Ruby Tuesday legal management, who said that there was no normal way to track staff complaints.
Now that the company is using the Converter service, the problems that were previously hidden from managers in offices in other cities or states – such as discrimination, harassment and unfair wages – can be found and handled more quickly.
“I can get closer to a comprehensive, comprehensive understanding of the situation of staff,” said Vitrano, who was led by the Ruby Tuesday risk management group.
“And we protect our shareholders from judicial proceedings with staff.”
According to Queenland, companies began to be more serious about the ethics, values and involvement of staff in 2002, after the accounting firm Artur Andersen suffered damage due to ethical violations resulting from Dele Enron.
But only when “social networks received mass proliferation” did companies realize that they would not be able to keep their dirty clothing from viral distribution in the network.
“Before using technology to control ethics, people used hope as a strategy,” he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, taking regular payments from companies for the use of their products.
This is a business model and an opportunity to gain the approval of venture investors who supported both startups.
In February “Convercent” received $10 million from companies such as Sappire Ventures and Tola Capital, resulting in a total of $47 million.
Glint received $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, resulting in the company's total capital of $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising if they take into account the interlinked nature of companies, cultures and venture capital.
The growing volume of research shows that today's staff expect more jobs than they did before.
In markets with strong competition, such as the Silicone Valley, high wages and interesting projects, this is only a minimum necessary.
Staff members want to feel that they are accepted and appreciated and that they devote their time to a positive mission.
“When people are happy to work in companies, they feel that they are being heard and that the work they are doing is the result of their efforts to make such a company more successful,” says Nina McQueen, Vice-President of Global Benefits and Satisfaction Officers at LinkedIn, where they are also using “Convercent”, and “Glint”.
Investors receive income when business in their portfolio goes well; business in companies goes well when employees are committed and involved.
If the analytical instruments of the third party promise to increase the loyalty and involvement of staff, it is not surprising that they are supported.
As cultural experts in the workplace claim, it is important to have information on the involvement of staff.
But the data is useless until the company's supervisors take action.
In fact, if the company requests feedback, it may create the impression that the cycle of change is changing.
And if the changes do not happen fast enough, or if they do not happen at all, disappointment can develop and staff lose interest.
“If you are going to ask for 4,000 proposals, you should be ready to interview 4000”, said Russell, President of the Cotter International Management Consulting Company, who had to see how companies made a mistake based too much on data collection.
If you do not go forth, the officers will say, ‘Did you hear me?
You don't care?
Why should I not be equal to you?"
According to Errett, Madison Reed, who is now conducting monthly interviews with staff, is able to take action on the same day that someone reports the problem with Glint.
And, after collecting feedback from staff who were slow in decision-making and communication quality, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and introduce communication training to solve the problems.
Ruby Tuesday receives new knowledge about her staff and hopes that in the long term, this knowledge will help her to maintain more effective staff in a well-known high-speed industry.
"If you do not try to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," Vitrano said.
If you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose companies.
In Barnaul, there is a new asphalt on the horizon of the Krasno-Armie.
In Barnaul, there were crucial measures to eliminate the causes of the outbreaks of the Asphalt in the Krasno-Armeisk perspective.
The place where the caves appeared twice on a recent road trip (the intersection with the Young Street) is decided to "discover."
It is recalled that a small section of the road near the tramway was disrupted because of the land being occupied in the area of an uninhabited uninhabited network.
According to Ivan Garmat, the Vice-Chairman of the City Committee on Road Agriculture, Welfare, Transport and Communications, will conduct a detailed survey for the detailed survey and removal of violation requirements.
Depending on its results, the necessary measures will be taken.
It is expected that there will be a need to restore the gap between unmanned communications and their concreteization.
This is reported on the official website of the capital.
Team Browns has to take longer because the National Sports Association has cancelled training twice a day
The time is approaching eleven evenings; a group of footballers from the University of California in Los Angeles is being held back to take on one side the new training fields of the campus team.
Some of them were standing on their toes, and they found their backs shining after a tense first day of the sports camp.
For many players, these minutes are an average break in the middle of the day.
Games recorded for summer classes will be returned to the community after three hours of training to prepare for final exams and will return to Wasserman football centre at 6:30 in the morning.
Shortly before Monday became Tuesday, Coach Browns Jim Mora said, "In the next three days these guys are waiting for a butcher."
The fact that the National Sports Association has cancelled training twice a day, which was designed to reduce the burden for players, has actually removed their working day, at least before the completion of the Friday exams.
The first three training sessions of the California University team in Los Angeles were therefore scheduled for 7:15 p.m. to be held in and without a flat schedule of players.
The side effect of the lack of two trainings per day was more than one day of training, and Browns was moving into the camp almost weekly than last year and was training during the summer school for the first time in the six seasons of the Sea in Vesuvius.
According to the schedule, they will have to conduct 18 trainings before 20 August, including formal training for the first game in the season against the A&M team of the Texas University of A&M in September.
He must say that he supported the amendment of the rules by the National Student Sports Association, despite the fact that there had been another point in the playwright timetable.
"In three or four days, we will give them this enormous burden, this is a serious test," said Mora.
“And they just beat him, and they are working, and they are notable boys.
I think that when we live until Saturday and we have more time, it'll be really good."
When the camp is completed, the University of California in Los Angeles will make training closed; this is an easy task, since its field is directly visible from the adjacent park and from the nearby Laskin Centre, a expensive hotel that has already been bombed by football balls that have crossed the protective net behind the doors.
The Browns players must take the hotel from these exits, but the Mora assumes that when rooms are free during the season, there may be a problem.
"We'll have security," said Mora.
“It’s a serious problem, and I’m not overindulging in danger, assuming that someone can take the room off, sit there and record video training.
If you have a training video, it's very serious.
But we'll have security there and we'll have security in the parking lot number 8.
We'll do whatever we can with what we have.
I won't be too worried about that.
We have a plan."
All victims of a terrorist attack in Petersburg are expelled from the hospital
All those affected during the attack in St. Petersburg Metro in April were released from the hospital.
This was reported by Deputy Governor Anna Mitjanini in the press.
According to data at the end of July, there were three people left at the station, broadcast by the TV Centre.
Remember, the explosion in St. Petersburg Metropolitan progressed on 3 April this year.
The bomb was blown up by a terrorist death bomber named Akbarjon Jalilov.
As a result of the attack, 15 people were killed as well as the perpetrator himself.
In criminal proceedings, 11 persons, including the alleged organizer of Abor Azimov, were arrested.
It is recalled that before that, the Commissioner recommended that the Petersburg Metropolitan Plan of Transport Safety Activities be revised, in particular by increasing the number of metal detectors.
Facebook enhances fact-finding in the fight against fake news
Facebook will be more likely to send suspicious texts to independent experts and show their conclusions under original positions, the largest social network of worlds on Thursday, which is trying to combat so-called faecal news.
In its statement on the website, the company stated that it was beginning to use improved machine learning algorithms to identify possible mysticizations, send them for verification and possibly show the results of the check-in under the original post.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main ways of spreading so-called faecal news that many believe have influenced the 2016 presidential elections in the United States.
This issue is also being debated actively in Europe after the French voters were misled by false communications before the presidential elections in May, and in Germany before the September elections they declared support for the plan to penalize social networks if they did not expeditiously remove hate-fired posts.
On Thursday, in a separate German-language statement, Facebook reported testing a new check-in algorithm that was launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“In addition to seeing what reports are being challenged by independent investigators, people want to have a broader context to make reasoned conclusions about what they are reading and what they are sharing,” wrote Sara Sue, Facebook news manager in her blog.
She added that Facebook would continue to test the "related articles" and work on other changes in the news chain to solve the problem of fake news.
Create a novel comic: One castle in English history
In the recent past, the small castle of Scotty was recorded in the music video "Squeeze", and in the 1970s and 1980s he served as a port for Margaret Tetcher.
But 700 years from his close spot in the Bay Valley in Kent County, he watched the stormy history around him, and now he inspired Jamie Rods, a Yorkshire hairdresser, with a tendency to historical documents, to novel comics.
"I think it's so beautiful to look at a man who died 300 years ago," he says with excitement.
"You feel it so personal when you hold this letter in your hand."
The Castle in England covers a period from the Middle Ages to the Evardian era and tells about the families who lived in Scotland; each story illustrated one of the young British artists, Isaac Lenkevic, Briannie May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
This is not the first book of Rhodes, which is based on archive data: in 2014, he wrote "Dear Man's teeth and other stories" - a compilation of the British Library's documents; this project suddenly moved him to the depths of the soul.
"I could have seen a simple fingerprint on the edge of a letter written in the 1700s by a double agent working on the bonds," he says.
"It's his finger print."
And the letters will always smell smoke, because at that time fires were lit to light.
And in 300 years' time, in the future, you think you're there too.
Oh, how I love archives!"
For a person who has such a passion for old papers, getting support from the National Fund and the English Art Council and living in a castle for four months ("I am honest, I am a bit stuck there") seems too good to be true.
Rods studied the “new” Victorian castle all day long, went through archives and looked at numerous treasures of names and ancient things, such as the heads of gynaecs on walls or bottles, centuries gone by.
He walked through the park and through the ruins of the old castle, talked to foresters, gardeners, and sometimes with artists working over the illustrations of his book.
Then at night he "drinked whiskey and sat down to write."
The history of Scotty ' s castle has not been very studied, because the National Fund has been fully accessible to it only in 2006 when the last successor, Elizabeth Hassi, died.
When Rods arrived ten years later, the officers were only beginning to understand the archive he described as "the one that the aristocrats have been down on the hill for centuries."
The journals, the letters of the British Empire, the maps showing who owned it, "You think the land disputes are boring," says Rods, "but there were two families behind this shore.
That's right, guys!"
In some stories, the castle is becoming a starting point for wider research in English history: for example, in "Worker", the hero leaves a newly built castle to join the Christian Revolution of 1381.
"There are reports of the rebellion that took place in the castle in 1380, in a book called "Kenta and Sassex Empire Families," says Rods.
"The Christian uprising began in these places, and I thought that rebellion was the right start.
Maybe they were connected?"
Other topics are closely related to the history of the castle, such as "The Priest", which tells about the Jesuit priest, whose family Darrell had been hiding in his home for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or "Contrabandist," about 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell, who was believed to have staged his own funerals by striking the grave with stones (this was discovered several years after the tomb was dug).
Darrells are the favorite Rods family of all who lived in Scotland: "The gentlemen seem to have been a perfect jule, they've always been in debt, and they've spent money on what they couldn't afford.
In different generations, Darrell men have solved their debt problems, marrying rich elderly women - I represent them as a company of nice men capable of caring for the heirs of great conditions."
After the completion of the work at the Rods Castle, there will be other opportunities for a unique writing experience.
He lived two weeks in a Finnish silence, where he wrote a graphic novel about Germany, a place where there was a sanatorium in the early 20th century, and then it grew into a forest again.
But Scotty remains a special place for him.
"I was sad to leave," he says.
"I felt like this: the hell with you, I have to go back to real life."
Fifteen largest banks choose "Russia"
The Russian Banks Association (ARB) has developed: following Sberbank, TBB, TB24, Alpha Bank, Gazprombank, Rosselhozbank, Binbank and FC, seven other credit organizations are about to leave this public organization.
As a result, at least 80 per cent of the market will be lost from the ARB organizations.
But this is not simply an exit - all banks that have reported a break with ARB are negotiating with another public organization that brings together credit institutions - the Association of Regional Banks "Russia", led by the famous politician, Anatoly Axakov, Chairman of the Committee of the Voice on the Financial Market, recognized, by the latest session and by the most effective leader of the think committee and by the MP on the number of drafts prepared.
The beginning of the conflict within the ARB was during a discussion in the Council of the Federation, when new draft laws were being considered by the Interregional Banking Council, in particular with regard to the reclassification of banks according to the size of the statutory capital.
At that time, Gargetin Tosunjan, President of ARB, said that, in the opinion of the association, the bill was adopted for the larger banks, which were thus trying to limit the possibility of small and medium-sized banks in the regions by taking over their clientele.
Among other claims was the criticism of the Central Bank, which, according to Tosunjan, did not always legitimately withdraw licenses from some banks, which, in fact, had followed an objection by the representative of the CB: many of the heads of the criminalized banks, in particular, Foreign Prombank, had been included in the ARB ' s governing bodies.
This exchange of views seems to be very sensitive to the relationship with the main regulator of the banking environment, and it has become apparent that the fifteen largest banks, with disagreement with the ARB policy, have begun to prepare themselves for accession to the Association “Russia”, noting that “the effectiveness of the ARB’s work will be at a low level and that constructive dialogue within the banking community is not actually carried out”.
It'll be better for investors.
What's the matter?
Let us respond immediately to the main question that arises in or near a minor failure or conflict in the banking sphere: the investors will not be threatened, rather, by the bank system ' s reliability.
"Rossia" is headed by Anatoly Axakov, who is well-known for his curiosity about the interests of banks and their clients, a high-level professional who is highly valued in the Central Bank: almost all the management of the CB is present at the annual activities of the association, and all significant legislative initiatives of the regulator are carried out through expert evaluations of the "regional".
The staff-organization plan obviously does not provide for any special shocks.
Without a doubt, ARB is in a difficult financial and management situation after such powerful and influential participants with their contributions and lobbyist capabilities are absent.
However, the oldest organization, established in 1991, that advocates the interest of the banking community, has little potential to continue to improve banking legislation and the scope of monetary treatment in general.
It cannot be said that, in Russia too, with extended commitments, it is ready to accept any new members, according to her manager, Anatolia Aksakova (“may be too desirable”), who said on 21 July at the press briefing in the centre of the Parliament's paper, that “on the next day representatives of the ARB banks have asked me to consider increasing the potential of our association “Russia””.
Their proposals are to strengthen the voice of bankers in the Association Council and to pay more attention to new banking technologies.
The negotiation process is now under way, the proposals are being studied by both sides, and the association's emergency conference is being held in Sochi in mid-September in the framework of the International Banking Forum.
That's where we're going.
Annatoli Aksakov also stressed that “it will not be held back,” he called it a possible new leader of the updated Association “Russia” of Luntowski, who left the post of Vice-President of the Central Bank in September, with a high profile of his business and human qualities.
On 18 August, Anatolie Aksakov, who is now resting in Crimea, plans one day to break off and arrive in Moscow, at the extraordinary meeting of the Russian Association Council, which is scheduled to consider the agenda of the Russian extraordinary assembly.
The entry of petrol-powered cars into the major cities of Russia will not be limited
The Vice-President of Mintrans Nikolai Asaul said that, contrary to media reports, the entry of petrol engines into the major cities of Russia would not be limited.
It's a more radical form of our concept.
Our concept is that we need to gradually increase the environmental class.
And there's the concept of going straight to zero emissions.
I don't think we're ready for this.
The question is, what year has it been?
It's the same at the level of the phrases - let's ban it.
Where and when?
Tomorrow?
The whole town's closed?
"In 20 years, I don't know, maybe it'll happen," says Prime Minister.
Earlier, the Newspaper reported that, by 17 August, Deputy Prime Minister Arkadia Dvorkovic had been commissioned to examine proposals on possible options for electrical transport management submitted to the Government by PAH Director KamAZ Sergei Kogogin.
Among the proposals, according to the newspaper, are the use of cars with VCS in large cities and in resorts.
Washington is changing the rules for receiving a postcard.
According to the media, President Donald Tramp said that a new US immigration plan would be adopted, which would change the rules for receiving a postcard.
The plan provides for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, more stringent rules on temporary work visas and restrictions on family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republican Party and supported by the President.
The bill will be discussed in two Congress Chambers.
“This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save taxpayers billions of dollars, and it will make changes in how the United States publishes grincards to citizens of other countries.
The law will reduce the gradual migration and replace the existing scheme.
The new application process will provide advantages to candidates who have English, have money resources that allow them to hold on to themselves, and have skills that will benefit our economy," Tramp said, according to the American media.
Sex robots are real, and that's supposed to bother us.
We failed to think that 2017 could no longer get worse, a new report on technological progress in the production of sex jobs.
Yeah.
Sex now in the center of attention.
The responsible worker (FRR) fund recently issued a report on the development of sex work in the next 5-10 years.
In the opinion of Noel Sharky, a professor of robotics and art intelligence at the University of Sheffield and the co-founder of the FRR, we must take their appearance seriously.
Users will be able to choose the color of the eyes of robots, the shape of the nails and the type of nails.
"People are guessing about it, but companies are already sending them to consumers in large numbers, and soon we will see them much more," said Sharky at the presentation of a new report.
Modern sex dolls evolved from their inflated colleagues into silicone-skin robots, warm-to-skinned, and almost human replicas controlled by artificial intelligence.
Users can also "set" their robots at their own taste by choosing from the color of the eyes and the shape of the robots to the shape and color of the nails.
But the fact that many jobs have a "personality" compared to which the Stepford Woman would appear to be very progressive is even more worrying.
Modern sex dolls have become silicone-skin robots.
For example, RealBotix robot allows users to adjust the quality they find attractive, such as darkness.
There are still Roxxy Gold sex jobs designed by True Companion, which are provided with an already programmed individuality. For example, Cold Farra produces a grim impression, and Dicka Wendy has a bold character.
"Roxxxxy Gold has a character that suits you beautifully," says True Companion.
So she loves what you love, doesn't love what you don't love, and so on.
She's changing her mood during the day like this man!
She may want to sleep or shave, or she may be "in the mood"!"
In the emergence of sex work, there is a lot of concern - not least because they replace real human relationships - but most of all concern the subordinated image of women, the association of rape, which causes the possession of the Cold (read: resistance) Fari.
The True Companion Roxxxxy website compares with the vibrator, only for men.
"If a woman can be a sic, why can't a man be Roxxy?" - says the website.
But these sex jobs are not just fetishes or just new sex toys.
Their appearance and increasing complexity indicate something darker and deeper in our culture, a departure from the ideal of gender equality to the desire for sex with submission as an optional supplement.
Most men, of course, will not buy sex jobs, and while the FRR notes their growing popularity, they remain in the periphery of consumer culture.
But what comes to us from the periphery can be very instructive about the meanings of the era in which we live.
And many people are not stupid or aggressive until the free market gives them an opportunity to do so.
It is not a coincidence that these complex sex jobs occurred when women's rights around the world were threatened when there was a President in the White House, who praised what was coming to women.
The most horrible thing in the TV series "Rassakka Servanka" is not graphic images, twisted bodies and eyes, that is, how much this vision seems realistic.
The Republic of Gilead is an exaggeration, but now it doesn't seem so big.
The aim of the sex business industry is to achieve such a physical image of real women (only with the proportion of porn stars) that technology allows.
Their creators want them to tell the people that they're being fooled to copy the movements of the human body.
But it's just that your "character" robots don't look like these women.
They can't break up with their partners or get away from them.
They don't have their own life or their biographies - nothing that could indicate independence or anything else that could destroy the illusion of complete dependence.
In other words, they are beautiful slaves.
Or, as they say in 2017, maids.
The native of L.A. Eugene (Puch) Jeter, who has been running for Ukraine since 2013, will not help our national team at the European basketball championship, the final part of which starts on 31 August.
In an interview with the BeBasket portal, General Manager Andrey Lebedev reported.
We tried to make a deal with Jeter, but unfortunately he won't come into family.
We're going to go to the Eurobasket without a naturalized game, because we don't want to take someone we don't know.
"This situation will allow us to develop our young players," he said.
I recall that, with Jetera's direct participation, Ukraine took the sixth place in the Eurobasket-2013 and for the first time entered the world's basketball championship, where "yellow blue" could not overcome the group stage, and the U.S. citizen picked up an average of 15.4 points, made 3 choices and handed over 5 transfers.
Jeter has stopped running for Ukraine since his departure from the post of Chief Coach of our national team, Mike Fratello, who left this post in 2015.
The Eurobasket-2017 will be held simultaneously in four countries: Turkey, Romania, Israel and Finland.
The Ukrainian team will carry out its team tournament matches on the Promised Land.
There will be five units in Group B: Germany (31 August), Italy (2 September), Georgia (3 September), Lithuania (5 August) and Israel (6 August).
In preparation for the tournament, our husband’s assembly held two checkpoints, in which he joined the Dutch and the Belarusian.
- Big Trampa's high?
Imagination of Mita Romni seems very reasonable
In the Trampa era, it was common ground that political disputes that polarized the U.S. electorate destroyed some families on a micro-level basis.
Between Thanksgiving and Christmas, American newspapers have fanned columns on how to deal with horrible relatives voting for Trump.
Looks like we're all under a lot of stress, so we're gonna hit it soon.
It's less about the ability of Trump to unite families.
I'm writing about it because my cousin, the left-wing poet from Chicago, who had long been on knives with Republicans in her family, came to me in New York this week.
She reminded me that a united fight against the common enemy could have a powerful effect.
At Trampe in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican brother she's been arguing about for decades, was suddenly and strangely on the one hand.
After dinner it is undoubtedly good; but I cannot think that in a broader context it may be quite dangerous.
The tramp has inspired force into the left flank, but the deforming effect of its control can move us all right.
When we're talking about Trump and "normalization," we mean the unlikely possibility that we'll ever be able to stop hitting his exits.
There is, however, an even more questionable scenario in which the Trump "normalizes" the most right Republicans, who will suddenly appear to be a model of sound meaning in the light of its standards.
I realized that I was missing out on the old-fashioned nonsense of Mitt Romney today -- with a dog on the roof of the car and a 14-percent income tax (but at least we knew what his tax statement looked like) -- compared to Trump and so on, and the other seems to be a very small evil.
When Trump leaves, the next Republican candidate will simply be in his mind to see a huge step forward.
When my cousin went downtown, we went with the kids to the carousel in the Central Park - the biggest carousel in the New York Park Department and the best way in town to spend three dollars if you don't need caffeine.
The loathsome and huge, pictures of the glass in the central drumper are gruesome clowns and animals who, in horror, look on their backs, are extremely predatory, and the enchanting music is no wonder.
So many well - known things in this city are disappointed: the species of skyscrapers are getting old, the silhouettes of buildings have come too far to cause shock, and the reality of the city does not succeed.
Thirty-five years have passed, and I'm still experiencing the day when I learned that the Swiss-cattage area is actually not a Swiss joke (thematic pub "Ye Old Swiss Cottage" not an account) but a big circular crossroads in Northern London.
And carousel in Central Park is still an unusual, magical place where two years old, eleven years old, and two women in forty can spend a great time.
Well, if I could put down a carousel, I'd put up a five, but fortunately nobody asked me to.
And this week at the university, I was asked before I had a terminal card, to evaluate my "expert" purchases on a scale of between one and five stars.
At the corner of my street, the same plus option is to conduct a 15 per cent tea evaluation for a stand order.
As a result, not only does it slow down the idea of interaction, but it still requires a personal approach to a situation that does not involve it.
The poor salesman at the university smiled confusedly until I was able to evaluate my experience of handing her a credit card to five stars.
Oscar Pistorius was transferred from the prison to the hospital for pain in the chest
Pistorius is leaving the prison because of his visit to the doctor for the second time.
Last year, he was transferred to a hospital for the treatment of fines on his wrists, which, according to the prison administration, resulted in his falling into the chamber.
Pistorius was convicted of intentional murder after the prosecution's appeal for an initial sentence for unintended murder.
He killed Steinkamp early in the morning of Valentine's Day in 2013, shooting several times through the toilet door in his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius said he had taken his friend for the night gate he was hiding in the toilet.
The Prosecutor ' s Office declared its intention to bring another protest, this time against the six-year term of Pretoria, which she said was too soft.
The Prosecutor General ' s Office stated that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal would be considered this year.
Pretoria may increase by 15 years if the prosecutor ' s office succeeds.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
A non-exit signature has been chosen by the suspected NTV journalist
The mayors chose the measure of interception in the form of a sign of non-exit for a man who attacked a TV reporter, Nikita Dzozzeeva, during a direct air raid from the Goriko Park on 2 August.
This is reported by TASS with reference to the official representative of the IMF, Irina Volk.
“In the context of an investigation of a criminal case initiated under Art. 116 of the FMR (‘Poboi’) against a 32-year-old man who struck a correspondent in the Central Park for culture and recreation on behalf of the Gorica, suspected of having chosen a measure of repression in the form of a non-exit and appropriate conduct,” Volk said.
The representative of the IMF added that an administrative protocol for police innocence had been prepared for the suspect.
On Wednesday, 2 August, during a direct flight to the VDV Day, a nervous man came to the correspondent and struck him face to face.
As it turned out later, huligan had nothing to do with VAT.
In fact, according to the Razuzzaev himself, dissidents were trying to keep the mosquito.
Two Bulgarian citizens were detained in Greece for illegal palatial detention
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, two Bulgarians were detained in Greece for illegal detention.
On the morning of 1 August, a group of people who had placed tents in an uninhabited location, including two Bulgarians, were detained in Sitonia.
They were released on the same day as they were pursued.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the Bi-Ti-Vi television channel that Bulgarian citizens had then been released.
The Greek authorities have stepped up the control of the free campaign and have already imposed serious fines on all those who are arrested during their stay in a place not intended for that purpose.
Checks will be carried out throughout the season.
According to the Ministry, the court may appoint a fine.
The Russian MIDI accused the U.S. Vice-President of the period of "cold war" rhetoric
Statements made during the U.S. Vice-President Michael Penz's European tour were criticized by the Russian MIDI.
“Unfortunately, Washington is becoming increasingly affected by the primitive ideologies of the cold war, which have been completely eliminated from reality,” says the Russian Foreign Office.
This was how the words "Russian threat" and the attempts at violent cross-border crossings in Podgorica were responded to in the Middle Ages.
The Russian MID pointed to the destructiveness of the choice "with the West or with Russia" and the invisibility of the claim that the whole of South-East Europe is being entered into NATO.
Russian diplomats also recalled that it was the United States that violated international law by applying force to withdraw Kosovo from Serbia and thus created another wave of tension.
"We call on colleagues in the United States to stop the abuse of Russia and its foreign policy line, which is constantly based on respect for partners and willingness to work together constructively, taking into account mutual interests," said the Russian MIDI.
Feldsher's been hit in the DTP with "almost" in Podmoskov
The DTP took place in the foothills of Stupino, resulting in anomalous collision with the Quick Help carriage.
Today around 08:10 msk happened a collision of the Mitsubishi car with a ambulance in the city of Stupino Moscow area.
“As a result of the collision of the car, the “soon” has turned,” the TASS said in the press service of the MVG in the Moscow area.
Law enforcement officials are on the scene, and the circumstances of the incident are identified.
In the Odes area, a woman threw her newborn son into the cellophane package.
On 3 August, the Department of Police reported to the local resident that he had found packages with the infant in an unaccompanied private home.
“At the site, law enforcement officers and doctors who quickly delivered the child to a medical institution” reported in the Odez chapter of the National Police.
The doctors determined that the boy was born a few hours before his discovery, as evidenced by the presence of the doll.
The identity of the birth was established during the priority operational follow-up activities, the 36-year-old local resident.
It has also been found that a woman has three other minor children.
As noted in the chapter, family law enforcement had not been in the past, and there was no special record.
Police are currently setting out the circumstances and the reasons that have offered women this procedure, after which a procedural decision will be taken.
Now the baby is under the supervision of the doctor.
As previously reported, a 21-year-old woman in Nikolai had her unborn child thrown into a trash can.
Gregory Lips: "I'm going to fight, though 55 is not 30."
One of the most successful Russian performers, Gregory Leps, will celebrate his 55th birthday on the next Sunday.
Before the feast, the singers had a conversation with the suspect of the News.
I remember how your "poltini" was mentioned.
A special tent in the Lies, Gloria Genor sang for the nominee, a powerful salon over the Moscow River.
You must have been wondering if you wanted to spend your next five years.
Do you have any idea?
If you're talking about a profession, it's been a good time.
I worked a lot, I went through the country with gastroesus three times, I gave 120-130 concerts a year.
He released two bad albums.
Of course, I'm not what I said 20 years ago.
The biological times will not lie.
Singing like I sang in my 30s is getting harder.
Still, I'm fighting, I don't want to stop.
And I'm with new people, and I think I'm going to a different level.
You're writing a new album with them, the first in three years.
Yeah, work on him now.
Of course, we've already recorded it in my studio and now we're sending it to Los Angeles.
It's called "What are you so serious about?" in a single song written together with Timothy.
She's not ready yet, so we haven't put her out yet.
We'll do it later when we get a clip on it.
And the album will be presented in November at a series of my birthday concerts in Moscow's Crocus City Hall.
A classic American drummer Chris Coleman put his hand on your new coat.
Do you think you wanted to attract him to your gastro-intestinal?
In my opinion, Coleman today is one of the most outstanding fighters in the world.
He came to my studio, recorded his lots.
I invited him to join my team, and Jeremy Colson (a well-known drummer who participated in various projects.
But for long-term work in Russia, they have raised, gently speaking, excessive conditions.
It was about fees from €35,000 to €45 thousand a month.
At the time, I thought that the post-Soviet space would find decent musicians.
And he found a great drummer Max Malachev.
It's better to feed ourselves.
In time, I'd like to say good-bye to one of them, not for anything.
For example, guitarist Fedor Dosumov is highly rated at the international level.
It's written by Western music magazines, invited to various guitar festivals.
Steve Wy, after listening to his game, said that "a new generation of guitarists came with another executive technique."
Your album goes to Los Angeles, American musicians work with you, but you still can't come to the United States yourself?
Are you trying to remove this ban?
Now, honestly, I'm not doing anything.
There are a number of lawyers dealing with this issue.
As a musician, I'm really sorry that I can't go to America.
I used to say I was learning there.
The more you communicate with these professionals, the more useful it is.
We don't know them, but we don't have that kind of experience, school.
In front of our performers of popular music for 70 years, the challenges that American musicians have always faced have not been fully met.
They were striving for the highest quality sound.
And I'm trying to follow the same principles.
Now why did the United Kingdom refuse to join me for ten years?
But I'm going to submit visa documents to the British Embassy every year so that I can be allowed to go there again, and the main thing is to work there.
The rest of Europe is kind to me.
And in August, you're planning a concert in Monaco, not an order, but an official, right?
Yeah, there's a good sports room in Monte Carlo. I've spoken there before.
Now they've been invited again, and, as far as I know, all the tickets to the concert are already sold.
"Randevo Lyma Weikula", which will begin July 20th in Yurmale, will you?
She invited me, and, of course, I answered.
Lyma is a remarkable singer and a beautiful woman who is able to give herself and her beautiful vocals and even whispers.
After the gastroles and the Christmas concerts, as far as I know, you want to turn to the creation of Vladimir High.
You already have two albums with his songs on the disc.
When will the third come out?
Probably next year.
But it'll be completely different.
I want to record some 80-90 High songs about in the same feed as he did himself.
Just a voice and a guitar.
No other arrangement.
I'll be accompanied by our famous musician, Timour Wedernikov.
I'll try to get myself involved in the album and Alexander Jakovlevic Rosenbaum.
I talked to him about it, we have a good relationship, but he's busy, so let's see what happens.
You and Boris Grebenškov's songs gradually introduced into his repertoire.
Maybe you can write his stuff on the album later?
Boris Borisovic is a wonderful man and a great musician.
I've crossed over with him a few times and asked him, "Can I sing some of his songs?
He said, "Grygoria, I write songs so that they can be fulfilled."
Please try it, go.
It's probably interesting to write such an album.
I don't have a job like that, but in the future, two years, if Boris Borisovich won't object, I might be doing this project.
If you don't focus fully on the business of your mall.
I don't think you've signed contracts with all the artists you're interested in?
There are a number of performers I'd like to have under my wing, but they're self-contained people.
You mean Sergey Lazarev?
Serja is a brilliant singer, I invited him.
I can't agree with his repertoire, but he's a professional and he has his development strategy.
And now there's Alexander Panyaotov in my center, which I put in the Voice.
We've made a deal with him and we're working.
In our pop music, such songs are rare.
It'll be a real shame if he doesn't reach the heights he deserves.
I'm trying to improve his repertoire, I'm taking pictures.
I hope for a good result.
I'm also trying to promote other artists from my center: I buy them songs, I cry to poets, sometimes their tracks fall into the rotation of television and radio channels.
If they don't reach high levels, I'll still lead our cooperation to a logical conclusion.
They'll get a written album on their way out, a couple of videos.
And then, if they want, they can go their way, and I won't insist that they return the money they put in them.
Although I would be pleased if any of them would achieve commercial success and pay me the percentages we agreed on in the contract.
But if that doesn't happen, I don't want to cover the oxygen for anyone.
Let everyone work, break, prove how I used to prove it.
If tomorrow you're invited to take a gastronomic tour to Ukraine and guarantee entry into the country, will you go?
I've been invited there so far.
The focus is on closed activities.
And as for the big tour...
I'm a Russian man in my country who, in his own opinion, flew to Syria on the same plane that was then broken.
If they say they have to fly somewhere else for the sake of the State tomorrow, I'll take it easy.
And I don't care what bloggers and other critics think about me.
I'm very sorry that we've got this situation with Ukraine.
Because I believe that we are one people and must be together.
I'm sorry that this is not going to happen, at least in the near future.
And I used to do 40-50 concerts in Ukraine for a year.
We've met somewhere.
Thank you very much.
And he worked with several Ukrainian artists: Annie Lorak, St. Lobodi, Artem Loick...
In Ukraine, the masses of gifted people, and sincerely regret that they cannot now give their talent to a broad Russian audience.
Music must unite and entertain people.
I would be pleased to invite some classic Ukrainian executive to Russia, such as Slav Vakarcuk, and to do a joint concert with him.
But at this point, I think it's unlikely...
Andreia Ochlopkova was released with a cosmodrome
As "U" became known, the technical director of the cosmodrom East Andrei Ochlopkov started working at the State Space Science and Production Centre (HCNPC) in the name of Hruniceva.
He had previously de facto been involved in the construction of the East Cosmodrom, but because of disagreements with the management of the Centre for Land and Space Infrastructure (CENKI), he was transferred to a company in Moscow, where he would coordinate production.
Mr. Ochlopkova will not be replaced: the post of technical director is likely to be cancelled and the officer will be disbanded by CENKI units.
The fact that the Technical Director of the East and Sub-Director of CENCI on Technological Development Andrei Ochlopkov moved to work on behalf of Hruniceva, "U" told the top managers of several space industry enterprises, as well as the Government's staff.
"He's been working on a new post for weeks," the U spokespersons explained in the industry.
An operational comment from CENKI was not received on Thursday, and Mr. Ohlopkov himself was not available for comments.
However, the information “U” was officially confirmed in the CCNPC.
He decided to move to the position of production coordinator, said to the company. - Andrey Ochlopkov had fully fulfilled the task of providing a minimum for the first launch of the spacecraft.
Mr. Ohlopkov went to work at CENCI in 2013, with his shoulders behind him in space forces, in particular in Baykonour, and in Plesecke, he was the first Deputy Commander of the "North" Cosmodrome.
In 2009, Andrei Ochlopkov became a criminal officer.
The prosecution accused him of being taken into custody: it was alleged that the regional traders had received a bribe but had failed to comply with their obligations to clean separate parts of the aircraft in the Arkangel area and the Republic of the Commission.
In 2012, the jury found him innocent.
Its responsibilities for technological development in CENCI have been extended to various projects, but the main project has been the construction of outer space in the Far East.
The then head of the Federal Space Agency, Oleg Ostapenko, in an interview “U”, directly said that the situation in the East “was critical already in October 2013”.
The point is that there was a strategic error in planning: the completion of the construction and the first launch of the Union-2.1 carrier missile was planned at the same time as at the end of 2015.
In order to complete the release by the end of the year, the completion of the construction was decided on a half-year earlier and the deadline was postponed from December to July 2015.
To speed up the process, CENCI specialists began parallel installation of technological equipment on unconstructed facilities.
Andrei Ochlopkov was the main supporter of this idea.
Despite the existing risks and still the transfer (instead of the Union flying only on 28 April 2016 in December 2015), this idea justified itself, the source of "U" on the cosmodrom says, " Otherwise, we would not have made any launch from the East yet, but would have done the construction."
Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, who was driving the creation of a spacecraft, called himself Andrey Ohlopkova his "space Susanian", but he almost always asked for information about the design.
Mr. Ohlopkov recalled and said: for example, in an interview with "U" he suggested that the Federal Special Building Agency (Spectre) be the only East Executive and work directly with subcontractors: "Why should we put all eggs in one basket of Specstre?"
This idea was supported by the Government.
Since 2017, CENCI has assumed the responsibility of the contractor-general to allow the construction work on the start-up and technical complex to be completed in the fourth quarter.
According to “U”, Mr. Ochlopkova's transition to a new place of work had led to disagreements with CENCI's management on how to complete the construction of spacecraft and facilities, as well as working methods with subcontracting organizations.
“It was decided that this would be better for everyone,” said one of the top managers involved in the establishment of the East.
In turn, the Government staff member calls the decision strange: "He was one of the best professionals, finding a balanced replacement for him would be difficult."
According to "U", this will not be necessary: the position of the technical director of the cosmodrom will be abolished and its functions will be decommissioned by CENCI units.
Two specialty training programmes will be held in music schools
In the future, students of children's music schools will be able to receive two specialties at the same time.
According to the Deputy Director of the Department of Science and Education of the Minkulture of St.
"The Ministry of Culture has taken over this issue, and we and the expert community are developing a mechanism that will allow two specialties to be adopted, but will not go against the existing legislation in the field of education," said Golubenko.
Last Friday, during the "Nedetski Talk" of Vladimir Putin and the educators of the child centre Sirius, student Maria Andreeva reported that repeated items were forced to pay for second specialty at the Moscow Conservatory.
The girl told me that she was studying in the violin and piano class and that she had prizes in both directions.
The Head of State recognized her question as very relevant and promised to help.
In Mexico, 17-year-old Russian is detained on a wall in the sky
In Mexico, a 17-year-old Russian named Kirill N., who was arrested on the roof of a tall building, reported the El Universal portal.
An incident occurred in Mexico City.
With the help of two unknown men, the young man moved through a three-metre fence into the territory of Nestle's office building complex and took himself to one of his own pools.
He did not use any special equipment, insurance and chains.
A young man is already on the roof.
Staff of the Ministry of Public Security dropped him on the ground on the helicopter.
He was then sent to the National Institute of Migration.
It shows whether a young person is legally present on the territory of the country.
In the meantime, the video with the young high - ranking man became popular in the Network.
The users called the young man a spider.
According to the media, such experiments are a hobby for him.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate can help to facilitate CPC.
Red meat and chocolate are considered a nightmare for your food tract.
But recent studies say that diet, rich in meat proteins and dairy products, can help to relieve symptoms for those who suffer from infectious infectious diseases.
This incurable disease, which affects some 1.3 million people in the United States and 300000 in the United Kingdom, leads to the death of and excruciating life, chronic or bloody pride, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Usually to relieve symptoms, it is recommended to avoid meat and milk products, but researchers at Washington University found that the main amino acid of the white triptophan contributes to the production of immune cells that increase the tolerability of the bladder.
The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that the immune cells in the bladder are monitoring that harmful microbes from food do not penetrate the body.
Cells capable of starting the burning process are balanced by cells that increase tolerance, protecting the body and thus do not harm sensitive tissues.
If the balance is too severe to burn, it may lead to infectious diseases of the bladder.
The experiments have shown that the mouse has a certain bacteria in the clipboard has increased cell tolerance.
And this bacteria need triptophan, one of the building elements of the protein, to start the appearance of these cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have established a link between one type of bacteria - Lactobacillus Reuters, which is part of the normal microbial bladder, and the development of the population of cells that increase tolerance.
The more trippphans were fed into the mouse, the more these immune cells had."
He assumed that the same would be true for people: the combination of L. Reuters and a rich triptophan diet can contribute to a more tolerant and less prone to the burning of the environment in the clipboard.
According to Dr. Luis Servantes-Barraganas, studying the diversity of immune cell tolerances, one group of mice tested these cells and the other group that belonged to the same line but contained them separately.
She assumed that the difference could be caused by the microbial microbial mouse -- the communities of bacteria, viruses and fungi that usually live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The cell DNA of the mouse was sequenced and six types of bacteria were found in the mouse that had immune cells but were not in the mouse that did not have them.
The mice that grew in the sterile environment with no good microbial and did not develop this type of immune cell received L. Reuters, and the immune cells appeared.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, researchers raised L. Reuters in a liquid environment and then transferred small portions of the fluid - without bacteria - to undeveloped immune cells from the mouse.
Immune cells have become cells that increase tolerance.
When the active component was separated from the liquid, it was a side product for the processing of trippphan known as indol-3-lactic acid.
When researchers doubled the number of trippphans in mouse food, the number of these cells increased by about 50 per cent, but when the level of trippphan was reduced twice, the number of cells also dropped twice.
Dr. Servantes-Barragan explains that people have the same tolerability as the mouse, and most of us have L. Reuters in their gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether the L. reuteri side products contribute to the development of cells in people as well as in the mouse, but in people who suffer from foot-and-mouth disease, there have been defects in the genes associated with triptophan.
She said, "It is possible that we can develop these cells and we need to strengthen them, because these cells depend on the burning processes on the inside of the shell.
High levels of typtophane, if L. Reuters is available, may potentially lead to an increase in their population."
According to José Maureen, Manchester United hired genius in the face of Nemania Matic
Manchester United hired “geni” in the face of Nemania Matić, he considered José Mourinu after the semi-defence debuted in the match against “Samphoria” on Wednesday evening.
A game of 40 million pounds at Chelsea began with the victory of 2-1 in Dublin in the last pre-season match United in front of the UEFA Super-Cube against Real Madrid on Thursday and impressed the role of a semi-protector, while players such as Pola Pogba and Andreas Preira broke out when they were tried.
However, since Matic did not take part in the pre-season Chelsea tour in Asia, he did not take training seriously, and he lasted only 45 minutes, which, according to Maureen, required preparation before the start of the Prime Minister ' s season.
“He needs time, but his experience, mind, genius is what he thinks – he thinks football,” said Maureen.
“We will help prepare him as soon as possible.”
Just like Matic, his new-player friends Victor Lindelöf and Romel Lukak began the game at the Aviva Stadium when Maureen began to form his main composition for the beginning of the next season.
The Independent newspaper reported this week that Maureen wanted to hire three more players, but suggested that the club had already achieved fantastic results by hiring three of the four players he would like to hire first.
He said, “I am grateful to the club for having gained three out of four.”
“I will be more pleased if they get me four of the four, but they have done a lot for me.”
Former Lithuanian Social Democrats' Leaders Treaty to Stay in the Leading Coalition
Former Presidents of the Socialist Party of Lithuania, former Prime Minister Algirdas Butkyavichus and Gediminas Kirkilas, as well as former Speaker of the Social Democrats Chamber Cheslovas Yurshenas, called on the parties to remain in the ruling coalition.
As the Parliament's paper reported, a discussion was initiated in the Social Democratic Party on whether to remain in the ruling coalition due to training with the partners, the Union of Christians and the Greens.
And here are three senior experienced associates who addressed one party with an open letter saying, inter alia: "The party's disappointment at the election party is continuing, but the coalition with "Christians" has created us with little or no ease, but still the conditions for further implementation of the social justice goals set out in the Government's programme and for maintaining the political domination of the left-wing centre over the right parties."
According to the party's former leaders, the discussion has so far “held an emotion-based expression of opinion without specific arguments”.
The authors are concerned that the unintended actions of their party can lead Lithuania to political, economic and social instability.
A fine was imposed on a disabled person named Anton Mamaev.
Mossgorsud reduced the punishment of disabled rider Anton Mamaev from four and a half years of imprisonment to a fine of 200 thousand rubles.
Prior to the decision of the Timorese Court, the convicted person was released from SISO.
Mossgorsud confirmed that the accused was a criminal because he had organized the burglary and kidnapping of the former Specialist.
By its decision, Mosgorsud reduced the punishment of Anton Mamayev to 200 thousand rubs.
“Mamaev is an organizer of the massacre, which also constitutes a crime, and, accordingly, such a person must be brought into criminal responsibility”, explained “U” press secretary of Mosgorsud Uljan Solopova.
In this case, the court took into account the health situation of Mamaev, the actual circumstances of the case, the absence of extenuating circumstances.
In addition, the court applied article 64 of the FMR, which stipulates that punishment may be imposed below the limit.
With regard to Assistant Mamaeva Vasilija Serostanov, the court did not determine the circumstances that would give rise to a change in the weight category of the soda and a change in the sentence.
Anton Mamaev himself stated that Mosgorsud's decision was not satisfactory.
I'm disappointed with the court's decision.
The only legal solution would be the justification for continuing to fight for justice.
His lawyer, Andrei Orlov, did not rule out the appeal of the sentence in the Mosgorsud cassation court and the Supreme Court.
"We will use all the resources to the European Court of Human Rights," he said.
Remember, 28-year-old Mosquito Anton Mamaev, who suffered from spinal atrophy, became a criminal case last autumn.
The invalid claims that he bought a motorbike in a company known for 160 thousand rubles to sell.
However, the owners of the motorcycle, including the former specialist fighter, said that the disabled person and his assistant Vasili Serostanov had chosen property from them, threatening to resort to violence.
On 30 June, the Timorese District Court of Moscow sentenced Vasilia Serostanov to three years in a colony, and Anton Mamayeva to four and a half years in prison with a general regime sentence (art. 2, para.
After the displaced person was placed in SISO, the case was brought before the Public Chamber, the Office of the Attorney-General of the Office of Human Rights with President Tatyana Moskalkova.
As a result, in mid-July, Anton Mamaev was released from the SISO by the same decision of the Timorese Court.
The defence, in turn, regretted the decision of the first instance in Mosgorsud.
NF will prepare a report on the environment for the President
The Final Forum for Action of the General People's Front (ONF) will address environmental issues in 2017, reported the source to the UNF and confirmed the head of the Aleksei Anisim movement.
According to him, the Frontowics Forum plans to prepare a report to the President on the problems of the home environment and to propose a strategy for their solution.
The UNF Co-Chairmen noted that the report of the Head of State would contain a “deep analysis” of the situation in all federal districts of the country.
According to the “Reports”, the final UNF forum will be held in the autumn.
The exact date of its implementation has not yet been defined, usually based on the President ' s schedule, which is the leader of the movement and is traditionally present at the key activities of the UNF.
The Front held several interregional environmental conferences, one for two federal districts, in Rostov-Na-Don, Kaliningrad and Kirov.
The outcome will be a conference in the capital of the Republic of Buratía Ulan-Ude.
On the basis of the proposals that have been made and will be made on these events, we are also making systematic proposals to address environmental problems - the UNF co-rapporteur told the Reports.
The Co-Chairman of the Central Staff of Olga Timofeeva, headed by the Committee on the Environment and Environment, reported that the “frontiers” would report to the head of the State on the work carried out within the framework of the Year of the Environment in Russia.
The outcome of the environmental forum and the UNF Forum of Action are likely to be consolidated.
Over the year, we have grown up by a powerful team of environmental experts, seen gaps in legislation, stopped dozens of violations of the law.
All of this will be in the report that we are preparing for the President as the leader of our movement.
In addition to this document, “frontiers” are also reported on the priority projects of the UNF,” said Olga Timofeev.
She said that a special representative of the Head of State on environmental, environmental and transport activities would be invited to the forum.
He had already participated in the NF Media Forum, which was held in St. Petersburg in April.
A few months later, the Year of Ecology will go into history, and the most important thing to do today is to start environmental mechanisms to work for years.
To prevent these issues from coming out of the agenda, Olga Timofeva added.
The head of the Regional Policy Laboratory of the Institute for Social Research (EISI) Andrey Koladin noted: by raising the environmental issue, the NF is acting on the presidential agenda.
Many things they as experts have offered in various forums, and these initiatives have been supported by the President, said Andrey Koladin.
He stressed that the economic capacity of the environmental agenda could not be excluded to date, which could give regions additional impetus for development.
Further, with the help of the UNF, the regions will be able not only to overcome their environmental problems but also to develop ecotourism, the expert added.
The current environmental issue demonstrated "direct line" with Vladimir Putin in June.
In particular, questions were raised to the President about the garbage dump in Balashte (already closed) and about coal dust in the port of Nahnka (a bill has already been drafted to ban open coal spills in human settlements, one of the authors of Olga Timofeva).
Environmental experts believe that the legal basis for addressing the environmental problems in Russia as a whole has been established, the issue is further in law enforcement and civil society.
It is necessary to implement clearly the decisions taken by the State - consider the head of the Ecology for All - Leonid Bochin charity fund.
A member of the SPC, Head of the NGO Greens of Russia, Sergey Kiplenkov, stressed that a responsible approach to society and business was needed to address environmental problems successfully, some legislative efforts were limited.
As soon as society and business realize that the solution to environmental problems is a much more strategic step, the situation will change, Sergey Kiplenkov noted.
The expert stressed that there was a need to break the trend that the violation of environmental legislation was an economic advantage for business.
The British inventor used a microchip to get into the house and a machine with his hands around.
The British inventor became the first man in the country to have a microchip set up so that he could open the door of his home, enter the office, and even drive the car with a simple hand.
Steven Nortem, 30 years old, used a tiny chip between large and indicative fingers and now, through his BioTek company, offers this service to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives for technology.
He joined Dr. Jeff Watson, an anesthesiologist from the Queen of Winchester, in order to ensure that the practice was conducted in accordance with medical standards.
Technology is like a microchip that uses cats and dogs, and the procedure takes only 30 seconds.
Nortema also replaces castles in houses and cars with a price chip of 300 pounds per castle.
The father of one child has already established technology in his home and in his BMW Z4 car, which is being manufactured when his hand is on the roll.
A requirement for the White House was imposed on taxpayers in thousands of dollars
According to the reports of the armed forces provided by the TIME magazine, the White House's decision last month to force a seabed helicopter on the South Pole to an event dedicated to American industrial production was worth $24,000 to taxpayers.
The White Green Sikorsky VH-3D, known as the Marine One, when on board, became the central element of the 17 July event in the White House, which demonstrated American construction programmes.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pens and senior White House officials have examined technological products from all 50 states.
The helicopter, which was constructed in Connecticut, was displayed next to the Man State plane, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a Mississippi truck.
According to the records of the First Marine Heat Heat Heat Escadril (HMX-1), the Heat Management Division, the Military Office of the White House had arranged for the presence of a helicopter in a private order, or FRAGO, only 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the Southbed on an “unusual” event.
“I just wanted you to make sure that you were in the course, because this is an unusually well-known event in the press,” said Commander HMX-1 in an electronic letter to his superior, the first Deputy Head of the Marine Foot Corps Air Force, before the event.
The letter indicated that the helicopter would arrive at the South Pole about 7 a.m. on 17 July to participate in the three-day event, and would remain there before the halo would be released between 6 and 9 evenings on the same day.
The letter adds that if the departure from the White House is delayed, a second flight crew will be required in accordance with working hours limits.
The first crew escorted the helicopter during the event and the security officers stayed close to the aircraft while it was on the ground.
It was unclear whether the second crew was required from the Time magazine.
The Hetcha Act prohibits federal officials from using public property for political purposes.
According to the records, HMX-1 clarified whether the event was contrary to this decision.
“We asked, among other things, whether it was a violation of the Hatch law, and we were told that there was no,” the commander wrote.
“You don’t seem to be here anywhere,” said the deputy chief.
The event “Sdelano in America” was announced by the White House as an official event, and the Hetch Act did not apply to it.
But even official activities have political notes.
During the course of the event, the President made efforts to promote the health reform that was then being developed in the Senate and commended efforts to regulate government decisions.
The use of aircraft known as Marine One and Air Force One for political purposes is hardly new.
Presidents are required to use them for travel.
But to ask them only for photo opportunities is unusual.
The tramp had already been discussed in February, when the Presidential plane was on its way back at its first pre-election meeting in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account had been seized with complaints about the use of the Presidential plane by his predecessor.
“A White House in the wake of the show “Sdelano in America”, which presented products from 50 states made by American workers from American materials,” said White House Deputy Secretary of the White House, Lindsey Walters.
Teams of HMX-1 often operate training flights around the Washington Aglomeration and on the South Coast to train the transportation of the President of the United States to the White House, exactly before the thumb.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in early July in Germany, HMX-1 conducted 58 training sessions at the White House.
According to one of the officers, the flight carried out for the "Delano in America" event was counted as the necessary training flights per month.
The unit's helicopters also spent 11 additional hours on “non-presidency support” that day.
According to the White House, taxpayers were not charged for any of the other exhibitors present at the event.
The representative of Sikorsky reported that the company had not taken part in the organization of the helicopter demonstration in the South Lusaka.
HMX-1 does not take into account the budget for the presidential elections, and it is difficult to determine the exact amount spent on the event.
However, according to the time rates of the Ministry of Defence for 2017 fiscal year, the rate of reimbursement of the Ministry of Defence for VH-3D is $24,380 per flight.
The unit records that the flight time in the air was 30 minutes on each side of its airport based on the Quantico Marine Aviation Base in Virginia.
The White House argues that the real value of the helicopter is much lower than that rate.
“To count the value of taxpayers, based on the indicative rate of reimbursement, is completely wrong”, says Walters.
“These exemplary rates include personal composition, servicing and many other non-refundable costs that are included in the annual appropriation”.
According to a 2015 study by the RED Corporation, reimbursement rates do not include the personal value but indeed take into account the value of the fuel, services and costs specified in the contract.
At the time, the former White House Press Secretary, Sean Spaiser, spoke for the protection of the use of the helicopter for the event.
“The idea is to show this week things done in America,” Spaiser said.
“And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to national security, and that they exist, I suppose, hundreds, if not thousands of people, whose jobs depend on it.
And I think like most Americans, we're all proud of this helicopter and other military technology that so many Americans have been constantly working on.
It is, of course, appropriate to draw that attention.”
It was not clear whether Trump was interacting with the helicopter, watching the South Pole during the event, but he was sitting right in the driver ' s seat in the fire car.
Within the White House, Trump addressed Sikorsky's representatives, with a press release on his own fleet of company products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the President. "I have three of them."
Moscow will provide grants for city hospitals' rehabilitation offices
Every year, the Rescue Grants will be awarded to the resuscitations and offices of intensive treatment of capital clinics.
The funds will be used to promote doctors and nurses.
M. Moscow, Sergei Sobianin, visited the City Hospital for the name of Judah.
During his examination of the clinic, he handed a thank-you letter to the orthopedic physician Victor Procco, who led the most difficult operation to rebuild the adolescent's stage.
Sergei Sobianin also told of the decision to allocate grants to the resuscitation and intensive treatment of urban clinics annually.

Currently, the medical office is expected to receive more than a thousand patients.
In addition to reinvigorating and stationing, there are daily offices.
The hospital staff consists of 2,800 people.
The total area of the clinic is 23.7 hours.
In February of this year, the hospital was part of the pilot project for the organization of short-term accommodation stations (SPS).
They are intended for relatively small operations.
The surgery process uses advanced medical equipment to significantly reduce patients ' rehabilitation time.
After the operation at the station, they spend a few hours.
Only during the first half of the current year in the clinic on behalf of Judine was hospitalized for 36,000 patients.
Medical staff performed 15800 operations of a variety of complexity.
The NGO reported the lack of Ukrainian "daughter" Sberbank
In the Nazbanke Ukraine (NBU), there were no applications for the purchase of the Ukrainian "daughter" of Sberbank.
This is reported on Friday, 4 August, by TASS with reference to the NGO press representative.
The NGO confirms that on 3 August 2017, a package of documents from Belarus and Cyprus, Victor Prokopani, to agree on the acquisition of 100 per cent of Sberbank shares (through Paritybanks) was withdrawn.
"There were no documents from other potential investors for the purchase of shares in Sberbank in the NGO," the report noted.
On 3 August, Belarusian businessman Victor Prokopenja withdrew the application for the purchase of Sberbank's subsidiary structure.
On 28 July, it was known that the Bank of Ukraine had refused to acquire a Ukrainian "daughter" of Sberbank to Russian businessmen Sayid Guceriev and Grigory Guselnik.
The regulator justified its decision that businessmen had not provided the necessary documents to verify their compliance with the requirements of Ukraine ' s legislation.
Sberbank reported on the sale of its Ukrainian daughter to Norvik Banka consortium and a private Belarusian company in March of this year.
The majority shareholder of the consortium was Said Guceriev, the son of the Russian businessman Mikhail Guceriev.
Sanctions against the “daughter” of five Russian banks in Ukraine, including Sberbank, were introduced in mid-March.
During the year, they were prohibited from withdrawing capital from the country for the benefit of maternal organizations.

Democracy in Afghanistan depends on the role of women in politics, said in the UN.
Elections can only be representative when all members of society, including women, are involved in them, as the UN Mission Head in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
According to Nicolas Heisoma, the Head of the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, hundreds of women are involved in elections in the provincial councils, three women are fighting for the vice-presidential position, and more than 30 per cent of the newly registered voters are women.

Electricity saves both for the inhabitants and for the cargo producers of Bouratia
The efforts of the Soviet and post-Soviet authorities of the Republic of Burma (East Siberia) to establish fair tariffs for electricity users have begun to bear fruit.
From 1 September to 25 per cent, the value of electricity is reduced in low voltage for industrial recipients.
The Federal Antitrust Service of the country, in accordance with the Government of the Republic of Russia ' s Resolution on the Amendment to the Rules of the Optic Market for Electricity and Power and the Combined Prognose Balance of Production and Delivery of Electricity (Power) within the framework of the Single Energy System of Russia on the Subjects of the Russian Federation ' (No. 842) has established indicative prices for electricity and power for industrial users in the Republic of Burma since 17.07.2017.
As a result, the cost of electricity for storm-producing producers is reduced by four, making life much easier for small and medium-sized enterprises and individual entrepreneurs.
For decades, the leaders of the Republic have been on the thresholds of Moscow's cabinets in an attempt to compare the region in tariffs with the nearby Irkutian region with the hydroelectric cascade in Ankara, from the Baykala, the main water collection territory for which Burratia is located.
And only this year the movement began.
In March, electricity tariffs for the population of the Republic fell from 4.24 rubles/kWh to 3.93 rubles/kWhh, or 7.3 per cent.
With the inclusion of the Bureau of the Federal Government in the List of Prices Areas of the opt-market, for which the characteristics of the operation of opt- and different markets have been established among industrial consumers.
According to analysts, this is only the beginning, as the Irkutian population pays for a kilowatt/hour of 1.01 rubles.
But no one dares to mention at least the approximate date of the new tariff movements towards the humiliation of the Burratia.

National Professional Union of Unqualified, Municipal and Carousel Workers (GMB) is concerned about capital investment at McVitie's factory in Glasgow
The trade union requires guarantees from the managers of the McVitie's biscuit manufacturer for his long-term manufacturing obligation in Glasgow.
The Scotland branch of GMB reports that the company has closed down the issue of future investment in the Tolcross facility.
More than 500 people work at the factory producing Hobnobs and Rich Tea among other products.
Pladis, owner of McVitie's, reports that more than 5 million pounds have been invested in the facility over the last few years.
The company adds that in the case of any change in the staff member's work and the union's representatives, “they are the first to know”.
In a letter to the head of the company, the Scottish office of GMB requested McVitie's responses to concern that funding would not be allowed to modernize production lines.
Senior organizer Drew Daffi said: “Our trade union members are deeply concerned that we cannot obtain clarity from the head of the facility on business needs and investment plan regarding the future of Tolcross”.
Families worked here for generations, and the concentration of large workers in local society and in the territory of the Greater Glazgo; this was an important pillar of decent work in the territory of high unemployment and social degradation.
Thus, in terms of jobs, wages and prosperity, and in the background of Brexit, the growth of living minima and the chronic decline of production, East End Glazgo desperately needs to flourish in McVitie's factory.
According to the representative of Pladis, “The Tolcrosian Head only received a letter from the Scottish GMB office yesterday, and the company will respond immediately, as we appreciate our continued cooperation with staff and trade union representatives.”
Two months ago, we held a regular meeting with GMB staff and representatives in Tolcross, where a number of issues were discussed openly.
We have talked to staff about how all companies working in the most competitive and unstable economic climate are constantly reviewing our actions – and this concerns all our facilities and activities – to remain competitive.
“In recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our tolcross facility, especially in production lines and improving functional indicators.”
We are fully aware of the value of Tolcross as a production facility, and in the case of any changes to this facility, staff and trade union representatives will be aware of this first.”
Putin stated that the authorities would not give direction to Rosnefti and Gazprom
Vladimir Putin said that the issue of gas supplies to the Eastern Petroleum Company (WNCC) should be connected to the Kremlin and the Cabinet of Ministers, but the Gazprom guidelines, as well as Rosnefti, would not be given.
Thus, Russian President Vladimir Putin responded to Igor Sečin ' s request to help resolve the conflicts.
The Head of State drew attention to the fact that relations between Rosneft and Gazprom should be decided solely on the basis of market principles.
Former Head of Rosnefti Igor Sechin at the meeting on major investment projects in the Far East Federal District said that the lack of agreement with Gazprom on gas for WNCC threatened the project.
The case noted that the dialogue with Gazprom on this issue continued.
Gazprom suggests finding gas resources from Rosnefti, but we don't have such resources," he added.
Recall that Rosneft asked to be allowed to use it for the East Oil Chemical Company gas from the Kyrin village of Gazproma, located on the Shelf Sahalin.
In June, Gazprom stated that negotiations on the issue continued, and “there are no sharp corners”.

The La League participant may regret his interest in Marko Verratti
Pari Saint-German will not stop chasing Neimar after the club has offered 189 million pounds for his ransom, but did they warn Barcelona about the world record of the three years ago?
The sensational proposal brought about a more summer transfer window when League 1 was ready to hit a world record of transition worth more than twice the previous note relating to the return of Pogba to Manchester United in the last 89 million pounds.
When the transition is over, Neimar will become the most expensive player in the world, as well as the most highly paid professional athlete in the world, since the PSC offers him over 500,000 pounds a week.
It is known that Barcelona is angry with the proposal and how Neimar broke the contract, despite the fact that, according to a source close to the leadership of the Catalan club, the club has always done its best to play since its transition from Santos in 2013.
But wasn't the football world warned of this possibility three years ago by the president of the PSC?
When Manchester City expressed interest in Blaza Matouidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Helaifi issued a strong warning to every club that wanted to turn one of the best players of PSG.
“I am not worried because they know that if they touch one of our games, then we will fight them, we will make offers to their games,” said Al-Helifi.
“We respect all clubs.
But if they try to recruit one of our games, then their consequences are expected."
According to the opinion, Barcelona crossed this line when the Spanish club expressed interest in the semi-protector from the PZP Marko Verratti earlier this summer.
The PSC indicated that it would not release the Italian game of assembly under any circumstances, and now it is likely that Barcelona feels the consequences of its proposal as a loss of one of its most valuable players, Neimar.
