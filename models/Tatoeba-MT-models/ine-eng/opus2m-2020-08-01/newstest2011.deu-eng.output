What are they supposed to do, the ČSSD? The Czech Social Democrats in Prague don't know the Voldemort, nor the "Conditori".
The new city councillors from the ČSSD series will obviously have to overcome certain language barriers in order to understand their old-new colleagues from the ODS in the Prague Council and in the city representation at all.
The Aktuální.cz newspaper has once "decoupled" members of the new ČSSD Council, as they have ruled the notorical snake that has been born in recent years, where the present coalition partners in Prague were at the ruder.
The coded vocabulary introduced by Mayor Pavel Bém of Prague's political elite in the busy era is rejected by some of the most famous actors, situations and causes.
Surprisingly it turned out that the new councils had something to do with what these new terms were saying in the dark.
At least they claimed that.
"Who's Voldemort?"
"I don't know."
"I am rather a new man in Prague's politics," said Lukaš Kaucky, the new Councilman for Culture, who responded to the test of the "paten word treasure".
But also Councillor Karel Březina - a political veteran - reacted similarly.
For example, the term "golfloch".
"That is the only expression of those you present here to me that I use again and again."
" Otherwise, I don't think much of a snake."
Out of the vocabulary published by the daily Aktuální.cz in June this year before the ODS election congress, the editorial took out six terms, especially those that are notorically linked to the Prague Magistrate.
The Social Democrats should define the terms "Voldemort", "the largest Prague Golfloch", "to go to the conditorium", "Stiernack", "Treaty of the capital" and "Blush".
Three Prague Councillors agreed to the test, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, the future head of Prague School - promised his participation in the conversation first, but then did not even take his ears off.
The fifth Councillor, Petr Dolínek, rejected the test from the front.
"I don't care about these things, and I don't judge how the bourgeois Democrats treat each other."
"It is important to me how we understand ourselves in our programmes," he said.
As already indicated, Lukaš Kaucký would not have recognized in the above-mentioned battle lines that the influential entrepreneur and friend of former mayor Bem, Roman Janousek, is the talk.
The term "Voldemort" says nothing at all, and the only term he got right at the test was "the largest Prague Golfloch".
"That's the Blanka tunnel," says Kaucky, but he added to the security: "But I know that from the paper."
And hilariously, "I'll have to take a language course."
The "Golfloch" is then deciphered not only by Matador Karel Březina, but also by the Council for Environmental Questions Lukáš Plachý as a blanka tunnel.
But both Social Democrats also know who the term Voldemort stands for and Lukaš Plachý doesn't even know where to find this figure and also what it means to "go to the restaurant".
"I think that means going to some Prague gastronomy company," Plachý is pretty close to the solution when you know that this is about Janousek's company.
In agreement with Březina, however, he feels that this knowledge was more of a newspaper than that it was his own treasure.
According to the decision of the test participants, it does not seem to give the social democrats a similar snake.
"I have also asked my colleagues, but obviously there is nothing like this with us."
"We call ourselves by name, we also use shorts or nicknames again," says the president of Prague ČSSD Petr Hulinský - named by his partner Salop "Hulda".
"In school I was called Bříza (Birke), but I don't know if my colleagues call me that," Karel Březina tells us.
The newspaper Deník Aktuální.cz has tried the name and see there - it works.
Counsellor Weinert is friendly to the "opa" or less friendly to the "Old", the representative Miroslav Poche, who took note of himself before the elections by the parties sponsoring, is called "Igráček" by some colleagues (known Czech lego figure).
This is the only sign that allows the Social Democrats to use their own language.
Hulínský is not allowed to be named after Hulda, but Deník Aktuálně.cz registered another top name of the Prague President.
His top name "Doctor of the Gummyknüppel-Recht" suggests that Petr Hulinský acquired his title Doctor juris at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to ban the torture of "Hexen" and issued a brochure
Women who are sealed to hexen in Burkina Faso usually show some common social characteristics.
They belong to the older generation, they do not find work - for example for health reasons, they are free and they do not have children.
If one of these women becomes a witch, she is strictly isolated so that she cannot be dangerous to the rest of the village.
"Men are quite rarely affected by this fate."
"And young and healthy women remain spared because they help with work and give birth to children," a sister described the situation in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso in a special home for more than a hundred women who were expelled from their communities.
The local government has now decided to take action against this abnormal "social measure".
And for this reason, a brochure was published that was intended to stop "Hexenhunting".
But the thing has a hook.
"More than 70 percent of all adults in Burkina Faso cannot read," the newspaper "the Standard" pointed to the dilemma of the written explanation.
To be seen as a witch is also to be seen in other African countries.
In Ghana, the neighbouring country of Burkina Faso, the 27-year-old Amy Hemmahová was tortured by three women and two men to death - they poured them with oil and burned them.
The BBC server also reported on this incident.
The perpetrators claimed, however, that the matter would only have been a meeting of unfortunate circumstances.
According to your version, oil is flamed out, which is used for ritual anointings.
And after the group tried to "a wicked spirit" from the woman.
The isolation of "Hexen" supports people here regardless of their education.
"The standard" quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso as saying: "The women of human souls are a danger before today," he said.
While the government in Burkina Faso is at least trying to sharpen the Hexenjagd, the Gambian President himself has been very well involved last year.
"President Yahya Jammeh invented a monstrous witch warlord after the death of his aunt, as they allegedly had a share in their death and would now try to kill the president himself by black magic."
"He called for help from the nearby Guinean woman who was violently taken out of Gambian villages and brought to the president's farm in Kanilai, accompanied by policemen, soldiers and the President's bodyguard," said Amnesty International in her report.
On the farm people were forced to drink an extract from plants with hallucinogenic effects, but also caused problems in the intestines and kidneys.
Two of the arrested people did not survive the stay on the farm.
Only because of the international pressure did the almost thousands of prisoners be released again.
A tenant of Bakala: He heats in the oven - yet he pays higher rent
An older subordinate just leaves the client centre of the company RPG Byty of the "cool baron" Zdeněk Bakala, the largest owner of private apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under the arm a folder with three new leases to three apartments: for his own and his own daughter's and his son's apartments, which are just a penalty for imprisonment.
All three of them have just increased their rent in the context of the so-called "deregulation".
Instead of 3500 kroner monthly rentals, the son will cover 4100 kroner for a 2-room apartment next year with kitchen in the second category.
"And there is no even flowing hot water in the apartment and you have to heat in a simple coal oven," he says angryly with the finger on the new contract of the son's rental, to which he has a full power.
"But what - I signed it," he explains half-confirmed and half-resigned.
BytyOKD.cz, which called the new rental conditions "incorrect and immoral", advises the tenants not to sign the new contracts and wait until 7 December, where they think of publishing a guide as opposed to such contracts.
But the man only wins.
"One says this, the other says it," he makes a window face.
The region of Ostrava is thus the largest deregulation laboratory.
After a new year, this deregulation is before most of the rentals in the Czech Republic, whose tenants have not yet paid marketable rent.
Currently.cz therefore decided to visit this "labor" personally.
The RPG Warteraum in Havířov is one of four in the Ostrava region and already nine in the morning this Tuesday is breaking full.
Just next to the door, the bodyguards of a security agency and a phone call to her.
"Final 2011", a special key field lights on the touchscreen.
Briefly tapped and the device is already picking up a number list.
We have barely deciphered the number "157" and already taps it on the large display on the roof of the waiting room.
A half second later you're on the line.
Later, an older couple enter the waiting room to ask for the rent, but the stress in the waiting room apparently does not apply to the new rent.
Most people are here to solve the common problems - repairs, insurance matters and so on.
From mid-November in the region of Ostrava, the envelopes with the new rental contracts are the most tenants of the total 44,000 apartments in the RPG portfolio in the mailboxes.
The RPG Byty suggests in the letters a rental increase of about 15 to 38 percent.
The special switch for new rentals in the customer centre has been open since 18 November.
"The action runs a little over a week, i.e. it's only the beginning," the ladies behind the switch respond after a moment of delay when the "client" comes out as a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakala's former mining apartments are a brilliant topic.
Prior to the elections, the parliamentary vice president from Ostrava, Lubomír Zaorálek, had taken up this subject quite loudly from the ČSSD, no wonder that today the newspapers are full of it.
"Twenty years I want a new floor from them."
"Not at all. WC-glass could replace them," says the man mentioned at the outset.
So far, according to the employees, in particular the tenants are on the switch to make sure that they actually receive the promised rent reduction that promises them RPG when they sign the special offer in time.
The other tenants who are signing the new lease until 15 December will also benefit from a semi-reduced February rental.
So far, however, "deregulation switch" in Havířov is anything but overloaded by demand.
"Only about 40 to 50 of the tenants from the 360 clients were hired in 2011 because of this," the switch officials estimate.
RPG offers individual rental agreements on its websites as well as wall tables where it appears necessary.
But if the rental parties do not agree on the new lease, they will be determined by an independent court.
"This should not be a threat, but it is as information about the only possible and completely legitimate legal practices to understand," explains RPG on its websites.
"No one goes to court here," says one of the employees of RPG Byty and a man on the street before the client centre gives her at least a partial right.
"I have 13,000 (Kronen) rents, of which 5,000 are left for food, where I should collect the money for a trial," he says.
Then the employees will be uncertain.
"Look."
"Mr. Zaorálek tells them about the media that they shouldn't sign and that's how people are waiting," they say.
The regulated rent ends in most of the Czech Republic to New Year 2011 and according to RPG Byty, the increase in rent is an economic necessity.
"The existing height of rents is not enough to maintain the housing fund," argues Pavel Klimeš, director of the housing portfolio of the company RPG Byty and - precisely the neglect of the housing fund, which the tenants have criticised, is in the opinion of the houseowners of the main reason for the increase in rent.
While RPG was able to invest in the apartments in the years between 2005 and 2010, it is expected that it will be 5.2 billion in the four years from 2011 to 2014.
On the large-format LCD display on the deck opposite the wrist seats in Havířov’s waiting room, however, a few red lights appear again and again.
"The rental increases in 2011 amounted to 15% and less to 31,200 apartments, which means more than 90% of RPG apartments."
"This always means a maximum of 7.50 CZK per square metre and month", is to be read on the LCD monitor.
Only 400 apartments from the portfolio of RPG increase the rent by 38 percent.
"In these cases, there is an extremely low rental price of 19.66 CZK per square metre," argues RPG.
In 2600 apartments the rent will remain at the same height next year.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation does not slow the tenants down, but gradually takes place within four and eight years.
What's more - the company has another obligation: All income from the increase in rent (see diagram) wants to get back into the apartments, especially in the heat savings - in new windows and in the heat barrier.
But, above all, these are to benefit those who sign the agreement on the increase.
The architects see - the office also belongs to a children's garden
The office building Avriopoint in Brno is the new seat of the company Arch.Design.
But who here would expect a mini-child garden, with all that belongs to it: colorful walls, creative furniture, a lot of toys and even a mini-game space on the outdoor terrace.
This children's garden has been available to Arch.Design employees since last year.
The design and architecture office Arch.Design, from which the studios originate a whole series of well-known buildings, calculated from the first designs for the new building Avriopoint with the premises for its firm mini-garden.
In a wise estimate, because most of his 90 employees (inside) are in the babyboom age and the company is located that the project antennas and architects return to their workplace as soon as possible.
Together with the possibility to work short, the kindergarten is another bonus, the arch.design has to offer its employees in the concept of its social program.
The construction engineers and architects have so much easier to bring their demanding profession and childcare under a hat.
The mini-child garden is an original idea of the employees (inside) of Arch.Design and with the support of management, they managed to earn funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs for their project.
The operating mini-child garden is financed by the Operational Programme on Human Resources and Employment through the European Social Fund and the State budget of the Czech Republic.
This funding (CZK 2.8 million grants) enabled the necessary facilities and equipment to be provided and for the duration of 2 years is provided for qualified staff and for the operation.
After exploding the funds (2 years) the company Arch.Design is obliged to continue operating the mini-child garden for another 3 years at its own cost.
The preparation of this project took place all year round, with the company Economy Rating providing effective assistance in the processing of applications.
A fully qualified staff - a nurse and a teacher of the kindergarten - is responsible for the care of the children, while most of them are over three years of age.
And since this is about a mini-garden, only 5 children may be present at the same time, however, the day varies over several children.
The children's garden is flexible to the needs of the parents, who have the same rights in relation to the use of the children's garden - regardless of the company hierarchy and their respective position.
Although this is individual education and care, the programme content in the mini-child garden is still comparable to the pre-school framework.
The children are not only playing here, especially they are offered excellent training - from basic knowledge to pre-school education, and they are also learning English.
The classroom is not only equipped with toys and creative games, but also equipped with a computer available to children.
What is more - the presence of small children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive corporate environment.
Parents can take a look at the children at any time and thus escape the stress of late pick-up of the children from a distant kindergarten.
Parents therefore make more productive use of their working time.
No wonder that natural and loyal employers' relations are developing here too.
Arch.Design thus selected among the Czech companies that offer significant benefits in the application of new employees, which are family-friendly and strengthen their personal marketing through such programs.
A bone house also fascinates after 100 years. See the interior of Gaudi
The roof encourages like the back of a prehistoric axis, the stairs like the vertebral column of a dinosaur and the balconies are dissolved fish mills.
This is the Casa Batlló of the Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
The house with its organic forms received the nickname "Knochenhaus" from the local residents.
Organic shapes, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, tile fragments and mosaics, the facades and all-modern soft lines, all these are typical features of Antonio Gaudi's youth style.
The facade of the house plays with dreamy lines, tender colors and textures that remind nature and creatures.
Only with a more accurate view can you see that everything is dominated by geometry, rhythm, and thoughtful order.
In the night, the whole facade is even more plastic, more dramatic, and the special lighting is still enhancing the brightness of the colors.
The same swingful lines and curved shapes also dominate the interior of the house.
Well-formed wood copies the window frames, gels, seal elements of doors, even gecko holes and performances.
The house Batlló in the Eixample district on the lively shopping street Passeig de Gràcia No. 43 was created by the reconstruction of a house in 1877, performed by architect Emilio Sala Cortese.
The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrial Josep Batlló, originally stood on the edge of the old and the construction of a completely new building, but finally he agreed to the idea of Gaudís on an unusual and even cheaper reconstruction.
However, the House of Rent Casa Batlló designed Antoni Gaudí not alone.
He worked with architect Josep Maria Jujol.
The decorations for the representative apartment of the real owner and also the use of mosaics on the facade were his idea.
However, many other artists and artists also worked with the design of the facade.
The joint work on the drafts for Casa Batlló was the beginning of fruitful cooperation between Jujola and Gaudí.
Jujol also participated in the construction of Gaudís House Casa Milá in Park Güell, where there are also other works by Antoni Gaudí.
Shortly after its completion, the house was given by the domestic residents of its organic forms because of the peak name "Knochenhaus".
Others referred to it as the special window opening mechanism because of the "appropriate house".
It is also said that on the very top of the building the sword of the holy Georg, the patron of Catalonia, was represented.
But also other imagery elements symbolize hidden religious motives.
Gaudí designed for the house a unique central heating system with ventilation channels and typical fireplaces for the time being.
Something strange is already encouraging her 45 degree trend.
In his creation, Gaudí ignored all the construction regulations at the time and was not deceived by them.
Although before the construction began, he obtained the relevant building permit from the city, but the information he had made about the planned reconstruction was so vague that the city's fathers were so excited about the outcome that they demanded relief two years later when they finished.
Among other things, the councillors insisted that the construction with its pillars even interfere with the public.
However, there was no change, on the contrary - only fifteen days after this call for the city district, Joseph Batlló applied for permission to rent the two highest floors of the house - and it was granted to him quickly.
The owner himself entered the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a living room, on the third floor there were the bedrooms and private rooms of the apartment.
The ground floor was sealed to a jewelry store.
The whole six-storey building goes through a staircase up to the roof terrace.
Through the fundamental elements of the reconstruction, all right angles and straight lines were removed and replaced by curved and curved walls.
Gaudí, however, also worked on a modern concept for the mutual connection of spaces.
The social part can be fully connected by opening the salon doors, so that a larger society could boast comfortably without having to give up some intimacy in more confidential conversations.
The house was renovated by Gaudís except for a new facade also a fairly unusual roof and two other floors.
Gaudí's game with the light as well as the blue and white glass tiles with which the inner courtyard is covered and the lighthouses are also impressive.
The game of these two colors gives all the floors of the house a maximum light.
He simply made use of the principle that white reflects the light better than dark colors that absorb the sunlight instead.
The Casa Batlló house, which was included in the Unesco World Heritage List in 2005, can visit anyone today.
On the first floor the most spacious and magnificent apartment of the public is made available.
The houseowners decided only this year to take this step and this on the occasion of the 150th birthday of the famous Creator.
When it was found that this was a fairly profitable business, the visits were kept, as they were also extended to other common and roofed spaces, including the roof terrace.
However, the price for visiting the building age is not a paper style; it is 16.50 euros, students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist exhibitions get 20 percent discount.
This amount exceeds the entry price for other Gaudí buildings in the city.
Those who want to know the real atmosphere of the house with their dragon towers should try to close friendship with one of the householders and visit it at home.
The right mattress and the right bed rest? Women have desires other than men
Not the greatest beds, but the quality of the bed area - i.e. mattresses and rust make up the good bed.
However, these must be complemented harmoniously in order to meet the wishes of the user.
Many things play a role in the selection - the weight, the size, the state of health and, last but not least, the sex of the sleeper.
Also important is the interior in which mattresses and rust are to be subjected.
Typical example?
In a weekend house where latex mattresses are not regularly heated, they need much longer to be "warm".
In addition, they are significantly more difficult than usual polyurethane mattresses.
And they should be returned regularly.
If they do not have enough vents in the core and are still on a hard plate, moisture is called: It is therefore not excluded that it is formed under their mold.
Of course, the choice also plays a role in what you are accustomed to.
Those who have been abroad for a long time, where very high mattresses with soft layer are used, will find it difficult to get used to a low mattress with hard surface.
"Well all the ice hockey players who came back from the NHL have complained to me that they can no longer sleep properly here."
"For their hidden shoulders, furs and hips they simply need a soft layer of visco foam (Memory Foam - a form memory polymer)."
"I recommend these, among other things, also sugar-sick people who suffer from a nervous system disorder, so that they can receive the "information" from the joints and the skin badly," explains Silva Hadamkíková, who specializes in powder furniture.
That's why I've taken care of many ice hockey players years ago, but also other customers with Visco foam (Memory Foam).
"Today this is no longer a problem, because such mattresses offer, among other things, the Tempur manufacturer, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech producer Tropico."
And you don't have to be a famous ice hockey player to appreciate the benefits of visco foam.
This "Wonder" actually works very simply.
The foam optimizes its heat and shape according to the absorbed heat, in other words, it regularly softens on the warm body.
Nowhere does it push, in the night you don't wander around like after a hard fight.
You just sleep a lot better.
The viscoelastic foam also offers protection against decubitus (Wundbrand).
When selecting the size of the mattress, you should still count the length of the soles, i.e. about 21 to 34 cm.
Men like women who are 180 cm tall need a 210 to 220 cm long bed.
Each sleeper should be at least 90 cm wide, i.e. 180 cm wide.
For single beds, for example, for singles, 120 to 140 cm are installed.
The comfort half and also for any visitors.
Otherwise, the following Faust rule applies to the ideal bed width: "If you are on the back, there should still be enough room for the slightly angled arms," says Ing. Helena Prokopová, the master of the gymnasium and gymnasium, who has been devoted to the problems of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture for years and also to specialized schools.
In a double bed, each needs his own cheese and his own mattresses, but watch out when buying, so that the mattresses are the same.
Otherwise, nothing else will be left than mounting the rust at different heights and this is no longer possible at all.
foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with spring skeleton 15 cm, of which at least three centimeters should fall on the shape layer and the fine powder.
"By hand or by hand, you must not feel the feathers," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a special type of cheese.
Fully ground beds with mattresses and floors such as grown-up siams have nothing to look for in the bedroom.
These mattresses are not allowed to blow and the relationship cannot be washed, what is already gone and given today.
And since one night you lose between 0.2 and 0.75 l of sweat, it is clear that after five to seven years the mattress becomes slow to a giant (and hidden seven).
This is also why experts reject advertising that promise a lifetime of up to 25 years in mattresses, even lifelong guarantees.
Every thing she's got is fine and fine.
And so a practical advice from the dealers: In mattresses of 120 or 140 cm wide, you should not look at the hygiene of washable, removable relationships, but it is recommended to use a mattress cleaner that can be easily removed and washed.
Even though it is common today to produce mattresses with round-and-line closures, so that after opening you get two half (very important for washing and washing machine size!), the manipulation with larger mattresses, especially performed alone, often like the unequal fight between David and Goliath.
Do they have a hard plate in bed instead of a roast?
Get out of here!
Or at most for a bed for unloved guests and for a single night.
Also, they should prefer to use the plate with air holes (if they are no longer inside) and mattresses with spring skeleton and 15 cm minimum height with so-called pocket spring cores and fine wrists.
Polyurethane mattresses do not contain such a substrate.
For non-adjustable latten roasts with 14 to 18 spring strips (lamelles), latex or sandwich mattresses (if applicable also combinations of latex and coconuts) are always paid with a larger number of latten, i.e. 28 and more spring strips, with Lords support in the Larden Wire area and the possibility of regulating latten hardness.
There are no mattresses with spring skeletal on adjustable lambellar, as they do not react to the ergonomic setting.
In addition to setting the strengths of spring straps, special flexible shoulder modules are also offered.
This is a special fixation of spring straps which enables the spring straps to be pressed or even angled so that they allow the precise insert of the shoulder of the sleeper.
Especially for men with broad shoulders an important thing.
There are even mattress manufacturers who have begun to use soft zones for the shoulder area in the "men's mattresses".
The ladies are also thought of - they like these soft zones in the hip area.
For most demanding customers, puncture flange spring systems (Lattoflex) or ruste are determined with puncture contact paths with so-called multitortion suspension.
The pressure is distributed on several points, reducing tension.
But - if you use a bad (too big and full) headrests for the right mattress and right rust, most of the benefits are lost again.
Here is also a rule: the head cushion should support the head, its tips should reach only to the shoulders so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
Ideal, therefore, is a 50 x 60 cm large cushion, as the scanners like it.
In the side position, the headrest (together with the shoulder load zone in the rust or soft zone in the mattress) should equal the shoulder height.
However, our modern mattresses have something in common with the in-depth (filled with heu) straw bags.
Modern manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials or at least their mixing.
Also in mattresses, the new magic word is called "Bio".
Instead of petroleum oils, they are used to produce polyurethane foams more and more often natural oils - such as rice and soya oil.
Soya is probably used by all known manufacturers.
"Bio is called "in the case of mattresses, which consist of the core of materials of pure natural origin," explains Petr Vasíček from the company Tropico Plus.
But natural substances are also used in the manufacture of mattresses - one of the first was Aloe Vera.
However, you can also use micro capsules that spread fresh forest or lavender scent while sleeping.
Here too you make a difference between a man and a woman.
While in men a "cooler" plant extract is used from birch leaves to absorb the heat and cool the body, the relationships for women have "cooling" effect.
Extracts from red paprikasshots cause blood circulation, so the weaker sex becomes often hot when sleeping.
And today's favorites?
Cold foam mattresses (he has larger pores with damaged cell structure and is therefore more breathable than commercial polyurethane and much more flexible).
The combination of the various layers (hardness) of cold foams and visco foams creates multi-zone mattresses that know exactly where heads, hips and ferns are.
For a high quality mattress, however, you have 7,000 crowns and more.
However, health mattresses are usually burdened with lower value added tax as they are considered as medical devices.
As the first Czech company, Gumotex was granted this advantage.
It's not that easy to save on mattresses and cheese.
Over and over there are special offers from manufacturers and traders who offer two mattresses at the price of one offer.
Thus the brand Magniflex offers the mattress duofreeze with the Wisco foam memory for 11,990 CZK.
The second one is free of charge.
It was the material Tempur that introduced the era of viscoelastic foams with open cell structure and high density into almost cosmic tempo.
No wonder, they were developed for NASA, because the astronauts are exposed to enormous overloads at the beginning.
Tempur is soft at warm, in cool environment it is fast again.
In this way it fits perfectly with the human body and optimally distributes the body pressure.
It is therefore not only ideal for preventing pressure fires, but generally increases the comfort of sleep.
However, viscoalastic foams are used not only in mattresses, but also in other health products, such as special foot pillows, which are intended to provide leg and leg relief.
Domestic manufacturers use, for example, the foams Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
More and more parents want human surveillance devices to have the kids under control
The fear of their own children grows and so more and more parents are considering monitoring them through GPS.
The system originally invented for driving to cars can be as good as people, which would be helpful in such cases, as in the recent disappearance of the nine-year-old Anička Janatková.
The device is now about as big as a cigarette box but soon it should not be bigger than a bracelet.
Many people have put the case of the missing Anička in fear and fear and thus keep them looking at means and ways to better protect their children.
Also for the price of affecting her privacy.
"We are trying to tell everyone that this is not about home spying, but about an effective means to reduce the likelihood of tragedy," says Peter Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of GPS location devices on the Czech market.
"I admit that it can happen in individual cases to misuse such devices, for example if you put it in someone's pocket without knowing about it, but we haven't had to register such a case so far."
"Most customers really buy it for security reasons," adds Pilin.
In his opinion, however, the child should always know the purpose of the "box" and how to use it in an emergency.
However, child psychologist Dana Bočkova points out that if a child does not like to wear such a thing, it simply relaxes.
"And very small children show great creativity when it comes to losing certain things intentionally if they don't want to be controlled."
"Even though the phones initially raised great expectations with the parents, they can easily be switched off just like these new surveillance devices," says Mrs. Bočová.
In your opinion, it is also controversial whether such an institution actually helps in the event of an attack.
"In the case of planned kidnappings, the Kidnapper is almost always checking whether the child has any electronics with which it could be done."
"Today it's the phone."
"If such surveillance equipment were more widely used, they would also be looking for them, since their sale would certainly be accompanied by massive advertising."
"In these cases, police criminals are always a step ahead," says psychologists.
However, it admits that similar devices can be quite helpful in case of a sudden attack by a paedophile.
Roberta Čech, according to the company RC Monitoring, offers location services both for cars and for people, can help the existence of such a device even if it is destroyed immediately after the attack.
"The device can be configured in such a way that it reports the respective position at certain intervals."
"Even if it was destroyed immediately, at least the last position of the person concerned is available."
"In the case of more expensive devices, even a bending knife is integrated, that is, if you fall down and lie there without movement, the device will immediately send a warning indicating the position," says Mr. Čech.
In his opinion, similar services could also provide intelligent mobile phones with navigation, only one needs to use a special software.
The problem with the current locational devices is that it is either a device in a stringed wooden box size, which resembles trailers or smaller phones.
There's always such a danger that you lose them.
According to Mr Pilin from the Macro Weil, therefore, you are testing in the present devices that look like normal digital watches.
"This has the advantage that the attacker must not at all recognize that it is a monitoring or location device.
"Or he only notices after a certain time what the police have a time," he adds.
No matter what direction the development takes - to arms or trailers, the same technology is always used, as in the vehicle location.
So about the combination of location function using the GPS system (as well as the Navi in the car) and the function of a mobile phone that communicates the current position.
The army has so many sparks that you can turn all over the Czech Republic but you can only keep two years
The Czech army has purchased 445 kilometers of fire hoses, which are lit with explosives.
In the previous year, the Ministry of Defence had already delivered 224 kilometres of firefighting to the army camp.
It is comforting to know that the fighting forces have provided for 225 years.
The problem is only the durability of the fire hose - two but not more than four years.
The army bought the lighter from the stock company STV Group, e.g. for lipids of 40 million crowns.
In his explanation for the purchase of this huge amount of Zündschnur, the MF DNA General Staff replied that the soldiers would consume the 60 kilometres of Zündschnur each year.
According to the research carried out by army pyrotechnics, the MF DNAs claims that the entire army had to complete an extremely intensive pyrotechnic training every year - from all the generals and officers of the army commanders, to the secretaries and women of Putz.
Minister of Defence Alexandr Vondra and General Vlastimil Picek are not excluded.
This was the only way to justify the remarkable annual consumption of 60 kilometres of sparks.
This length corresponds to 25,000 detonations.
But this would also be the case for more than ten years.
But if the old rule of experts still holds that the training of each new professional soldier is two meters long enough, then the army has created a calming stock for the 225 years already mentioned, even in view of the increased need of the pioneers and special units.
Soldiers of the rapid deployment brigade complained to the Defence Minister Vondra soon, they had almost no more ammunition patterns, so that the lack of means of shooting were severely limited.
To keep quiet about the underpants.
"I don't know why they buy from us such a lot of sparks."
But that is their decision, they will already know what they need."
"For us, the Army is a good customer that we want to come up with as a dealer," says the sales manager of the STV Group Jan Děcký.
Jan Pejšek, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Defence, founded the purchase of hundreds of kilometres of firefighting so that the army would have covered itself with this "munition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan Děcký from the STV Group only talks about a four-year term of use of the firefighting and police and military pyrotechnics for only two years.
"The four years mentioned are possible in perfect storage," says one of them, who wants to remain anonymous in order not to be criticized by the army as a soldier.
After the duration of use, any ammunition must be thoroughly tested whether it is still reliable and not endangering the lives of the soldiers.
However, these tests are not wrong, but they cost more money.
Another argument of the Ministry of Defence is the quantity discount for the 445 kilometres.
"They cost us sixty percent less than the last year's delivery of 244 kilometers," spokesperson Pejšek tells us the position of the defence ministry's buyers.
Only for comparison: The annual consumption of firefighting by police pyrotechnics, which liquidate ammunition from the Second World War or the Soviet Brotherhood, has been nearly 1,500 metres long.
And the police always order only such quantities of this ammunition that they can consume before the end of the period of use.
Because of the safety of the pyrotechnics, it is also possible to buy more modern and therefore reliable lighters.
Nevertheless, the Ministry of Defence has enormous problems with the liquidation of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the times of the Warsaw Treaty, when the two hundred thousand-hundred-and-one Chechoslovak People's Army prepared for the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnics who claimed MF DNAs, the Czech military expects in a few years the same problem in the liquidation of hundreds of kilometres of old burns, which it has today bought so "funny".
To this day, I find the contacts I have won thanks to the competition
The successful placement in the competition "Small Entrepreneurs of the Year" helped Lukaš Pytloun to sell the Franchise of his hotel.
The winner of last year's competition "Little Entrepreneur of the Year" was Lukaš Pytloun from Liberec.
The story of his success is like a film scenario.
Lucas Pytloun is happy to be here.
Only abroad did he realize that there was a lack of good accommodation at reasonable prices in Liberec.
Out of the savings from his work abroad and with a bank credit, he created a generous house with five apartments.
Remembering that he was then a high school student in the sixth semester, this must have been a brave venture.
"The price-quality ratio at the time made me angry, and so I tried to do something contrary," says Lukaš Pytloun.
The first reconstructed apartment he rented to foreign workers.
He immediately reinvested in the house, which he then took step by step to the pension with 54 beds.
Since then he has been able to open in just seven years of business activity in Liberec four pensions, two quiet restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of more than 300 beds of all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of them was the four-star hotel "Pytloun Design Hotel".
This year another first-class hotel was added.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tísé, which we have sold our Franchise concept and other stakeholders at the Franchise of the Pytloun hotels have already registered," says the Entrepreneur Number One of the last years.
"A large share of this licence sale for the operation of hotels had just won in the competition "Enterpriser of the Year", Mr. Pytloun added.
The victory has brought him greater popularity, yes popularity in Liberec and the surrounding area.
"The people recognized me on the street, often congratulated me afterwards, and I have to say that it was right," he recalls.
I really recommend that everyone who wants to do something to participate in this competition.
You don't have to win the same, every visualization is good.
He says that he is still benefiting from the contacts and acquaintances that would otherwise not have come to him.
"With some people I have met thanks to the competition, I maintain regular business relations to this day."
In his view, the fame associated with success is also a little lower on each of his employees.
And there he is at the age of seventy.
"I note with them greater loyalty and pride that they are part of something that is granted general recognition."
I also really see this not only as a personal success, no, it is the result of the good work of all of us."
"My name is just something in the foreground," says Lukaš Pytloun.
I wish my followers a quieter year than we had in farm
The victory was quickly resolved by the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to his ambition, Farm has the worst behind him.
The price for the first rank of the competition Vodafone Company of the year last year was taken by Karel Žjárský, the firm owner of farm.
At that time, the jury commended the efforts he made to stem a company from the small Česká Skalice tool building, making hundreds of millions of sales.
"I can say that this appreciation not only encourages me but also all my employees and has strengthened our self-consciousness in the fight against competition," says the previous year's winner.
At the beginning of farm history, the effort was to do something useful.
And then, when the state offered his father Karel Žjárský as a compensation for the property seized by the communists, he did not delay long, left his career in the company where he had been employed to do so and set up with a few friends of his father's own company for the manufacture of plastic vessels.
Shortly thereafter they began to focus on plant oil presses.
Within 18 years they have risen to the largest manufacturer of automatic press throughout Central Europe.
But only through the success of the competition mentioned and its medialization has it also entered into the consciousness of non-professionalism.
"Not only that our customers now perceive the brand Farm now significantly more intensively, our foreign partners also began to work with a company that has achieved the greatest possible success in their country to gain greater value," says Karel Ždjarský.
Last year, however, farm was not only a sign of victory.
The assessment was based on the economic results of the company in 2008 and part of 2009.
And just 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of tool construction products.
The crisis, which at the time was still smaller than the citizens, but above all the companies, reached its peak - many companies were forced to set up their investment projects and restrict the purchase of new facilities and technologies.
"Of course we couldn't get away with this situation."
"The sales went back by 40 percent, we had to restrict production and even get fired," explains Karel Ždjarský.
A viable company must also take such unpopular measures.
However, it was possible to get the situation into the grip and keep the company in the black figures, even if with less profits than before the crisis.
In one case, the company was unwilling to withdraw - in the case of investment in research and development.
"Out of the grant, we built a research and training centre, strengthened our presentation at international fairs and acquired major prizes at domestic exhibitions," says Žjárský.
Everything proves that we have overcome the crisis.
Turnovers are growing again and with them the number of new employees.
"I wish the new winner a lot of joy in victory - but in a calmer atmosphere," Karel Žjárský explains.
A question of opinion, which is covered by unreasonable rules
The question of "absorbity of the year" is for the fourth time part of the competition.
Some foolish rules have already been made to come from the world.
To doubt the winner of the next year's opinion poll "Absoluteness of the Year", the duty to create documents on authorities available online was advanced.
Thus, more than a third of non-quad thousand voters decided.
This is how the Social Insurance Administration requested a paper extract from the trade register, even if the official could have picked it up by two mouse clicks.
Thanks to the opinion poll, this is changing now.
"In the future, the Czech Social Insurance Administration will no longer require extracts from the trade register when social insurance taxpayers are under control," ČSSZ spokesperson Jana Buraňová said.
The meaning and purpose of the opinion poll "absorbity of the year" is to take all the provisions and arrangements under the lupe that entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic have to meet and eliminate the foolish ones.
This is already the fourth time this year of a competition organised by the so-called 'Economics' (HN) and is enjoying growing popularity in the public.
If three thousand people took part in the vote last year, it was four thousand this year.
No wonder, because there are still a lot of legal obligations that serve only and alone to prevent business.
"For example, as regards the number of income tax forms, we take a leading rank in the world," says Karel Havlíček from the association of small and medium-sized enterprises and traders of the Czech Republic.
Simplification of business activity has been the proclaimed objective of all governments in recent years.
However, compared to the world, the situation in the Czech Republic has improved little.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic takes the 74th grade in terms of business conditions, a worse position around eight places compared to the previous year.
The year's absurdity competition was first called out in the year and played every year after the same scenario.
Everyone can report administrative and bureaucratic nonsense from April to the conclusion of the competition at the end of September.
For registration, the website www.firmaroku.cz. After that, the organizer of the competition is looking for seven candidates for the "Antipreis" and lets the public vote on the website www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
It beats the absurdity that gets most votes.
For this year's opinion poll, more than one hundred, 105 meaningless regulations and arrangements have already been notified.
The tips are not only from entrepreneurs but also from professional associations and journalists.
For example, among the nominated "finalists" of the competition are provisions that maintenance vehicles have to pay for motorways and motorways or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets have to present every two years.
The list of this year's "Sieben" is published on the sides of the competition.
The call for competition at Prague Wenzelsplatz at the beginning of November is part of an event in which political and public life also regularly participates.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, Director of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Business Operators of the Czech Republic and Petr Kužel, President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic at the peak of competition with the Party.
"Where the state throws business knots between the legs, there can be no real economic upheaval, so it is my goal to eliminate at least thirty paragraphs each year that make businesses more difficult today for them," said Martin Kocourek, Minister of Industry and Trade.
Efforts to create foolish arrangements from the world show effect.
In 2007, most entrepreneurs failed to report their intention to the trade officer at their permanent establishment three days in advance to go to an exhibition or workshop with an exhibition status.
This obligation was abolished by a novel of the trade law.
The obligation that 2007 received the second largest number of votes - the duty to notify the labour force of employees to the extent of up to 30 days - was abolished by the Act on the so-called "Green Card".
And all the good things are three:
To the absurdity of 2009, the regulation that imposed physiotherapists was chosen to have a mirror, a refrigerator and two passenger cars in the speech room.
This Regulation has been amended by the Ministry of Health this year - the refrigeration obligation has been removed.
A new category honours socially responsible companies
Assessment criteria are humanitarian, environmental, education or sport projects
A new feature in this year's fifth year of the competition of the Economic Journal (HN) is the category "Responsive Company of the Year 2010".
The basic idea of this competition is to promote reasonable and fair enterprises.
"We want to support such companies that are aware of the consequences of their business activities on the environment and support socially responsible initiatives," says Patrick Bartholdy, regional manager of the Vodafon mobile company, the caller and guarantor of this competition, as well as the "Rebell of the Year" competition.
For this year's first year of this special subcategory of the main competition Vodafon Company of the year registered companies for which success is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is extremely inspiring and fine enough material for an independent article.
Although they differ in terms of the subject matter of their activities diametrically, their efforts nevertheless have a common denominator - support and consideration.
For example, this is about disabled people, as it is about personal problems or the health of their own employees.
Among the fourteen finalists from all over the Czech Republic, for example, the Prague software company E Netera, which promotes the creation of non-formal sports teams among its employees, then participating in numerous tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a responsible company in the Pardubice region is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main sponsor of a foundation fund for disabled children for seventeen years.
A paper factory from Poděbrady also deals well with its health-impaired employees, who make up 70 percent of its staff, for which it was rated with the title "Responsive Company of the Central Bohemian Region"; in the competition Vodafone Company of the year, it ranked the third in the context of this region.
In the Olomouc region, the accounting firm MiRyz Soft succeeded, which, among other things, introduced a steady and also an average of 35 hours a week reduced working time and this without a relative reduction in wages.
The jury also honored the fact that the company purchases mainly from Czech producers, supports citizen initiatives in its environment and works in accordance with environmentally friendly principles.
"We are trying to recycle as much as possible in order to keep the consequences of our business activities and administration for the environment as little as possible," explains Managing Director Miloše Ryzanrová.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the region of Ústí nad Labem is once again located in the health of its employees and has therefore created ergonomic chairs and keyboards for all notebooks, and also encourages them to use catering services provided by a home-based workshop in their work and in company operations.
"In addition, we support the Foundation "People in Not", which provides concrete assistance to the Roma community in this area," says Ondřij Suchý, the company's representative.
Not least is the activity of the cleaning company "Praní a čištní" from the Karlsbader region, which contributes to their pension insurance to their employees in the form of extra bonuses.
"We provide our employees with our contributions to the maintenance, work path, increase their qualifications and holidays," says Josef Strapáč of the construction company Czasch from Bruntál, the winner in the Mauritian-Schlesian region.
To the category of responsible company of the year, all district finalists of the competition Vodafon Company of the year were automatically registered, which answered the questions of the questionnaire attached to the application and sent it to the organizer by 15 August.
Wrong or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were excluded from the evaluation by the organiser.
"If the representatives of the competing companies did not answer the questions, they were excluded from the competition "Sponsored Company of the Year", but they were not disqualified in the main competition Vodafone Company of the year."
"A separate application for this competition is not possible only because it is only a subcategory of the main competition company of the year," explains Karel Goldman from the organizing agency Bison & Rose.
Pilsner Bodenfonds - Police arrests in a public tender
In the building of the Land Fund in Pilsen, the anti-corruption police arrested in the last days.
The local media contractor and real estate dealer Luboš G. was taken away by the detectives in handcuffs.
He had allegedly tried to manipulate a direct public competition for the settlement of claims for refunds in such a way that the assets offered in the competition would be of a specific interest.
This guy is supposed to have paid Luboš G. half a million for it.
"At this point, I can only confirm that the police are pursuing a person for the crime of fraudulent machining in a public competition," said Antonie Zelená, the head of the Pilsner Public Prosecutor of the "Právo" newspaper, who could not provide any further details regarding the ongoing investigations.
24 hours later, the 46-year-old businessman was released from the police.
In what way he could manipulate public competition, you can only speculate about it in view of the specific official information.
The spokesperson for the Land Fund Lubomír Černá raised the question of Právo, which the police had actually made arrests in the Pilsner side of the Land Fund during a public competition.
"It was about a client and midnight about one of our employees," she said.
According to the public competition, Ms. Černá had the correct term "order for the supply of claims for the transfer of property under the Land Law" and would take place in cases where several applicants are interested in the proposed property.
"These persons offer in the context of the call a higher value of their claims to compensate for the transfer than the value of the property called out."
"In accordance with the requirements offered, the order of potential buyers is determined and then the Land Fund transfers the property to the person with the highest bid," explains the speaker of the Fund.
Luboš G. was obviously available information about who had applied for the invitation and since he was a legitimate person, since he had purchased a number of claims for restitution, he offered a property interest to withdraw from the competition.
Obviously against a fat finding.
This would also be a sufficient explanation for why he had such a large amount of money when he was arrested.
Luboš G. already had very good contacts with the Pilsner Bodenfonds in the past.
He also played a role in the cause of the former head of the Land Fund Václav Sankota, which was prosecuted because he issued land in replacement refunds that had already been covered by construction projects.
At that time, Luboš G. from the Land Fund also acquired land intended for the construction of public roads, more precisely, at the place where the construction of the access magistral was planned for the Borske Pole area.
Later he exchanged this very cheaply with the Magistrate against a house directly in the historic center of the city, which far exceeded the value of the property.
At that time, the town hall had to have a heavy heart attack to avoid endangering the building project by blocking the property.
Household housing costs increase by a few hundred per month
As of January, the budgets must not only bear higher costs for all energy types, but also for higher water and water charges and for remote heat and other places, the rents also grow.
As of January, families will have to pull several hundred crowns out of the wallet every month than ever.
Electricity will be up to 4.6 percent more expensive, gas will be up to 2 percent and more, in some cities you will have to pay up to a tenth more for water supplies and in some places you will also consume the remote heat supplies.
The electricity consumption alone costs the apartment budget a few hundred kroner a year.
The high electricity prices were reduced by all main suppliers, so it is due to the clear promotion of electricity generation from renewable sources, namely photovoltaic installations.
Gas will only become more expensive, however, precisely when people have to heat most and have the highest consumption.
So here is also to calculate with several hundred crowns more per year.
While electricity and gas become more expensive throughout the Czech Republic, prices for remote heating from town to city vary.
Above all, larger places plan price increases.
For example, the households in Pardubice and Hradec Králové have to pay more than 50 kroner per month from January for remote heating, more than 1000 kroner per year for families in Liberec.
The inhabitants of Prague are again threatened with 9 percent higher water and water charges and this in case the city increases the infrastructure rent.
If the rent doesn't change, it's only 6.8 percent.
The price in Prague, however, is still among the lowest in all of the Czech Republic.
In the north arc, where prices are already among the highest, water and water charges should rise by 7.4 per cent.
For example, huge rental price increases are expected in 140,000 rental apartments, where the so-called rental regulation will be removed from January.
For example, the apartment company CPI Byty, which owns 2500 apartments in Ústí nad Labem, plans to increase the rentals by one hundred percent from January.
Those who do not agree with this increase in rent will be interested in the company's legal interests.
The regulated rentals that are still paid in about 300,000 apartments today are expected to increase by more than 10 percent next year.
Czech children drink with remote and Rum Beer is out - it just seems too slow
Farnet, Rum and Vodka, except once a good whiskey that was stolen from the house bar by the father.
These are the drinks that require the most frequent treatment of alcoholic Czech teenagers.
There are no exceptions to children who have to sleep their catheter again in the hospital.
This is illustrated by the experience of doctors who are confronted with similar cases in the admission of the child clinics.
"Beers or wine are completely out of fashion because it just takes too long to get drunk."
"The trend today is clearly hard alcohol," said Právo Luděk Pelikán, the head of the Children's Department in the Middle Bohemian Clinic of Horóvice.
"Whisky, if it's possible for the father to remove a bottle from the home bar, and if not, then at least remote or vodka.
"Wodka has the advantage of mixing it with juice, then he doesn't smell so loud," explains the chief officer.
The speaker of the Faculty Hospital Motol Eva Jurinová gives him the right.
"Most often it's about remote or rum."
"This is today's alcohol trend, especially in primary schools."
"It was also about Slibowitz, which you take home from home," said Mrs. Jurinová.
According to Chefarzt Pelikán, thirteen or fourteen-year-old drinkers are no exception in hospital admission.
Before the hospital in Horjovice, where he has been working since this year, he worked ten years in the Paediatric Department of the Motol Hospital, where the rescue car was delivered from near and far.
"A girl had to be hospitalized four times."
"Your career began at 12 years of age when she was first given 3.5 promille alcohol in the blood and was still given in combination with "extase", the doctor described a particularly difficult case.
"She was at the exhibition site in Holesovice on some dance party."
"The interesting thing was that it wasn't unusual for her mother to come home for 48 hours," the chef wondered.
It is precisely the lack of interest of parents or their incredible tolerance in assaulting their own syringes that is considered one of the main causes of the growing alcoholism of children.
For a real dependence in the true sense of the word, there are no experts according to children.
"Under alcoholism is a long-standing chronic dependence on alcohol and all related phenomena, and that is not the case with these children."
For those who drink alcohol repeatedly, a negative family-social background is usually characteristic," explains Chefarzt Pelikán.
According to Ms. Jurinová, the spokesperson of the Motol hospital, about forty children drunk by the middle of November were enrolled in the Home Department for Child and Youth Medicine.
However, only cases of severe alcohol poisoning that require hospital stay are included in the statistics.
Children who are brought home after an ambulance treatment by their parents or, where appropriate, by the police will not be registered.
In addition to the cases where children can only draw out a bottle of snaps in the school bank, according to Mr. Pelikán, there are three age-old amplitus on which is a hundred percent trust: Walpurgisnocht, Silvester and the end of the school year.
"The last one was named for two reasons - either because of the bad testimony or because of the joy of the holidays."
"In the Walpurgy night, I have also experienced seven drunken children at one time in the recording," says Dr. Pelikán.
A drunk child who spends the night under medical supervision is Paradoxically better than a child who has only to fight with an unpleasant cat the next day.
The headaches in the morning, which are caused by dehydration and glucose deficiency, can be distributed in the hospital with a fluid-dependent infusion of glucose and nutrients lacking in the body.
"They're clearly better at it, because after the "wonderful" experience in the evening, they wake up with good pay without doing anything to hurt."
"They're just a little confused about where they are," says Dr. Pelikán, who at least earns the good pay by counting the cost of the treatment.
Because the transport with the rescue car and the night in an emergency bed will come well and gladly on a few tens of thousands of crowns.
"I used it as an educational tool once and for all when I had just counted the children on the visit, which cost them their alcoholism and that it could just happen that they had to work all the holidays to earn the money for a single such fat," added Dr. Pelikán.
However, in his view, the hospital does not take into account regression procedures to require the parents’ costs for the care of the under-injurious children.
Two training planes L-159 for the first time in a foreign hand - in Spain
Two light combat aircraft L-159 of a total of five, which the Czech Ministry of Defense has exchanged against Casa C-295M, flew to the Spanish city of Seville on Tuesday, where the Spanish aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS sits.
It is the first time that machines of this type are owned by a foreign army.
In the abroad they were seen only at maneuvers or fly shows.
This is about the airworthy dual-use version L-159T1, which was operated by the Czech army.
The remaining three aircraft are unilateral L-159.
These are still preserved in Aero Vodochody, the broker of this business - the company Omnipol - has taken over last week.
When sending the aircraft physically from Vodochody, Jan Pejšek, according to the spokesperson of the Ministry of Defence, is not yet known.
The L-159 single combat aircraft were, in turn, excluded from long-term storage aircraft, without further deposits and investments from the Ministry's headquarters.
"The double-sitting L-159T1 were exchanged in current condition and appearance," said Pejšek of the Právo newspaper.
He added that the army would not have to leave without two-seat combat aircraft, as in May 2009, the Ministry of Defence signed a 200 million contract with Aero Vodochody on the conversion of four superfluous L-159 to the two-seat version.
A new aircraft has taken over the army in July, the second will take over until the end of this year.
According to Pejšek, EADS has undertaken to implement the combat aircraft in one of the NATO countries.
"The contract clearly states that the EADS is the carrier of the L-159 aircraft and that they are to be used to train NATO pilots.
"It is therefore the matter of the receiver, how he realizes the matter," Pejšek said.
The economic newspaper (HN) had previously reported that the Spanish government had no interest in the L-159.
The trade of five L-159 against a transport aircraft Casa and the purchase of other aircraft for 3.5 billion Kronen was approved by the government of Mirek Topolánek last year.
At the time, the Ministry of Defence had not written a tender procedure for the purchase, but called directly on EADS.
The then defence department argued that this exchange will support the future exports of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought Aero 72 machines, of which only 24 were used, and the rest wanted to sell them.
By the way, the purchase of the aircraft Casa should also have a judicial copy.
The European Commission appealed to the Czech Ministry of Defence at the European Court of Justice.
The army has already taken over three aircraft from Casa, which is scheduled to land at Kbely Airport within fourteen days.
A longer finger than a ring finger means a lower risk of cancer
Men whose finger is longer than the ring finger are obviously at a lower risk of developing prostate cancer.
This is the surprising result of a study published by the British Journal of Cancer on Wednesday.
This is to relate to the mirror of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our results show that the relative length of the fingers can serve as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer, and this is especially for men up to sixty," explained the co-author of the study, Ros Eeles, professor at the Cancer Research Institute at Warwick University.
The finger could help determine which men should necessarily undergo a prostate cancer test, especially if there are genetic risks or other risk factors, such as family health burdens, Mrs. Eeles added.
In the period 1994-2009, she and her colleagues in Britain persecuted more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer, while at the same time 3,000 healthy men.
In more than half of the participants in the study, the right hand finger was shorter than the ring finger.
For these men, the same probability of prostate cancer was considered, as for 19 percent of those men whose rings and fingerprints were the same.
However, in men whose finger was longer than the ring finger, this risk decreased by 33 percent, in men up to sixty-seven percent.
The ratio of the length of the two fingers mentioned, which are already in prenatal age, clearly reflects the different mirrors of sex hormones that the child was exposed to in the womb.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer finger.
Previously research showed that the testosterone accelerates the growth of prostate cancers.
Václav Pačes, the leading Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, said ČTK, that this study was quickly known to him, but he still did not consider the relationship between finger length and cancer risk to be "completely proven".
Czech Republic in the snow - D1 and D5 are closed
Like most of Europe, the Czech Republic is also under a snow cover on Thursday morning.
On the streets and roads there is usually solid snow, the winter servants were mostly on axles all night long.
The D5 motorway between km 89 and 90 towards Rozvadov is blocked by some accidents of trucks and cars and also the D1 at Brno towards Prague.
This said Novinky.CZ of the dispatcher of the Central Auto Moto Club (UAMK).
At 91 kilometers a truck crashed, at 93 kilometres two trucks crashed, in this accident there were injured.
There are also a few cars in the streets.
There are also problems at 185 kilometres from the D1 motorway towards Prague.
Two trucks have also been hit here.
The riders should drive right behind Brno at 190 kilometers or above Brno and at 182 kilometres at Kývalka.
There are a mile-long staus.
On the D11, too, an accident happened and the same thing happened on the way to Prague.
In Prague itself there is a several centimeter thick snow cover and the thermometer shows less than seven degrees Celsius.
Autocolons are formed, for example, in the town hall Prosek, also the road Štérboholská is completely hidden.
The safest means of transport is the metro anyway.
The roads run with delays, for example on the line between Karlsplatz and Peace Square.
At eight o'clock in the morning, the Prague crisis staff meet.
There are also problems at the railway and at the airport.
The Czech railway had to cancel seven fast-track connections due to snow-driving.
There are problems, for example, on the Prague - Kralupy route or also Prague - Beroun.
Travellers should be informed of the current situation.
The airport Ruzyně has been closed since Wednesday 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Most of the streets in the South Sea are only subject to increased caution.
Around Vyškov three side streets are completely impermeable, in the area of Brno there are snowflakes and in the area of Blanco it is forced to use snowflakes on some higher roads.
One of the most affected areas is Výškov.
There are still three roads still completely blocked: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Sharatice - Mileshovice.
Here too you will have to use snowflakes for cleaning snowflakes.
When they become viable again, they cannot be estimated until now.
In the Hodonín region, caution is exercised in the area of white carpathians.
On the streets that can only be fought with inert fluids for reasons of nature, there is a thick snow cover up to five centimeters, ČTK started.
In the Czech Republic, from two to ten centimeters of neuschnee fell, most of them in northern Bohemia - up to 18 centimeters.
In the Mauritian-Schlesian region, up to 15 centimeters of neuschnee fell.
In the Czech Republic, however, it is slow to cut.
American soldiers have a new "intelligent weapon".
The U.S. troops first used a new "intelligent" weapon in Afghanistan, known only to date under their code name XM-25.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon will influence the conflict there with the Taliban and shift the force to their favor.
The new weapon is something like a super accurate cannon.
Its projectiles are directed towards the target by laser with only a few meters of impact safety.
The special casts of 25 mm caliber designed for this weapon and containing high-explosive explosives work practically like small grenades.
The bulkheads can be programmed in such a way that they can not only explode at any point in the rush to the target but at any point in their ballistic flight.
That means you can use them against an enemy hiding behind a barrier - a wall or in a protective tomb.
He is usually not protected from the top, so he can easily be removed from the battle by the deadly steel splitter from the top.
According to Richard Audett, who participated in the development of the XM-25, the new combat weapon is the first infantry weapon that makes use of "intelligent" technologies.
"The soldier goes basically as follows: he looks at the target and sends out a laser beam that determines the distance, then he wins an exact point of view after correcting the elevation angle, then he just needs to push down.
"Let's say you measured 543 meters."
"When pressed, the weapon is loaded and fired at the distance of 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters.
400 jobs are being moved
The Fujitsu Group is moving its branch to Frankfurt in Bad Homburg.
In July next year 400 employees will be transferred to Astro Park from the former office building at the Marienbader Square in Bad Homburg.
The Japanese group Fujitsu is moving its branch to Frankfurt in Bad Homburg.
As the industry giants specialized on computer and maintenance were announced on Wednesday, 400 women and men will be transferred to Astro Park to work from the former office building at the Marienbader Square in Bad Homburg in July next year, which is a large office complex on the Lyoner Straße in the Frankfurter district of Niederrad.
A speaker from Fujitsu explained that, in the medium term, another 100 jobs of the Group should be provided there, which have been distributed to the region so far.
The rental offer has been extremely attractive, and the large-scale offices in Astro Park are better off against the employee's working methods.
In Bad Homburg too, Fujitsu was just a tenant.
Managing Director Bernd Wagner said, "With Frankfurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure".
The excellent connection to the airport is just for a global company like Fujitsu of great importance.
The recent conversion of an important company within the region called for yesterday's joy in the winners and disappointment in the losers.
Frankfurter Economist Markus Frank (CDU) said that once again a "Global Player" was won.
That's a "big location confession".
Fujitsu passes to the city, the settlement is an important impulse for Lowerrad.
The Bad Homburger Mayor Michael Korwisi (Greens) regretted Fujitsu's decision.
The city was soon informed by the management of the intention.
"We have of course offered our help to the company," Korwisi said.
However, the friendly contacts could not change the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the owner of the property at the Marienbader place.
Finally, economic reasons would have given rise.
Now it is about preventing a long gap at such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and owner of the building are cooperative."
The house used by Fujitsu so far at the Town Hall and the nearby "Small Vertical" were among the other buildings at the Marienbader Square ten years ago among the most controversial construction projects in Kurstadt.
As a joint project of the city and a private project developer, a new city tree was created between the railway station and the town hall, which provided both for the massive construction of the previously used areas as a parking space and the height of the buildings for criticism.
In 2001, the Feri investment consultancy and rating company, the software manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, and then the computer manufacturer Fujitsu connected to Siemens.
The building used by Fujitsu was acquired in 2006 by the Frankfurter Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen Group together with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and sold a year later to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Fujitsu Konzers in Tokyo are the third largest IT provider in the world.
For example, it provides companies with computers and servers and also provides the necessary service.
The branch in the Rhine-Main area is one of the largest in Germany, but much more employees include Fujitsu in Munich.
From Bad Homburg, the subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions is in Frankfurt-Niederrad, the other subsidiaries at this location are to be Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
For this purpose, the Astro Park 7000 square meters were rented in the office building.
In the twenty-year-old complex - the name plays on its star-shaped basis - has its seat, among other things, the Central Association of Electrical and Electronic Industry.
Amazon Block Server - Threats to Assange
Wikileaks drives increasingly in distress.
The Amazon Internet Service Provider has banned the disclosure platform from its servers.
It is possible that political pressure is behind the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomats.
Wikileaks founder Assange is reported to be standing in England.
The Wikileaks Revealing Platform is increasingly under attack in the United States.
Internet activists have lost access to their former American server and are now looking for an Internet home in Europe.
The prominent American senator Joe Lieberman called in other countries and companies to the boycott of Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol's march lists, is supposed to stop after a newspaper report in Britain.
"Wikileaks driven by Amazon server."
"Free speech in the country of the free," the revelation activists told Twitter on Wednesday (location time).
Recently, the Internet company Amazon had banned Wikileaks documents from its servers.
Internet activists had withdrawn from the Amazon Web Service (AWS) in the publication of the secret diplomatic documents in order to manage the high numbers of access to the documents.
On Twitter Wikileaks went on to say: "Excellent - our dollars will now be spent to employ people in Europe."
If Amazon has such a problem with freedom of speech, "they would stop selling books".
Amazon stopped using its server by Wikileaks after the employees of Senator Joe Lieberman had commissioned research, the TV broadcaster CNN reported on the Liebermans office.
The chairman of the Senate Home Protection Committee threatened Amazon with a boycott, reports the British "Guardian".
"I would have liked Amazon to take this action earlier in view of the previous publications of information classified by Wikileaks," said the Senator.
Lieberman therefore called on the platform to ban the use of servers in other countries as well.
"Wikileaks' illegal, inhuman and thoughtless action puts our national security at stake and threatens around the globe," says a statement by the Partisan Senator.
"No responsible company - whether American or foreign - should help Wikileaks in his efforts to distribute stolen material."
Wikileaks founder Assange, who is wanted by the authorities in Sweden due to suspicion of rape, is on Interpol's list.
After a report from the London newspaper "The Independent", the 39-year-old Australian in the United Kingdom, the exact location is known as Scotland Yard.
The Internet activist has always referred to the investigations in Sweden as an intruder of his opponents.
Wikileaks-Speaker Christian Hrafnsson said in London that there were threats.
"There was even a call after a murder of Julian Assange."
Therefore Assange rightly feared for his safety, Hrafnsson said.
The Wikileaks founder will therefore remain hidden.
Hrafnsson obviously responded to statements from North America.
In America, former Republican Governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, had demanded that the responsible for the Wikileaks revelations be charged and set up for treason.
In Canada, an adviser to government chief Stephen Harper - apparently ironic - said that assanges should be "killed" and Obama could "use a drone".
Between the White House and Assange, then, a beating was fired.
US President Barack Obama, Robert Gibbs, called it "Laughter and absurd", that Assange had demanded the resignation of Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton if she was responsible for recently announced spying orders to diplomats.
"I'm not sure why we care about the opinion of a guy with a website," said Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more significant than its website."
The U.S. government is now putting the protection of its databases to the test.
As Special Representative, the White House was appointed vice-director of the Centre for Anti-Terrorism Measures, Russell Travers.
Travers is responsible for the development of "necessary structural reforms" that have become necessary after the publication of the messages by Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to see how the entire government exchanges and protects information.
The U.S. government also announced that they should be in danger by publishing Wikileaks to ensure the safety of dissidents and activists.
"We've done everything we can to get in touch with them," said Foreign Secretary Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if necessary."
The Ice University
At the "Gelato University" in Bologna, ice absorbers are prepared for better seasons.
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest hall and visitors from all over the world.
Where does the whole ice actually come from?
From the gelatio and from the gelatio.
The glacier, somewhat old-fashioned in German, represents the cream according to all the rules of Italian icemaking.
The gelataio takes the ice cream from the fridge with a bowl, stretches it into the waffle and then sells it.
To know that, you don't have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But whoever wants to know more about ice is not going to the "Gelato-University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The Ice University has set up the manufacturer of ice machines in 2003 so that the ice cream from its machines can be repaired all over Italy's high ideals.
The three-day basic course for future gelatieri has the largest hall and visitors from all over the world.
But there are also several days special courses around chocolate and practice in the home ice cream.
Some dream of a new career in the midlife crisis; others simply lean on the smooth ice of their vague longings.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves the slow food movement and wants to offer a European quality product in the country of industrial ice cream in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a corporate consultant and wants to exploit something of his own after years in a nervous job.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an iceberg in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil want to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars - and the Canadian housewife Julia comes because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream.
It is crucial not only to taste good, but also the silky smoothness and the good consistency.
Luciano, however, does not forget the national and even southern reconstruction of his training: "Italian gelato is just the best - and then every amount of romance is still there."
The first step to production seems quite simple.
Luciano puts the basic ingredients of milk, soap, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large mixer that heats everything up to 85 degrees with an electronic program and then cools down to four degrees immediately.
Then he turns up on the machine and comes out a pasteurised white bass cream, the basis for all milk varieties.
Immediately, the lecturer will ask questions: Can ice cream be produced only with natural substances without stabiliser?
How can you let your own experimentation run free?
Luciano warns against being led by the spirit of time into error.
Anyone who speaks of ice cream "only from natural ingredients" may have used stabilizers - mostly a natural product, such as guarkernmehl from the Guarbohne.
Of course you can make ice without a stabilizer, only then it must be sold within one day, otherwise it sinks together, and the customer bites on thin ice grains.
Certain variations in the base mass are allowed.
It'll be more exciting with the aromas.
For the taste in the ice, Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients you buy in the fruit department or in the sweets of the supermarket.
In addition, there are powders and pasta.
"The suppliers will all try to convert dozens of aromatized additives to you."
"But you should just experiment."
In the case of fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or even with the ice cream from the white base mass, which becomes with eggs for yellow cream and with cocoa powder on the basis of all possible chocolate delusions.
Now the participants are allowed to use the ice machines.
Luciano allows it to produce four different types of vanilla, chocolate, mokka and hazelnut ice - with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla flavouring or other natural additives.
In the same experiment, fruit varieties will also be subject to the same experiment.
More flavourings, more fruit purée - delicious is not necessarily better.
Hazelnut ice is not necessarily more nude when it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular Kiwi ice represents the working group that uses more fruits, less water and a little less stabilizer.
Only a balanced mix really enhances the taste of a gelato, says Luciano.
Ice production is a computational task: If Pfrich-Puree is used with a lot of sugar, the sugar content must be reduced in the basic recipe.
An extraportion of sugar is required for lemoneis.
Luciano draws up a device with which he determines the sugar content of the fruit varieties (wines measure the oechsle in the grape must).
Luckily, tables facilitate computing.
Making ice does not require as much physical use as it used to.
Not only does the device help the automatic production of the base mass.
There is also a device in which the finished ice mixture is also creamy and cooled at minus temperatures.
All automation for spite do not remain small tires.
The Brazilian Gustavo is aghast at himself and his students from the top to the bottom with fruit purée when he is ruled over by the over-dimensional stabmixer.
"In every course," says Maestro Luciano, "it's only a matter of time until something like that happens."
Controls on-the-fly
The European Food Authority (EFSA) has been migrating from the plant-experimental industry.
This project is now formulated by the Expert Group Test Biotech, which is considered an independent institute for the impact assessment of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have documented it well," said Testbiotech Chief Christoph Thenn on Wednesday in Munich.
The head of the Efsa Group of Experts on Genetically Modified Plants, Harry Kuiper, and another Efsa expert have been under contract with the lobbyist association Ilsi for years.
It is paid by such groups as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper has cooperated substantially with the Efsa test rules for genera plants and has thus been in a clear conflict of interest, criticised by Than.
The Efsa regulations are equally valuable to Ilsi's position papers and therefore carry the handwriting of the industry, which is to be controlled by the Italian Parma by the Authority.
It was already the second time that Test Biotech attempted a conflict of interest.
Thus, a high-ranking manager of Efsa recently became a Swiss agricultural company syngenta without any notice or transition time - and thus changed the pages.
The German Central Radio (MDR) had recently revealed personal connections between the EU's controlling authority and industrial lobby, which has made the Environment Agency as clear as the EU's parliamentary.
The Efsa cannot recognize any conflict of interest.
All serious data, including those of industry, are taken back as long as they are of high professional quality, is said in an opinion.
The experts who work for Efsa do not require that they have no contact with industry.
But they had to reveal them.
Kuiper agrees with his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the United States.
This is called itself a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics - including for risk assessment for biotechnology without a lobbying order.
In this case, independent experts such as Then criticise that genetically modified plants are currently allowed without any feeding attempt in animals and that the response of plants to environmental influences is not tested.
"We want to know what makes genetically modified maize on the farm for example," says Then.
Current practice is to test only isolated proteins, but not the entire plant, which does not provide reliable results.
"If you don't look for the risks, how can you find them?" then Then asks the prosecutor.
That's what Angelika Hilbeck sees.
The scientist has been researching genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Zürich Technical University.
Industry in this area, as in the United States, is now increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists in Europe.
There are therefore hardly any researchers who have not escaped with groups.
For companies critical studies would generally not be published.
"Industry controls security research," Hilbeck claims.
The Trace of the Stones
Uli Gsell has also taken care of a total of about 400 kilos.
On Monday night he stood before Stuttgart Railway Station, the Tuba on the back.
It was a demo.
It's cut.
The story is known: In September the Baggers were on and had begun to break off a large piece of the northern wing.
The Stuttgart world was no longer the same: tens of thousands demonstrated against the S21, the billion-thousand-threading of the railway station.
When it came to the buildingtop, a large part of the bird was in the dunes.
Breaking into 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a soft solid stone, built between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Eastfields, 43 years old.
He's got a few of his pants secured.
"These stones are Reliquien."
"You can't disappear."
He swears: "A cheaper and poorer stone, simple and earthy."
When he gave up, he smoked cigarettes.
He doesn't know what he's gonna do with his pants.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
The trail of Stuttgart Stone leads into a forest near Tübingen to a former ammunition depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen has built his Stein-Reich.
The 44-year-old deals with old stones.
He bought everyone who attacked Abruzzi in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were to lie down or disappear in the warehouse," he says in his office, a wooden bench that once was a watchhouse.
He was insulted and threatened, he tells when he was in the newspapers in September that he bought the rest of the northern wing from the takeover.
But he's been talking to the S-21 opponents for days.
And he explained to them that he couldn't do anything for the abbreviation right now.
And if it happens once again, then it is the most sensible thing if the stones were to be used again.
Approximately 200 S-21 opponents then took one of the 80 kilos in average, with a piece price of 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a reminder, some, but also in the hope of being able to give it back when it is rebuilt.
500 tons had bought rounds, 25 large trucks.
About half is still stored in the forest, the rest is sold for a long time.
Garden owners, landscape gardeners, housekeepers.
They had come from everywhere and had dragged away what they could carry suitcases and trailers.
The Stuttgart stones of the attack have long turned into "mauerle" or into restrictions of herbs.
"In fact, this stone is nothing special," says Rongen.
"Wouldn't be the political component."
He rises in his field cars, makes a tour through his 20 hectares of kingdom.
Jura studied and discontinued, later biology, then he was interested in computer and eventually became a stone dealer.
And stone lovers.
40000 tons of stone is stored.
From all over Germany he gathers his treasures.
He says he's the biggest antique dealer in the Republic.
He's slow.
In the snow there are artificially decorated sandstones.
"They once belonged to the Dresden Marienbrücke," he says.
Elbsandstein, yellow, hot, it's hot.
"My favorite stone."
It's going up the road through the forest.
It shows on a hill: red sandstein, former part of Karlsruher Railway Station.
And so on.
"Sweet Travertin."
On one occasion, the headquarters of the Stuttgart Neckar Stadium belonged to the tribe.
Everywhere in the snow stones and stories, Cannstatter Travertin from the Stuttgart Police Bureau, red granite from the Dom Sankt Blasien, Tuff from the Heilbronner Hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When rings think about how the stones were sewn by hand and moved with simple bottlenecks and oxcarts, it will be very scary.
"It'd be a scandal if you'd step on something like that."
He didn't become rich, he didn't even become stone.
But 14 people today employ the stone dealer, as well as in the forest of Steinmetze, a sculptor, asmith, a glassblower and a gardener.
"We work hard, but it's satisfying," says the restorative.
He'll have to go to Cologne soon.
There are also stones to save.
Language struggle for high potentials
There's a real Andrang at the buffet.
16 Students are anxious about salmon, tomato soups and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the Autobauer Volkswagen invited the machine building and design students to a workshop.
In an idea competition, they will be able to get to know VW developers through the car of the future - and know all along the Volkswagen.
In the competition for the smartest heads, many companies are currently going to the near fight and, like VW, are working on cooperation with the universities.
Your mission: To recruit the most successful graduates in the hearings as early as possible before they come to the labour market and are recruited by others.
And because the universities do not issue opinions about the performance of their students, you try to spy out the exceptional talents in practical projects and bind yourself.
On the second day of the workshop at the TU Braunschweig, the car group runs around the talents.
A young lady from the staff department distributes ballwriters, rubber beads and folders with VW logo.
She tells the hopeful young people about practical programs and student jobs and shows them ways in the group.
Nico Selle from the TU Braunschweig supports the project with VW.
He sees the benefits for both sides: "The students get in touch with industry and gather experiences."
"VW can get to know students at the same time, look at interesting candidates more closely and think about who comes as an employee."
Such co-operations, such as Selle, are not unusual.
Now, let's just say it's been so offensive around the students.
"Sonst the focus was rather on the professional project," says Selle.
The fight for the fresh graduates is likely to get even harder.
In many sectors, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large range of applicants.
In particular, they need to be rewarded and especially for highly qualified workers.
In particular, graduates from engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating position.
According to the Association of German Engineers VDI, over 40,000 engineers remained unoccupied in October.
And the so-called engineering gap is going to be even bigger, according to VDI forecasts.
For the economic audit and consulting company KPMG, Roman Dykta goes to the talent hunt.
He organizes expensive recruitment events such as KPMG-Race, a kind of modern cutting game where participants need to find their way through GPS coordinates.
Eight promising students want to send the company across the United States next year.
In addition, participants can view KPMG's branches and get to know the company.
Who can decide in two rounds of selection in advance.
Only the Creme de la Creme of many applicants flies to the United States.
In the case of the Hauen and Sketches around the High Potentials at the Universities, the shields are increasing according to Dykta.
"We want to get rid of the race."
"Just a simple sailing session was too small for us."
For talent hunters, Dykta seems to be going up.
"We still have contact with all participants in a similar action last year."
"Some are just ahead of their conclusion and want to apply with us soon," he says.
In addition to the direct booming at the campus, small and medium-sized companies are also classic in trade fairs.
"We're trying to reach graduates at trade fairs."
"Sometimes on the intersolar", reports Sitha Stube, staff leader at Solarworld's solar technology manufacturer.
The Bonner company employs about 1500 employees in Germany.
Stebe knows about the growing problem.
Currently 35 jobs are posted on the company's website.
"It's just very difficult to occupy frequent positions."
"It costs a lot of time and money," she says.
Another way is to contact the uni-professors.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
"The professors indicate that we can practice or write our diploma."
Dear advertising events are not addressed to the solar specialist.
For this purpose, the company tries to advertise with other advantages: Personal atmosphere, flat hierarchy and easy communication.
"This can't often be offered by a large group," says staff leader Stübe.
Money no longer plays the main role in job search.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good climbing opportunities are other crucial factors.
In a study of the Great Place to Work Institute, Solarworld held the 55th place among the top 100 employers in Germany.
The Institute establishes an annual best list of German employers.
It asks employees how satisfied they are with their work and their work environment and looks at the framework conditions for the workers.
Staff leader Stübe also expects additional points from the placement of the job seekers.
"I think that applicants are looking especially for external evaluations about a potential employer," she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies that want to build a good reputation as an employer with a long-term strategy.
He advised his clients more authenticity.
And that means, according to warkeepers, above all internal measures.
"The best way to be attractive as an employer leads to its own employees," he says.
In industry jargon, the internal employer Branding, i.e. employer branding, is within its own staff.
"Relaxed employees are the best ambassadors."
If his people were to be treated well and identify themselves with the company, they would be completely employed by friends and acquaintances for their employers.
"It's like a band game," says Kriegler.
Obama stops new oil drilling
On the coast of the U.S. state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico, there will be no new oil drilling in the coming years.
A corresponding ban has been passed by the government in Washington - thus finally withdrawing its earlier plans.
New drillings are also prohibited before the Atlantic coast.
This was shared by Interior Minister Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
The trigger for the strict prohibition to be applied at least for the next five years is the explosion of the drilling platform "Deepwater Horizon" in April.
Before the accident, which cost eleven workers their lives and led to the biggest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama had signaled his willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
The advocates want to reduce the dependence of the United States on supplies from abroad.
Those who bear the responsibility for the devastating oil spill in the Gulf have not been fully informed.
In the centre of criticism, the British energy group BP is confronted with billions of requirements.
A committee of inquiry on behalf of Obama will present its results during December.
In October, Interior Minister Ken Salazar lifted the drilling stop that was suspended after the explosion.
Following this, various oil groups had also submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With more stringent controls and more stringent safety regulations, Obama and Salazar want to eliminate a recent catastrophe.
At present, the competent supervisory authority responsible for the implementation of numerous corruption projects is fundamentally reformed.
At the same time, Obama has announced that it is possible to close luxurious tax slots for the oil and gas groups.
The industry now publicly warns that the amount of aid in the Gulf would be significantly lower by more stringent regulation than ever.
"The government's plans are the biggest brakes for the growth of the oil and gas industry," says the result of a current industry survey by the BDO consulting company - even before the drilling ban on Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance also complains about the uncertainty in the industry: "No one knows exactly what will change with the regulation."
Investments in new funding projects would be suspended until further notice - the burden of growth.
Ogoniland burned down
The water in the rivers is oil brown, it smells like at the tank station: billions of litres of crude oil have destroyed nature in the Nigerian Ogoni country.
People live from theft, corruption and illegal oil cooking.
Celestine Akpobari thinks it's good.
"Don't pay off," the eco-activist reassures the journalists: "You'll still get enough oil before the lens."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has been trying to light up a boy running through the water to his chest with the veils around him: In the rainbow-coloured water gloss, the scene seems almost beautiful.
It is not possible to see that under the surface of brown crude oil swivel.
Earlier, she had collected shrimp here, says Esther Badom on the shore of the Bodo-Jetti river.
In the meantime, the river is completely dead.
Five years ago, a brushed tube line was made up of lots of crude oil into the huge wet area.
Fishers from the nearby towns of Bodo now need to mine six hours to get into fishy waters: the country of Ogoni located in the heart of the Niger Delta is considered one of the world's worst-damaged regions.
On the journey through the mangrove bumps through the flow of rivers, the whole extent of destruction is apparent.
Instead of light water, the motorboat breaks up brown bridges, who dives his hand into the water pulls out oily fingers.
The roots of the mangrove trees say like black lactating stems from the ground, which sadly allow the individual palm trees to hang their folds.
Bird fever, as they are otherwise common in wetlands, is sought for forgiveness: As soon as the outer borders are silent, the former paradise, like a tank, spreads spences of peace.
"What happens here is ecological warfare," says Celestine Akpobari window: "We live in constant danger to health."
The war comparison is in place.
The Ogoni settlement area has been a battle field for decades: here the first explorers from Europe entered more than 60 years ago, here organized in the 1980s with the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa of the first resistance, here the Shell Group had to stop its production because it was too dangerous for its oil workers.
Today, the company is still denied the return to Ogoniland: while from the three-fold size of Switzerland with more than 5000 drilling sources and 7,000 kilometres of pipelines are pumped daily over two million blocks of black gold, the oil fields in Ogoniland are broken, the situation is too unstable for the group.
All a few hundred meters say stealthy statues like bizarre sculptures from the water: "Christ Trees" are called the heads of holes too delicate.
They are up to 50 years old, most of them corroded to the mark.
Such a drilling head breaks down again and again, Akpobari says, then a constant stream of crude oil runs into the water.
More than two billion litres are flown into the Delta's ecosystem in 50 years according to expert estimates: year by year the amount of oil, as it was forced into the sea in the case of the "Exxon Valdez" super tanker 21 years ago in front of Alaska - one of the greatest environmental disasters in the history of humanity.
Those who are responsible for the continuing eco-GAU will be challenged.
While the Shell Group is responsible for the sabotage and organised oil-derived steel for more than 90 percent of pollution, environmental protection workers see heavy drilling heads and leak pipelines as the main cause.
Shell, a much lower safety standards in Nigeria than elsewhere in the world, presented to the Group in 2008 by US scientist Richard Steiner: Only the rate of defects in the guidelines is "a multiple higher than elsewhere".
At a place that looks like a deserted, oil-smelling workshop under free sky, emerge from the mangrove shapes: they are split and oil-smelling up to the neck.
Under one of the many fibers that are partially connected to pipes, partly randomly scattered on the ground, a flame is flinging: an illegal little refinery.
In the facade, the oil is heated over the fire for several hours, explains Michael, the group's head.
First, petrol penetrates through the tube into the cap, then drop field at the end of the line of kerosene and finally diesel.
Michael and four employees produce up to four barrels of diesel at 300 liters daily: "This brings us 34,000 Naira" - about 22 dollars.
The Delta residents use the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil country in black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The ridiculously low price of almost 40 Euro cents per litre of diesel can still be offered by illegal cooks: because they get their raw material for nothing.
It comes from "Bunkers", which blow the pipeline across Ogoniland: This way experts throughout Niger Delta lose at least 16 million litres of crude oil per day.
However, only a small part of the intermediate raw material is illegally processed: the lion's share of organized criminal networks, including politicians and high-ranking military, are to be filled in tank ships and are toppled on the world market.
The debate on whether the environmental disaster is due to population or lax production is due to revolutions, the Akpobari activist considers it purely academic.
"If the oil companies did not consider themselves to be insurgents and did not destroy the fishers' living ground, there would be no sabotage or theft and illegal refineries."
Meanwhile, the Ogoni's relationship to Shell has been disrupted, but in this way only a withdrawal of the Group is infrequent: "Perhaps other nationalities like the Chinese will be better off."
Michael's getting nervous.
"The maximum time that you disappears," says the muscular oilman.
"Every minute the soldiers can come."
If the illegal oil refiners are caught by the special unit of the fighting forces, they are not threatened with imprisonment, but rather with a painful butter money.
The soldiers from the north of the country, like all Nigerians, want to benefit from the raw material.
"This damn witness has brought our country in every respect to the dog," Akpobari says.
Detectors detect dangerous buffers in A380 engines
The A380 obviously has a major safety problem.
Researchers have discovered in the investigation of a non-terrestrial machine a possible buffer that could lead to a "catastrophe-drive failure".
The flight of Qantas now wants to report to the engine manufacturer.
The passengers of Qantas-Airbus had apparently much more luck in early November than in the past: the Australian Air Safety Authority has identified a major safety problem in its investigations with the engines of some A380 machines - and now warns against a possible boomer.
The potential defect would have serious consequences: in the case of an oil pipeline connection, it could cause fatigue and leakage, it was mentioned in an opinion published this Thursday by the ATSB.
This could have led to "a catastrophic failure in driving".
Affected were the engines produced by Rolls-Royce in 20 aircraft of the A380 series.
Below is the Quantas-Airbus, which had to land in Singapore on 4 November.
The Australian airline has now launched legal steps against the British turbine manufacturers.
She founded a complaint at an Australian federal court in Sydney, allowing him to take further legal action against the company.
Quantas Chief Alan Joyce said his airline will claim damages for the incident in early November.
At the engine fire, parts had dissolved and the wear surfaces had been damaged.
Rolls-Royce made an oil fire as a cause of damage.
In the meantime, up to 40 engines have to be replaced worldwide.
The Australian investigators announced to carry out further safety tests on the superjumbos equipped with the affected drives.
The safety recommendation was the result of collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said ATSB-Speaker Martin Dolan.
The security problem has been considered important enough to inform all concerned.
After landing the Qantas machine, the airline had kept its A380 fleet on the ground for weeks.
Singapore Airlines temporarily left about three of its eleven A380 on the ground.
The Lufthansa replaced the engine with an A380 as a precautionary measure.
The double-stock flyer is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
Landwide snow breaks out traffic chaos
Germany completely white: Over the night snow has fallen almost all over the country.
On many streets chaos, trains and flights fall.
At least three people died in car accidents.
The winter freezes Germany: At icy temperatures, almost the whole Republic is added to the night on Thursday - which leads to traffic chaos in many places.
In the north and the east there are in part 15 centimeters thick snow cover.
On several motorways and many roads, traffic is severely restricted.
At the A7 at Flensburg, the winter service was in permanent service, but was not finished with the ever-increasing snow.
In addition, the shores of the Baltic Sea were damp.
The Federal Office for Seafaring and Hydrography (BSH) is expected at the eastern coast of Schleswig-Holsteins from early morning to storm currents with water stops of 1.2 metres above normal.
In Saxony, the snowflakes on the motorways and the roads led to major problems.
According to the weather-centered weather media, alarm level was therefore violet in the Saxon Switzerland - the highest level at all.
In part, 30 centimeters of neuschnee, fresh and strong winds provided shelters.
There remained several trucks and cars in the night.
Even in Saxony-Anhalt, police authorities reported major road disturbances.
On the A2, snow and wind led to stockpiling traffic and staus.
In Thuringia, the A4 and A9 were affected by snow.
According to Deutsche Bahn, there are significant disturbances in Saxony, Sachsen-Anhalt, Thuringia and Northern Bayern.
The main problems are snowing on the glaciers, felling trees on the rails, or damaged roofs and softs.
In Saxony, the distance from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be stopped.
In the Turkish Saalfield, an ICE had to stop its journey to Munich.
The 165 passengers were provided by firemen and rescue workers with wool blankets, food and drinks on the train.
Snowwinds flew across the streets.
On large German airports, the snow winds lead to numerous accidents.
Some cancellations have already been notified in Munich, according to a spokesperson for the Air Traffic Management Centre.
In Frankfurt am Main, 40 flights had already been cancelled, according to a freight speaker.
The winter service is in permanent use.
Although only a few beached passengers are at the airport, they still have almost 400 field beds.
On many streets there were accidents already on Wednesday night.
In the evening, a truck driver came to life with a train on a train crossing in Ostholstein.
The driver was slightly injured.
In the vicinity of Nuremberg there was a similar accident due to snow-covered roads: here too a truck was recorded on a train crossing because the vehicle was stuck.
The driver died.
Four passengers were injured in the train - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was therefore blocked until morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after she had hit a smooth street with her car at Aschapenburg.
However, the meteorologists have good news: although the snow will still be smooth and powdery, it will therefore be shaken by slight bends.
But the wind will slow down.
Only the Baltic Sea is visited by fast and stormy winds.
However, it remains very cold - instead up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers
The Deutsche Bank wants to separate from its flag: According to a newspaper report, the money house is looking for buyers for the two office towers at its Frankfurt headquarters.
Up to EUR 500 million could bring the property.
The Deutsche Bank has only made its group seat attractive: the twin towers in Frankfurter Bankenvirtel have been modernised; the banks have now been allowed back to their old workplace.
But now the financial group wants to recover the costs for the renovation - and is looking for a buyer for the two high houses, as the "Financial Times Germany" is calling on a speaker.
Reasons for the planned sale were not called by the speaker.
"We always check whether it makes sense to own or sell real estate and then rent it back," he said.
Thus, Germany's largest credit institution will return to its firm office after a short period of time.
The Bank had taken over the double door only in mid-2007 for EUR 272 million from the investors of a home-owned fund and then carefully repaired it.
The energy conversion went down to around EUR 200 million.
A sale would probably make the bank a lot of money.
Industry experts estimate the value of the paper's towers, which are now called "Greenovers", according to about EUR 500 million.
Whether the buildings are resold to a fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor, it is still open, the speaker said.
Thousands of tears for a dead friend
More than 10,000 people in New Zealand thought of the sheltered mountain meadows that were declared dead after several explosions in a mine.
The bodies could still not be secured because the safety situation in the accident box is still precarious.
Almost two weeks ago, the Pike River Mine near the town of Greymouth came to a severe explosion.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were buried under days.
A probe had been left in the accident box, but no trace of survivors had been found.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and subsequent explosions, no rescue forces could be lowered for safety reasons.
After the second severe detonation, the authorities and experts assumed that there was no longer any chance of survival for the buddy.
The bodies could not be secured until now.
Now relatives and friends remembered with a memorial feast to the dead.
Tens of thousands of people had gathered on the New Zealand South Island in a radiant sunlight in Greymouth.
They've been quiet for two minutes.
To the honor of the protected mountains there were 29 tables on which were visible Helms, lamps and the names of the palate.
Pictures and personal items, including clothes and surfboards, also found their place here.
In front of the country's government buildings, the flags were half-mast.
New Zealand hoped that the miners would "from the depths of the earth" would come back to the surface," said New Zealand Prime Minister John Key to the participants in the Memorial.
"But they never came home."
He could not finish with the death of his son until he had seen his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the grave.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the victims' members, several foreign diplomats attended the Memorial.
In the first explosion on 19 November, mountains of British and South African origin were also removed.
Rescue workers began to wipe out a fire inside the coal mine on the island of New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gas is forced, it will begin to cool the glowing temperatures inside the mine, police president Gary Knowles told reporters.
To hell, warrior!
Does Splatter fit in with the art cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn has re-entered old genre boundaries with his "Wallala Rising" champion-epos.
What audience may the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have thought about when he turned "Wallala Rising"?
A prisoner Viking warrior with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) is released from his tormentors and is dying with almost superhuman forces, especially his opponents - sounds ideal for young male viewers looking for blood action, just because our hero likes to use rabid killing methods and his enemies will have already traveled the thunders out of the living body when he has bad pay.
On the other hand, Insight says, as he is actually called, that the whole film is not about a word, and also the other figures are able to raise at most one or two sentences or a few qualful screams of death.
Otherwise, it will be silent and in the gruesomely beautiful hillland of Scotland, which the Viking world offers its culture about a thousand years ago.
Ideal for adult cinematics with interest in existentialism and very quiet camera travel.
It's nice if a movie has multiple target groups, it only hurts if they exclude each other.
Director Winding Refn has since his wild and refined drug dealer trilogy "Pusher" as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, however, reluctantly refuses to make his works more humorous to the mainstream or somewhat less brutality to the arthouse.
Most art cinema friends are allowed to be frightened by the surrounding brain mass and the moods.
The action fans die not later than long ago when eyes for free interpretable reasons with a troops of violent Christian missionaries break up by ship to Jerusalem and hold an eternity in flute and nebula before the team appears to arrive in America and there remains silent.
No wonder, then, that "Wallala Rising" in Germany has not found any cinema rental and has now only appeared on DVD.
This is especially because of the beautiful pictures a pity, but also because behind the pretentious to bloodthirsty facade a sometimes exciting piece of cinema that has earned some attention.
In this film it's not about dialogue or a strict action, it's all atmosphere, a filmed fever dream.
And there's no way out of that for the audience.
Refn barely takes him a moment of relaxation and cuts him with his icy pictures and the thin trance-like soundtrack quite slowly to the throat, but especially with the unfathomable hate that confronts him from the hearts of the figures.
Only a little blonde boy, who is faithful to his side, is preserved as innocent, all others are driven by anger.
Most of the one-eyed hero whose motive is never explained, but who will ever become a warrior from hell for enemies and temporary allies, possibly a messenger of the devil himself.
It means corruption, but perhaps only for those who have been corrupted anyway.
"Walhalla Rising" is a hideous film that you can hate and admire, for trouble, excitement and stun.
An experience.
Crews of soil
The IAEA has new indications of a secret nuclear programme in Syria.
The country, however, is reluctant to take a position on this - it still allows for controls.
At least four Israeli F-15 I combat aircraft attack a mysterious, vertebral building in Syria by midnight of 5 September 2007.
It is on the shore of the Euphrates; the next largest city, 30 kilometers away, is Dair as-Saur.
Its name appears in documents of the International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA) when it comes to the reactor that Syria allegedly built with the help of North Korea in the framework is hidden in a valley that runs from the current.
According to a letter from the CIA Foreign Secret Service at the end of April 2008, the reactor running under the name of the nearby town of El Kibar would have been well suited to produce plutonium - from which nuclear weapons were built.
For other purposes, however, the technique is hardly out of the 50s.
The CIA conducted a video presentation with unscathed satellite images.
By computer animation, it blended into what components of the reactor should have been before the destruction, which is a reduced copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyon nuclear centre.
She also presented photos showing the building from the vicinity or even the interior.
The reactor was just before the launch, it was, but it has not yet been filled with fuel.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, it is hardly more known than at the time, since the puzzles have become much bigger with time.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush has recently revealed in his memoirs that the CIA was quite certain before the attack that Syria was building a reactor in El Kibar, but hardly noticed that there was "an active nuclear programme" in the country.
Some secret officers in Europe prefer to be more cautious and speak only of a "probably reactor", even though they hold the CIA presentation as "pleusable".
You lack hard evidence, as well as the IAEA.
Asked how sure he was to have a reactor ahead of him, a high UN diplomat answered only Lapidar in the summer, which the IAEA has "sufficient material to ask questions".
The Syrians, however, created a bad side of the alleged "unused military building" and planned the site thoroughly.
However, in June 2008, an IAEA team was found under former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen in El Kibar traces of uranium produced by humans.
In addition, the IAEA received via a Member State satellite images of a commercial provider from time to time immediately after the attack which should be more pronounced than those presented by the CIA.
However, these recordings are not available on the market because the unknown customer - perhaps Israel - has bought them exclusively.
The IAEA cannot therefore independently verify its authenticity.
Syria has always praised never having operated a secret nuclear program or built a reactor.
The uranium came from the Israeli weapons, Damascus said.
However, the IAEA found this to be unlikely after analysis of the particles.
Since then Damascus has refused to discuss this - as well as the satellite images.
It also condemns the inspectors a second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the ruins of the bombed building.
But Israel is also slow to anger.
"We will never comment on this," the Prime Minister Ehud Olmert recently confirmed the official position at the time of the attack.
Thus, the investigation of the case has been unsuccessful since June 2008 and "becomes increasingly a serious credibility problem for the Authority", as a high Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna - finally, a serious breach of the Nuclear-Weapon Treaty lies in the area over which the IAEA is waiting.
As a key to progress in the enlightenment process, the IAEA apparently sees three other institutions that are to be "in functional connection" with the mutative reactor - and other than this one still exist.
To date, the inspectors have not revealed what plants they are or what function they have or what they are likely to appear to be.
According to information from the Süddeutsche Zeitung, they are internally referred to as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandarayah at the IAEA, again derived from nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) has identified these sites and discovered a building complex at Masyaf on satellite images, where it is most likely one of the suspicious objects.
It may be located in or directly next to a military base - precisely with this justification Syria of the IAEA reserves access to the three places.
In Vienna it is said that the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA will be sent by the United States to evacuate military facilities.
Because the nuclear detectives were paying attention to the institutions by a tip from the US intelligence services.
The IAEA has indicated, including satellite photos, that between the three places and the framework of the Euphrates material was transported back and forth.
A high Western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the plants could "be related to fuel production".
However, there is "no indication of sensitive activities", i.e. uranium enrichment or reprocessing; processes necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is operated with uranium, which is not enriched.
But where the uranium should have come from and from which the plutonium for the bomb should be separated, there are at least plausible suspicions about these central questions.
It is also unclear whether drums that could contain valuable traces were stored in three places.
If the hundreds of trucks had disappeared from the ground, no one wanted to know where the protection was.
The saltmine al-Tibni, located just a few kilometres from El-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, which Syria has investigated on its 1998 suitability as a storage facility for radioactive waste, is considered unlikely.
Former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley recently contacted the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the renowned magazine Jane's Intelligence Review.
However, recordings from the Orbit show that Syria took over work in the three suspicious locations and removed large containers after the IAEA had requested access.
This may be a coincidence, but it has hardly contributed to the elimination of suspicion.
Moreover, in diplomatic circles, the IAEA has used several months to develop an inspection plan there that should allow Syria to keep any military secrets - only the effort shown to show how much the inspectors' interest is.
India, Damascus has also tabled this proposal.
Having weakened Western diplomats in Vienna a year ago, the reactor has been destroyed, so the matter has not been of high urgency, like US ambassador Glyn Davies has been putting so-called special inspections into the game for a few months, one of the strongest means that the Vienna nuclear power has to carry out controls.
IAEA Chief Yukiya Amano, who was to propose these inspections, has already spoken of "an option for which I am open in the future", but he is still slowing down.
There is a high risk in this way: for one thing, it requires a majority in the IAEA Board of Governors, and some of the 35 countries represented there are all other than climbing on an escalation.
To others, how to think of a diplomat: "What if they find nothing at all?"
Love in War’s Times
Since Angelina Jolie started working on her nameless estate in the summer, there's been a lot of trouble.
The book she wrote herself, a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man.
Much more you don't know about it - but that's enough for trouble.
The rumor is that the woman, a Muslim, fell in love with her Serbian rapist during the Yugoslavian war.
Bosnian women's associations immediately protested, after which some of the rotations planned in Sarajevo were moved to Hungary in the short term.
Meanwhile, the film has been filmed in Hungary and in post-production, but it is still protested in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic from the organization of female victims of war wrote about the UN Refugee Relief Agency UNHCR to Jolie and requested a meeting with the actress, a Bosnian newspaper has now reported - Jolie herself is a UN Refugee Relief Agency ambassador.
She is not diplomatic - she has already offered the women a meeting in Hungary a week ago, but they refused.
The meeting must take place in Bosnia, says Hasecic.
Love stories in rape camps did not exist, and Jolie's attitude towards the victims betrayed her enough about the spinbook.
Her organization has recommended that the UN Refugee Assistance Agency to release Jolie as an ambassador, reports the Guardian.
What exactly did Jolie write for scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which was able to read her book, has granted one turn and one turn for Sarajevo - it is not clear why Jolie then did not come.
The young author himself claims that she does not pursue political purposes with her film, has worked hard in the Yugoslavian conflict, wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give a voice to all the parties involved.
However, the content remains vague.
This is how a second synopsis of the film takes place in the network, which sounds quite different: the lovers knew about it before the war broke out and met again when she, a Bosnian Muslim, is dragged into a Serbian camp where he works as a guard.
What sounds a lot different than the variant "violence victims get involved in torture".
That Jolies film actually starts before the war - so much is safe.
The pressure on her, says Jolie, is "unfair and based on misinformation".
Now you can only give her the hackers of Hollywood peace: by putting the spinbook, like so many before, illegally into the net.
Nothing like this.
This evening, it finally runs right around again for the Iranians.
No trace of confusion.
The home team dominates its guests from Sweden, Finland and the United States too.
The fans cried out for joy in dazzling loud music, they stomped with their feet.
The Bailey pub is located in the Southern Cork because the players throw table tennis balls over a three-meter distance in beer pools - and meet.
"Bierpong" is called the bizarre show to win, there is 500 Euro prize plus tickets to Las Vegas for the brewing world championships in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet type; this chilly drink game and the withholding computerist that doesn't really fit together.
And yet the 26-year-old tries to amuse himself to get away from the boring question that will bring the future.
On his plan there is no play in Las Vegas, he will conduct application talks in New Zealand in January.
"I have a feeling of silence," he says.
"It's so far away from home and I still don't have a job there."
Always: His girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "she had back, sucked her desire as an event manager, maybe a good sign," says the young man and laughs.
Because of poor prospects at home, two of the Tanners' three siblings have already sought their happiness abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, and his brother Colin now has a place as an IT consultant in London.
The boys go: As with the dancers, it looks like on the island in many families.
100,000 Irish will probably leave the country in the near future, experts from the ESRI Economic and Social Research Institute in Dublin predict.
By 2015, they have even accounted for 200,000 immigrants.
For the small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants a severe loss.
If the forecasts are preserved, there is a wave of migration comparable to that of Ireland in the 1980s.
After a decade of upsurge, which brought great prosperity to the Iranians, there is now a new wave of sadness.
The economic crisis in particular insinuates the young well-educated Iranians, for which it has only been uphill.
Job loss and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone was needed, money was in the outflow.
Meanwhile, three out of ten women and men are under thirty without work.
In the Irish Times there are also letters of young immigrants who complain: "Everything goes down the river in Ireland."
"There should be a rebellion against politicians and bankers - but who can go away and our country loses a whole generation."
"The last one will then light up."
Jura-Student Leanne Caulfield, President of the Irish Student Union, sees a darker future, because the government only operates eye desire and gives young people no prospects for the future.
"They reduce minimum wages, but they have no strategy to create new jobs," says the 20-year-old.
She observes how her compilitons hang from an unpaid practice to the next.
Her greatest concern, she says, is to have to migrate alone in four years.
"This thought is sad and depressing."
Men like Stephen McLarnnon are trying to raise the issue positively.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a trade fair that offers a round-the-clock service on the subject of foreign work.
"For starters, working abroad is a great opportunity to take the first steps on the career leader," says the manager.
On his website are photos of surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not a gallery service, but also brings freedom and fun.
How it feels to build something somewhere, Seán O'Donovan has known for half a year.
Because there was nothing more to do for the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland, he is now working with 15 Irish colleagues on construction in Germany.
In Gelsenkirchen, they just pulled up a fashion house.
In January, it goes on to Hannover or Berlin, for the next project.
His home sees O'Donovan now only rarely, because he makes extra layers to pay off the credit for his home.
"The situation is already a bit crazy," he says, when he comes for the first time over the dust of his house.
"I earn money in Germany for a house in Ireland where I am as good as ever."
He smiles a little bit and goes through cold rooms.
The small house is located in a fine residential area with well-maintained suburbs, in the entrances park large, expensive cars.
Together with a sister O'Donovan bought the house for four years ago for 380,000 euros - 100 percent of credit.
"There were crazy times, there was easy money without many questions," he says.
He's afraid it might happen with the credit?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, throws hot tea and says, "I don't have kids to feed and I'm young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start from New."
The construction engineer doesn't like the complaint he's hearing at the moment.
"No one has to starve - our situation is not as dramatic as it was on the island in earlier times," he says.
"Working abroad for a while is not the worst thing that can happen - maybe we only feel like Irish."
He laughs and then tells of his father who went to England in the last great economic crisis.
"After seven years he was back there and life went on in Ireland, quite simply."
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Let the future open and just look at how it goes with life everywhere.
A few years of work in London, he's already behind him, and why shouldn't he and his girlfriend be doing well in New Zealand?
But there is still one thing that makes him very anxious in these days: the celebration of his 27th birthday in Dublin on Friday.
He's afraid it might look like a lifetime party.
"Only not too many emotions," he says and drinks a great blow from his beer.
"Life, that sounds scary."
"Let's call it a road party, quite loose, with a couple of friends, a couple of drinks, a couple of games."
The Democratic Routine
The movement of democracy in Latin America is becoming stronger, as is the support of private companies.
Crime is a bigger problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region, the influence of Brazil is greater than that of the United States.
These results resulted in the Latinobarometer survey conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively in The Economist.
This survey has been carried out on a regular basis since 1995 and thus shows the change of opinion in this region.
Two facts are particularly evident in this year's September and October survey.
First of all, the good mood in Latin America
Secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its main institutions.
In many countries on the South American Pacific coast, the democratic movement has increased significantly (see Table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy has grown by about 6% annually since 2002, the number of advocates of democracy rose from 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
Even in Mexico, where the economy recovers from the strong break-in last year, such a trend is to be recognized.
However, only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the most populous countries in the region, are convinced Democrats, which reduces the regional average (see Figure 2).
Some 44% of the respondents stated that they were satisfied with the democratic practice of their country, which is as much as in the last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (Figure 3).
About 34% trust the Congress of their country and 45% of their government. Both values correspond to those of the last year, but show a significant increase compared to 2003 (17% or 24%).
A decade ago, Latin America's economic crises undermined the efforts to increase democracy.
This also lasted during the global economic crisis, possibly because the Latin American countries experienced only a short period of recession and recovered quickly.
In addition, the poor were captured by a stronger social network.
(According to reports from the UN Economic Commission for Latin America this week, the poverty rate in Latin America rose only slightly in 2009 and fell by 32% again this year.)
But from country to country there are strong mood differences (see Figure 4).
Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of the separate president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, are reflected in a widespread vision of progress.
In Mexico and Central America, where recession was more sensitive and crime increased, this is less the case.
For the second time since the beginning of the survey, many questions in Latin America in crime in their country have seen a greater problem than in unemployment (see Figure 5).
About 31% say that they either themselves or a family member have been victims of a crime in the last year. However, compared to 38% in the last year, the values have fallen and have thus reached the lowest level since 1995.
The increase in economic performance is reflected in the stronger support of the private and market economy: about 71% of the respondents over the region reported that the private economy was indispensable for development, 56% in 2007 (see Figure 6).
Approximately 58% said that only the market economy can make progress in its country, compared with 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of people in Venezuela have maintained this view (and 80% are for a private economy), although their left-wing President, Hugo Chávez, has made many private companies public.
According to 19% of respondents (18% last year) Brazil has the largest weight in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% last year).
On the other hand, respondents in Mexico and most countries in Central America see the most influential country in the United States, taking over this role in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua of Venezuela.
An Chosen Sleeve
No one had expected the elections to be perfect in Haiti on November 28.
But the facts far outweighed the fears of the electors who sought to help the oppressed country.
Filled polls, multiple votes cast, ballots in the rainstone, destroyed polls and intimidations were only part of the problems.
Vohlokale opened with hours of delay.
Many Haitians, many of whom had become homeless by the earthquake in January, fought around looking for an option.
Some finally gave up completely.
A dozen presidential candidates, including a number of moderate riders, demanded the abolition of the election results due to alleged fraud.
There were some violent protests across the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the leader of the UN mission in Haiti, called the election "as well in many ways".
According to a cautious statement by observers of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community, "they make these irregularities, so seriously they also like it, not necessarily invalidating the process".
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral authority, which is allegedly obliged to separate President René Préval and his candidate, Jude Célestin, will announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The expected elections are called for in January.
There's still hope in the election.
The two leading opposition candidates, rap musician Michel Martelly and former First-Lady Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn their initial call for invalidity.
If Jude Célestin, who finds only little or no consent from the voters, explains from the electoral authority to the winner of the election, this could lead to problems.
Due to the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million Earthquakes still live in tents, a small election was feared.
On the election day, many Haitians were prevented by the lack of organisation from giving their votes.
Shortly before the start of the election, about 250,000 demonstrations required for the election were not yet distributed.
There's a lot in the game.
The donor countries consider a legitimate, recognized government as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
The Haitians themselves are of the same opinion.
Holy in the middle
In the weeks following your husband's sudden death, Argentina's president, Cristina Fernández, experienced a wave of sympathy that has driven her popularity rate up to over 50%. This is the highest value since her election in 2007.
However, whether you will help this to a re-election next year depends on whether the apparently grieving Cristina Fernández is compromiser than her deceased husband, her predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
The signs for this are not clear.
Néstor Kirchner, who followed his wife’s choice of economic policy, often put forward budgetary plans that did not fully take into account tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the President-in-Office to issue the extra revenue according to his own discretion.
On paper, the Fernández government lost the majority of the Congress last year.
But the opposition was divided and Kirchner's death after a heart attack on October 27 led to further overthrows.
Some regime critics from the ranks of the ruling Peronists stood behind Cristina Fernández.
But after chaotic meetings (when one parliamentarian struck another and others visited the government of protection), it was not possible for the Congress to adopt the 2011 budget.
"I will not discuss this," said the President.
The 2010 budget is now also valid for the following year, which gives the President an even more opportunity to spend money on his own merits.
The economy is running hot: it is likely to grow by up to 9% this year.
For example, the official rate of inflation is 11.1%, but numerous private estimates - and wage requirements of trade unions - drive the value to almost 30%.
Kirchner, who took over the office in 2003, when Argentina was protected by economic crises, explained growth and poverty reduction to its main objectives, not inflation.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, harassed the private sector and refined the National Institute for Statistics and Population Indexing INDIC, which then decorated the official inflation statistics.
Can Fernández take a more moderate course now?
She called the private economy and the trade union leaders for talks.
And according to official statements, wage increases are to be limited to 18% next year.
The high world market prices for Argentina's agricultural products have given the economy a strong boost.
However, inflation undermined growth by a major devaluation in 2002.
It is possible that Cristina Fernández wants to return to the rest of the world financially for this reason.
At the beginning of this year, the Government entered into an agreement with securities holders who had rejected the country's previous debt in 2001.
Now, Fernández seems to force an agreement with the donors from the Paris Club, which she owes about $6.7 billion.
The Churchmen had always rejected a check by the IMF, as elsewhere usual.
Last month, however, Minister of Economic Affairs Amado Boudou announced that the fund would provide "technical support" in the creation of a new national consumer price index, which would appear to be the first step towards cleaning the INDIC.
It is not known whether Fernández will be politically active after the end of her term of office even without the support of her husband.
If so, it needs the support of the middle layer, which most of it has enough of the church.
When the Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy they have been taken away will be lost.
If she wants to win another choice, she has to decide whether she will silence and silence many political decisions of her husband.
Weak Applaus for China
Taiwan's voters are slowly approaching a closer connection to the mainland.
What does Taiwan hold from his great brother beyond the sea?
On 27 November more than 7.5 million voters, which are 70% of all voters, were elected to choose mayors and city halls in the five districts. This is assessed as a broad assessment by President Ma Ying-jeou.
Through the establishment of career-stricken business relations, including a partial free trade agreement, Ma herself is a symbol of relations to the mainland. Its policy has changed the relationship to the Chinese mother country for the first time since 1949.
Ma has passed the test, but only recently.
Although his Kuomintang Party (KMT) appointed three of the five mayors, she did not receive a majority.
Instead, the Democratic Progress Party (DPP), which advocates greater independence in Taiwan, received almost 50% of the votes that KMT received 45%.
In the event of a presidential election, this would have meant problems for Ma.
Since his election two years ago, his party's vote has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP even joined the KMT in the stadium.
During the election, it came to the usual events in Taiwan, such as truck convoys with screwdrivers, flag-sweeping crowd trains and only well-dressed dancers.
There was even the obligatory, mysterious attempted murder.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan and the honorary chairman of the KMT, gave a speech on a KMT candidate on the election night,
When a man from the crowd shot him in the face. Lien was wounded and a constant observer was killed.
Bizarre pointer is not clear whether the soldier killed lines or wanted to fight with the candidate.
Regardless of this, according to Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, affected the election and the DPP got into a bad light, which the KMT has protected more votes.
Perhaps China was the biggest winner of the campaign.
Significantly, relations with the mainland have not been thematicized.
Instead, the candidates discussed plans for social housing and job creation.
The Taiwanese love their actual independence and reject China's military threat.
For this reason, KMT does not like its relations with the government in Beijing.
But this time also avoids the DPP to hear the anti-Chinese feelings very much.
She responded to the new awareness that Taiwan’s economy cannot survive without China.
Ma would like to confirm that the majority of Taiwanese are in favour of their China policy.
The Government in Beijing will continue to pursue its strategy of bringing Taiwan back to the Community with economic incentives.
China immediately sent a retailer to Taipei to prepare a summit meeting for investment security and medical cooperation.
It certainly also wants political integration, but first of all.
It is therefore more likely to wait until the 2012 presidential elections.
The DPP has now re-founded itself.
Two years ago she was very weak: the former party leader Chen Shui-bian was in prison for corruption.
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he made a major contribution to absolute independence.
But under Tai's regentship, a new generation of politicians developed and the DPP fought for the voices of professionals and young people.
Tsai, as a presidential candidate for the DPP, found great agreement, such as Su Tseng-chang under Chen.
Your party is now doing everything to show that it is also able to build close relationships with Beijing.
Tsai plans an idea charm as a point of contact between DPP and China. However, this presupposes unprejudiced discussions.
Tsai publicly stated that its party offers a "confidential alternative" to mass advance approach to China.
Chen seems very upset about this change.
From his cell he explained that the DPP candidates would have done better to be independent on Taiwan.
He even called on Pragmatic Su to give up the presidential candidacy.
Even without Chen's interference, the DPP is difficult to choose its potential candidates.
The KMT will have to undergo its own self-analysis.
Mas values are bad, despite rapid economic growth; the KMT candidates wanted to make their election without him.
The main reasons for his infidelity seem to be unemployment and the continuing scarcity between the poor and the rich.
According to a KMT speaker, he will be redesigned his cabinet as well as the local facilities.
The strong presence of the DPP suggests that Taiwan is only in favour of a limited re-negotiation.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic cooperation with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "there is no longer any return."
Grammy nominations: The jazz singer Esperanza Spalding was surprisingly awarded in the Newcomer category of the year
If you appear at the request of a President, people will notice it.
President Obama himself asked Esperanza Spalding to attend the 2009 Nobel Prize ceremony. Now the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer was nominated mainly for this year's Grammy in the Newcomer category of the year.
Given the fact that Spalding has already been a celebrated star in the jazz scene since her album "Esperanza" in 2008, the nomination appears a bit unusual. However, it complies with the Grammy rules, after which an artist may have released at least three albums prior to the release of the album, with which he was known in the general public.
Her ambitious 2010 album, "Camber Music Society", is certainly a step forward. And with her excited voice and a good feeling for pop, funk and Latin music, you can quietly compare Spalding with Norah Jones 2003, whose great success in 2003 comes as a jazz interpreter in this category of nomination Spaldings next.
The album "History" of the Vijay Iyer Trios was also nominated in the instrument album category. This appreciation of the critics was a great success.
Among Iyer's competitors are "Moody 4B" by experienced saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" by keyboard John Beasley.
Trombone Shorty, a roby favorite from New Orleans and a frequent guest in HBOs "Treme", was awarded in the category of contemporary jazz, where other albums by Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber can be found.
The Secret Society of Wild Steampunk-Musicist Darcy James Argue has received well-deserved attention in the category of the Great Group. He is thus working against the Billy Child's Emsemble with his chamber jazz and the adventurous Dave Holland and his Octette, whose life-ablum "Pathways" is a good example for a bassist as a democratic band leader.
Grammy nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead in the classic categories
The classic nominations for the 53rd Grammy Award contain a colorful mix of musicians and composers from all over the world.
The list of Michael Daughertys "Deux Ex Machine" for piano and orchestra with five votes, and Steve Mackeys "Dreamhouse", an eclectic orchestra with three votes.
Among the nominees with connections to southern California is the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt with his symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles". This piece was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonics and was launched in 2009 at the Walt Disney Concert Hall.
The composer Avner Dorman in L.A. was also nominated for his Mandolin concert.
Classic nominations are divided into 13 categories, from orchestra, opera, choir to solo recordings.
Five artists were nominated this year in the category of classic producers - Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Among the nominated classical albums are Bruckners Symphonies No. 3 and 4 of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daughertys "Deus Ex Machine" and "Metropolis Symphony" played by Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackeys "Dreamhouse" by Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacificium - the Art of the Castrati" presented by various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" by Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chor.
In the opera category, "Lulu from the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hases "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariahos "L'Amour de Loin" by the German Symphony Orchestra Berlin; Rodion Shchedrins "The Enchanted Wanderer" by the Orchestra and Chor of the Marine Theatre; and Arthur Sullivans "Ivanhoe" by BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
As composers, Pärt für Symphonie No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machine", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionattet Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer" for a Grammy.
Pärts Symphonie No. 4 was recorded and recorded at Disney Hall on January 4 by the L.A. Philharmonics led by Esa-Pekka salons.
The approximately 30-minute piece bears the title "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to former oil magnate Mikhail Chodorkowski, who is in prison in Russia.
Dorman's "Mondoline Concert" received a nomination in the category Instrumentalsolo with Orchestra.
The composer from L.A. said he wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for the Mandoline artist Avi Avital, who performed the concert with the New York Metropolis Ensemble.
"I have used sounds from the Middle East and numerous North African sounds and rhythms," Dorman explained in a telephone interview.
Director Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the category Orchestra Award for a recording of the works of Strawinskis with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under his direction.
The pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin, organist Paul Jacobs, Geiger Julia Fischer and Harfinist Sarah Schuster Ericsson were nominated as instrumental soloists.
This year only women were nominated as vocalists, including Anne Sofie von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the category Classic Crossover, Soprano Jesse Norman was nominated for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song".
Mosque in Temecula wins the approval of the Planning Committee
The construction of a mosque in Temecula found the unanimous commitment of the local planning committee after a five-hour, often hot public hearing.
Critics proposed the project to promote both terrorism and traffic.
However, according to the Commission's statement on Wednesday evening, the new religious centre will comply with the local provisions and will become an aesthetic focus.
"The project is supported by many good people - by Christians, Jews, Bahais, and many others," said Hadi Nael, President of the Islamic Centre of Temecula Valley on Thursday.
"As an American, that makes me proud."
"It shows that justice reigns."
"There are only a few enemies," he added.
"They're just very loud."
"Wonderful people live in this valley."
The meeting began at 6:00 p.m. and the discussions for and against the construction of the centre lasted almost until midnight, with the votes on both sides being fairly distributed according to the press firm.
The debate was continued on the website of the newspaper.
"There is no America anymore," said one comment.
"It is another planet of monkeys, and the statue of freedom is dead in the sand."
"America is at the end."
Planned Islamic centers have also led to protests in other parts of the country, e.g. near Ground Zero, the scene of the terrorist attacks on New York City on September 11, 2001.
In Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush called for non-violence.
His community with approximately 135 families has lived peacefully in Riverside County for years. However, they wanted a larger and better place than the warehouse they rented together with a water filter manufacturer.
The new, about 2,300 m2 large mosque in the Mediterranean style is supposed to have two minerals and are about 13m high.
It is intended to be created on the approximately 17.500 m2 large plot on the Nicolas Road near the Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still object to the project at the city council.
Arsenic-resistant microbes could allow new forms of life on earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a foreign type of bacteria that can live by arsenic, among other things, opens up new possibilities for new forms of life on earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists have discovered this unusual bacteria here on earth, it is in their view a sign that life is possible even without the elements that have so far been considered vital.
"This organism has two possibilities."
"He needs to grow either phosphorus or arsenic."
"This makes it something very special, although it is almost a 'foreign' form of life," explained Paul C.W. Davies from Arizona State University and co-author of the report, which appears on Thursday in the online edition of the journal Science.
Until now, six main elements have been considered vital - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
But as scientists discovered, the bacteria in the California Mono Lake continue to grow when it is replaced by arsenic.
"That's where you ask yourself what else is possible," said the co-author of the Ariel D. Anbar report from Arizona State University.
The discovery is an important step in the search for extraterrestrial life, since scientists have to recognize life and its forms, says Anbar.
The study deals with microbes found on earth.
The announcement of a press conference that did not disclose any details of the discovery caused too much speculation on the Internet that the report could act on the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
This is not the case.
The discovery "shows that in other planetary systems organisms with the help of other elements biochemical processes can be put in place and that the 'standard elements', which we believe are absolutely vital, are not necessarily fixed," explained Charles Cockell, Professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute of the University of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom.
Cockel wasn't part of the research team.
"This work is a novel because it shows that in basic biochemical processes and structures one element can be replaced by another," said Cockell.
This discovery was not accidental.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon from NASA's Astrobiological Institute, which led the study, chose the Mono Lake because of its high arsenic content.
Since arsenic and phosphorus are chemically equal, they assume that microbes exposed to both may be able to replace one element by the other.
"The toxicity of arsenic is mainly based on the chemical behavior similar to phosphorus."
"This makes it difficult for organisms to distinguish one element from another."
"But the difference is so big that arsenic works differently than phosphorus. It reaches into our biochemical system, where it almost all fades," Anbar explains.
The researchers used the bacteria GFAJ-1 to produce an increasing arsenic concentration. It adapted and grew.
Although the microbe grows better in phosphorus, it also survives in arsenic, shows that an arsenic-based form of life can occur naturally, either on earth or on another planet or moon, on which arsenic occurs more often.
According to Jamie S. Foster, Professor of Microbiology at the University of Florida, the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic is not new. But so far there has been no working example.
Arsen came more often in the early years, she says, so science has assumed that early life forms have used it.
"There is reason to assume that life may have evolved differently than in the early age of the Earth," says Forster, who was not a member of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research work was supported by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Health Authorities.
Other stolen exhibition dogs found in Compton
The other two of the four exhibition dogs stolen from a Bellflower motel were found on Thursday, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's statement.
The four exhibition dogs - two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis - disappeared on Tuesday, as unknown the 2006 Chevrolet Express van, in which the animals were placed before a Belflower Motel 6 night, according to the authorities.
Two of the dogs were discovered on Wednesday afternoon, and the last two on Wednesday evenings, Steve Whitmore, a spokesperson for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, explains.
"The good news is: the dogs are well," says Whitmore.
"They're in good condition."
"They were returned to their rightful owners."
Whitmore did not make precise details of the site of the dogs yet to the circumstances that led to their discovery.
"The investigations are still under way."
"We don't want to say any more," Whitmore explains.
"We're tracking some tracks."
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not available on Thursday for information.
They took their two dogs in a district home in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
The sheriff's representatives found the delivery cars and the two dogs in different places in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old redhead, and Didi, a 10-month-old dog - were unharmed according to the government statement.
But the Corgis Bunny and Peter, Rickard and Peek wanted to present this week on behalf of their Japanese owners at the competition, remained missing until Wednesday evening.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were on this weekend because of the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach in the city, because Trace should participate in the competition.
As Peek of the Times announced on Wednesday, the other dogs should participate in other competitions on the days before the AKC/Eukanuba Show.
South California is a stop on the almost one-month tour of the couple from Dogschau to Dogschau.
On Monday evening, Peek and Rickard checked into the motel.
They often stayed in motels and park their car in front of their room window.
They took three more dogs - a boxing alley, a parson Russell terrier and a Brittany - with their motel room.
The thick Akitas and Corgis stayed in the truck because it was cooler there.
They left the window wide open, so the dogs had fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported their car stolen on Tuesday at 6:00.
Peek promised to anyone who could give a reference to the Corgis a finder's pay. The animals were implanted microchips for identification.
On Thursday it was not yet determined whether a finder's salary was paid.
The lion roars again after judicial approval of the MGM restructuring
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally got green light for a fresh start.
On Thursday, a new-York competition judge officially awarded the "prepared" creditor plan to pay off the debts of $5 billion and open the way for new movies and television shows to the 86-year-old entertainment company.
According to Thursday's statement, the plan meets the requirements of U.S. competition law, so that the restart of MGM under Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founders of Spyglass Entertainment, is no longer in the way. Barber and Birnbaum are presented to the somewhat speculative studio as the main business leader.
The number of employees is reduced from over 400 to about 320.
For MGM, Chapter 11 actually enters into force only when JPMorgan Chase has completed a planned loan of $500 million to finance new MGM productions.
At the moment, a consortium of the Investment Bank, which owns $75 million, will run the company. The funding will be up to mid-December.
The restructuring of the studio began in May 2009 with the assignment to the Investment Bank Moelis & Co, the company manager who fought with interest payments of $300 million/year to help solve their financial problems.
In August, Managing Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and restructuring expert known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis & Cooper's efforts to solve MGMs' financial concerns and pay out more than 140 creditors of the studio lasted longer than expected.
After months of discussions, the parties decided to offer the company at the end of 2009.
But the auction attracted only a few bidders and no one wanted to pay the $2 billion required by the creditors.
In spring this year, everything started from the start when the MGM team started with the restructuring plan, which was finally signed by the creditors after months of debates and internal disputes at the end of October.
If MGM has officially survived the competition in the coming weeks, Moelis and Cooper will receive a bonus of several million dollars for their work.
The share for Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, is $9.5 million.
Cooper, who has been paid $375,000 a month for the management of the company, receives a "success bonus" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM. This year the studio brought out only one film and created an annual plan with seven or eight films to come to the cinemas in early 2012.
They also plan two films after "The Little Hobbit" in co-production with Warner Bros.
The studio also needs a separate loan between $265 million and $275 million for its financial share in these two films that are to be created under Peter Jackson's leadership.
The investor Carl Icahn, who has funded about 18% of MGM's loan, attempted a merger of the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, whose largest shareholder he is.
However, the last negotiations between the two companies did not produce any results.
Tech Toys keeps your gift budget in balance
This year's favorite among the gifts is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect video console. Both players can travel a considerable hole in your gift budget.
An iPad costs as much as five BMX wheels for $99, while the price for a Kinect game is about 10 classic jumping lines or about 48 doses of Play Doh.
But you can see your gift budget.
Recently, I was looking for three electronic toys under $80 three national toy dealers - a Wal-Mart, a Toys "R" Us and a BJ's Global Club.
I immediately realized that Moore's law had come into force. This year the technology toys are more efficient and cost a little less than last year.
And although fewer new toys appear with their own website, it is one of the most famous of these types, webkinz and Club Penguin, a wider offer.
There are more and more button-operated toys on the market, and many contain rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(If not otherwise specified, all prices of Toys "R" Us.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for children from 3 years old) are plush figures, as big as sea pigs who sing a note when you push on their belly.
Once press corresponds to a note, you can play a song through multiple press.
Several sing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony.
Attention: Once you start with the pressure, you cannot stop.
For a combination of send and dance, the Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price $60, for children from 2) is the best choice.
On the basis of the Elmo Live technology developed last year, the animated doll offers swaps such as 'Simon says', and thanks to its innovative wheel-blocking carnival feet, it dominates the Moon-Walk.
Children who test the device use Mickey as a dance teacher. However, their parents complain about the lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, remember Alphie, one of the first computerized learning toys.
Now he is back there (Hasbro/Playschool, $40, for children from 3), with a whole range of questionnaires with which a ride can become a lesson lesson, with a better know with auto correction function as a teacher.
If you don't want to trust your child's smartphone, there are three independent alternatives here.
MobiGo by VTech ($60 for children from 3 to 8) is the cheapest and most user-friendly solution, equipped with a qwerty keyboard. However, the games included on it are not as educational as those on the Leafster Explorer ($70 for children from 3 to 12), which is equipped with a new, brighter screen according to Leaffrog's first major revision of the Leafster series.
None of the versions are compatible with older cassettes.
iXL by Fisher-Price ($90 for children from 3 to 7) uses a system like iTunes for games and eBooks, and thanks to SD card drive, family photos can also be viewed.
Finally, there is Scrabble Flash ($30 from Hasbro, for children from 8). The five blocks are not larger than a wooden box and have a separate LED screen.
The game is about to combine the blocks to words before the time runs out. It is great for an improvised letter competition.
More and more toys have a kind of online connection.
If you go only after the offer in the toy stores, Webkinz and Club Penguin are the most important.
To give your child an online animal at the Penguin Club, for example, you can buy a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match figure package ($5 for children from 6 to 12) containing a coin with a secret code.
If you enter the code online, your child at the Club Penguin Store will receive sufficient credits for two more parts.
These can be roller shoes or a puffle-stuff.
The latest head cells microbot, Hexbug Nano ($10 for children from 5) is no bigger than the head of your toothbrush.
The cage moves rapidly to 12 vibrating silicone legs in any direction.
It's fun to send him out of a mess by mistake.
And he's holding on to something.
Ours fell from the kitchen table and even spent some time in the mud of our dog.
Police in China is becoming more gentle
As a training officer, Tang Shenbin walked over a city square, checked his nervous subcontractors and gave military authority and dampened voice commands.
He wanted his female members of the Chengguan - China's robust watchmen of the urban order, afraid and respected for their arbitrary actions and their dependence on violence - to impress the audience.
"Stand right there!"
"Look straight!"
"Show them," he whispered to them, "how beautiful girls are!"
Four girls, barely growing up at teen age, stood tight with white gloves and identical olive-green jackets and pants.
Four pairs of black pumps stood in a straight line.
Four neat hats sat perfectly on the hair held with blue-white strands.
"For me, they look like averages," Mr. Tang noted slightly.
"Models are beautiful."
Several governments have already tried to publicize the image of Chinese city inspectors.
In one city, all new applicants must have a university degree.
The Guangdong Province introduced a bright blue uniform instead of the grey greens.
Wuhan replaced violence in Central China by low-strengths: According to reports in 2009 50 officials turned on an improperly set-up vehicle and looked at the operator until he packed it after half an hour and left the place.
Xindu, a city district in Chengdu with 680,000 inhabitants, wants to fundamentally change the image.
Since 2003, 13 women have been strengthened by urban police forces. They have been specially selected because of their appearance, their good figure and their youth.
They're supposed to give the gross police a softer, feminine aspect.
Unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson would not have managed to improve the bad image that the Chinese have of these city commands.
Right, so the critics.
Unlike the police, these officers are allowed to enforce urban laws only by means of fines or other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media show a different picture on a regular basis.
In January 2008, officials in the Province of Hubei staged an audience to death when she filmed with his phone how they shot a protest against a mine.
Last year, a textbook of Beijing officials was stolen and published on the Internet. It describes how criminals can be beaten without bloodshed.
This year a Shanghai watermelon dealer suffers from a handful of brain injuries with five officers.
A violent video game that can be downloaded from the Internet shows officials trained in China in an attack on street dealers.
"Chenguan scares the government," lamented the national newspaper China Daily last year, after further controversy over the tactics.
The paper called for "really thorough purification".
Skeptics find the current approach clearly insufficient.
When the District looked for eight female recruits in October, an editorial in Beijing Evening News asked whether women should have real jobs or only serve as an optical bias.
Probably both.
According to the position announcement, women between the ages of 18 and 22 were searched for with good figure and "harmonic facial features".
You should be above average size - more than 1.5m or 5 feet, 2 1/2 inches.
The employment ratio ends with the 26th year of life.
According to the officials, the activity for women over 25 is too intense.
"The most important thing is her image," said an unnamed district officer at the almost government website Rednet.com.
"If the candidates get the job, it depends first on their external appearance, such as size, weight, face, etc."
Then come temperament and "inside qualities".
"Woman Chengguan are like flower vases," he said, adding, "but they also have other obligations".
Zheng Lihua, Vice-President of the City Administration of the District, does not wish to comply with this description,
however, it added that in China the size requirements in job advertisements for both sexes are not uncommon.
The same applies to uniform facial features.
Whether to match it with a good look is controversial in China.
But people with disabilities or physical disorders do not need to apply.
"Unfortunately, we cannot use any mud or boulders here," said Mr. Zheng.
"Your image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who patrols the Baoguang square near a monastery, is 22, has apple cups and a well-formed mouth.
She didn't feel so sexy that so much value is put on her appearance.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asks with an ironic look.
Her colleague with the Grübchen, the 21-year-old Xu Yang, commented, "We have the task of representing the image of the city."
According to their statements, they do not regret the short attitude, since they had more ambitious career plans than just checking out traders through the gases to prevent them from doing business.
Every morning, the strips are made up of about twelve street dealers who try to sell as many breads and tofu dishes as possible on foot or on the bike before they are pursued.
"Mr. Wang, please get out of here."
"We've told you so many times!" explains Fr. Xu, a dealer who had fled on foot and who had left his nudal kitchen on a bicycle cart at a time.
According to the officials, the activity is rather monotonous than demanding.
"It's almost the same every day," says Huang Jing, 20, who studies sales in leisure.
"Alle Routine."
One reason is that female officials are not allowed to confiscate the goods of traders, as their male colleagues do.
They can only threaten criminals to report them to their male superiors.
This should protect them from public enemies whose officials are often exposed in China.
This year hundreds of people from Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, randled after the announcement, Chengguan officials had killed a dealer.
More than a dozen police officers and Chenguan officials were injured at night, 14 government vehicles were thrown into fire.
Xindu has been evicted from such violence so far.
But unrest is not to be excluded.
Only two blocks away from the quiet Baongang square, where the women's officers patrolled this morning, more than 50 people gathered at a street corner.
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle which was repaired instead of at a workshop.
The owner shouted Zeter and Mordio.
After a 15-minute delay, the officers continued their way to their vehicles with a cruel face and continued to drive with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator of the male strips, stayed back. He turned his white name badge to remain anonymous.
Like their colleagues, the coordinators - men over 40 - play a purely supportive role.
But they were not trained to present a clean image.
"Sometimes we go verbally."
"Sometimes but also physically," explains Mr. Li Nichtern.
"Most of the time, people start the fight."
The Attorney General will not be charged with Senator Ensign
State prosecutors of the Ministry of Justice have released Senator John Ensign from the charges that, after his case with a former electorate and his attempt to give her husband a lobbying activity, was brought up against him, the senator's lawyers announced on Wednesday.
This decision ends the toughest bill against Senator Ensign, the Republican from Nevada. Until the scandal that provided strike lines across the country and caused a damper for his career, he was considered a potential candidate for the Republican presidency for 2012.
As Senator Ensign's office announced, he was "very pleased" about the verdict after the one-year investigation.
However, the Senate Ethics Committee could still impose a discipline.
According to Ensign's lawyers, they were informed by the Ministry of Justice that investigations against Senator Ensign had been initiated and that no further charges had been brought in this case.
The Ministry of Justice did not wish to comment on the case.
The verdict was a surprise for many ethics lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice. In your opinion there was sufficient evidence that Ensign was wronging the lobbying ban.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents that were first published in the New York Times in October 2009 caused Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his constituents, to help him to take on lucid orders to buy his silence over a business with Hampton's wife Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton worked as a treasurer during a campaign.
Ensign contacted some political friends to provide Hampton with work. According to the documents and interviews, he took over for them after setting up Hampton's lobby work.
Since Hampton had recently been in Ensign's election team, he was not allowed to take up a job for a year for his former employer or the whole Senate.
According to ethical experts, the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the affair, was against the so-called ban on rotational lobbycracies.
According to the published index, "it seems to be a deal and a violation of the rotating states," says Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients who are in the government's vision.
While the Ministry of Justice officially refused to disclose the reasons for the decision in the ensign case, Mr. Brand and other Ethical Walds said that the Ministry appeared very cautious in the admission of political charges following a multitude of cases of high interest by the media, including the decision last year to drop the charges against former Senator Ted Stevens for misconduct on the part of the prosecutor.
Public prosecutors "are obviously scary," said Melanie Sloan, president of the Association "Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington" (an organization whose aim is to combat corruption in the US Parliament and Government), a group of lawyers who have brought various charges against Mr. Ensign.
"This basically means that senior government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, chief defender of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview, he received a phone call from a state attorney on Monday and another day next day when he was informed that the ministry would not raise complaints against his clients.
Mr. Ensign's defenders had cooperated with the state prosecutors to convince them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement on Wednesday, "had acted in accordance with the law".
Mr Coggins refused to explain more precisely the legal arguments he had presented to the public prosecutors.
"I'm not sure how to go into the details of the conversation between the Ministry of Justice and me. Just say so: we believe we have made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Elections Commission decided to put in place the investigations due to a separate complaint by the Ethical Group, after which Mr. Ensign's parents had violated the Hamptons against the Federal Elections Act.
The electoral commission said there was not enough evidence that the money was anything but a gift.
NV Energy, a large company in Nevada that had been supporting the senator for a long time, was one of the companies in which Mr. Hampton found work thanks to the help of Mr. Ensign lobbyists.
An e-mail from December 2008 shows that after Mr. Hampton was a lobbyist, Mr. Ensing's Chief of Staff, John Lopez, had an interview with Mr. Hampton, in which he informed him that he was "attacked" at the Ministry of the Interior.
Mr. Ensign was also with Mr. Hampton and another customer from Nevada, Allegiant Air, who had arranged for lunch and asked the Minister of Transport to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after Mr. Hampton had set up lobby work.
Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents for the first time in the past year and gave up his position in the Senate, where he was in fourth place in the ranking of the Republicans.
After many months of his arrest, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he was seeking a third term in the Senate.
In announcing that Mr. Ensign was no longer the target of police investigations, his press spokesman, Jennifer Cooper, the Senator, said he hoped that the Ethics Commission would follow the example of the Ministry of Justice and set his findings very quickly.
"Señor Ensign is pleased to continue his hard work in the service of the people in Nevada," she said.
Cheshire's call is on Twitter
A half a dozen of them went to the Krawalas in the courtroom.
In a minute, they posted their reports on gruesome testimonies on Twitter.
In the end, according to the defense, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the process of rape and bedding children in a house that went up in flames.
On Thursday, Steven J. Hayes, who was charged with killing three members a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, will find an official end when the ruling on the death sentence that the jury has pronounced falls.
However, Mr Hayes' lawyers have already filed applications before the Court of Justice to state the reasons for an appeal and to employ the courts for years.
One of the most challenging reasons is that through the intensive reporting of the process - including the extensive use of Twitter by average reporters - it has come to a "Circusatmosphere" and to such a wide-spread, immediate flow of upheaval details, so that the jury has been affected in an unacceptable way by public equipment.
This objection could cause the Court of Appeal to question whether the new technologies would need new rules in the courtroom.
"As I have experienced during this process, I believe that it is really a danger when the introduction of new technologies into the courtroom affects the right of each individual to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullman, Chief Defender, Mr. Hayes.
The President, Jon C. Blue, of the Supreme Court of the Chamber, showed last week the applications by decision short and binding when he said that the new media would be "supervised carefully" and that there was no evidence that the jury was driven by passions.
But that was certainly not the last word in this matter.
For decades, it has been found that the report on famous-announced cases has raised doubts about the fairness of a trial.
In his historic decision of 1966, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed Dr. Sam Sheppard, an osteopathian from Cleveland who was supposed to have killed his wife and said in his decision that there was a "carnival atmosphere in the courtroom" because of the new media.
Some believe that the TV series and the movie "On the Flight" are based on this crime.
Some lawyers say that the court's objections, which Mr Hayes considered a half century later, could follow the argument that new rules have become necessary to regulate the communication routes from the courtroom that were still unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a good reason to be concerned about the influence of the new media in processes that are being pursued by a broad public," said John J. Donohue III, Professor at Stanford Law School, who examined the death penalty in Connecticut. According to his report, it is optional.
Professor Donohue said that some appeals courts might be fascinated by the idea that the restriction of an immediate communication from the courtroom could make the proceedings fairer.
The Twitter case is just one of many who present Mr. Hayes' lawyers to discuss years and thus delay a conviction.
For example, the defenders also claimed that Mr. Hayes could have already been prejudged, as Judge Blue had not allowed them to test the reactions of potential jury members by showing them gruesome tattoo photos during the jury selection.
Some of the jury said that photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years old, and their daughters, Hayley, 17 years old, and Michaela, 11 years old, had fulfilled them with abscheu.
Defenders say they would also question the constitutionality of the death penalty constitution, and argue that the judge has falsely exchanged a jury that has been a critic of the state prosecutor and that he would have made unacceptable pressure on the verdict when he had made the unusual decision to release the jury on the weekend.
The jury was not isolated.
However, their arguments about the impact of the detailed reporting on the process may be of the greatest interest.
In a conviction they filed last month, they found that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and that during the election struggle for the Governor's office and the US Senate were discussed by the candidates.
They argued that the new media had constantly re-evaluated the flames of emotion over the case.
"Such a daily andrang of media pipers, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom," the lawyers wrote, "you've never even been to New Haven before and perhaps not even seen from across the country."
Its focus on Twitter reporting is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said that the claim that these direct messages were higher than reports that are being replaced more slowly was a technical enemy view, which undermines the reporting of future processes.
However, some lawyers said that appeals courts would often be confronted with the argument, social and technical changes needed to be adapted by the courts.
Mr. Hayers' lawyer reinforces this claim.
In their opposition, they referred to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966, in which Dr. Sheppard's conviction was lifted on the basis of the report and made it clear that the new media needed new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can courtesy connect the separation?
After a campaign of chimpanzees and negativity this week there is little courtesy in Washington.
Is it an oment of genuine bilateral cooperation or a moment of illusion before you return to the struggle of the parties in the capital?
On Tuesday, the meeting between President Obama and the summit of the Congress did not bring a break in the big issues with which we had to deal during the so-called 'lame duck session' of the session at the end of a period of government in which no decisions were taken.
After all you hear, it was not a polite discussion between two different sides nor a consideration of their shared responsibility, but rather an empty episode of a partial point collection.
The public meeting of the President's Deficit Commission on Wednesday was also civilized, despite the political differences that continue to exist between the members.
It seems clear that a close interaction over a period of months creates mutual respect, which blurs the ideological gap that continues to separate members.
This is hardly enough to say it was a new era of cooperation.
Both sides are now in a test phase - in which one of the other signs of cooperation and compromise is called upon, while one tries to weigh the limits of public opinion and the voter's patience after a new party war.
Therefore, the meeting on Tuesday itself and its assessment by the participants were limited to a minimum of claims or charges.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deep to expect a rapid change in the atmosphere that prevailed over the past two years.
Whether it's taxes, donations, health or expectations, the two sides are miles away.
Finally, the November elections in Washington voted mildly for at least a short time.
"No question, the sound has changed," said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush government who is now working for the "Ethics and Public Policy Center".
"This is inevitable after elections.
Elections create partial passions that die again.
And that's good."
In some matters, especially in those on the agenda of the 'lame duck session', Republicans and Democrats have little choice but to find a solution."
Bush's tax cuts end at the end of the year, and no one supports that.
Both sides want to find a way to get some or even all, whether temporarily or permanently.
It is also a compromise to be expected about the increase in unemployment, although only because the Republicans cannot afford to believe that they believe the favoured tax cuts for the rich, while they refuse to support the unemployed.
After the meeting on Tuesday in the White House, optimism has increased that you can agree on these issues during the "lame duck session" and at the same time ratify the new START contract.
However, William Glaston of the Brooking Institution warns that successful cooperation in urgent issues of the Lame Duck session" does not necessarily have to lead to permanent cooperation of the parties when the new 112nd Congress is convened in January.
Instead, as he says, a phase of non-conformity is more likely, perhaps even impossible.
"After the things that have to be done are done, this short-term psychology will be wrapped in confrontation," he said.
Wehner is also skeptical - and this skepticism is shared by many - leading to genuine cooperation.
"I see a lot of what's going on from today to 2012 as a pre-fighting, or shadow boxing, for the 2012 main event," he said.
The reasons for this have a lot to do with the opening up of the new Republican majority in the White House and with the tea party voters who have been trained.
How concerned the Republican leaders may be that they are too high to poker, they know that they have to try to reduce their government expenditures and to force health reform.
These party lines are already in the first reaction to the recommendations of the Commission on the deficit, which include a tax reform and the levying of certain taxes, the raising of the pensioner and the reduction of government expenditure.
The vice-presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken on one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, according to their own estimates, have so much pressured to put the deficit issue on the public agenda that they can no longer be ignored.
But they need 14 of the 18 votes within the Commission to make their plan for formal recommendation and they fight very hard to get closer to this number.
The greatest resistance is found in the elected representatives of the Board, since in financial matters, at least today, there is little room for play or little sympathy for compromises.
Galston predicts two phases in the fight between the White House and the Republicans at the Congress.
The first fight will take place next year in the form of party clashes if the Republicans of Obama challenge the government budget, taxes and the health system, later followed by a phase of greater bilateral cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
The public opinion.
It has been proved that, despite the partiality of the current election, the majority of Americans still wish that the two parties would work together.
If confrontation leads to a pocket gas, as in 1995, then both parties must pay careful attention to the public response.
Anyone convicted of losing will have to change the course and seek compromise.
This may in fact be an optimistic view.
Partisanity and polarisation are now larger than in the mid-1990s, and they seem to be a larger ideological gap between Obama and Congress Republicans than between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, the activists of both parties in 2010 see as a clear example of a much wider 2012 election.
This is how many Americans welcome the kindness that is shown this week.
But on both sides it will take much more effort to find a common denominator on the issues that continue to separate the two from each other.
Persecured U.S. document portrays Moscow as a port of corruption
The control of the city is in the hands of the "Kleptocracy" and it gives part of the protection and protection money it collects to the Kremlin. Thus, in February the American message in Russia reported in a memo.
Both the police and the State Security Service express high protection fees so that they can keep their expensive standard of living in Moscow, it says.
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses but also from organised criminal gangs.
Every layer of bureaucracy - which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin referred to as "Vertical of Authority" - takes part of the money that the leader moves upwards.
The memo sent under the name of Ambassador John Beyle to Washington was released on Tuesday by WikiLeaks on his homepage.
The memo is based on sources whose names have been edited.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still a Moscow mayor, and it accused him of corruption.
He was fired in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but there is hardly any evidence that it would have been cleared in the meantime.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a well-known construction company, have repeatedly rejected corruption proposals over the years, and he has won numerous insults against such charges.
In September he explained to a Russian television channel when he was asked for a documentation suggesting that he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it's shit, it's dirty."
> An incredibly large number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt.
But it is unusual that, as in the Ambassador's report, individuals are called, and it is unusual that this is done by a diplomat from a foreign country.
"The direct connection of the Moscow government to crime has led some to call it "distorted" and conclude that the government is more like a kleptocrat than a government," says the memo.
"Criminal elements enjoy a "kryshna" (a term from the world of criminals/mafia, which literally means "dash" or protection), which extends to the police, State Security (FSB), the Service Supervisory Authority (MVD) and the State Prosecutor's Office as well as to the entire Moscow government bureaucracy.
Experts have discovered a three-dimensional structure within the criminal world of Moscow.
"Luzhkov stands in the highest position."
"FSB, MVD and militia are on the second stage."
"Lastly, the ordinary criminals and the criminal inspectors follow at the lowest level."
"This is an incompetent system in which criminal groups in some areas close a gap because the city does not offer any help."
The report goes on to say that the FSB funds are disbursed by the largest companies and that the police are arresting small businessmen.
A source, that is, "declared that Moscow's business owners understand that it is best to get protection from the MVD and the FSB (and not from organised crime), as they not only have more weapons, resources and power than criminals, but also because they are protected by law."
"For this reason, protection by criminal gangs is no longer asked as before."
The memo notes that, while collecting the money is comprehensive, protection itself is not very modest; even those who pay are sometimes arrested.
Those who do not pay will find their business closed very quickly - because of some prejudice.
Medvedev has repeatedly talked about fighting corruption, but at the same time noted that he has made little progress.
The memo of the message contains descriptions of men going into the Kremlin with suitcases that were probably full of money.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev must rely on the bureaucrats," said George Satarov, director of Indem, a Moscow expert commission, recently in an interview.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy."
"It is not part of the political class because a political class in Russia no longer exists."
Without politicians, without opposition, without separation of the forces, he says, corruption is inevitable.
Worldwide, Idem estimates, corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
The country ranks in place 154 a more recent investigation into the global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (countries are listed from "minimum corruption" to "most corruption").
The revelation of the memo of the American message, which took place after Moscow late in the evening, will certainly trigger irregularities within the Russian government, although since Luzhkov can be blamed for Moscow's error, it can also be an opportunity for the Kremlin to claim that the problems are solved.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN, Putin claimed that the WikiLeaks documents could be a fake and responded furiously to the revelation that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth is that it is our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we didn't expect this to happen with such arrogance, with such pressure and in such an unethical way, you know."
Khmer Rouge Veterans forced to face the past
In a dimly lit, focused classroom with dirty and leafy walls, the director of the Anlong Veng High School reminds the man who built it of the later Khmer Rouge Guide Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and he took care of his people," said Singh Kor Ma, 42 years old.
Because of its brutality during Khmer Rouge rule known as "the Battler", the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge-Hochburg in northwest Cambodia, where he built hospitals and bridges, which have developed the infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
However, this year, 12 years after the capitulation of Khmer Rouge against the government, long-term supporters are challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local truth and reconciliation forum allowed the victims to face public confrontation with the people who once supported the regime.
In June, the government distributed a school book that told the history of Khmer Rouge for the first time to children of former soldiers.
And in July, for the first time, a UN and Cambodian community tribunal condemned a former member of Khmer Rouge when it sentenced the former head of the notorious Tuol Slang Torturerkammer, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as the duke, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these developments, fear grew among the Khmer Rouge Veterans Alnlong Vengs, making their efforts to reconcile and reintegrate into Cambodian society difficult.
"There is still denial and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything," said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodian Documentation Centre, an independent organization that investigates the regime.
"For her life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"It separates families itself."
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, 1.7 million people were estimated to have been executed or died of disease, rehab or hunger.
When the Vietnamese broke down and the Pol Pot-Ied government collapsed in 1979, the remnants of the regime and its military fled to the border of Cambodia to Thailand.
They spread here until December 1998, when the last movement capitulated, unrest.
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla war from their base in the west of the mountains and jungle of Cambodia, Ta Mok brought the next generation to Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, when a peace agreement that was signed by the UN in 1993 led to the country's first democratic elections, large groups of Khmer Rouge began fighting over to the government, leading to the chapters of Ieng Sary 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan 1998.
Pol Pot died in 1998, and Ta Mok, who did not give up, was arrested by government forces at the Dangreek Mountains in 1999.
He died in 2006 in Phnom Penh prison, where he waited for his trial.
When their graces no longer protected them, most former Khmer Rouge fighters fled to the devastating poverty of the rural Cambodians and many kept the movement in nostalgic memory.
Even though few elite officers of Khmer Rouge kept their local government posts because they laid down their weapons, the simple soldiers remained poor, uneducated farmers.
"These people have benefited very little from the capitulation," said Sok Lang from the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which holds public forums throughout Cambodia, also in Anlong Veng.
"They are anchored in the utopian agriculturalology of the regime."
"They grew up without any professional knowledge."
Sor Lim, 55 years old who had joined the Rhmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle for Anlang Veng before he resigned in 1998 to lead a life as a poor traveller.
"The life under Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Ta Mok has given everyone something to eat."
"But now life is hard because we have to take care of ourselves."
The current Khmer Rouge Tribunal has also called for concern here.
At the beginning of next year, the court will try to bring Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife and Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge Minister, before the court.
The task of the Court is to condemn the old leaders and those who are primarily responsible for the atrocities, but it is not said whether it will be prosecuted beyond these four cases.
This has contributed little to softening the fears in Anlong Veng.
Current media speculations have focused on Im Chaem, 64 years old, who was the district chief of Manteay Meanchey during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she had told representatives of the Cambodian Documentation Centre that she had led the construction of the Trapeang Thma Damms, a project that probably killed thousands of forced workers.
On a hot evening, the Chaem returned from work on the fields to her wooden house on a dirty street outside Anlong Veng.
When the sun had long shadows on the dried grass cast it off In the chaem it refused to discuss its past at Khmer Rouge.
If the court were to forward them, she would refuse to go, she said.
"Kambodsha lives in peace and stability," she said.
"If there were no more persecution, war would be here."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who fled the Khmer Rouge in 1878, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would become uncertain, the court would accuse more suspects, although experts and historians discuss this.
"Kambodsha must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But the confrontation with the past is what Cambodia must do in order to move forward, Chhang Yek said from the Documentation Centre.
"Accompaniment with Khmer times means summing up the broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to put together these broken parts, so that they can understand everything."
The centre created the first school book approved by the government about Khmer Rouge, the 75-page "History of Democratic Cambodia".
It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng as an annex to the history book for the Ministry of Education's High School, which contains fewer than four pages over Khmer Rouge.
As often in Cambodia, young people in Anlong Veng know little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's connections to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a student at the Anlong Veng High School, said that the new school book helps students understand an important part of their story.
But his parents reacted skeptically when he brought the book home to read it.
"My family hates many parts of the book and the court," he said.
"They are suspicious because they are not sure how many people are condemned by the court."
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complicated, Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, the school book and the court are reaching for influence," he said.
The Khmer Rouge still has a powerful attraction here.
Up in the Dangreek mountains, one of the steeper and dirty roads leads to a corner of black rust, covered with a rusty roof.
Paul Pot's body was burned here after his death in 1998 on a tire station.
Noum Sothea, 31 years old, a telephone seller on the street, said she didn't know much about the man who was burned here.
"But he has a strong spirit and many people here go to pray to him," she said.
It was Noum Sothea's birthday and later on the day she wanted to go to Pol Pots' last resting place, where she would be carrying a bush of mature bananas - in the hope that he would bring her luck.
Belarus agrees not to collect any further weapons uranium
In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign for global nuclear material security, the government of Belarus announced on Wednesday that it would no longer collect highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was announced in a joint statement following a meeting of Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the Security Summit.
The U.S. government had tried for years to convince Belarus to stop collecting highly enriched uranium and seemed to have reached a hardy last spring.
However, U.S. government officials told Washington Post that in the last two months, two secret agreements had been concluded with Belarus to remove 187 pounds of armed uranium from a Belarusian research facility.
This prepared the stage for the agreement on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material - according to an official employee who remains anonymous due to the sensitivity of the topic, approximately 500 pounds.
The agreement appears to be one of the most important results of Obama 'The Nuclear Summit of 47 Nations' since April, which had excluded Belarus.
And obviously it was good enough to secure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really excited by the fact that they wanted a seat at the Nuclear Safety Summit (from 2012)."
"This proves to me that it works," said Ken Luongo, President of the Global Security Partnership, a group to promote nuclear security.
Clinton called the agreement "a very important, important step" by Belarus.
Obama made a promise in April 2009 in Prague to secure everything in advance of nuclear material within four years.
Since then, the US government has helped six countries to release their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did it under George W. Bush's government.
At the time of Obama's nuclear security summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko stated that the nation will never give up its uranium.
"How to keep highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos, which is fundamentally armed, and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said at the time.
"That's our raw material... we won't make dirty bombs and we won't sell it to anyone."
"We only use it for research purposes, that's all."
However, Belarus approached the United States a few months ago when it showed interest in the meeting of an agreement.
The first call to remove the uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated, because the material was easily irradiated, officials say.
It was moved into a special suit, which is more than 1,300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal, says official.
The second visit was decided on Monday and was carried out according to the officers by plane.
The U.S. government pays $14 million for these efforts, with most of the money flowing into Belarusian research with weakly enriched uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
"This was very carefully coordinated and agreed to build trust," said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Ministry of Energy, who is working on global risk reduction to the agreement that Clinton has signed.
The James Martin Center for Non-Wide Studies estimates that Belarus had at least 88 pounds of armed uranium this year as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus intends to resolve its stockpiles under the joint agreement by 2012.
The relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, primarily because of Lukashenko’s gross violation of human rights.
But the statement from Wednesday suggests a possible approach.
"The progress of these global security issues is welcome, the United States of America and Belarus announces that an increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue in improving bilateral relations and is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," she explains.
No objection from the Spanish government against CIA flights
The Spanish government had no objection to the CIA flights with Taliban and Al-Qaida prisoners across Spanish territory to Guantanamo, as shown by a telegram by the U.S.A. messenger in Madrid.
This reflects the documents covered by Wikileaks and forwarded to the daily newspaper "El País" (by cable). It is added that former Deputy Prime Minister María Teresa Fernández de la Vega called for the Spanish government to be informed "to demonstrate that foreign aircraft flying over Spain are being adequately monitored."
In June 2006, following the publication of a report by the Council of Europe, in which the aid for human rights practices in a thousand countries, including Spain, was accused, the former North American Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega discussed.
The Deputy Prime Minister said that the Council's report "has met Zapatero on the sidelines" and confirmed that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega stressed, Spain has no objection to the secret service flights over Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed," to avoid "unprecedented surprise," Aguirre reports per cable.
Also, former Foreign Minister Miguel Ángel Moratinos pointed out to the ambassador that the Spanish government "does not want to give great attention to this matter, although the government has little influence because they are in the hands of judges."
In January 2007, State Attorney Vicente González announced that he would not block the application for the CIA Flights to declassify the documents of the Spanish Secret Service Centre (CNI) and the Minister of Defence.
"These reports do not contain any burdensome or sensitive information," the ambassador explained after a conversation with the prosecutor.
Nevertheless, the US was more concerned about the "evident coordination between the Spanish prosecutor and the German prosecutors" than about the declassified information of the CNI and the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to discreetly deal with governments," Aguirre complained.
At a lunch in March 2007, attended by US ambassadors and Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, the latter commented that "although the Spanish judges are madly concerned about their independence and do what they consider appropriate," he had instructed his employees to "avoid public rhetorical comments to let the tension go."
The Ambassador also expressed concern about the PP's behaviour in this matter.
"Despite her general pro-American attitude, our experience teaches us that the PP will not doubt the fact that the government of Zapatero's actions of the United States, which could have been exposed, tolerated or deliberately ignored as possible human rights violations, will strike capital, even if these revelations could have a negative impact on the U.S. government," he said.
The child killer was on the Internet complaining about the "trouble" of the motherhood.
The young woman spoke of the child when she was already dead and she had a blog: "Terror in a Galician Way"
Monica Juanatey Fernández is on the internet "Muki".
Under this name, which she carries from her childhood, she keeps in touch with a cousin and at least a friend. Both come from Noia, a village in the province of La Coruña, where she was born.
The communications are from 2008.
To understand this, you need to know her life of love, which the daily newspaper ABC reconstructs on the basis of testimony of her family members.
The 30-year-old Galician woman entered into a relationship with Iván Túñez, an industrial woman.
She spent a year.
Soon after she had dissolved her relationship, she was known to be pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was from him, but his ex never let him carry out a DNA analysis.
Soon she was in another relationship.
The chosen man was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighboring community.
She lived with him for a long time.
Caesar lived with them.
When the young woman went to the Balearicians to take care of herself on the labour market, the little girl stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her to Palma for a week.
But from the contents of her news, it can be concluded that their love relationship broke and they separated.
In March 2008 she is alone on Menorca and writes: "Alberto is very peculiar and angry because I have come to work."
"When I told him this, he found it good, but now he of course notices what it means to be alone with the boy all day long and not to be free to do and let go of what he wants."
Later she mentions a message she just received on the phone: "I want you to come back this month or let me get an address that I can send you the boy to."
She complains, "If he doesn't like me leaving the boy with my mother, I'll pick him up when I get back."
In May she said of her return to her village: "This week I will go there, but I will only stay there until 19 because I have to introduce myself to a job on the 20th if I don't want to lose it."
She explains that she takes her first child when everything's okay.
"He will be with whom he must be, that is, with me. Never in my life will I leave him with someone other than my mother," a dubious intention when considering their bad relationship.
In July there is another e-mail.
When she writes this, it is assumed that the boy who came to the island on the 1st of the month and was allegedly murdered on the 10th is dead.
"On the one hand Caesar is satisfied, on the other hand, not."
"On the one hand he's with me and the place he likes a bit, but on the other hand he has to go to school every day."
She's talking about moving to Mallorca.
"There he (the boy) will visit a summer course, so I have less expenses for the girl."
On 17th: Reminders and complaints.
"A giant kiss from César who asks me when you're coming."
"Alberto says he sent me some videos on the e-mail. You see, if he wants, he'll find me, so bad."
On the 30th, "The boy is doing well. He's going to a summer class to learn Catalan."
From Victor, her current partner, there's one: "He's throwing money at me."
On the Internet, in anime and mangablogs, there are messages from her.
She even had her own blog in MySpace, which is now locked up, and in which she called herself "Muki, the prison laser".
"Terrorism in the gallega"
The last man who lived with her, a defeated hunter, explains having a conscience because he feels guilty.
He can't believe everything happened because she didn't tell him she was a single mother.
Monica was transferred yesterday from the Centre for Prisoners to Menorca in Palma's provincial prison.
The Ombudsman, Carlos Maceda, explained that they could not recall the outcome of the case, "and they did not intend to add to the minor damage."
Before, however, she had stood up to drink Caesar in the bathtub and to have his body stolen in a suitcase.
Defence and public prosecutors applied for a psychiatric opinion.
Partyo Popular won 4 seats in Congress and PSC lost 9
With the results of November 28, the PP could play a decisive role in the cities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
According to the significant increase in the vote and in the number of Members in the last regional elections, the PP is already looking forward to the parliamentary elections. Their expectations are more than positive because the number of votes reached by this party in those elections is usually twice as high as those in the Catalan elections.
The Catalan People's Party received 610,473 votes in the 2008 parliamentary elections, while this figure was only 316,222 in the 2006 regional elections.
On the last Sunday, the PPC reached 384.091 votes.
If this upward trend - the result of the transfer of the PSC's voting share and the binding of the PP's election - should continue, the PP analysts predict that the PPC could rise from 8 to 12 congressional members in the parliamentary elections, while the CIU also won four (now 10) and the PSC would lose at least 9 (of 25).
These calculations demonstrate the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the People's Party, the ERC would lose a Member - currently it has three - while ICV would keep its Members or win one.
However, if the calendar of elections is to be maintained, the next date with the municipal elections will be in May 2011. Also, the People's Party (PP) can be the tongue on the scale to prepare an end to the socialist rule, in four provincial cities and with its majority in the Barcelona City Council, one of the city administrations with the largest budget: €661 million for 2011.
Both the nationalists and the People's Party agree that the PSC will lose the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, in which the Socialists cannot reach a majority or return to their traditional allies (ERC and ICV).
After the Republican debacle, it is not easy for this party to lose its representation in the municipality of Barcelona, where it had to achieve 5% of its votes.
On the other hand, the PP recorded an increase in its vote in the four provincial cities and could become the decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
Nationalists are convinced to be able to play the main role in Tarragona’s conversion. There they had ruled before the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros, together with the PP.
An Lérida is located only 500 votes behind the PSC. The mayor, Angel Ros, maintains good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last election they met several times.
Also in other important places, such as Badalona, Casteldefels or Reus, the People's Party was able to register a significant increase.
Currently, the PP is represented in 34 Catalan city administrations and aims to form lists in as many places as possible.
The Catalan cell provided Al Qaida with thousands of travel passports
In addition to the seven prisons in Barcelona, there were three more in Thailand
The seven Pakistani and Nigerian police officers arrested by the Barcelona Police Department formed the DS cells controlled by Thailand, the various Al Qaida groups, including the "Move to Liberation of Tamil Eelam" (LTTE) and "Laschkar e-Thaiba" (Let) - the latter was the author of the assassinations in Bombay, which claimed the 2008 106 dead - with passports.
The Spanish Interior Minister points to these investigations as important, which goes so far as to ensure that the "Operation Kampai" has been "weaked" by the counterfeit Al Qaidas worldwide and "so on their ability to act".
The researchers assume that in the two years in which the cells were active in Catalonia, thousands of passports were sent to Thailand, where they were faked and then sent to the groups from which the criminal galaxy Al Qaida was composed, so that their "combatants" could go beyond the borders of European and other Western countries without penalty.
The discovered cell is not the only one of the dshadian networks active in Europe, which is why other European police units have been involved in the investigations, other than the Thai investigative agencies. It is not to be excluded that similar attacks will occur in the EU field in the coming days, such as those carried out in Barcelona last Tuesday.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Ashhar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested) another execution was carried out in Thailand, where Pakistani Muhammad Atar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt were arrested as well as the Thai Sirikalaya Kijbmurung.
They had been led by Bangkok from the cells in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - a part of it was destroyed in 2009 - in particular stole tourist passports according to the standards of the so-called "International Islamic Front".
This means that the documents on the names of men aged 25 to 45 were issued and had to be valid for several years; they were not allowed to display visa marks.
In the investigation circles it will be stressed that so far no links could be established between the prisoners in Catalonia and the assassination in Bombay, although the author of this assassination, "Laschkar e-Thaiba", was one of the recipient groups of passports stolen in Spain and then faked in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it should be remembered that several thousand dollars had been sent through a money transfer company several days before the assassination of Catalonia, which had been "invested" in the purchase of prepaid cards for mobile phones, which were later used by the members of the "commandos", which provided an end to the lives of 106 people.
The police have seized extensive documentation.
PP requires a representation of the tax agreement from Mass
The President of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, yesterday, took the opportunity to present his terms of office to Arthur Mass personally to support his office as President of the Generality, which is not different from what had already been presented during the election and can be summed up with the priority of economic recovery and the abandonment of regionalist independence supporters, such as a financial compensation agreement that the regionalist leaders would like to propose at the top of their mandate.
The president of the Catalan People's Party turned to Arthur Mass for security, who gave her the 18 MPs she had won last Sunday - a figure that is more than enough to feel unrelenting. Because the candidate of the CiU's bourgeois-regional party is indicated that at least one of the opposition parties is present at the vote at his office.
The future alliances that the regionalists want to join in the upcoming parliamentary elections depend on a possible understanding with the PP. However, the talks that the masses are taking place with the other parties are turning around.
As far as the PPC is concerned, it calls for "all speeches concerning Catalonia's sovereignty and independence" as well as for an agreement on the financial balance between the state and the autonomous region - like in the Basque country - and that the leader of CIU even wants to submit a referendum.
Both political leaders are in common that they want to reduce the regional administration's expanded political apparatus and to abolish inheritance and gift taxes.
The details of the negotiations on the entry of mass are taken up by the PPC Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who announced a severe opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV). Today he will meet with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Citudadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The nursing home confirms that deaths are not due to "missing measures"
The owners of the Old House in Olot do not exclude that their nurse killed over eleven older people
The managers of La Caritat's nursing home in Olot (Gerona) gave a press conference yesterday, in which they explained the damage that Joan Vila Dilmés - the nurse who had killed at least eleven old people he was responsible for during his work - had added to the institution.
The head of the nursing home, Joan Sala, joined his lawyer, Joan Cañada, before the court and announced that "La Caritat wants to accuse the responsible (for the death cases)", but "the law and our obligation of liability force us to accept the process and civil liability".
Not only does the institution have to take a social loss of consideration because it did not detect the manager's criminal acts in time, but it is also now paying a high amount of compensation that is calculated by the legal representatives of the victims' family members.
Joan Vila Dilmé was told that the first crime was going back to August 2009 and that he had since then been killed.
The judge arranged for the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the nursing home - since he suspected that no doctor had examined the deceased personally, but that the formalities were made by telephone due to their age and illness.
The leader of La Caritat derailed this point round and explained that "remaining measures could never have been the reason for the events."
La Caritat's lawyer added that "there was no indication in the dispute of a person other than the accused's conduct."
He was already baptized as "Dad Angel" yesterday 11 murders and explained that the first crime was committed on 29 August 2009 and one and a half months later to have murdered the second old lady.
In this case, he killed insulin with an overdose, unlike the first crime in which he had administered a mixture of various tranquilizers.
The leader of La Caritat explained that the access of staff to the drugs was only difficult to control.
The insulin injections and tranquilizer cocktails were used by the nurse in six of nine crimes committed in order to free the patients from their suffering death.
But the results of the laboratory investigations will show whether Vila was lying and actually chose a less cruel death for his first victim or if he burned it from the inside by presenting them with leechlugues, as he claimed to have done in three women whom he murdered between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat, there is no belief in the words of the nurse, not even in terms of the number of permanent murders that could be much more. This attitude is justified by Vila’s making very different statements before the court and that it makes no sense to suddenly change her ways after eight successful murders.
They say they made themselves available on this basis and to clarify the scope of these events of justice.
European Central Bank threats (ECB)
yesterday's investors reacted sharply to the threat of the ECB President Trichet, who warned that "the markets should not underestimate our response."
The risks of euro periphery countries have increased dramatically and the shares of European banks have increased by more than 5%.
At the same time, we should not underestimate the possibility that the ECB can deceive itself and that the euro has barely given up points that cause concern.
The events of yesterday are typical of an illicit market, which, to the extent that it recovers again, however, due to the closure of shorter and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investor will not lose his fear for a long time.
Today, a month ago, the European Central Bank called on us to withdraw our liquidity arrangements, which the ECB will have to withdraw for the fourth time in two years, and probably several more times in the future.
The Bundesbank called for the termination of the plan for the purchase of sovereign debt, since it was ineffective, and for the abolition of all exceptional liquidity measures.
Following the Irish crisis, we expect the current liquidity measures to extend "at least until March" and the quarterly calls with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity by at least June.
We also expect the programme to continue to buy bonds and to issue a strong signal.
If the created expectations are not met, the excellent reaction of the markets will be thrown back from yesterday and if it is persistently insisted that we take back our liquidity measures, only God can help us!
As at the ECB meeting in May, in which the Bank confirmed that the purchase of sovereign debt would not be taken into account and that the markets would collapse, this story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and patient.
In May she showed the teeth and on Wednesday she said that she had already bought a lot, causing a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday the auction of annual state titles in Portugal was relatively weak.
The government's assets accounted for only 500 million to 5.28%, compared with 750 million to 4.81% in the previous auction.
Nevertheless, the interest rates in Portugal fell by 30 basis points throughout the curve and thus reflected a change in market perception according to the words of Trichets.
In Ireland the figures of Allied and Bank of Ireland’s debt log were published.
The sum is estimated to be around 10 000 million in the short term and possible additional 15 000. There is time to buy private capital or these banks are made public.
Although Ireland has lost its credibility completely after it did not recognize the problem with the stress tests in July, the figures in the rescue plan are acceptable and help to reduce uncertainty.
However, the government must receive parliamentary consent to its new budget on Tuesday, and since it still does not have sufficient support, Ireland is still a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel made her speech on the summit of the Heads of State and Government on 14 December. There is political unity asked to show that we are playing the same score together.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries the ninth symphony of Beethoven.
The Spanish President presented yesterday the plan of action to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Remuneration reform, transparency in autonomous regions such as financial institutions, government deficit reduction, liberalisation, privatisation and employment measures.
The double effect of Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish stock exchange has added 4.5 percent, doubles as much as the rest of the European stock exchange.
Compared to February, the reaction of the government and the Spanish central bank was rapid and convincing, and we benefit from the surprise effect.
Today there is a substantial auction of a three-year state loan that will benefit from the Trichet effect. That is why we are asking for a strong demand that will eliminate all doubts about our ability to repay.
For Spain, the application for an aid plan would be self-suffering.
We would get liquidity that we do not need. The treasury has 40 billion euros available, three times as much as in March. Interest rates are too expensive and access to the markets would be closed without time.
Nevertheless, our strategy should be in line with the motto of Caesar's wife: "Now not only the Being but also the Shine."
It's all we can do!
At the request of his children, the Chairman of the Executive Board of Eulen denies the meeting of Vega Sicilia
The storm in the open conflict of the family Álvarez, the owner of the companies Eulen and El Enebro, does not run off.
David Álvarez, founder of the company group, will challenge the meeting of El Enebro, which will take place at the request of five of his seven children on the 16th, as he considers them "absolutely void". His children will try to obtain a majority to control the management bodies of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, the owner of the winery.
David Álvarez and his children Jesús David and María José are preparing the legal measures for a new chapter of justice in their fight to control a part of the group.
The founder of the largest holding for corporate services does not appear to be willing to give in his dispute to control the organs of El Enebro.
He was expelled from the Board of Directors by five of his seven children, who were appointed members of the Board of Directors at the shareholders' meeting on 18 January of this year, which has already been registered in the Trade Register.
El Enebro's meeting, convened by the Judge of the Madrid Commercial Court No. 2 for the 16th, triggered a new thunderstorm in the Alvarez family.
The Judge's call for the assembly is the only legal way to ensure the convening of the Society's meeting.
The final strategy of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta y Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz will be designed by David Álvarez as a "desperate means of the applicants - his five children - to be recognized by legal peaks, fraudulent machinations and abuse of the Assembly on 18 January", as official speakers explain.
This argument is the basis for the claim of the assembly in succession to declare it "absolutely void".
The same protagonists, who were hiding in discreet silence, had already tried unsuccessfully in June to call a meeting on the right path.
At El Enebro - property company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, in addition to other property values - David Álvarez' seven children control 100 percent of the capital.
On the other hand, according to family protocols, the founder of the service group demands the right to use more than 51% of the capital.
This is the actual background of the case which the judge has decided in his hearing on the proceedings for which no date has yet been set.
Red Bull wins in the F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
The cars are improved with real-time software.
Since Red Bull entered the world of Formula 1, its history has been characterized in this read universe by the speed of surprises and successes.
At first, no one paid any attention to the novelty and, despite his steeply rising turn of value during the last season, all of them were at the end of the quest for the victory of the Ferrari by Fernando Alonso in November.
Without wishing to reduce the abilities of the German pilot and world champion Sebastian Vettel or the power of Renault's engine, the "steam weapon" that the Multi Siemens Red Bull put into the hands and thus created a winning team became the legend.
In fact, this is a powerful software for the simulation of processes that the German company launched in 2007 for purposes that are not related to authors.
This computer software called PLM was used for the development of assembly chains in factories around the world, energy works and high-precision instruments.
A reliable reproduction or simulation of a product or process is intended before this is actually built to avoid errors and excessive costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft and Nissan's most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, Head of the Siemens Industrial Division, explains that using this software in Formula 1 - Factory Red Bull "in a few hours, almost in real time" can design and perform the changes and improvements that are detected on the races and during the tests.
Russwurm argues that in 1992, on average, ten technicians worked in the racing stations, which could introduce at least three or four improvements in a season.
In the Red Bulls team today, 180 highly qualified young people are employed. With powerful EDV systems they perform analyses and all possible changes to the racing cars.
The Siemens Manager explained that the PLM software is able to analyze and improve all components of the Red Bull racing car except the engine for which Renault is responsible.
The materials, the fuel, the aerodynamics and the safety elements are changed.
The changes can be transmitted to reality by progressive production systems and high-tech autoclaves within less than 24 hours from the virtual reality of the simulator.
The only limit set by this crazy technical perfectionism is the $40 million that a Formula 1 team can spend for its competitions in a season.
Red Bull has built its high-tech factory for the development and manufacture of its racing cars in a place 50 kilometers away from London.
These are two buildings in which visits - especially by journalists - are severely limited.
Everything that's going on there is Top Secret.
The team includes 580 people, including the two pilots, the world's champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bulls true Formula 1 - hero is undoubtedly the latest world champion Sebastian Vetell.
Behind the enormous technological resources that the energy-drink manufacturer puts in the service of his participation on the race lines, there are other protagonists, whose support is invaluable and their popularity is zero.
The head of technology, Steve Nevey, stressed that five years ago, it was still possible to say that F&E's progress in the field of racing cars was 50 percent successful and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today, the share values have changed. Technology accounts for 85 percent of the success, while the pilot's contribution is estimated to 15 percent.
Nevey admits that Vettel and Webber can never be replaced by EDV because they are "unpredictable gladiators".
HP will open twenty-one stores with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) spent his first exclusive purchase in Barcelona yesterday in collaboration with his partner Ront Reyes.
It is the first sales network consisting of twenty shops with 80 to 100 square meters each, which the multi intends to open in Spain over the next two years.
The company agrees with the existing 16 sales areas in the multi-market business, such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The vice-president of HP España, Helena Herrero, called as an example the refurbished store at the Gran Vía in Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, who has been working with HP for thirty years.
The North American Group intends to set up 200 sales outlets in Europe by 2010, 20 of them in Spain.
The first were dedicated last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia). Barcelona is the third business.
Herrera did not want to betray the upcoming new openings, but did not conclude that Madrid could be the next target.
The Vice-President, who is also Head of HP Personal Systems, assured that the philosophy for opening the store is always the same. It is based on a local vendor with experience and industry knowledge.
The North American company group advises on this and takes over the exclusive cargo equipment (with interactive products for handling).
In addition, HP is responsible for training staff.
Helena Herrero said it was not a franchising system and pointed out that the exclusive sales network would be intended to "optimize the customer service and the advice of small and small companies when buying and then even the packaging."
The loading in Barcelona has a pioneer pilot program that solves the technical problems of HP devices with warranty.
An online service builds a connection to the technical centre in Maastricht, the Netherlands.
"In this way we can solve problems in ten minutes that sometimes take up to two days."
"This system has been developed in particular for small and small firms and private customers, as large companies have already concluded their service contracts for technical customer service," Helena Herroro said yesterday.
Sabadell wants his rivals to 'claw' a million customers in three years
Banco Sabadell's managerial member, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than any other manager. He believes that 2001 will be a tough year for banks, but first of all, a new liquidity crisis and prophecy will bring the end of the debt war.
Nevertheless, it foresees a break in the interest rates that banks are trying to offset by increases in fees and in the price of loans.
Sabadell expects to hold a million private customers in three years - a subject that still exists.
Sabadell has found the way to spend the next three years and thus survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The Bank will introduce a new three-year management plan in 2011.
The aim is not only to survive but also to increase the market share of a million private customers – 700 000 if the customers who lose the bank are withdrawn – which is the great challenge that this bank is facing, because so far it has paid more attention to its business customers than to its private customers.
This year it has received 250 000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share for private customers is 3.5 percent, while business customers account for more than 10 percent.
Another principle of the 2011-2013 business plan is to increase productivity, say austerity, cost reduction. The challenges faced by the bank will be presented together with the annual final report.
Only a few banks dare to set and publish targets in these difficult times, as the financial crisis has led to the collapse of all the plans of the banks worldwide.
Sabadell will complete its Optima Guidance Plan four years ago. It was originally designed for three years, but due to the market situation, it was extended for a financial year.
The customers who leave the savings are the bank's main target.
With a breakfast organised by the APIE, Guardiola stressed, 2011 would be a "hard" year "with a great reach".
The manager assumes that Spain only "slow" comes out of the crisis.
It would also be "very difficult" in two or three years "to create work" - fundamental for the survival of the banks.
Even if he assumes that the war on liabilities - which penalises interest rates - will run out, the risk charges that banks and savings have to pay for their emissions in order to obtain liquidity are already being paid off as a compensation for expeditious payouts at the price of loans.
"The issues of liquidity and financing are structural and they will exert pressure on the credit."
"We haven't turned the branch, but the interest differentials are very high," said Guardiola.
On Thursday, Banesto issued the order on her branch network to restrict the granting of long-term loans and to increase interest differentials (cf. Cinco Días of 22 and 27 November).
The manager was also aware that the banks were currently pursuing the stateggie "to increase the fees", however "within a framework marked by competition".
Sabadell's plan is based on organic growth, even though the group, as always, does not exclude corporate business.
It does not inadvertently ensure that in Spain "larger companies are necessary."
"In the coming year everything will change," he assures.
He stressed that the need for capital is now "great" and does not exclude some Spanish financial institutions from falling into red.
It is the opinion that the Frob can replace the money market with capital stocking.
After ensuring that Sabadell can also survive a temporary closure of the markets, he detracts from the argument of some bankers who are already predicting a new liquidity crisis.
He stressed that nothing could be done, but unlike the events in June, short-term financing could be achieved through repo businesses and thus the crisis could be tackled.
ECSC excludes a second fusion wave of the savings
The Director General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, took the opportunity yesterday to come to a merger wave of the savings banks and stressed the speed with which the industry is being restructured.
When the concentration process of the Spanish savings banks began, several savings banks failed to participate in the first phase. They remained in the second round.
On the other hand, the Director General of the Spanish Savings Association (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured that this second round would not take place.
"I believe that most of the mergers are completed. The inclusion of Cajasol in the Banca Cívica group cannot be seen as a second round, rather than an adjustment."
"The majority is completed. It may be that we have instead of seventeen or fourteen, but all important processes have already been completed. They have been controlled by Banco de España, who has strongly supported all operations."
In a breakfast organised by the Association of Managers and Managers of Aragonia (ADEA), Olavarrieta explained that the concentration process "was completed as soon as possible and that we must be satisfied with the time-frame that was set in earlier times, not now, as part of the business plans with Banco de España", he stressed.
"The transition from 45 savings with an average of 28,000 million assets to 17 with 75 500 million is a historically unparalleled process. The number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62 percent and they are now much larger than what we have accomplished the Basel Agreement," he pointed out.
Olavarrieta explained that "there were a number of unresolved opinions about the slowness of the process, the seriousness and insanity" because "Banco de España reminds us to complete the deadline before the end of the year."
The Director General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, said yesterday that Spain has one of the most rigorous funding systems in Europe and "maybe" in the whole world and added that those who doubt this "without any further knowledge".
The manager noted that in the current economic sector, we need to make "no concern" about the situation of financial institutions and savings that have undergone a "very important" concentration process that will be completed "as quickly as possible".
He also recalled that the Spanish banks had been very good at the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and the red line of Germany
Berlin has decided to maintain the euro, but at the same time has laid down conditions for the entire European Union.
The tensions on the markets have triggered a double response from the government.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has introduced new adaptation measures, beginning with tax reductions for small and small enterprises, the regulation of time-based enterprises or the abolition of the 426 Euro support for unemployed people who do not have an unemployment allowance, up to 49 percent of AENA, the management of Barajas and El Prat airports and 30 percent of the government lottery.
On the other hand, the Deputy Head of Government, Elena Salgado, with the help of former government president Felipe González, supports the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel as responsible who has voiced the current crisis.
How can these procedures be understood?
It should be noted that the Merkel position is not an error in its public work.
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of the redefinition of the euro.
Germany is taking up a fundamental new perspective on the design of our future, which coincides with the maintenance of the traditions of a large part of its partners.
In view of the resistance in Europe, there are three possible ways of speculating from the crisis in Germany.
The first: a strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south had to leave the euro area.
The second: The re-introduction of the German Mark - although it now sounds like science fiction - is supported by a majority of the public opinion, about 50 percent of the population.
The third is a reform of the euro in line with German proposals, i.e.: more macroeconomic control; strict budgetary management; punishment of countries that exceed the requirements; possibly the payment adjustment of some countries and the extension of the costs of potential adaptation measures to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been marked for some time. That is why there are no reasons now.
First, in 2009, both the IMF and the European Commission created incentives for deficits and the German Government moved to a constitutional reform from the arm to prevent this from 2016.
This was the first sign of the interaction between what Germany considered necessary (strict tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second sign put the Central European country in a painful way, as a brand, the decision to save Greece.
At that time it was severely criticized, but the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and the published opinion were absolutely against a salvation of Greece.
Finally, in the last few days of October, Merkel is emerging with a clear position, calling for a reform of the European Union's agreements to enable a country's rescue and at the same time obliges private lenders to bear part of the costs.
This position has been set up as an anti-European because it is moving ahead with the Irish crisis and all of the following.
In the coming months we will be participating in the reform of the European Union, which will allow these measures from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that does not think it over.
It tells everyone that, even if unprecedented measures have to be taken now, the old functioning of the euro will no longer exist from that date.
2013 will be the year of birth of a new currency in which the countries that are in conflict are severely penalised, which can be forced to declare themselves indemnified and in this case the private sector must take over part of the costs.
Germany shows us that we need to take a hard growth rate, with high savings and investment rates, consumption measurement, improved productivity and competitiveness, as well as positive external economic balances.
The other alternatives based on debt and construction with huge holes in the balance of payments, as indicated by Spain in booming times, will simply not be taken.
The offer is clear.
And we would do bad things not to understand.
It is not only about lowering the government deficit to three percent by 2013.
The demands are much harder.
And the worst thing we could do under these conditions is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will go into more quiet.
And that we will take advantage of the opportunities that will be offered to us by spring 2013.
It seems that Zapatero has understood this too, and his dual announcement (the reforms promised after discussion with the major companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures yesterday) indicates that despite the criticism of Merkel, the hypothesis of creating order in his own house has been prepared.
But the red line drawn from Germany is there, and it doesn't look like something would change.
Under the options considered, we should not exclude the euro area that is completely closed with few serious countries.
In this case Germany could still tell us that it warned us.
Sports and regulation
Tricks like those of Alonso and Ramos in the game against the Ajax show the spirit of invention, but not the will to impose a penalty.
The alleged exclusion of two players from Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the game of November 23 against the Ajax in the Champions League led to the release of many inks about whether or not it was an unsportable act and whether or not both players should be punished by UEFA.
As is generally known, the two players lost a few minutes before playing (their team had already made clear) time and played several fools so that the judge would show them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since the Real Madrid would lead its group, the two players will meet the prescribed penalty at the next league game against the Auxerres and thus enter the next stage without any cards.
Finally, the UEFA disciplinary committee punished the coach of the club, José Mourinho, with two games and the players involved with different amounts of money.
The provocation of a yellow card under such or similar circumstances is not new practice, it is more often found in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos - the unwritten but followed by rules of this kind of sport.
Part of the debate on the case presented goes back to the fact that a team of the Royal Madrid Football Club (who presented himself with noble courage and honor and had punished his players for similar events on other occasions) played the leading role in this process, and to the dramaticization by Maurinho, who added more to his long history than theatrical and provocative technicians.
In any event, the debate is about whether this behaviour, which is not expressly prohibited by the Statutes, is contrary to the principles of sport, that is to say whether these actions are a rule of law.
In this case, the damage caused by the sport spirit should be investigated.
The sports spirit defends the physical insecurity of opponents, an aspect that was not threatened by these actions, because it was not an aggressive game.
Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid the opposing players taking unfair advantage of the team. This too did not happen.
The paradox of the action of the players of Real Madrid is that they do not correspond to what we normally understand under error or rule, because the circumvention of the rule was not done secretly to avoid a penalty, but should be as persistent as possible in order to be punished by the judge.
The players waited and accepted the penalty joyfully.
Another question is what kind of advantage did the abusers draw from the intentional fools.
Here it should be stressed that the rival was neither put in a more unfavorable position nor were the benefits of the game played, because the obvious result of this action was that the own team had to continue playing with fewer players.
It is also not a useful strategy for the next game, because the club then does not have this player.
The advantage is obviously that the players start the next game phase of the Champions League without any cards that could threaten their participation in a future game.
But this is a long-term, to a certain degree uncertain advantage, as the team could sometimes even separate. In addition, the players get a penalty in this way and go over in the second card cycle in which they separate with a card with a card less than in the first cycle.
It is not clear whether this is really an advantage.
Finally, such practices are not against the spirit of sport, which also includes strategic decisions to make the most of the benefits of the rules.
In this case, the players did not want to impose sanctions (that would actually be a clear case of circumvention), they wanted to choose when they were subject to this.
They made a strategic decision without avoiding a penalty or fleeing from it.
Although the boundary between the gift of invention and the environment has been obscured, I believe that this is a clear case of the gift of invention.
I have the impression that the controversy was caused by two factors: because it was about two self-conclusions and because of the nature of the provocative rule transfer.
The damage added to the principles of sport by these actions is less ethical than rather aesthetic.
Offering for customer capture for group Christmas dinners in Barcelona
This year the dictatorship of the calendar will drop a set of reservations on December 16th and 17th.
The holidays paid by employees themselves are expanding. They do not want to spend more than 20 to 30 euros.
Like the Turrón and the Christmas Lottery, there are also group dinners in the pre-night period that are leading to Barcelona's hospitality and leisure activities of oxygen. But as a result of the economic crisis, they release a price offensive to capture also the customer segment that represents the mass: almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros for lunch or dinner, the companies and associations in question confirm.
To make accounting even more complicated, the calendar (silvester falls on a Friday) has let all orders fall into the week of December 13th, with the result of a maze of reservations from dinners at two peak days (the 16th and 17th days) and almost no orders in the week before.
Since 2008, when the bad times began, many companies have set up group dinners for budgetary reasons.
In order not to have to give up this tradition, many workers pay these from their own pocket.
As always, the economy requires the lowest prices, confirmed by the chairman of the Barcelona Hospital Committee, Gaietà Farrás.
The representative of the Association of roofs is not afraid to predict what the holiday will look like this month.
"People think it's over a dozen times before they book."
"They want to go out, but they pay close attention to the prices," he says.
The business will go well with those who offer "quality at good prices with good service", he adds, and reminds us that customers are saving in times of crisis, so prices are asked at 25 euros the most.
In a survey in various central restaurants, it appears that the evening of December 17 will lead the provider to collapse.
The Soteras Group says that requests for this Friday with a view to spending less than 30 euros would be booming. The group has adapted its menus with complete offers between 25 and 35 euros to the economic situation.
In another leading group, Andilana, which maintains 16 guest houses in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), has led the ownership of the calendar to booked reservations, even from the beginning of November.
"We have made it impossible to maintain the previous year's prices with menus for each taste of 19,95 to 30 euros," he explains.
At AN Group, which runs El Mussol, Attic, Quu and a total of 23 locals, you will not lose optimism after the second quarter of the year the revenues have been re-flowered and good, even though the prospects for the Christmas business have been ignored for a few days.
Sources of the company group point out that the 18th day will also be an overactive day with friends who celebrate Christmas.
In the sixth group menu, a Christmas menu was added for 30 euros or more than price. You have the impression that customers are willing to spend 10 percent more than in the previous year and want more details on the contrary, such as Cava.
Even in some companies you see green sprays spraying, so the employees are invited back. This gives the impression that the group substances are back up.
On the side of the Fécasarm Association (with connections such as the Barcelona Association of Cuckoos, Restaurants and Leisures), the Vice-President, Enric Gomà, is confident to see the end of the tunnel and notes that the reservations are quite "living", even though the customers "express a maximum".
However, the fun at the celebration has not returned, no one pays.
Pakistan's nuclear programme is causing great concern in the United States
Islamabad represents nuclear weapons "faster than any other country".
The revelations of Wikileaks confirm relations between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the North American Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. Department of State, revealed by the Wikileaks website, confirms the enormous concerns of the Pakistan nuclear programme Washington.
On the edge of the clear and sensuous details that provide the documents on the content of the talks and the thoughts of accredited North American diplomats in Islamabad, they reveal that cooperation between the two countries in matters of nuclear security is not strengthened but rather "takes" and that the unstable Asian country produces more nuclear weapons "to a faster rhythm than any other country".
In particular, the very nature of the Pakistan nuclear program - that the weapons are not put together, but that their components are stored to make their destruction more difficult when an attack is possible - make Washington sleepless nights.
The following risks are listed by the Ambassador in Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report before the visit of the former National Security Council leader James Jones: "The proximity of some atomic systems to the area under attack by the Taliban, the alleged proliferation of nuclear material and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear material".
The large number of people involved in the nuclear arsenals and missile programmes is seen not only by the United States but also by Russia as an outlaw and as a reason to be cautious.
"Pakistan must set up strictly credible personnel to protect nuclear installations; due to the low level of education and culture, extremist organisations have more opportunities to recruit people who work on nuclear or missile programmes," said expert Yuri Korolev from the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a discussion with his North American colleagues.
The new documentation revealed by Julian Assange's Internet portal is that cooperation between the US and Pakistan is leaving nuclear proliferation and the increased rate in which Pakistan is producing nuclear weapons.
In May, an office of the message that describes communication with Pakistan as "frustrating" states: "There is often no transparency; we do not receive answers on aid offers or they are rejected."
In another communication, Peter Lavoy, an official of the State Secret Service for South Asia, confirms that "in spite of the economic catastrophe of Pakistan nuclear weapons, they produce as quickly as any other country."
Ambassador Patterson asks Washington during a visit by the chief military commander, General Ashfaq Kayani, to "clear the responsible", that "Pakistan Army has its silent support of terrorist groups."
Hunting for Wikileaks Chief
Obama appoints a high responsibility for the fight against terrorism to prevent new revelations.
Interpol gives a red warning about the persecution and discovery of Assange.
Everything associated with Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, is a complicated labyrinth, in which things can only be clarified.
Yesterday, Interpol issued a "red warning" about the "instigation and persecution" of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional system of detention.
Besides, she's not new, she's from November 20th.
It also has nothing to do with the last revelation of more than four million diplomatic documents from the United States, but with the allegations of sexual abuse that the Australian must commit to Sweden.
In addition, the lawyer of the founder of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, "the police knew where and how they could contact Mr. Assange."
Already on 20th, the International Police Office with a seat in Lyon (France) issued the order at Sweden's request, but it was not announced until yesterday after the Swedish authorities obtained the power.
This is how things lie. The 188 Interpol countries are told to identify assangs and find "to hold him and deliver him in advance."
Although Interpol cannot arrange for the arrest of a person affected by a red warning, many Member States consider the red warning as a free letter for arrest - which the national police have to carry out - especially if they have a bilateral delivery agreement, such as the case of Sweden and England, where Assange is likely to remain.
The procedure prompted Assange lawyers who published a letter to the public informing them that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks is ready to answer the Swedish authorities' questions by videoconference.
They also remember that Assange applied for an exit from Sweden and was granted the appropriate authorisation by the state prosecutor, who is referred to as Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, the head of security of Stalin.
"This is like a hunt, not like a legal persecution," is accused in writing.
While the world is looking for him - and his mother from Australia appreciates the innocence of her son - Assange stands in an unknown place, however not silent.
On Monday, he gave the head of Time per Skype magazine from an indefinite place to an interview. During the conversation he requested the resignation of US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be proved that it was responsible for the organisation of North American diplomats to spy out the UN and thus violated international agreements signed by the United States, it had to retreat," he said.
His opinion was condemned yesterday by the press secretary of the White House, Robert Gibbs, who described the application for resignation as "Laughter and absurd".
"I'm not sure why we should value the opinion of a guy with a website," he told the CNN.
Obama himself has commissioned a high responsibility for the fight against terrorism, Russell Travers, with the prevention of new document delays.
The attempt by President Barack Obama to pay less attention to Assange is contrary to the opinions announced by conservative politicians and commentators in these days.
Congressman Peter King, who will chair the National Security Committee of the House from January, has called on the State Department to examine the possibility of putting Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organisations, "to seize their funds and anyone who supports them or contributes to them."
Tom Flanagan, adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, was still on the move, and he had to recall his statement that Assange had to be "killed".
"Obama had to turn him into a target disc and use an unmanned aircraft or something."
Those who did not apologize were Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
"Whoever it was who provided information in the government, he was guilty of treason and everything that was not directed, is one too mild punishment," he told the messenger Fox.
Puigcercós is looking for the Carod nearby peace in the ERC with an eyelid
The Republican leader shall allow the party to vote in secret on its continuing stay in the office.
Huguet proposes a more pluralistic government and the end of the assembly principle.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe to get away for the first ten times of an internal emergency in the ranks of 11 Members after the loss and half of the voters' vote-free ERC.
The chairman is aware that his threat of resignation is not sufficient to the presence of former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira. But he also knows that the influence of this sector is as weak today as its mentor himself and he will not have the same head fractures as other former currents.
Therefore, the leader of Esquerra with an eyelid tries to win the new critics, which would secure his position until the next municipal elections.
For the first time yesterday, it was announced that more than 200 regional council members from ERC could speak secretly about their stay in the office.
With ballots, not with a raised hand.
If the Cardists wanted to pass a list of sentences to the president, they could do so without having to fear reprisals.
In fact, the chief wants to avoid both the impression of division and the impression of subjection among his people.
In several interviews he confirmed that he would feel half of the votes plus an unconfirmed one, and he added without indicating percentage values, a result "in Bulgarian style" would not be good either.
The Carod neighbours ask the President more than just to provide his office to the party. An insufficient gesture since Puigcercós controls the top organ of the congress.
However, since they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will agree with the board a plan of action from now until May.
To this end, they expect to be able to participate in the preparation of the document on strategic humorification, which will be put to the vote on 18th of the Council.
Their intention is to provide Puigcercós. On the contrary, this is to promise to present the convention in autumn 2011, which the party leader already holds as a fact.
The chairman of the ERC is of the opinion that "polyphony" is damaging stability and he strives to enable the organisation to wash their dirty laundry behind closed doors for every time.
In this sense, the article signed by the incumbent councillor Josep Huguet in his blog is symptomatic.
In view of the fact that Puigcercós is an ideologist, the owner of Innovacó considered it a fact that the chairman of the party will be "on exchange against various objectives".
He counted five, two of which are in the front.
First, the "restructuring" of the board so that it represents at least 90 per cent of the members of the party, that is, the inclusion of new faces from Carod's environment.
The second could be the big news.
Huguet suggests that the ERC should finally abandon the principle of assembly as a function.
In this way, he challenged a reform of the statutes, which would allow Congress to be held with elected delegates.
From the end of the complete assembly model - an exception in the Spanish party system - Puigcercós' team, which has already fought at the last two congresses for how they are occupied.
In fact, at the joint meeting in 2008, the meeting was commissioned to lead the party with the review of the principle of assembly at a convention to deal with the reform of the statutes.
This is still the case, since because of the internal anxiety of recent years, the approach to this matter was not advisable.
Now, without the critical sectors on the ground, the time could have come to tackle this issue again and to close forever.
23 Murdered in November, 290 in 2010
According to the MILENIO census, four cases were listed in Mexico in less than 2010.
In November, 23 people were murdered in Mexico, according to MILENIO Mexico's calculations, four were less than in the previous month.

The man had a wound that ravaged his neck from the shooting of a firearm.
In the middle of the month, two men were reported to have been killed and found in the trunk of a vehicle left on the streets of Villas de la Hacienda of the municipality of Tizapán de Zaragoza.
A day later a human head was found in a cardboard box in the settlement Valle de los Reyes in the village of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby settlement, the rest of the body was found in a black plastic bag with a message signed by El Incorrigible.
On 17th, two dead women were found in the settlement of Zoquiapan of the municipality of Ixtapaluca and the next morning they found in Huixquilucan the body of a man buried in a yellow-blue blanket, probably named Mario Ríos, according to the news that his killers left next to him.
In the settlement San Francisco Aquautla of Ixtapapaluca was found the lifeless body of a woman with guns in her neck.
On the woman's skin tattoos were discovered by Santa Muerte and chains with appropriate pictures.
In the last half of the month, the body of a man with at least three shots and a message signed by a criminal group was found in the municipality of Zinacanantepec next to a vehicle.
Two days later, the bodies of two men whose heads were covered with adhesive tape were discovered and a message was found in the municipality of Puente de Piedra in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
Against the body was probably a message signed by a criminal organization saying, "This happens to those who do not participate."
In Ecatepec, two bodies attached to hands and feet were found with torture marks inside a taxi station behind the center of San Agustín settlement.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were discovered in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcóyotl.
The first one was found in the settlement of Cuchilla Ancón and cut into black plastic tools, and there was a message. The second one was tortured and found in the streets of the settlement Juárez in a plastic bag.
Next to him, the police found a papa with a message.
China maintains its targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
The representative of China stated on COP16 that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce carbon footprints and would maintain its bid to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020.
China maintains its bid to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 per cent by 2020, according to Su Wei, the representative of this country on COP16.
In his first public appearance at the 16th World Climate Summit of the United Nations (COP16), Su Wei ensured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce carbon footprints and to transform its industries.
He explained that in the last four years, his country has invested $245 million to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
On the other hand, he explained that China would not change its objectives but would work with the international community on this matter.
He explained that the Chinese strategy on climate change was divided into four aspects: dialogue, capacity-building, institution-building and support for pilot programmes.
In all aspects, progress has been made, including the adoption of a new energy law last year, which includes the targets for greenhouse gas emissions reduction.
On the other hand, he pointed out that in China, the authorities of the Federal States had worked with those of the Central State and the municipalities to achieve the energy saving targets, an effective use of energy and the reduction of emissions.
In addition, he concluded that some multi-year plans have already been launched or completed, both those financed by the Chinese government and those that received money from other countries.
For example, he referred to the programme for the effective use of energy introduced in the last five years and received investments from the United Nations (UNO), the government and private hands.
A project is also under way at provincial level for climate change, another for the exchange of traditional light bulbs through energy savings and another for mitigation and adaptation, he explained.
Martin Krol, a scientific adviser on climate change in this country, confirmed that China's efforts would be much larger than usual.
He pointed out that the per capita emissions of greenhouse gases in China amount to six tonnes per person, while in the United States it is 100 tonnes. China is responsible for a nine percent total contribution to environmental pollution.
It also makes unprecedented progress in the field of energy use. Energy efficiency has been increased by 20 percent over the last five years and is expected to be further achieved by 2020, he said.
Legal Exclusion of Espinos: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN explained that the former PAN president had the right to turn to the National Board of Regulators and to demand what was right for him.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the exclusion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was right and that the former PAN's chairman had the right to turn to the National Board of Regulators and to demand what was rightful.
In an interview that took place prior to the complaint by Gabino Cué Monteagudos as the governor of the state, he explained that Espino's exclusion was a decision taken at local level.
"This is an independent decision of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure in Sonora."
"Mr Espino has the right, in his case, to refer the complaint to the Commission de Orden del Rasad Nacional for a decision by a competent authority," he added.
On the other hand, he explained that it was not time to think about 2012 and that an alliance for presidential candidates had never sat on the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that Action National was strengthened by the internal vote on 4 and 5 December, in which his successor was elected.
"That (an alliance in 2012) is a topic that has never been on the negotiating table, at least not until now. It was a proposal for the municipal election, it was successful and fulfilled its purpose," he said.
The Panish leader explained that the PAN is looking back at 71 years of dialogue, so "we are not afraid of internal competition; on the contrary "we enjoy it and it strengthens us," he commented.
He said that the Council would no doubt choose the president or the best president who would need the Action National for the next three years, so he would hand over the staff "to those who would be appointed by the Council."
"I'm completely unconcerned and open. I'd be proud to hand over the office of the chairman to each of the five."
He predicted that the party's upsurge in the last elections of 4 July would be reflected in the next elections, although "it is not time to think about 2012."
"Now it is up to Governor Gabino Cué to support his mission."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments that emerged from alliances between Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa would wear the flags and be observed throughout the country. Therefore, "many hopes and longings will be put in them and I am sure that Gabino is above the requirements."
When he was questioned about the criticism of the PRI by President Felipe Calderón because of his record course within his four-year government, César Nava called on the followers of the PRI to reflect on the six-year period of former President Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderón, they should start defending them, they should finally come out of the closet," he confirmed.
He is of the opinion that the owner of the federal government expresses what he can do in his speech in the Auditorio Nacional, because in this country there is no prohibition of speech and even less censorship.
Obama uses Twitter for the law for the benefit of undocumented students
"If you are for the adoption of the Dream Act, then call your senators and insist on the adoption of this Act," the President of the United States tweeted in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today supported the national mobilization to support the Dream Act Act on Legalizing Undocumented Students with a message on his personal blog on social Twitter.
"If you are for the adoption of the Dream Act, then call your senators and insist on the adoption of this Act," Obama tweeted.
His brief statement contains a cyber link to a broader document that calls on the public to contact with its senators, as the vote of the law immediately preceded.
"With your voice that we are waiting for, the time has come to listen to you," he emphasizes.
The message was spread after the 42 republican senators threatened to block all votes for each law, except for the extension of the tax reductions from the times of Bush and the financing of the government.
Such a blockage, which was announced by a letter signed by the 42 republican senators, could affect the vote of the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START agreement with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Regarding the blockade of the Republicans of the Dream Act and other projects, President-in-Office Robert Gibbs said he trusted that once the tax issue has been resolved, a timetable could be established for the other projects.
"I think we still have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that the tax case must have been settled before the end of the year..."
"I think we can make an agreement about it at any time and then plan the outcome of the rest," he said.
The president of the democratic majority in the Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that "he would apply for the vote at the end of the debate", so that the Dream Act would be more likely to bring the initiative to legalise undocumented students from the coming Thursday in the Senate, although the next week would be more likely.
The version of the Dream Act or the American Dream Law would legalise about 800,000 young people who emigrated to the United States when they were not yet sixteen years old, while they had lived in that country for the last five years and were registered with a higher education institution or with the army.
But the prosecutors of the law need sixty votes in favour of the initiative, which is why they are referring to the votes of a Republican full of hands. At the moment, the organisations of the sponsors of this project are organizing an intense influence on the adoption of the law.
The Democrats, the majority of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against and only a Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, announced his support for the law.
Therefore, the advocates of the Dream Act must have several Republicans on their side if other Democrats should decide to return to the initiative.
Most of the Republicans recruited include the Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as Senator George Lemieux of Florida, who took over the mandate of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who in the past supported the Dream Act are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson from Texas, but they explained that they would no longer support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who had spoken for the law, John McCain, has not yet determined his position.
Although the House of Representatives has another version, analysts agree that the Dream Act in the Senate is facing the greatest obstacles.
Put your fingers in the wound with literature
The second round of 'The desire to speak' was a walk where the participants made themselves strong for the story
"I understand that with the sex in the language, but... the finger in the wound? What is expected of me?" asked writer Luisa Valenzuela, who should open the second round of 'Los placeres de la linggua', a cycle that celebrated the Spanish-language literature and used the title of her question on this occasion (on another occasion the round was devoted to the sex in the language).
The finger in the wound... "brings us in trouble", the Argentine writer jumped against the audience, which consisted mainly of young people who gathered at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara (FIL) to attend this round table moderated by Marisol Shultz, attended the Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio and then marked the secret as a great story. Luisa tells in the first person and is the protagonist who is on the lookout for what is a "wound" and goes from doctor to doctor, from which she does not receive an answer, but guidance for the guides of her story.
The infectionologist leaves her convinced: "Physical patience is not my strength, perhaps it is my wound."
Finally, after a frustrating approach to the traumatologists who stole the breath in the middle of the walk, and who explained that wound is not a scientific concept, the psychoanalyst reveals the secret: "the wound is really open, the symbolic is the scar."
The main figure of the story is light and concludes that it "only experienced from the wound that it really is open and does not exist". But she is convinced that the desire in the language and their fall mixes.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a fascinating story that he called 'the praise of invention' and in which the finger in the wound is not mentioned, but is discovered.
With images of magical realism, he tells of a famous magician who brought back the clouds, traveled men, or restored the virtue lost by a girl. The story made a turn and reported of America, the great novel that it did not miss at the beginning of his own chronists, and he quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticized the abundance of the stories told by the Erobes.
"Cervantes, who invited all of us (the writers), laughed at the pre-conceived witnesses who appeared in the true stories, but otherwise the story of America would never have been told - with imagination that even felt ashamed."
However, he argues that "it is the crazy and lying who best imagine the things", and there are reality and lies that approach each other, where one no longer knows which side the story belongs, where fictional literature reaches the summit.
He actually calls this the 'Tradition Cervantes'.
"We have inherited from him what is told."
When Mayra Montero was on the line, the writer commented and praised the variety of interpretations to which the Phil had contributed to the round table 'Der Finger in the Wound'.
The Cuban and Puerto Rican women dedicated their contribution to the great wounds of the social violence that their country - like the whole of Latin America - has suffered as a result of the fights against drug trafficking.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a silent, unintended commitment," she explained, after stressing that literature is communication and commitment that builds between the author and the readers as with a "chemical reaction".
On the evening, the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose contribution also highlighted "this finger of the dedicated writer in the wounds of the writer", decided.
He noted that in a fast-lived world also the intellectual habits and control of consciousness run out on dogmatism, and is forgotten, "that behind every confirmation there is a little no and behind every denial a little yes."
"To be in the possession of our thoughts and reality, we must nuance: And nuances often meant to put the finger into the wound and to bother those who feel much better when they think in the form of cartoons, in black and white, in pre-made ideas without nuances, and also to bother the powers who prefer to divide the world into black and white, he noticed and called upon to rediscover one of the meanings of the letter.
Romano fights for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in final games, has experienced ups and abs in his career, but three times he played decisive games.
In the duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey at the end of the game, two different styles are compared with their respective trainers, and their encounter marked by opposites is reflected in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in final games, he has experienced ups and abs in his career, but three times he has had crucial games, and so far he has kept well, why this opportunity is very important to him.
The Argentine player played with the medal for the second champion, he is a step back behind the winners and surprisingly he has played consecutive finals with the same team.
The Santist strategy reached the first final game as a coach at the 'Torneo Apertura 2002', when del Morelia had the toe in hand, with which he suffered a major defeat against Toluca with 4-2; later, at which 'Clausura 2003' he reached the crucial duel, which he also lost with 3-1 against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna at the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010', where they played against Los Diablos, Rubén had to re-entered a retreat, as the game with 2-2 against Los Choriceros went undecided after 210 minutes of play, but at the 11 meter he came forward with 3-1 and got two possibilities to insert his title, but finally three of his players missed the eleven steps and the game turned into a 4-3.
Rubén had already lost two games with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his great rival. Therefore he does not want to be persecuted once again by the accident and free himself from the evil wizard to be able to celebrate a title for the first time, although he confirms that the most important thing for him is the game itself.
"I want to be a champion, I don't want to break statistics, which is for a club, for my affection that I give myself, and therefore the title will come to me, but what happened before is the most important thing," commented the taxman when asked about the lost games.
The last final game is still strong in his memory, he assures us that much has been learned from it: "The only lesson we can learn from it is that until the judge puts an end to it, we cannot celebrate, we are prepared on the line, the players too, because the last time we were prepared to separate, and I think that this is a lesson until the game is over, there is no reason to celebrate."
To know that this series could be decided by Elfmeter shooting, does not bother him, because he trusts his players: "You never want to arrive at Elfmeter shooting, you want to close in the regular playing time, but sometimes there is no alternative and you have to be prepared for it, in the previous tour we were prepared, but unfortunately prepared for us the fate a bad game, sometimes due to nervousness or the hard effort to keep the title in the hands that left us something for this final game, and we hope that this time will not come."
It is in Romanso power not only to be the second champion and to spend the glory that the title brings with them for the first time.
The USA changes the rules for obtaining a visa
Persons must submit their visa applications to the consulate prior to their consultation with the visa authorities; costs will be reduced.
As of 10 January 2011, the procedures for applying for a visa are changed in the United States message and in the consulates.
In the new procedure, most applicants must present themselves before their consultation in the Consulate at the Visa Application Services Offices (ASC), the starting letters in English.
The staff of the ASC shall record the applicant's biometric data verified by the consulate before the interview.
The new procedure has certain advantages for the graduates, including:
The total costs for the settlement of the visa are reduced, as it is no longer necessary to pay separately the deadline for the processing of the visa application and the transport service with which the document is issued.
The applicant shall only make a single payment covering the three services.
The current price remains unchanged: the equivalent of 140 dollars for a tourist visa, 150 dollars for Visa with application (including Visa for time workers) and 390 dollars for hands and investors.
Those who only want to extend their visa must not have a conversation in the consulate, they must only present themselves to the next ASC, where they present their documents and fingerprints.
As biometric data are collected in the ASC, applicants who need a second deadline for the conversation in the consulate remain there less time than before.
Those who apply for the visa in the consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo no longer have to pay the service charge of 26 dollars.
For more information on the new visa application procedure, see the following website: http://mexico.usebassy.gov/boletteines/sp101201_Visas-FAQs.html
NASA announces the founding of extraterrestrial life
The North American Space Agency launched a press conference to present tomorrow with a fund that will have an impact on the search for life in all.
The National Aviation and Space Authority (NASA) of the United States will announce tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The Fund will be presented tomorrow at 1 p.m. at a press conference at NASA headquarters in Washington by experts from astrobiology. This is a science that explores the origin, development, distribution and the future of life in the universe.
At the opening of the press conference, NASA assured them that it would present "a supervisory fund for the search for extraterrestrial life", triggering speculation among experts from other countries.
The discovery could prove that in hostile environments that have so far been considered uninhabitable, human beings could exist. It was suggested that these could turn into intelligent creatures - like humans - if their living conditions improved.
Apparently, this is a microbe found on the basis of the Mono Lake in the Yosemite National Park, California. It lives there in an environment that was considered too toxic for all forms of earthly life, since the lake is heavily arsenic.
In some way, the microbe uses arsenic as a means of survival. Taking into account this ability, there is an increase in the chances that there may be similar life on other planets that do not have our protective atmosphere.
When these organisms change the arsenic, according to astrobiologists, it has been shown that "there is actually another form of life, there is a second form of life that differs from the one we know."
The space agency will announce tomorrow, Thursday, at the press conference, the actual scope of its fund.
At the conference, geobiologist Pamela Conrad is involved in the study of the possibility of life on Mars, and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists, the Titan (the largest moon Saturns) is studying whether his chemical composition is similar to that of the earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergence and pattern form an opposition block
With the reform of the Organic Act on Congress, the two-party system is introduced, they complain.
The 60th legislative period had just begun, and an opposition block was already installed, led by the MPs of the PRD, PT, Convergence and Jesús Manuel Patron Montalvo, who presented himself as an independent. The following four questions were raised: the introduction of the 'Two-Party System' into the Chamber.
Before the opening of the session in the 60th legislative period, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of the PRD and patron Montalvo against the reform of the organ law, as they would thus be excluded.
With this reform, they repeated, a 'two-party system' would be introduced, because now there would be two people, the same number as the parties that controlled the Congress.
These four MPs, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the presidency of the Panist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca as Vice-President.
Corvera Quevedo stated that the parties to PRI and PAN with these reforms had institutionally introduced their political position.
He explained that in the next few days they would speak to the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the scheme. In doing so, they would go out of their political will, and if they didn't have it, they would go back to the two parties, which would put an end to the opposition coalition.
"To this end I come (the opposition coalition), that is what I see, because we will be excluded from all decisions that do not even look back to considering the opinion of the others."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia explained that there was agreement with PRD, PT and pattern and that a pluralist group would therefore be formed.
It cannot be allowed, he continued that the Congress, after being monopolistic, should now be "duopolistic".
"It is not the spirit of the reform of the law that the Congress should rule an eternal two-party system."
"For the start, this group will start with five Members and they will talk to other colleagues and colleagues to make them more effective," said the Convergencia member.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza from the PT, acting on PAN and PRI, said that the Congress had now turned into a 'bucket' for two.
"Before it was just a party, now they're dividing it into two."
Mr Montalvo asked the honourable Members to respect them and give them their place in the negotiating tables.
"It must not be left out because of the top five decisions that are likely to be nine Members. The five that are currently seen as divided into different groups have decided to unite to take our place at the negotiating table, because because of the reform that has been carried out and distributed by the others, we have stayed outside and we do not agree with this reform."
200 000 peso more for "the supplier"
The city administration of Mazatlán pays another check to the contested owner of the company for electrical material.
Another check over more than 200 000 peso for Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the city administration.
This is the amount paid to the owner of the company for electrical material in the second half of the year 1,200 000 pesos.
According to the site for more transparency of the city administration, this check was issued at an amount of 200,144,56 peso with number 9258447 last November 16 with the purpose of using "counting open accounts".
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had already sent more money from the municipality to this supplier. She is observed by the Auditoría Superior del Estado because she sells it at higher prices.
What has not been mentioned is the total amount that you still owe her and therefore the number of checks that are still displayed for the benefit of Camacho Palazuelos.
"It wasn't bought with her, it's just paid the debts, just like the rest of the suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last checks "appeared" in the last quarter of the year "on": 24 September, two of October 15, October 19, October 29, and the last of November 16.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal as required by law when a company is questioned by the ASE in order to avoid other administrations applying for its services, the Treasurer assured that its services would not be re-applyed.
After the Noroest newspaper had published the review of the checks issued by the City Administration to its suppliers on 25 July, it was announced that, from March 2008 to 9 July 2010, the municipality had paid over 10 million pesos with 42 checks on Camacho Paluzelos during the three-year term of office of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez.
Businesses with Jumapam also took place where they took checks worth over 3 million pesos.
Tourist sites need to be improved urgently
Tourist companies regret the accident of the foreign tourist due to the poor condition of Gloria Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the collapse of a foreign tourist in the collapse of the Gloriat Sánchez Taboada, the tourist industry of Mazatlán requested special attention from the authorities, the areas in which they are in a bad state and that they throw a bad image at the port city.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Trade Association of the Zone Dorada, recalled that there were many different opportunities to maintain the destination and to turn the bad conditions that tourists have found into new employment opportunities or routes.
He said that the bad condition of the roads and roads had had a negative effect, as tourists came to wander and saw the disorder, so that they would turn their backs to the nearby shops.
"The politicians don't know what it means to have to close a company someday and they don't think about how much money you lose, because otherwise they wouldn't do the construction in this way slowly and planlessly."
Hotel owner José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the storm of the tourist would have brought attention to the lack of prevention and the continued maintenance work on the part of the city.
"The community has to take over its responsibilities and avoid something that happens once again. How should it do this? Well, by taking preventive care instead of doing everything afterwards," he explained.
"We look forward to having a clean city. Not only because it is a foreign transport area, it must be maintained, we also have a right to a clean living space. The city administration must change its strategy to keep the city in good condition."
"There are other places that also look carefree and incomplete," he said, "for example el Escudo y el Venadito of Mazatlán."
"Today we need more than just advertising to attract tourists. A good product must be offered, a city that cleans its beaches and streets, and the tourist attractions are constantly on fire," he added.
"These provisions have not been given enough attention and these kinds of incidents merely present what is obvious to everyone: maintenance is urgently needed."
Raúl Llera Martínez, Undersecretary of Promoción Turistica, expressed the importance of saving the tourist resorts of Mazatlán because they would not be properly used and made a bad image.
He mentioned a number of places that were to be brought together with the city to the front of the city. To make the city clean, orderly and attractive for foreign transport should be a priority.
"Happyly Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites that first have to be cleaned and cleaned to make them attractive for foreign transport and to bring them to the inventory with which we are engaged for this purpose.
IP calls for conference results
Mr Dávalos, President of the CCE, suggested that the Members should take on the great responsibility of setting an example for a better Sinaloa, which is facing many challenges.
The Mazatlán business sector calls for a worthy Parliament, free of agreement, to move the parties and the government, because Sinaloa is overwhelmed and is facing major problems.
Yesterday the 60th Parliament was dedicated. It consists of seven political forces, 19 members of the PRI, 13 from PAN, three from Partido Nueva Alianza, two from PRD, one from PT, one from Convergence and another from PVEM.
The new members of the State Congress are expected to do a clean job, to feel obliged to the society and various social groups that are responsible for parliamentary work, and not to repeat the same pattern of participation and paternism.
Eduardo Dávalos, Chairman of the CCE Corporate Coordination Board, suggested that the new Members should take on the great responsibility of setting an example for a better Sinaloa, which is facing many challenges.
"We hope that the Members will really exercise their right to act free of any agreement between the parties, because it is customary for them to enter into agreements with which they represent their own interests, thereby transforming themselves into carnival camps of the government and the leader of the parliamentary groups."
He said that they should prove their commitment to building the bridges needed to support the current government.
"We are concerned that they do a trustworthy work and are working primarily for the society and its groups, because it was the inhabitants of Sinaloa who expressed their trust in them in the last elections."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, believes that one of the major challenges facing the 40 peoples is the drive and the joint work for economic growth of the state, because today the economic situation is extremely complicated.
"The most important thing is that they drive economic growth, create investment incentives and infrastructure measures, which will in some way promote job creation."
With regard to the foreign transport sector, he called on the new Members to give them the necessary place in the public budget to support the Ministry of Foreign Transport.
"I understand that it is the Ministry with the second most recent funds, which is incompatible with an important economic activity that brings foreign exchange and investment into the country and is in direct competition with the agro-industry."
The tourism projects must be allocated money, state security must be supported, and the alcohol law, which has not been renewed in previous legislative periods, must be updated.
Holy King Seeked
Dolls, cars, bicycles and other toys wish the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family look forward.
For the parents, it will be difficult to meet these wishes the next Tuesday, because the budget does not consist more and less of 12 people and a goat.
Even so, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesus, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaiah, José Juan and Miguel do not give up hope that Melchior, Caspar and Balthasar will give them the toy and the clothing that they look like.
The family lives a modest house in the Salvador Allende settlement. They live by hand in the mouth, because the father has no hard work.
"Sometimes hard times have been said because my husband doesn't have a job. But we sell Mandarins and potatoes... I'm going with the gorges to sell on the street in the afternoon," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the children.
The four-year-old Adelaida would like a doll or a bike, while her three-year-old sister Isabel would like a Barbie doll.
For some time now, ten-year-old José Alfredo wants to have a 'monstercar' and for that eight-month-old brother Jesús proposes Cayetana clothing in the size of one-year-olds.
" (José Alfredo) told me 'I would like this monster so much', but I replied to him, 'Let's wait, boy', because it was very expensive," Cayeta recalled sadly.
For older children who were in school, clothing and shoes would be ideal.
The eleven-year-old María Guadalupe has the size 12; the ten-year-old Isaiah has the size 10, while the eight-year-old Miguel has the size 8.
The 14-year-old José Juan lacks tennis shoes. A couple in size 5 1/2 or 6 would be very helpful.
If you want to help realize the dreams of the children of the family Coronado Valenzuela, you can participate in the campaign 'Holy King sought' by contributing a toy or cash in the reception hall of the Noroest newspaper.

On Wednesday, ten domestic searches were carried out in the administrative region of Austria as part of the destruction of a cannabis production and sales network.
Fourteen persons have been arrested and various charges are brought against them.
The house surveys were performed in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, where they were supposed to have been the main users of drug production.
"Approximately 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, cash and equipment that have served production have been confiscated," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesperson of the Quebec Security Police.
A total of eleven men and three women were arrested, two of whom were from Sherbrooke, the main drug addict.
The arrested persons are expected to appear in Sherbrooke for hours after their arrest before the courthouse.
They could, among other things, be charged with the production of cannabis, its possession for sale, the plot and the service of crime.
These household surveys had taken place as a result of a long-term investigation, which took place over a year later.
"The information received from the public has enabled us to carry out these arrests," said Mr. Ruel.
About the 70 police officers of the Regional Investigation Unit, Estria of the Quebec Security Police, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphrémagog Police Office had participated in this police operation.
The secret migration could be pursued without difficulty
The draft law of the Conservatives, which, according to the Government, is intended to address the problem of ships loaded with secret migrants, will be pushed into line with all expectations after the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they cannot support the proposal.
"I will pay attention to this charter."
"I'm with a party that has put you on foot," explained Michael Ignatieff, head of the Liberals, after the weekly Caucus session in front of the assembled MPs.
The Liberals claimed that the draft legislation allowing each person who comes to hold a ship identified as carrying illegal immigrants for up to one year would violate the Canadian Constitution as proposed.
Gilles Duceppe, head of the Bloc Québecis, also pointed out that he could not support the bill as he turned against the wrong target group.
"We are against it and it seems that all opposition parties are against it, so we will wait for what the government is doing," said Mr. Duceppe.
Criticism about the immigration issue of Olivia Chow, NDP, has left the critics who claim that their party did not behave consistently enough against the secret migrants.
"The neo-democrats agree to take action against the blind passengers, and we are also trying to implement this by means of another draft of legislation, C-35," Chow said.
We therefore do not support the draft law of the Conservatives because it seeks to blame the refugees and keeps children trapped for at least a year," Chow explained.
Immigrant Minister Jason Kenny accused the opposition parties of playing with politics and ignoring the wishes of Canadians.
"The Canadians strongly tell the MPs that they do not tolerate this kind of secret immigration, these criminal proceedings involving Canada and treating the country as a pedestrian."
"You expect Canada to take tough action," said Minister Kenneys.
"The government has not announced any confidence in its bill which could have led the country to elections that the government had rejected.
A conservative, however, spoke against the QMI agency, the government would call for a vote so that each opposition Member could express himself immediately to his constituents.
The new unit does not find any matching
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a new, standing unit to fight corruption and collision, many observers continue to request the formation of a public committee on this issue.
Robert Dutil, Minister of Public Security, claims that this idea did not come from yesterday: Quebec had already consulted the New York Department of Research on this issue last January.
Since 1870, the metropolis has been a standing unit against corruption.
However, Wednesday's announcement has more than one surprise.
It must be said that this measure was not discussed at the meeting of the Permanent Committee of the Quebec Police Service on 29 October last year, despite Robert Dutil's presence.
Nor was it lacking that Stéphane Bergeron, critics and member of the Québec Party, qualified this announcement in public security as "out of the Hut spelled rabbits" as well as "a right-based solution" in a table.
Minister Dutil had, in turn, turned to those who feared that political power had too much influence on the infra-red, future unity.
"You will see the result when we announce it," he was pleased to confirm.
"You're aware of this problem."
According to Réjean Parent, the President of the CSQ, nothing can replace the conduct of a public inquiry.
"The more Mr. Charest insists on preventing the formation of this committee of inquiry, the more people like you and I think he has something to hide," he explained.
"The only means to be able to form a committee of inquiry is the resignation of Jean Charest," said Yves Boisvert, lecturer of ethics and political systems at the ENA (State University for the Training of High Administrative Officers).
In order to get out of this bag gas, he proposes to Quebec that financial audit control should be given a special mandate to enable it to carry out research on corruption and secret agreements.
"You should be able to extend the mandate of the inspection control," he said.
He also believes that the Quebec of the inspection control could grant the same power as the Commissioners, which would allow it to oblige the people to make a statement.
The formation of a standing unit is not the only project in the cabinets of the Government Charest.
The Quebec will also require Ottawa to change the criminal law accordingly to be more committed to this type of crime.
This request comes from the Supreme Prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who informed Justice Minister Jean-Marc Fournier that the case in this kind of prosecution is not clear.
Vic Toews, Minister of State for Public Security, confirmed that his colleague, Rob Nicholson, is currently dealing with certain novelties relating to this dossier.
During the 2001 Operation Printemps, which involved the groups of motorcyclists, 131 persons were arrested, although the criminal law had not been renewed.
Ottawa has therefore enforced the law against gangsterdom.
Rivers under strict surveillance
Several flows remain under strict surveillance due to the high rainfalls that have taken place in some regions of the province since Tuesday.
In Shawnigan, in the administrative region of Mauritius, it came to an Earthquake on Wednesday afternoon.
Two houses were evacuated in a preventive manner.
In the evening, another Earthquake took place in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in the administrative region of Lanaudiere.
A street has fallen into it.
From Tuesday to Wednesday, strong rainfalls of 40 to 70 millilitres have hit several regions.
Between 20 and 40 additional millimeters of precipitation were expected here according to the regions until Thursday evening.
The areas north of the river and the valley of the Outauouais region were most affected.
A total of up to 100 millimetre of rainshows went down here.
Since snow melts are still to be added to these precipitations, which have already been collected in certain sub-areas, it is feared that several watercourses will be exceeded.
On Wednesday, warnings were issued by the Quebec Security Service on the high-water alarm concerning the Ouereau and Achigan rivers in the Lanaudiere region.
The rivers in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentian mountains and in the Chene in Lotbinière will be the object of high water monitoring and remain under observation.
In the Lanaudière region, the severe defeats of some lakes in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon have led to their overcoming.
In Saint-Calixte a detachment bridge was continued due to heavy rains.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as a preventive measure.
In Outauouais, the crossing of certain lakes has caused the closure of several roads, especially in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The security service continues to be in alarm alerts and is monitoring the situation as described by security advisor Annik Bouchard.
On Wednesday, the Quebec Landeshochwater Centre issued warning signs of the strong rise of several rivers, in particular from Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouereau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loop.
Dupont partly bound
The Quebec Radio Moderator Stéphane Dupont, before the Canadian Supervisory Board for Radio Standards (CCNR) for its controversial statements on social care and Haitians as well as its detailed speech on radio, has suffered a partial relapse.
Although the CCNR represented the opinion, Mr. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team had the right to their own opinion, certain statements had "inaccurate information about social care and unfairly negative representations of the Haitians as well as an unaccompanied speech which is not appropriate for the broadcasts broadcasts over the day."
The Supervisory Board also concluded that a discussion on suicide involving the spread of the names of two persons who have committed suicide violates the codex of radio transmission.
The CCNR had received several complaints regarding the comments made during the broadcasts in 2008 and 2010.
The first was made available as a result of a complaint from the "Front commune des persones assistees sociales du Québec".
The activist organisation had claimed that the amounts mentioned in the consignment were not accurate.
The moderators should provide more solid than misleading information.
Regarding the topic of suicide, moderator Stéphane Dupont had represented the view that suicide was an expression of cowardice.
The majority of the supervisory board members had concluded that the message communicated was that suicide should not be considered as a solution to life crises.
"The majority of the Supervisory Board takes into account that the infrastructural consequences of the "Dupont le midi" mission had cut down a sensitive topic in a family-friendly and appropriate way."
Therefore, he was presented with no table against his person.
The last issue was the statements on the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-Réné Dufort had been involved in an effective media discussion that caused a lot of reactions.
The CHOI moderator had explained that it was not in favour of Haiti's aid because it was not safe to know whether the funds would really be paid to the needy.
The Supervisory Board is of the opinion that these comments have not been abusive, but their cumulative effect presents an unjustified negative representation of the Haitians.
"I've already had my three-day suspension penalty in this case."
"My act has been youthful for half a year," said the moderator.
In all decisions, the Board of Supervisors shall facilitate the dissemination of an unaccompanied expression.
In all cases, the CHOI-FM broadcaster has acted "in addition to his obligations".
The consequences for the broadcaster, who, inter alia, was to notify his decisions on a single basis during the main terminal period within a three-day period, are limited.
A King of the King-Fu in Montreal
Nacereddine Zemmal, Montreal of Algerian origin, has launched a very special course.
The athlete, who shines in "Sanda" (full contact with King-Fu), kickboxes and Thaiboxes, now rises in search of new challenges to the Tamami and to the world's boxing rings.
"I started fighting sports like King-Fu and Kickboxes 12 years ago in Algeria," Zemmal, who has been in the metropolis since 2008, explained to develop under the profession.
I personally look for the fight allerred because for those who do not like the struggle of the ground, as the mixed arts present it, the fights in North America are rare."
Recently, his sign as a security officer, as well as his rivals with UPS, had given him bad news, in which he won two gold medals from the World Karat and the Kickboxing Association (WKA) awarded the World Cup in Edinburgh, Scotland, between October 23 and 30.
"I have won the victory in the categories of full contact with Kickboxen and Thaiboxen," he explained.
"I am currently preparing for the World Cup in San Shou in China."
"It was invited to the fighters of each category who had placed themselves at the last world championship among the first four."
"I got my baby 2009 in Toronto Bronze."
"2005 I'm back in Vietnam."
"2007 I finished the tournament in China in the fifth place, while I became third in 2009 in Toronto," he added.
"It is noteworthy that I have made progress in every competition."
"With this rhythm, I will be the first one this time or next year!"
"San Shou" or "Sanda" are disciplines from China, where foot-and-mouth blows and foot-and-mouths are permitted as well as ground throws.
The fights usually play on a platform, more rarely in a boxing ring.
The most famous box fighter that has emerged from this type of fight is the American Vietnamese origin Cung Le, who is well known in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal had only one event left in his career, he would certainly call his presence here at the Super Tournament "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of the King-Fu.
"This competition is the highest and the highest in China," said the sympathetic pound.
"It is a bit like the equivalent of the Lumpinee Stadium (the largest Thai Stadium)."
"That was a super experience."
He had won his first battle in the semi-final of his category (80kg) before losing in the final.
"The one who beat me was a real professional," he said.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals meet each other at the end of their category."
"Then the winners of each category offer the race to crown a single champion, the King of the King-Fu."
450 million in contracts without tendering
In mutual agreement, Hydro-Québec has authorized project planning companies $450 million for contracts for the water power project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
In the middle of this maze of more than 100 contracts, a consortium consisting of the companies BPR, Dessau, group SM and Axor, which received the most important share, namely that of the project management, to a sum of $295 million without a call.
This consortium, called "Energie gérance", was formed in 2004 as a sponsor of the decision of Hydro-Quebec, the private sector's responsibility to respond to this important hydroelectric project amounting to $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the consortium "Energie gérance" concluded the contract without a public invitation.
For the Québec Party, taking back on corporate consortia is a serious ethical problem that poses a risk of distortion of competition and a price increase.
"This is a new way of playing a carded game and discourages competition."
"This means that instead of playing carded games, instead of secretly running them in open form now," yesterday Sylvain Simard, the PQ MP, said at the press conference.
In the early morning, Simard had raised the question before the National Assembly, because it seems difficult to understand how the public interest can be used in this way.
Minister of Resources Nathalie Normandeau had responded to this in the afternoon by saying very much in Abrede that it would have been a de facto game in this contract.
"I remain faithful to my line," she said, as she strengthened that the PQ was "unfairly" and it "despites her hardness".
She said "it's the least," that the PQ apologized.
The model of the consortium is a global practice.
It is usually a temporary alliance that allows two or more companies to combine their expertise in a bid for a complex project.
The Eastmain project shows a high level of complexity in terms of its scope.
The construction process is in progress and will be set up by 2012.
However, the contract was granted without any competition being possible; there had already been negotiations.
In addition, the model of the Consortium in Quebec is no longer an exception even in relatively simple projects.
As the newspaper "Le Devoir" noted last week, the model applied in the field of engineering and consulting is the subject of government statements by the Consortium.
A short overflight of the Quebec Company Register allows to name more than 200 consortia, some of which seem to be permanent.
For example, Dessau works in partnership with most of its core competitors, including CIMA+, Génivar, SNC Lavalin or Roche and Tecsult.
Any link, and there are several dozen of them, leads back to one and the same legal person, namely Dessau.
With regard to the consortium "Energy gérance", Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territory of the Bay of James is subject to a special dynamic of labour and that Hydro-Québec has been paying special account for this fact since the 1970s".
Réal Laporte, the major employer of the Société d'energie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has made a statement that the nose over the fact that the project management contract was approved after agreement.
"If you make an invitation and there are only a few applicants, your prices will be faster."
"So you have two options: either you take the people who are on this March and tell you: you will negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price."
"The idea is, however, that the price is not crucial, but the understanding of the people," Laporte confirmed.
This contract awarded to the consortium "Energie gérance" is part of a long list of contracts over 50,000 dollars received from the Québec Party.
The contracts were approved either by the Hydro-Quebec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
According to the review, the Le Devor newspaper included more than 100 engineering and consulting contracts, which were granted to firms or their branches, including in particular resource laboratories, between 2002 and March 2010.
SNC-Lavalin had entered into 22 contracts, Génivar had received 16, Teksult 14 and Dessau 10, without taking part in "Energy gérance".
All these treaties have been negotiated.
They total $449 783 344, including the contract with "Energie gérance" over $295 131 564.
Sylvain Simard had announced that the four companies that form the consortium (BPR, Dessau, group SM and Axor) of the "Parti liberal du Québec" were well known.
Minister Normandeau had claimed that the PQ was equally linked to the companies that they "funded" before stating that it was rather about their leadership.
Barometer responsible consumption - The "green" label is not trustworthy
Greener, but uninvited skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has little confidence in the main players of sustainable growth, but also little in the marked brands or eco-labels to control its choice.
Unfortunately, although it is bathing in a media-efficient universe where information for a more responsible consumption only fades: the barometer's responsible consumption has a lack of credible information to complain about, an incompetence that makes itself known as the brake of its commitment, as the first reading showed, which was held yesterday.
Although they have advanced the consumption of the so-called socially compatible products in 2010, the Quebecers still seem to pay little credit to those who are trying to sell them.
Two thirds of Quebec's population agree that in fact the environmental commitment of companies is as little faith as the green company's advertising, the instrument of measurement, which has been proclaimed by the responsible consumer centre of Sherbrooke University.
Another finding is that half of consumers have doubts about the reliability of the official certificates attached to the allegedly fair products, but also the credibility of the products and brands that declare themselves to be environmentally conscious, says the barometer.
According to the same pattern, the discourse of the politicians on this issue is taken seriously by only 14.6% of the Quebec population.
However, information on responsible consumption seems to be important to stimulate this consumption segment, which is currently inhabited by only one third of Quebec's consumers.
In fact, empty and questionable nature of the information dampened the zeal of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the barometer at the higher price of the products.
In addition, one third of Quebecers are disappointed at the stated capacity of green products and services they are trying to afford.
According to another Communication, over half of consumers in 2010 had changed their habits and mainly changed the brand of one or more products to express their conviction.
According to Barometer, they had also preferred 61% purchases from traders in their city district and benefited from the purchase of food grown in their region.
Greener and more responsible - the environmental consumption index had reached 64 of the maximum value of 100 this year - the homo consumer of Quebec likes to present himself as King of recycling, trying to reduce its traces left in the environment by taking care of animal protection.
However, the social and ecological consciousness seems to stand in front of his car, according to the barometer: just 28% of Quebecers have indicated that they used public transport in 2010 or preferred to have their environmental interests demonstrated.
The addition and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of participants in this comprehensive behavioural survey, which feed on the skeletal perceptions.
State loan for the acquisition of eXcentris
The Quebec Government, which was invited by Société Angus and the company Parallel to participate financially in the acquisition of the cinema complex eXcentris, agrees with a cooperation, but only in the form of a competitive loan.
The developer company Angus and the company Parallèle, who had hoped to receive a donation of $7 million from the Ministry of Culture for the acquisition of the Daniel Langlois-owned cinema complex eXcentris on the Boulevard Saint-Laurent in order to re-response this actual kinetic function, apparently did not receive what they required.
The Government has accepted to be involved in this matter, however, under its own conditions.
Instead of the expected donation, the Quebec Government offers a loan of less than the initially expected amount that could bring about an existing solution to favourable conditions, at least in the opinion of the sources from the state-run kitchen.
A first action plan and a request for 12.8 million have already been rejected by Quebec for the last spring, the request has been substantially corrected since the second time.
A proposal, together with an action plan, has already been sent by the President of Société de Development des entrepreneurs kulturelles (SODEC), François Macerola, to Minister St-Pierre, who runs the eXcentris Act.
Several days ago, he had her give her a final report.
However, the counter proposal of the cabinet was transmitted to the SODEC on Wednesday.
Parallels and Angus now have until 31 December time to respond to these.
In any event, the contributions of the State funds seem to have really been pushed aside.
We recall that the Quebec ownership community of the cinemas and cinema complex had turned against a direct state investment to support the acquisition of eXcentris by presenting the argument that the Minister of Culture had no financial assistance for real estate projects that he had not allowed to come to other cinemas.
However, several other market participants in the segment complained about substantial economic aid.
After the self-financed construction of the cinema, film director Daniel Langlois had presented the author cinema in the rooms of his cinema complex for ten years, which could justify the exemption from the public funds.
The lack of cinemas showing independent films is more than obvious in Montreal, and eXcentris knew to keep his clients at the bar.
The Société Angus as well as the company Parallele with Christian Yaccarini at the top, directs a privately funded campaign from which they hope a sum of $700,000 to attract the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only a single screen continues to show films in eXcentris, namely Le Parallèle.
The goal of the future acquirers is to reopen the three cinema halls on February 27 next year with the presentation of the very successful film by Xavier Beauvois "Des hommes et des dieux".
But Christian Yaccarini has not called the newspaper "Le Devor" and one ignores what he and his group hold from the suggestions that have been corrected below.
Aired secrets of complex-scattered Canada
The new American diplomats, which were spread by WikiLeaks, blew the secret of what the United Nations thought under the Canadian minority complex against the Americans; however, with the same blow, they reveal the feeling of superiority of the latter against Canada.
As a result, the American diplomats are surprised that the Canadian elector at the election does not have Canadian-American relations in mind, and they believe that the visit of President Obama would have helped the conservative government to implement its 2009 budget!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which were distributed publicly yesterday, offer even more pique details than the only substantive content you have to knock on.
A link dated 22 September 2008, i.e. during the period during which the federal electoral campaign was in full swing, reports on the extent to which the United Nations no longer participates in the activities discussed by its political leaders.
To the great surprise of David Wilkins, the U.S. ambassador employed in Ottawa.
Mr Wilkins offers various explanations of this situation.
"A Canadian quasi-inhabitable minority complex may require the Canadian political leadership to talk much more about internal issues of everyday life than to assign the United States to the black Peter in this election (as in 1988 in the campaign on free trade)," he describes.
The United Nations, he concludes, is thus "the verbal Goliath of this election: omnipresent but potentially too dangerous to speak of it".
The ambassador understands this 'stupid silence' as the two countries have intense political and economic relations.
" Logically," he said, "it would be the ability of a candidate, a party and much more of a party to lead such an essential relationship that the voter has in mind as a key factor in the process of urning."
The other expression of this feeling of importance was read in the communication sent by Terry Breese, a businessman in Ottawa on 22 January 2009 by President Barack Obama to prepare for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your journey will help ensure the continued existence of the government in the confidence vote over the federal budget at the beginning of February, when Canada will announce its first deficit after more than a decade, which has been created due to a lifetime programme of 30 to 40 billion dollars," Breese describes.
He had not mentioned anything that the government had to represent the Parliament before Christmas in order to prevent Parliament from collaborating with the coalition and that the continued existence of the opposition parties would affect the quality of the proposed live programme.
Another message written by Ambassador Wilkins from January 2008 is Washington's increasingly negative image that broadcasts over CBC, dramatic series from the United States.
The messenger is concerned about shipments such as Borders, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, where you can observe little subtle recordings of Maher Arar, the "No-Fly List" or also lectures for the purpose of the CIA's muscle prosthetics.
Another communication reports in detail how Hillary Clinten asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner at her first bilateral meeting whether Europe was ready to take up certain prisoners from Guantanamo.
Mr Kouchner should have answered the question with a yes, but on the basis of an individual 'case to case' decision.
At the end of the meeting, he described "he issued a paper in Omar Khadr point, a 15-year-old Canadian Muslim."
"The Secretary of State has promised to review the act."
Finally, we note that the wallpapers are hot with regard to the WikiLeaks website.
Tom Flanagan, an old and Stephen Harper's very close advisor, had explained about CBC that those responsible for this massive leak should be "transferred".
He referred here to Mike Huckabee from the United States.
Global plan for the renewal of lighting
Yesterday in Cancun, the UN proposed a plan to re-enlighten households, trade and industry in 100 countries in order to achieve a reduction in greenhouse gas (FCKW), which corresponds to almost one third of the additional reduction that needs to be implemented in order to stabilise the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan adopts its position in the light of the concrete major projects that the UN hopes to implement in Cancun in order to compensate for the absence of binding reduction obligations of the industrialized countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, the main problem in the form of 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of the FCKW emitted to the earth would be avoided if the white glowing beers, which still represent a monopoly of 50 to 70% on the market, would be replaced by fluorescent or better, by LEDs.
The lighting is responsible for 8% of the world's emissions.
This corresponds to an equivalent of 70% of the greenhouse gas emissions from the global fleet.
Last year, in Copenhagen, large emitters such as the United States, China, Europe and other countries, including Canada, had committed themselves to voluntary reduction plans that should reduce global FCKW emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, this balance sheet had to be reduced to 5 gt in order to stabilise the rise in climate by 2 degrees Celsius from today to 2020 in order to prevent this device from being out of control.
In the white glowing berry, 95% of the energy is absorbed in the form of heat, and the rest 5% produce the light.
The compact light bulbs reduce energy consumption by 75%, and the new LED light bulbs reduce this energy demand by twice again.
The compact light bulbs hold an average of 6000 to 10,000 hours.
The new LED light bulbs, such as those that the manufacturer Philips placed on the market this week - this company has also participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a white light bulb, which provides an overview of the savings of the exchange plan to be applied in 100 countries.
In addition to the fact that it is completely new-looking glowing berrys only very little heat, they can also work with a rule resistance.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several experts have shown that compact light bulbs have reserves as they contain mercury and that they need to be disposed of as a special powder, which is not always possible in developing countries, except for producers providing an acceptance point.
However, according to the report, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the compact light source, but rather the coal power plants that emit much more mercury to generate the electricity spent by the white glowing sources.
These coal power plants alone in the United States amount to 25,000 tonnes of mercury annually.
The report describes in detail the gains that each country would generate through this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save a billion dollars a year on the purchase of electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, which means an equivalent of 3.5 coal plants, whose construction would cost Indonesia 2.5 billion.
Côte d'Ivoire awaits the announcement of the results of the election
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the "immediate" publication of the results of the presidential election of the Côte d'Ivoire immediately after their deadline.
"The Secretary-General underlines the need for the independent electoral commission to receive its work and to report the preliminary results without further delay," said a UN chief press spokesman.
"He asks all the parties and institutions of the Côte d'Ivoire to demonstrate their responsibilities and to include each initiative until the publication of the preliminary results."
Despite the pressure from certain foreign governments, the Commission had allowed the deadline fixed on Wednesday afternoon to be postponed three days after the Sunday election without publication.
About forty minutes before the deadline, the President of the CEI confirmed on television that the Commission would "go on with the work" to announce the results.
On Wednesday many calls from all over the world have been made, but the CEI can finally call out the name of the winner of the second round of elections under the distinguished Laurent Gbagbo and his opponents Alassane Ouattara.
The Gbagbo camp, however, counts with the cancellation of "false" vote contributions in the north by the Constitutional Council, which was achieved by the ex-Rebellion camp of the Forces nouvelles (UN) during the coup failed in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, head of the Côte d'Ivoire presidential campaign, had confirmed that the UN-trained manoeuvre to intimidate voters in the north of the country had terrified the President's supporters of the election.
The entire election could be cancelled if the complaints submitted by Gbagbo were taken into account by the Constitutional Council.
However, the Gbagbo contractors are now more of the view that the country's highest court is not neutral, since it is led by Paul Yao N'Dré, a politically close associate with Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north who denies any connection to the former rebels, has considered the delay in announcing the results of the election as "unacceptable" and has asked Gbagbo to respect them, even if he has not gone so far to seek victory.
His allies confirm that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows he has lost; and to file a complaint before the Constitutional Court after preventing the electoral commission from publishing the results, it is illegal.
The second round of the presidential elections on Sunday was held for the crowning of the union and reconciliation process of a country, which was split into two parts over years.
On Wednesday, the United Nations had warned the policymakers of the Côte d'Ivoire that they could be held responsible for any outbreaks.
Laurent Gbagbo enjoyed the first round of elections on 31 October, with 38% of the votes against 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who was behind the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
Unemployment rate remained stable in France in the third quarter
The unemployment rate in France, according to the International Labour Office (IAA) in the metropolitan area, is stable at 9.3% (including the overseas departments at 9.7%), thus showing the provisional seasonally adjusted data published on Thursday by the Federal Statistical Office of Insee.
The unemployment rate in the metropolis is 2,631 million.
The figures for the second quarter are 9.3% of the working population in the metropolis and 9.7% of the working population in the overseas departments.
Over the year, the unemployment rate recorded an increase of 0.1 percentage points.
In particular, 3.4 million employees of the French metropolis were not employed in the third quarter, however they wanted to find a job; this included whether they were able to work every two weeks or not or whether they were looking for work.
The situation of young people on the labour market has worsened with an increase in the unemployment rate of 24.2% in the metropolis (+ 0.9 percentage points within three months, +0.5 percentage points per year) and 25% with the inclusion of the overseas regions.
In the third quarter, 637,000 young people between 15 and 24 years of age were unemployed according to the IAA.
On the other hand, seniors have a slight increase in the unemployment rate of 6.4% in the metropolis (+0.2 percentage points over three months and over the year), i.e. 482,000 in over 50-year-olds, 6.6% in the overseas departments.
Only the 25-49 year-olds could benefit from the stability of unemployment in the third quarter; 8.3% in the metropolis (-0.1 percentage point over three months, +0.1 percentage point over one year) and 8.8% in France as a whole.
Following a dispute over its calculation procedures, the Federal Statistical Office Insee no longer publishes monthly unemployment figures since 2006.
However, Eurostat, the Statistical Office of the European Union, continues in this method and announced on Tuesday a 9.8% quota in France for October (including the overseas departments) compared to 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini charged and arrested
Against Alexandre Guérini, 53, head of a company and brother of the President of the General Council of the Bouches-du-Rhône Region (PS), a investigation procedure was initiated and he was brought into prison in Luynes near Aix-en-Provence during an investigation procedure on the public and suspicious markets.
Alexandre Guérini was accused of undermining society's assets, repudiation of general goods, healership, corruption, illegal occupation and possession of arms, according to his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is willing to fight and is willing to express himself on all the questions that will be put to him by the State's attorney rather than spread his mind."
"It is easy for him to submit a number of criminal charges, another thing is to prove them," said his lawyer Florence Rault of the AFP (Agency France Presse) before hearing his client.
Mr. Guérini, brother of Jean-Noël Guérini, the first man of the PS (Parti Socialist) department, had put the judge at the disposal of his lawyers before his hearing.
A relative of Guérinis, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and arrested on Wednesday.
According to Lawyer Lucien Simon, her mandate had never done anything but keep his deposit that he had to run.
As for the business area of competence or the destination of the associated fund, he would never have known, says Simon.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former Director-General of the Public Service of the Aubagne Balling Room, was also charged on Wednesday for subjugation and complicity, but then under pressure to stay away from the protagonists of these legal acts under judicial supervision.
"My mandate was able to provide explanations of the facts that had been presented to him."
"The chief prosecutor took into account not to rob him of his freedom," said his lawyer Yann Arnoux.
Four other persons were charged and released from prison on Wednesday night, including two of them under legal supervision, said Deputy State Attorney Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy manager of the company Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is prosecuted for "unallowed influence and passive attachment".
Two officials of the Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Briguier were also arrested, one of whom was entitled "Reduction and rejection of general goods by an officer of the public service", the other because of "competence in the pursuit of public money".
The life of Alexandre Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was also charged with the "healing and undermining of society's assets".
Among the people who were confronted with Guérini are Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently arrested for a similar case of fraud by the public who had suffered from Corsica.
The inmates suspect his society to have contributed to washing money from "high" criminal circles.
The investigation against X for fraudulent fraud in the award of public contracts, in particular for the purpose of disposal, will be carried out in April 2009 by means of anonymous letters in the files of several open investigation procedures.
It is noted from close sources that the investigation focuses on the conditions of the grant and the operation of a deposit in La Ciotat, which is also waste from the Aubagne area, as well as from certain cities of the urban area of Marseille (MPM).
Affaire Clotilde Reiss: the Elysée Palace exceeds its medium function for Syria
Within more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher who was detained in Iran for "spionage", the French public in the spirit, moved the diplomacy into alertness and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
This is all under the attention of the United States diplomats.
The American documents received by WikiLeaks and screened by the newspaper "Le Monde" give some of the reasons for this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée had told the Americans its strategy, which went so far as to give these advice to deal with their own crisis of "hospitality" in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They point out how the French authorities have tried to convince Washington that the liberation of the young Frenchman did not deliver the release of Majid Kakavand, a prisoner in France and the US court because of trade in material in favour of the Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, they use the way in which the French Presidency tried to manipulate the media for the purpose of making this idea credible, the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde's journey, in a great light.
In fact, he had done nothing about it.
A diplomat telegram published in Paris on 12 August 2009 bears the title "Iran: French comments on how to deal with hostages".
François Richier, Elysée's strategic consultant, was accompanied by Patrice Paoli, Director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explained the French method to her.
They asked the Americans to do everything they could to bring back their own countrymen who would be violent in Iran.
"Power noise," they said, "articulates loud and clear and without neglect" the words "fundamental human rights", "indebted", "immediate release" in the media.
This is necessary to expose the Iranian regime, which is very sensitive to its image.
"Do this as much as possible, especially ask the Iranians not to do that."
Because "Shut up doesn't solve anything", through the discussion attempts on infallible ways, the Iranians are "masters in the alternates".
Mr Richier added that the arrest of foreigners was a "regular, Iranian tactics" of "response for political repression".
He announces that Clotilde Reiss' release from prison (which was due on 16 August, on the day she fled to the French Embassy) "is demanding payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians" (230,000 euros).
And he lets it be said that the Elysée anticipates other hostages, a phenomenon that will "strengthen" itself.
The Iranians could "in the near future arrest another of about 1,800 French citizens who live in Iran," he said.
28. August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss was released from prison 12 days ago, but remains in Iran.
An information was circulated: Iran's Majid Kakavand, whose delivery to Iran by the United States for illicit trafficking in sensitive electronic material, has been released after a judge's decision in Paris.
The American message, like many other observers, raises questions about this disturbing coincidence.
The release of Majid Khakavand is a bad news for Washington, who is pursuing the illegal Iranian networks of acquisition of the nuclear programme.
Did France buy a cow trade?
The liberation of Iran from the French?
On the occasion of a new interview with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September, François Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Elysée, as he says, was not only "sudden of the judge's decision", but also tried to rely on it.
"There has been a real exchange between the French Presidency and the French Minister of Justice" (now Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French Government cannot change the judicial decision," he explains.
Mr Richier would also like to point out that Majid Kakavand remains under "strict" supervision of the French secret service.
The Elysée consultant selects a telephone number, re-issues it, so informs the American diplomat, the Iranian "now located in the buildings led by the Iranian Embassy in Paris".
During the custody of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, Elysée does not appreciate his efforts to make "future attempts" by means of defamation and by the media, the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays a "significant" and "impressive middle role".
The Americans do not observe this activity without irony and note that manipulation bears fruit as several press articles reflect the official French version.
A telegram dated August 25, 2009 is dated to "the media flash of the French authorities".
On what basis is so much "thank you" based on Mr Assad, the Paris Message is being asked.
"Despite their statements of praise, the French authorities secretly admit that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done".
The document deals with the reasons that led the Elysée to fall into this fiction.
The intensive communication efforts "is aimed at confirming Sarkozy's policy of opening up against Syria", he analyzes.
A 2008 policy, which was then perceived "by numerous critics in France and abroad as premature and undeserved".
"Strengthening the Syrian Role" Paris tries to "Lead Syria in front of the eyes of what promise can be achieved by playing a constructive role in the region".
The aim is also to "seal violence between Syria and Iran".
The American message knows this from good source.
On August 11, François Richier confided in her: "Of course we don't know if the Syrians have done anything at all".
"But in spite of all this, we thank them."
"This should at least create confusion among the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives it in Elysée.
In a communiqué, he thanked the President of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in the release of our countrymen".
No online games for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean government will pass a law called the "Aschenbrodel", which will prohibit young people from playing after midnight online games by blocking their access, so stated government leaders.
A bill to encourage online gaming operators to deny access to these games to young people under 16 years of age after midnight will be presented to Parliament in December, painted by representatives of cultural and family ministries.
"Many children play these games all night long and thus have difficulties with learning at school and also to lead a normal life through the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary in order to ensure their health and their right to sleep," said Jo Rin, with this draft law-enforcement minister of the French press agency Agency France Presse.
The online games will then be available again from 6 a.m.
For a year, manufacturers would have been preparing for the application of the law, he specified.
The government also looks into asking the manufacturers, who gave time-limits for access to these games to write down those young people whose parents ask for them, added the responsible.
It will also provide free programs to those who wish it to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries, and the newspapers report regularly on various events related to intensive Internet use.
The country is also an unmistakable champion in global online game competitions.
In November, South Korea won over 58 other nations four gold medals in the World Cyber Games.
World Championship 2018-2022: FIFA appoints the sponsor country
In light of the suspicion of corruption, the FIFA Executive Committee appoints the world championship coach countries 2018 and 2022, a highly political choice in which the range of influence and lobbying threaten to push the technical criteria into the background.
However, one thing is certain: the 2018 edition of FIFA's royal discipline will take place in Europe, its traditional Hochburg (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, the Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will then become somewhat more exotic; the International Football Association hopes to be able to win new territories (Qatar, Australia) for itself after the 2010 premiere on the African continent, or continue to pursue its deployment in the United States or in Farnost (Japan, South Korea).
The list of persons belonging to the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch government chief, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) provides the measure of the economic and political use of a world championship.
So the machines behind the scenes threaten to stop until the last minute.
It was difficult to establish a hierarchy of candidates.
According to FIFA's assessment report, the English, Spanish and Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) files offer better arguments than their competitors.
However, these considerations will not be so important for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the election.
The Sunday Times, which was at the beginning of the revelations, with the postponement of the two members of the Executive Committee (Reynald Temari and Amos Adamu), could well have ruined the chances for their own country, the weight of the football, which could only be achieved once the World Championship, 1966.
On Monday, the BBC gave the floor again by broadcasting a documentary report, which took over three influential members of the committee, namely Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Reasons enough to make FIFA more angry and to expose the English officials who, first of all, had engaged in intensive lobbying with David Cameron during the last few weeks.
The head of government hopes for a relaunch of the strike that his predecessor, Tony Blair, had achieved in 2005 for London the organization of the 2012 Olympics.
Would this intensive use be sufficient to re-evaluate the image of England before the committee?
Nothing is less certain, because Duo España-Portugal does not miss drums with its already finished stages, its expertise (WM 82 in Spain, the Olympics 92 in Barcelona, EM 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
However, the economic and financial shadow sides of the two countries could dampen their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English and the doubts about Solvency Spain and Portugal raise the chances of Russia, which, despite its gaps in the dossier (stations, hotels, transport), has become an important outsider.
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, however, has decided to press ahead with the unwarranted use of the English press's "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote" by committee members.
"You throw them with shit, you try to compromise them," Putin said.
For 2022, the United States, strengthened by the experience of 1994, seemed to be the logical favourites.
First Economic World Power, seat of FIFA’s main sponsors, the country seems to have a long list of advantages against Japan and South Korea that have set up a very nice project separately.
However, these new candidates seem to be early for two countries that had co-organized the competitions in 2002.
Another threat: the FIFA's declared approval of the WM 2026 for China, which will result in a fall in Asian opportunities by 2022.
With Australia and Qatar, which had drawn all the registers with the expectation of futuristic stages, FIFA is pursuing its expansion towards new areas, but these two countries are more at risk than are certain.
Australia, like Japan and South Korea, could suffer from the lack of television rights (due to the shift in time) achieved by the European countries, the sensitive nervousness of the FIFA.
Second term of office: visibility
De Gaulle had really been supportive.
Mitterand had to believe he was short.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not show the slightest hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy is even less than this.
A mandate in Elysée calls for the next one.
The current Head of State will therefore be a candidate in 2012.
But the transparency is not well on the side of the mystery that holds the Presidency function.
So you have to do as if there's any doubt.
In one sense, as in the other.
In 2006, the supporters of Jacques Chiracs submitted that a third mandate should not be excluded without believing in it.
On November 15, Nicolas Sarkozy, in serious tone, assured that his decision would be "sometimes in the autumn of 2011".
The fact that he would allow the perspective of "two mandates" in Elysée in front of the UMP parliamentarians on the day of service would have spread a little feverishness.
Was that the official announcement of his candidacy?
We're missing a lot.
The President recalled that the 2008 constitutional amendment limited the number of five-year term of office to only two.
He made a statement, no announcement.
It is not the first time that he mentions the presidential election for such meetings in a humourful tone.
"You've been with me for seven and a half years, or at best," he told them in July 2009.
To a new one in May 2010: "Don't believe that I don't think about the phase after that."
His words from yesterday no longer make him a candidate than the day before, but not less.
Should they make comments, then for a double reason.
The acceleration of the race around the candidate with the PS on one side.
However, it is not the admission of the competition with Ségolène Royal, which Nicolas Sarkozy is driven to reveal itself.
On the contrary, it is his obvious candidacy in 2012, which reminds many members of the PS earlier than accepted to fight.
The bad surveys on the other side.
For the first time, voters of the rights would prefer a candidacy of François Fillon of Nicolas Sarkozy (46%) versus 44%, according to the BVA-L'Express survey).
"We have a candidate, and there is no discussion about this with the UMP," the Prime Minister responded immediately and cautiously.
"If he were to find a defeat as possible, he would not be a candidate," Jean-Pierre Raffarin said.
"He will always believe in winning," corrects Alain Juppe, who has failed with the disclosure.
Euro: the ECB is obliged to keep its purchases of state papers
The last meeting of the ECB's Central Bank last year should provide an opportunity to offer opportunities to emerge from the crisis, or at least to announce a large number of non-conventional monetary policy measures to be concluded at the end of the year.
The crisis of European State debt requires that the Central Bank in Frankfurt can no doubt bring about even the present, more than the tense situation on the European bond markets in order not to cause them to deteriorate.
Political costs would be too high.
Yesterday, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde welcomed a press conference that took place in favour of the European State budget debt solution.
She did not hesitate to say whether she felt that the Central Bank could do even more, for example by accumulating its programme for the acquisition of State bonds.
"I keep my considerations for my European trading partners (...)".
Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB, did not very much talk about his projects on the occasion of his consultation with the European Parliament's Economic and Monetary Committee in Brussels on the day before, but rather wished to point out that the programme of the purchases of state papers on the secondary market would be "initiated" and that at the meeting on Thursday we would "see how the decisions are being made".
Only certainty: the ECB will continue its leadership at 1%, the historically lowest level since May 2009.
In practice, the purchases of bonds by the Treasury were doubled from the ECB last week to around EUR 1.35 billion.
And according to the indications of some traders, they were supposed to purchase Irish and Portuguese state papers yesterday.
In total, the Eurosystem’s central banks have purchased EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
There is no doubt about the anticipation of a continuation of the purchase price among traders (see page 29).
The local authorities are no longer expecting any significant change in the course.
If the lending transactions have already disappeared from the ECB's arsenal for more than three months, the latter will still be made available in a freely available way to the unlimited reserves, over a period of one week to three months.
The public authorities are already insisting that this measure will be extended in a few months.
"I cannot imagine that the ECB will substantially change its programme".
"If not, she would take the risk of causing new tensions in the short term," says Michael Schubert, the Commerzbank's Volkswirt.
"A progressive exit planned for the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely to be expected," predicts Norbert Bräms, Volkswirt at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In the area of its intervention on the public debt market, "the ECB has maintained such a volume of purchases of bonds that bring the market to life", Norbert Bräms adds.
In view of the relevance of the exposed position of the European banks in the euro area public debt markets, the Central Bank has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It must come on the market at any price to the sellers of the missing investors and act in such a way as to prevent the initial enthusiasm for the returns paid to the weakest states," said yesterday an important bond holder.
Because if interest rates were to be used for altitude flights, countries would be even more prevented from reducing or stabilising their debt.
This is the price to protect the euro.
The Berlusconi government goes to Italy in coverage
After a week of concern for Italy, yesterday, the situation with the fall of the peaks to 10 years has been somewhat relaxed.
A return to sad silence.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister of Economic Affairs, Regional President Giulio Tremonti had described the situation as "undigitable" and had calculated it with an "unpredictable" weekend, which the relevant person immediately demented.
In any case on Tuesday, with the German interest rates, the share of 210 basic points would have reached its record, and the prices of the contracts covering the risk of competition had risen to 263 points, resulting in a certain headlessness in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi pointed out to his Council of Ministers that Spain's disparity with German interest rates is at 400 basis points.
His right hand, Gianni Letta, however, had expressed itself as "seriously concerned" with the "market turbulence" and a possible risk of ignition towards Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third eurozone economy, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that Italy is like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, Volkswirt at the Hudson Institute.
In the text, this problem is the absence of economic growth and the resulting, rapid tax revenue that threatens the state to be unable to cover its financing needs.
The latest Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
In the future, an Italian growth of 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012 is expected... although the budget presented to the Senate for the review is estimated at 1.3% or 2%.
Under these conditions, as calculated by the EU Commission, the budget deficit will still account for 4.3% of GDP next year (as opposed to 3.9% predicted by governments) and 3.5% in 2012 (as opposed to 2.7%).
Therefore, there is also a need for a new budget collection that could be used after the holidays for a sum of EUR 7 billion.
"If necessary, new savings measures must be taken," says economic analyst Olli Rehn.
Italy is currently receiving support from international institutions.
"The fundamental feasts of the Italian economy are in order and its accounts are regulated, which we have been repeating for a long time," assures Arrigo Sadun, Italian trustee of the International Monetary Fund, who is entrusted with the IMF with Italy.
"At the moment, there are no problems, either in the short term or in the long term, as in spite of Italy's high debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, A.D.R.) there is no need for less stabilization progress than in other countries," observes Pier Carlo Padoan, head of the OECD.
It remains the question of political instability.
On 14 December Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure by the Chamber of Deputies, which could have led to the election already held at the end of March.
So there is a little time for a decision on a serious crisis.
Europeans are thinking about the expansion of anti-crisis measures
Christine Lagarde had stressed it yesterday during a press conference in Paris: "I believe you have proved it on Sunday afternoon as well as in the evening: Europeans keep clear, are ready and committed to defend their currency and their currency."
Although quite relative - the deduction recorded yesterday at European State bonds' interest rates was water on government mills and the ECB.
However, from the beginning of normalization it cannot yet be the speech.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's had announced that it could lower Portugal's debt record, the most effective target disc of speculators today.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political susceptibility which is particularly dependent on banking systems," said the opinion of the GNP Paribas Exane.
In particular, "the political time is much slower than that of the markets".
The European countries, which are well aware of both this scourge and the danger it poses, are intensifying discussions to strengthen the anti-crisis measures already in place.
Informal consultations between the most directly concerned finance ministers and, in the future, with their opposites to the G20 are going well.
This is also true of the meetings of Eurogroup and Ecofin at the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
The plan sets out the fate of the unconventional measures to strengthen the eurozone countries in the fading cross of the markets (see below).
As far as the EU Stability Fund is concerned, their Executive Director, Klaus Regling, has already begun his Asia tour in Singapore on Tuesday to inform investors in Fernost about developments in the crisis in Europe.
If the objective of his visit is not expressive fundraising, he will certainly prepare the terrain for this.
The first advertising expenditure by the EU Stability Fund is scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, an official U.S. representative of the Agency Reuters had entrusted the United States with a possible increase in the fund mobilised by the additional direct commitment of the IMF.
Portugal and Spain, first of all, are seeking structural reforms, particularly in the labour market organisation.
Reforms that are to come to the rescue measures, however, will have an impact in the near future.
Lisbon and Madrid have gone a different way than Greece and Ireland have done.
Both the one and the other are to avoid having to ask for international assistance at any price before they have put in place their own budgetary corrections and have decided on the inevitable structural reforms that bring them back to their confidence.
In turn, European capital donors are concerned about the options available to speed up the normalisation process of the public bond markets.
Axel Weber, who was on his way to Paris on 24 November, had first developed the idea that if the EUR 750 billion mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to take back into its own pocket.
With regard to the European public debt market, the leaders of Barclays Capital decided that an extension of around EUR 100 billion would be sufficient, " preferable" in the form of a direct liquidity syringe.
This means that the European financial stabilisation mechanism, which currently amounts to EUR 60 billion, is available.
A council that has every chance of being carefully investigated in the European capitals.
In particular, if market conditions are concerned.
Snow and ice: 24 departments in Orange
The snow episodes continue to cause traffic difficulties, especially in the secondary networks of the British and threaten to affect various economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in the Orange alarm level due to the threatening snow and ice risk.
The regions Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne have joined the 20 departments already in the Orange alarm level; 18 since midnight and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, then later in the night.
According to Météo France, the intense snowshoes reach the north of the Gironde as well as the Charentes, it cuts easily on the et Ile-de-France.
In the departments concerned, snow tyres of 2 to 5 cm are expected, depending also on 7 to 10 cm, as well as 1 to 3 cm, up to 5 cm in the Paris region.
The regions are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the regions Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
The snows are significant enough to cause traffic barriers and affect certain economic activities, says Météo France.
In the Côtes d'Armor region, several regional roads are blocked for heavy traffic of more than 7.5 tonnes, including the Guingamp-Lanion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
The traffic situation of the secondary transport networks in Brittany is very difficult, according to transport policymakers who refused to use their own vehicle only in the event of an emergency, and the use of some TER travel buses was abolished all day.
In Picardie, school traffic was suspended for Thursday.
No specific restrictive measures have been envisaged for heavy duty on Wednesday.
The prefecture "requires drivers to be careful on the roads and to adapt their behaviour accordingly."
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) invited airlines to cancel on Thursday 25% of their flights from the Paris Roissy Airport and 10% of Orly starting flights due to the expected strong snowfalls.
The DGAB recommends that passengers contact their airlines.
Gatwick Airports in South London and Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate on the modernization of the transport economy on the Ile-de-France is in full swing, it has reached billions.
At least in the discussions.
This includes the 23 billion for the Metro Grand Paris, which is to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
In order to lead the construction of the SGP into the way, the state has called for a capital grant of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical scheme, this is the sum that the SGP would thus allow the markets to allocate part of the financial amount to their double.
Today it finally came to first calculations.
The 2010 supplementary budget, this morning under the Financial Commission of the National Assembly, contains the measures envisaged to raise the first part of these funds.
These are two types of measures: the creation of a special tax on closure and higher taxation of offices in Ile-de France.
First, Article 15 of the Bill is adopted, "for the sake of the public-law firm Société du Grand Paris".
This is referred to as "the product of this tax amounts to EUR 117 million per year".
Secondly, it is a reorganisation of the existing corporate tax system: "to modernise it in order to increase its product and respond to this increase in Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that cost?
It's a puzzle.
This sum is not specified in the text.
From the 4 billion you're far away.
"It is carried out that the tax resources will be added to the 4 billion euros of the capital allocation imposed by the State and that the Société du Grand Paris will be made progressively for the project," the explanatory statement is to be taken into account.
The SGP does not find this system offensive.
"Since the moment when revenue is booked (the two taxes, i.e. R.), you can cover the design over three years and then only create from the 4 billion," it is explained.
"This is recorded in the budget and is deducted from time to time."
The SGP is expected to start 2013 to record the 4 billion for the 2014 budget.
This measure, whose promised 4 billion will be able to be sought for a long time, is in danger of triggering a rather moving parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will take place on 7 December.
Greedy hacker and messy spy
The WikiLeaks business has a double meaning.
On one side it has emerged as an obvious scandal, a scandal that is only a scandal in the sanity of the mind, which governs the relationship between the states, the citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at international level and gives a foretaste of the future dominated by regression.
But let's move on to the line.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is to confirm the fact that every act created by a secret service (an x-biblical nation) consists exclusively of newspaper cuts.
The "extraordinary" American revelations about Berlusconi's sexual habits are nothing more than what one has been able to read over months as well as in every x-like journal (except those whose owners are Berlusconi) and the fearsome cartoonist profile Gaddafis has been offering Cabaret artists material for their sketches for a long time.
The rule that the secret files may consist only of already known news is essential to the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century.
If you go to a library dedicated to esoteric publications, you will realize that every work (about the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templer or the Rosenkreuzler) repeats exactly what has been written in previous works.
This is not only because the author does not want to publish any research (yet because he did not know where to find news about the non-existent), but because those who dedicate themselves to occultism believe nothing but what they already know and confirm what they have already learned.
This is also the success mechanism of Dan Brown.
So are the secrets.
The informant is a fraud, and a fraud (or limited mind) is also the chief of the secret service (unless he could be anything else, for example, editor at Libération), who only considers what he recognizes as true.
The top secret information about Berlusconi, which had sent the American message to the State Desert in Rome, was the same as the newsweek had published the week before.
So why was such a removal of the revelations of these files made?
On one side, they say what any educated person already knows, that the messages - at least since the end of the Second World War and since then also the heads of government can call each other or take a plane to meet for dinner - have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of some small representation tasks, have turned into spy centers.
Any viewer of detection films knows this very well, and it does not happen out of curiosity that one does so to ignore this.
However, the fact that it is repeated publicly violates the task of holiness and serves to put American diplomacy in a bad light.
Second, the idea that an x-like hacker can capture the secrets of the most powerful country in the world gives rise to a significant blow against the prestige of the state desert.
In addition, the scandal brings less victims than the "sharfists" in distress.
But we dedicate ourselves to the deep nature of what has happened.
Previously, at Orwell's time, all power could be bundled like a big brother who controlled every gesture of his underwear.
Orwell's prophecy could have been perfectly correct since then, where any movement can be controlled by telephone, any transaction done, the hotel visited, the selected motorway and so on; the citizen would become the total victim of the eye of power.
But if you look at what is happening today that even the secret encryptions of the power can no longer escape the control of a hacker, then the control stop being unilateral and becomes circular.
The power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - chosen as the root of the citizen - can experience the secrets of the power.
But how can a power no longer be able to keep its own secrets?
It is true that Georg Simmel already said that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge about the character of Berlusconis or Merkels is basically a secret free of secret, as it gives the public sphere; but in the style of WikiLeaks offensive, that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets means that they were robbed of any power.
WikiLeaks has done neither Sarkozy nor Merkel wrong, but Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this restriction that has been added to such a powerful power?
It is obvious that the states will no longer provide any information reserved in the future online - this would be the same as an extension attached to the street corner.
But it is equally obvious that it is impossible to keep confidential reports on the telephone with the current technologies.
Nothing is easier than to find out if and when a head of state is moving on a plane and one of his colleagues has contacted.
How can private and specific relationships be maintained in the future only for certain ears?
I know very well that my prediction at the moment sounds after science fiction and romantic, but I see the need to introduce myself to the government agents in a secret way, moving themselves on uncontrollable routes, carrying their messages anywhere but in mere memory, and in addition to the few written information they have received.
The information would be stored in closed sheets in a single copy: basically the spying attempt of Watergate had less success than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology has advanced today like a cancer, that is, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communication, the Internet reconstructs a telegraph with (telephonic) wire.
The video cassettes had enabled film researchers to identify a film band for bands, by blowing from back to front and blowing all the secrets of the assembly, while the (numeric) CDs today have nothing to do but jump from chapter to chapter, i.e. in macroportions.
With high-speed trains, you can travel from Rome to Milan within three hours, while this takes three and a half hours by plane, including the ride.
It is therefore not exceptional that politics and communication technology return to cars and horses.
One last observation.
In earlier times the press tried to understand what had been stolen for secrets between the messages.
At present, it is the messages that require confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France boasts its financial promises
A year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to examine the compliance with the rapidly resolved financing commitments (also referred to as "Fast Start" or early financing) implemented by developing countries.
And already the coarse French beauties have been discovered.
With the Copenhagen Treaty, developing countries have committed themselves to providing 30 billion dollars between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has promised EUR 7.2 billion over three years, France EUR 1.26 billion (i.e. EUR 420 million per year).
On the occasion of the opening of the COP16, the EU has drawn up all the registers to convince its partners of the fact of its commitment to fast-start financing: its Member States' detailed action report, press conference, major events, brochure distribution.
The operation transparency is remarkable and is valued for its real value: the developing countries and civil society like to see it when all developed countries do the same at the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it has released 2.2 billion euros in 2010, leading to the right way to meet its commitments of 7.2 billion in 2012.
But when you look into the detail, things are a little more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Treaty, this money should be "new and additional" in order to ensure that additional use has been made, without prejudice to public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and additional" means.
While the EU Commission has proposed harmonisation, certain Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the guideline that he considers best.
For example, the EU Commission has chosen itself as a benchmark for those of 2009: international funding will be maintained, and this will amount to 150 million over three years in the context of the "Fast Start" funding.
Other countries have chosen similar benchmarks, either with respect to the year or with regard to conditions at the level of public development aid.
On the contrary, France considered that the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 was "new and additional".
In other words, there are no benchmarks for the expenditure of the previous year or at the global level of public development aid.
In concrete terms, the total amount of French support for developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease) - France proposes to comply with its commitment to "new and additional" financing.
Another crucial element is the unlocking of donations and loans.
There is no rule about it yet, and each one chooses his own calculation mode.
Some, such as France, find 1 borrowed € as equivalent with 1 spent €.
Obviously this is only difficult to bear: the effort is not comparable.
If it is possible to justify the use of loans for certain profitable investments (often projects linked to emission mitigation based on the most efficient technology), it is regrettable to present the euro taken as an equivalent for a dedicated euro... In addition, only the costs of the loan for the capital beneficiary country should be counted as commitment (i.e. the equivalent of a interest rate).
But France has nothing but the following considerations: it 'respects' its obligation of EUR 420 million by borrowing 91.5% (EUR 389.8 million) and spending 8.5%) - see also the EU document to convince itself.
France is the only country in the EU to make large use of loans.
Germany requires 46% while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (including Slovakia) comply with their commitments to 100% with donations.
In other words, if the majority of the European Union spends 1€ to fulfil its obligations, France will only once give 10 cents and understand a comparable use.
Nice hokuspocus!
All in all, France operates in its fast-start financing with a double swing: to part with a further development of the action over time and to the other part with the reality of financial use.
France manages to believe that it has spent 420 million "new and additional" million in line with its promises and saves 36.1 million euros.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (though it seems that it was Bercy who had performed the arbitrations) could have a double negative effect; once EU internal (why do other Member States continue to contribute if it is enough to borrow) and then in the negotiations, as the developing countries are not completely fooled...
The chapter of early financing is only a small question at a relatively short time compared to the whole of discussions on the climate.
But it could be too much in the huge machinery of the UNICEF.
We hope this won't be the case.
In any case, it is essential to learn his lesson from this first year's early financing.
Firstly, France could announce a change in its nature of booking for 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of respect for its obligations and the balancing justice with the other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France could bring forward the debate on the subject of long-term financing (a different, decisive and currently discussed topic): the question of "recognition" or the nature of its borrowing is not raised.
France could change its position in order to be as progressive as it is in other matters.
The hope is therefore based on the new Minister of the Environment Koscisko-Morizet, who will meet in Cancun next week.
A surprising announcement about the fast start of France and its vision of "reliability" and the use of loans would naturally raise from the international base of trust which is necessary for further discussions.
Alert - Pesticide taken by children
A 10-year-old child takes 81 different chemicals over the day, such a study published this Wednesday by the Association of Generations of Futures (formerly movement to protect the rights and respect of future generations).
The association, which explains that its results "in view of the small number of samples analysed do not show any statistically significant value, but illustrate the nature of the problems dealt with", had usually bought a meal in the supermarkets in Oise and Paris between July and September, within four, from an approximately ten-year-old child to the meals consumed plus a meal in the supermarkets.
These typical meals - including the official recommendations of five fresh fruit and fruit parts, three dairy products and 1.5 litres of water per day - have also been investigated as well as laboratory nasseries in the search for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The counter balance is low: 81 chemical substances, including 42 classified as possibly or likely carcinogenic and five as safe carcional classified, as well as 37 substances with endocrine disruptive factor, according to studies from several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Even if the legal limits for each chemical, individually absorbed substance are not exceeded in the approximate overall case, this survey is very well taken into account that the reality that the consumer may be exposed to carcinogenic substances or substances with endocrine disrupting factor is of concern," notes the Association.
Already at breakfast alone contains the butter and the tea with milk already more than ten of the potentially carcinogenic residues and three safe as carcinogens, as well as more than twenty residues that may affect the hormone system.
The apple imported from Brazil, as an intermediate meal for the study, shows traces of six chemical substances, including a fungicide prohibited in France.
The same applies to the green beans from Kenya, which are included in lunch, where the study has found traces of a strictly prohibited insecticide in the EU.
In addition, the hacksteak, the tuna fish from the bush, even the baguette and the rubber of pesticides and other chemicals were bitten.
In the conduction water, the analyses revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
At dinner, the salmon steak was the most "richest" found with 34 chemical residues, and even the plastic lighter used to heat the meal in the microwave was not unloaded.
The final risk of this "damaged cocktails" for consumers is "probably underestimated", says the study.
The Alliance Europe Ecology-Les Verts (EE-LV) has proposed "in view of the urgency of the situation" to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop the "increasing of civilization diseases".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) identified the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables, which are consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
