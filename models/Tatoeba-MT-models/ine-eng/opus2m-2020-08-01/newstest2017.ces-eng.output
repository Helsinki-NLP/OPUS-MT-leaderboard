Eighty-one-year-old chef found dead in a store in San Francisco
Twenty-eight years old chef who recently moved to San Francisco this week was the stairs of local trade.
But the victim’s brother says he doesn’t think he’d want to hurt him, and he adds, “He finally started to give. ”
The body found in Westfield Mall was identified on Wednesday morning as an 18-year-old resident of San Francisco Frank Galicia, the office of a doctor.
The San Francisco Police Department reported that it is a violent death and investigation.
The victim's brother Louis Galicia for the ABC WHO station in San Francisco said that Frank, who was a former rowing chef in Boston, got his dream job as a chef at the Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
Sons & Daughters said his death was "shocked and destroyed".
"We have a small team that works as a close family. We will miss it very much," the speaker said.
In this difficult time, our thoughts and concerns belong to Frank's family and friends.
Louis Galicia said that Frank had first slept in the apartments, but that recently “he had finally started to give. ”
"He found an apartment, went with a girl," Louis Galicia told the KGO.
Louis Galicia said he doesn't think anyone would want to hurt his younger brother.
He had a kind soul and a big heart.
When he wanted to join his family, he always cooked our food, made us dinner," Louis Galicia said.
He never wanted to take part in any fights.
He was the brother who took things the way they were.
"Even if everything else in the world was wrong, he was an unbreakable diamond that glowed every day," he said.

Czech roads have invested more than 31 billion vehicles to modernise.
They have air conditioning and new toilets.
In the last six years, public transport has invested more than 31 billion crowns to modernise vehicles.
A third of the cars are currently equipped with air conditioning, and almost half of the trains have a new system of closed toilets.
However, parts of modernisation in individual years with the exception of 2012 are gradually decreasing.
In the last six years, Czech roads have invested more than 31 billion crowns to modernise vehicles.
A third of the vehicles are currently equipped with air conditioning, almost half of the trains have a new system of closed toilets.
The money generated was shown to reduce the average age by two years in locomotives and separate units and by six years in classic cars.
The greater share of the investment gave the transporter to regional transport, where approximately 60 per cent of the said money was directed, and 40 per cent of the company was investing in the renewal of the vehicles for remote transport.
Average old locomotives and units are now 19 years old.
However, modernized older vehicles are counted as completely new in this indicator.
If the modernisation of the vehicles were not calculated, the average age of movement of the ČD vehicles would be increased in ten years.
Some older ones are on average a personal wagon whose average age at the time of modernization is 23 years.
If only the age from the date of production was taken into account, the average age of these vehicles would be 33.4 years.
However, classic combinations made up of wagons and locomotives have gradually disappeared in recent years from Czech and world railways and are replaced by motor or electric units.
Between 2011 and 2015 the locomotive was killed from 280 to 223 pieces, likewise the number of classic cars from 2716 in 2011 to 2132 in the middle of this year.
In particular, the carrier was relieved of old vehicles equipped with leather seats and doors without the possibility of locking the opening during the ride.
From January to July, the carrier let 110 of these vehicles crash.
For example, 50 cars can be purchased for speed up to 200 kilometres per hour, which the carrier is planning to place on the international line Prague - Bratislava - Budapest, or a framework contract for the purchase of electric units for foreign highways.
The contract includes up to 30 units of motor and 20 units of electric units.
The authorities know about illegal advertising for a quarter of a year. They can't get rid of it.
We're totally powerless, they admit.
Already a quarter of a year online edition of Aktuální.cz is following the story of billboards in southern Czech Republic, which now attracts motorists to visit Lebanon, where there is not only a touristic walk in the crowns of trees, but also an Olympic park.
Road managers know they're standing there, but they say they can't do anything about it.
There's a lot of advertising like this all over the country, maybe thousands.
According to officials, there is a law on guilt, which makes it impossible to remove illegal mobile billboards immediately.
The need is a complicated red tape.
In the meantime, the company will change its name and the office will be brief.
Or it's enough advertising to move around a few meters and the official process has to start again.
The Directorate of Roads and Roads four years ago admitted: at the main knowledge from the Czech Budějovic in Lipno stands on our land at the public road billboard in black.
Not for three months, however, the officials failed to release the unauthorized portable structures with a large advertising poster.
It's like nobody's mind that they're standing right next to the vehicle, in a 50-foot safety belt where nothing can happen for safety.
Road managers say they can't handle billboards because of a law of breach.
He can be loaded and taken away.
"That's not all we can afford," says the spokesperson of the Directorate of Roads and Roads Nina Ledvinová and refers to a complex bureaucratic wheel that the removal of billboards must take place under the law.
The case of this particular billboard, whose fate began online journal Aktuální.cz watch in detail in spring, but it is not unique and indicates a general problem that cannot be made up and the authorities can deal effectively and quickly.
Only in the south of the Czech Republic did she count dozens of similar mobile advertisements placed against the rules right next to or near her car.
So are other countries.
"We have trouble getting the companies to remove the ruminants," confirmed the head of the Transport Committee of the Czech Republic Regional Office Jiří Klas, whose colleagues share similar stories.
According to the Class, there's a faulty law binding officials.
First of all, the complex owner of the billboard has to contact to get the advertising off.
But the bosses are often inconspicuous or they know the fiction that has already been described in the past when the problem began to be more concerned: enough mobile stand with advertising to move about a few meters and the officials can call for the removal of a black advertisement to be thrown into the trash.
That's because the office has to determine exactly where the illegal billboard is.
"If someone moves it and the coordinator suddenly disagrees, it looks like a new device and we have to call the owners again," explains Jiří Klasa.
The new law won't help.
He could have brought about a new law that would ban billboards at the motorways from September next year and restrict them also at the I. Class Roads.
Critics point out that the rules for the suppression of illegal and easily transferable advertising will remain the same as they have been.
And he won't let the authorities get away with it.
Companies can continue to make tens of hundreds of millions of crowns each year in illegal areas and no one can afford them.
For example, the billboard on July belongs to Commerz Billboard.
Officials know it well: the Czech Buddhist magistrate currently conducts three administrative procedures for the closely established billboards.
The firm is threatened with three-sixty fines in every case.
These are more advertisements that have been placed without permission in Class I road protection zone.
The management has not yet been completed, says Jaroslav Mráz, Head of Transport Committee of the Czech Republic Magistrate.
The advertising that is currently concerned, although it is not yet listed among these cases, will soon be available to them.
According to RSD spokesperson Nina Ledvin’s company did not respond to repeated written calls for removal, and this will result in a regional table and then probably to the magistrates.
Commerz Billboard is one of those suspicious companies that can't be contacted.
She doesn't pick up the mail and the official seat on Zižkova was cancelled more than six years ago.
It's not even clear who's behind it.
In the past, the company's mail went to South Korea's businessman, Anton Fischer, who made a sharp argument with the head of the Czech representative Hyundai.
Fischer, whose company Euro Billboard rents and offers its premises from Comerz Billboard to the auctioneers, has refused any connection in the past.
However, this spring, when the RSD began to encourage Aktuální.cz to be interested in advertising on July, Fischer let state officials send a letter for the secret company Commerz Billboard to his pension, where the new company allegedly lives.
Even from this address, however, no one has contacted road managers to date.
An empty fight.
Similar silence or opaque changes in seats are not uncommon.
One company we gradually fined two million crowns a few years ago.
But she changed her name and ICHO and there was nothing to do.
The executor's case returned, the commercials continued, maybe elsewhere.
We are quite powerless against similar companies and their business practices.
It's like a fight with windmills, admitting under the condition of keeping anonymity one of the officers.
No one's going to solve the new law in this regard.
Currently, several Members have spoken to the problem.
But they haven't developed any activity yet.
On the contrary, Members who wanted to extend the deadline for maintaining billboards in the main Czech communications appeared.
The government has rejected it.
Billboards are not only for the state, but also for regional and general policy very sensitive and somewhat schizophrenic.
On the one hand, they know about social demand after their limitations, on the other hand, they themselves need them for advertising in pre-election campaigns.
I don't stop the relatively introduced idea that if something doesn't work, then we need to change the laws.
This year, farmers grow fewer crops, but more tails and makos, estimate statistics.
The Czech Statistical Office estimates that the harvest of cereals this year will be 6,7 per cent lower than last year.
However, this year's interest exceeds the average in the last five and ten years.
On the other hand, the drop of the tail (by 3.9 per cent) and the maquerade (2.5 per cent) will be higher.
The crop harvest will be 6.7 percent lower this year than last year.
Farmers raise 7.2 million tons of grain.
This results from the estimate published by the Czech Statistical Office by July 15th.
The initial estimate of a month ago was more pessimistic and assumed a ten - year reduction against yesterday.
Last year's harvest of cereals was over-average.
This year's interest exceeds the average in the last five and ten years.
On the contrary, this year there's going to be a climber of rope and bait.
Herbs grow by 3.9 percent more than a year ago when they received 1,256 million tonnes.
This year's interest may be 2.5 percent higher than last year's.
The expected decrease in the production of cereals is caused by a reduction in the yield of the hectare by 3,7 per cent to 5,71 tonnes per hectare, and by a reduction in the area of sowing.
This year, farmers had three percent fewer fields.
The winter wheat, which is the most important cereal for the Czech Republic, is estimated to grow by 3.3 percent less this year.
The farmers sent her to more fields.
However, a lower hectare yield will be signed at a drop of 6.04 tonnes.
The fifth reduction in statistics is expected in the case of barley barley, which is most commonly used for the production of beer.
A reduction in rainfall is due to a reduction of 15.2 per cent, but also a lower yield per hectare.
On the contrary, winter barley is produced by 6.3 percent more.
You'll also grow the wheat harvest.
The nature of the rape statistics is estimated at 1,305 million tons, which is against last year more.
The light areas increased by 7.3 per cent.
Hectaric yield will be 3.2 percent lower than last year.
This year's crop rate exceeds the ten-year average by 13.3 per cent, while the satin is on the surface by a third of the size more than ten years ago.
In the last four years, he's also got a machete field.
This year he was sent to 35,543 hectares by farmers.
By 2008, when the pop was grown in the Czech Republic on record 70,000 hectares, there is a half-field.
Thanks to the expansion of the grey areas, this year's call will make the mother richer.
It's going to go against last year by 2.5 percent to 27 423 tons.
Hectaric yield, but it'll be 6.1 percent lower.
The breaking cops accused two men of assaulting a knife and a machete, and the court sent him to jail.
The police accused two attackers who attacked a man in downtown Olomouc on Tuesday with a knife and a machete.
"Although the attacker was trying to escape, he was injured and severely injured, which he requested treatment in the hospital and other treatments," said police spokesman Marie Šrbáková.
Both apparent offenders were detained immediately after the attack.
The plaintiff filed a proposal for their arrest and the court upheld him on Friday.
Both men are threatened with three to ten years in prison.
Police officers accused two detainees of assaulting a man in downtown Olomouce with a knife and a machete.
The attackers caused him a stabbing and cutting wound, and the man ended up in the hospital.
The attack was preceded by an incident between the two groups of people who took place on Tuesday in the middle of the afternoon on the Freedom class, the police reported.
Pachatels ended up in custody, informing police spokesperson Marie Šrbáková.
A massive surge between the two families took place in the garden area in front of the Tratoria bar near the center of Olomouca.
After an aggressive verbal conflict, two attackers were attacked by a 50 - year - old man with a knife and a machete.
Although the man who was attacked tried to escape, he was injured and severely injured, which he requested treatment in the hospital and other treatments, the police spokesperson said.
When the raid that sparked a great deal of attention in the city center and caused several police guards and police officers to come to the scene, it was a family dispute.
The criminals of a 40-year-old man from Slovakia and a 70-year-old man from Olomouc accused him of trying to seriously harm health and health.
The plaintiff filed a motion for a court ordering them to be arrested, and on Friday, the court dismissed him, added the speaker.
The machete was used in the center of Olomouce in a collective battle also five years ago, it happened only a few decades later, before Varna's discotheque in Riegrov Street.
At that time, the police indicated that a group of about ten foreigners with weapons attacked the company’s guests who were standing before the entrance.
According to the police, they had knives, bullets and cats in their hands.
The court then punished two attacking foreigners with conditional punishment.
The abandoned and empty houses in the centre of Prague.
You'll be surprised, maybe you walk around them every day.
One of the most crippling examples of unused and empty houses is the extensive construction of the former IPB headquarters in the centre of Senavia.
That was supposed to work as a hotel a long time ago.
But it's still nothing.
That you need to build new and new apartments and offices in the metropolis?
And what about using existing, often architecturally valuable and protected?
Directly in the centre of Prague in the immediate vicinity of Václav Square are several kitchen houses which, despite their location, size and often memory protection, are empty and empty.
The property in the center was selected using the project Prazdnédomy.cz, which maps the length of the empty property in the territory of the Czech Republic.
Houses are usually victims of financial problems of their owners, of intransiguous relations between companies or belong to a state that does not know or wants to get rid of them.
There are more empty houses in the Czech Republic than homeless people.
Let the owners pay a special tax for them, he wants the initiative

Clinton's husband made $10.6 million last year.
Trump refuses to publish his tax confession.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, Bill Clinton, made $10.6 million last year.
More than a million dollars were devoted to Clinton for charity.
Most of Clinton's revenue -- over six million dollars -- is for their statements.
Trump refuses to publish his tax confession.
The candidate of the American Democrats to the President's Office Hillary Clinton published their tax returns on Friday, increasing the pressure on his Republican rival Donald Trump to do the same.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, Bill Clinton, made $10.6 million last year, announced the AP agency.
Most of Clinton's revenues - over six million dollars - are due to their manifestations, mainly from the period before April 2015, when Clinton launched his campaign before the elections.
The tax report showed that Clinton’s husband was taxed at 34.2 per cent last year and then taxed at the state and local level at 9 per cent.
So they paid 43.2 percent of their income tax.
But Trump has a similar problem, so far he hasn't decided to publish the tax confession.
It's a possibility that Donald Trump doesn't pay any taxes at all, wrote Clinton on Twitter a few minutes after his confession.
Clinton repeatedly returns to the secret around Trump's income, among other things, to raise doubts as to whether her opponent is really as rich as he claims, the AP agency said.
The troupe's assets are estimated at billions of dollars.
The lower benefit would damage the reputation of the Republican candidate as a successful business operator.
Senator Tim Caine, who has been running for the post of vice president in tandem with the former lady, today has published a report on his tax cuts in the last ten years.
Together with his wife, Anne Holton, they gave 7.5 percent of their income to charity and 25.6 percent of their income was spent on taxes last year.
In Nigeria again, the revolution broke out.
The Islamists of Boko Haram defended the consistent expectation and killed the doctors.
In Nigeria, cases of child abuse reappeared.
In the northeastern part of the country, the government expressed extraordinary expectations because there were two children infected with this disease.
Vaccines were transported there by helicopters.
In the occupied area, Islamic terrorists from Boko Haram, who defended expectations and even killed doctors.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there was an undetected virus.
In the northeastern Nigeria, there is an extraordinary expectation of children against the rebel because there are two children who have been infected with this disease.
In Africa the revolution was last diagnosed two years ago in Somalia.
The Nigerian government announced that in the state of Borno there would be millions of children and four million more in the surrounding states.
Nigerian military helicopters on Friday, according to the AP agency, quickly transported vaccines against children's return to the affected northeastern part of the country where Islamist terrorists from Boko Haram act.
The World Health Organization (WHO) stated that the virus has been undetected for many years.
Extremists from Boko Haram in the past defended expectations and even killed doctors.
Their attacks also made it impossible for doctors to get into areas where children were found with the opposite.
Both injured battalions came with refugees from the Nigerian part of the newly liberated Boko Haram.
The director of the WHO section responsible for the expulsion of the rebel Michel Zaffran told BBC that the expectation in Nigeria will begin next week.
In the state of Borno, the Islamic radical group Boko Haram has long been active.
The area was made available to international organizations and governments until the beginning of this year, when Boko Haram managed to weaken in this part of the country in a fundamental way.
The Nigerian Minister of Health Isaac Adewole admitted that the new cases of rebellion were a major disappointment for the country, because Nigeria wanted to declare next year that it had been wiped out.
WHO noted that it is possible that although the disease has not occurred for two years, it has spread among children.
Now children under five years of age will be slaughtered.
In 2012, half of all cases of revolution in the world were in Nigeria.
While it was still in 125 countries in 1988, it is now only in three areas - Afghanistan and Pakistan and in northern Nigeria.
The Pope met with former prostitutes in Rome.
He listened to the stories of the fallen women.
Pope František met with twenty former prostitutes who, thanks to the police, escaped the gang of passports.
The Pope listened to their difficult life stories and called them to look to the future with confidence.
František wanted to make this meeting a point of dealing with people and call for a stronger fight against them.
Pope František met with twenty former prostitutes in Rome who had been released by the police from the power of a gang of passports.
The head of the Catholic Church listened for more than an hour to the waved stories of fallen women and then urged them to look to the future with confidence, the Vatican spokesman said.
Among the former prostitutes that František visited were six women from Romania, four from Albania, seven from Nigeria and one from Tunisia, Italy and Ukraine.
Their average age is about 30.
All were exposed to severe physical violence during forced prostitution, according to the Vatican.
At the visit, František wanted to pay attention to human trafficking and to call for a stronger fight against it, he mentioned the pope’s spokesman.
František often points to people's convictions at the edge of society.
For example, on Thursday, he lunched with Syrian refugees who arrived in the Vatican this year in April and June thanks to his personal invitation.
France's gonna hit a bunch of jihadists.
Without the help of Muslims, it won't work.
The French have a struggle against radical Islam to help Muslims themselves.
In addition, the government of Prime Minister Manuel Valles is about to make fundamental changes in the functioning of mixtures and spiritual education.
Since last December, we have closed 20 measles and prayer.
And they'll follow up, the Minister has announced inside.
More than a hundred jihadists are operating in the country.
"If Muslims do not help the state in the fight against those who violate public freedom, it will be even harder for France to guarantee this recognition of freedom," said Prime Minister Manuel Valls.
In particular, it is our intention to ensure that only property educated in France is shown in the mixture and prayer.
At the same time, he wants to stop financing mixtures from abroad.
Currently, about 20 percent of the money comes from foreigners to build new mixtures, most from Morocco, Algeria and the Persian Gulf.
And that's why they get teachers who can spread radicalism in France.
"Our country must show that Islam is compatible with democracy," the Prime Minister added.
The key to achieving these goals will be the new French Islamic Foundation.
It should act as a bridge between a secular state and a Muslim minority.
No more foreign money.
In the country, the French Foundation for Islam, which was established by then Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin in 2005.
By then, the foundation had contributed to the review of the financial flows between the mixtures and the countries that are financing their construction.
But the institutions soon came to grips with internal disputes and rivalry.
"It's a total failure," Valls said recently.
On the French political scene, after the attack on Charlie Hebdo magazine in January 2015, the debate on a new institution that is being replaced by a non-functional foundation was sparked.
All have accelerated further terrorist attacks in France, which have been carried out on behalf of the Islamic State by radicalised Islamists.
French Minister of Interior Bernard Cazeneuve recently heard that a new hope would arise in October.
It will have two main tasks - to ensure the financing of mixtures from domestic sources and also to monitor assets.
Meanwhile, it is not clear where it will take money not only to build new mixtures but also different educational centers.
But consider a few suggestions.
One of them is a special fee or a food halal tax.
In practice, the sellers would pay for food, which is for certification.
Some of this money would then travel right into the money of the Foundation.
A contribution of between 10 and 20 euros (270 and 540 kroner) could then be paid by French passengers who go to Mecca.
Every year they go there on a traditional road to Saudi Arabia about 30,000.
And that's not all.
According to the Prime Minister, only teachers who have gone through special education programmes at French universities should be affected in the future.
That should ensure that the preaching is in line with democracy.
We'll close the radical mixtures.
At the same time, the French government is against radicals.
And they'll follow, the Minister has announced recently.
In France there is no place for those who report hatred in the mixture and do not respect certain principles of our country, such as equality between women and men.
In the country, it is estimated that there are about 2,500 mixtures and prayer.
It is estimated that about 120 of them are influenced by radical Islam.
Since 2012, the authorities have made up about 80 property, and several decades later they consider it.
Not all think that the government's steps can significantly affect radicalism.
Those who want to radicalize will do the same.
There is no such thing in the mixture, young people are radicalizing on the Internet, says Severine Labatová, an expert from the National Centre for Scientific Research.
The dragon Kelemen lost the first round of the sprint with the baug star.
On the way to the osmiffinal, the Czech road cyclist must kill in the repairs.
Dear cyclist Pavel Kelemen in the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, following the process of sprint qualification among the best eighteen, lost in the 1st round a match with the French grandiose Gregory Baugem, a silver defender from previous games in London.
The procedure for the osmiffinal must be killed in correct driving.
At the beginning of the royal discipline on the road, 27 riders were built and the best Czech runner of the day was assigned the fourteenth best time.
The two-wheeler with the summer start arrived in 9,969 seconds.
In the main parting phase, he was expected to be qualified by the fifth Baugé, who already has bronze in the team sprint from Rio.
Kelemen finally reached out to experienced French, but he looked at the procedure.
With a great performance, the gold defender Jason Kenny shined.

Young Doctors Press: They Want a Fresh Wind in the Field
Representatives of young doctors met to approve new steps in their dispute about a new contract.
The Board of Young Doctors (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) must request the entire board to support other sectoral actions from the beginning of September.
JDC says the ministers failed to resolve the contractual issues.
Young doctors and medical students voted out the rejection of the contract agreed with BMA in July.
58% of its members who took part in the elections were rejected.
In a letter to members published on Thursday night on Twitter, President JDC Ellen McCourt pointed out that the government remained "still calm" on the issues leading to the rejection of the contract.
She said: “In this light, the executive authority of JDC by voting decided to reject the proposed new contract completely and request a new formal agreement on all matters.”
In response to the government's silence, the JDC's Executive Board today formally requested a special meeting of the BMA Council in order to approve the current programme of endangered sectoral actions from the beginning of September.
This year, the dispute led the young doctor to report to six meetings, including the first general meetings in the history of NHS.
The leader of young doctors in BMA, Dr. Johann Malavan, resigned after the decision to reject the agreed terms of the contract recommended by BMA.
To BMA members at the meetings before the vote, 54 000 young doctors and medical students said the agreement was good and should be adopted.
After the vote, the Minister of Health said that the contract would be a burden for doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: Union of "inseparable"?
It was the gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give up their hands and announce the formal termination of eight months of long-term verbal war and economic sanctions.
But while Vladimir Putin welcomed the Turkish side to the palace palace hall in Petrograd, I had the impression that Ankara wanted more after this reconciliation.
It's been hand-in-hand, yeah.
But Putin didn't laugh, and he could hardly see the heat, even according to his measured standards.
On the contrary, Recep Tayyip Erdogan repeatedly spoke about his "dear friend" Mr Putin - five times as one of the reports states.
I didn't count it.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to its pre-crisis level, but would be even better.
The next day one of the local newspapers wrote that Erdogan was acting like nothing bad ever happened.
I think his enthusiasm reflected exactly the opposite.
But the constant cold that radiated from Putin showed that the Russian leader didn't forget anything.
The real cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening speech: Shooting a Russian warplane Turkish on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction back then was grumpy.
Putin was throwing wounds around himself, and Ankara accused him of killing Moscow with a knife in his back.
The worst was that it came from a supposed friend.
Rebuilding real trust will be difficult, perhaps even impossible.
The Russian public opinion has also changed since December.
The state-controlled media carried out a massive campaign against Ankara a month later.
Suddenly it seemed as if the Turks could do anything.
More serious was the accusation from the top state officials that Erdogan's own family benefited from the illegal oil trade in parts of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
That's the one who strongly denied it.
But there was an official message in Petrograd that it was time to move on.
The end of this meeting was only because Putin had been apologised to President Erdogan.
Russia could have declared some victory as well.
The benefits of the declaration are fairly clear for Ankara.
First of all, Erdogan was almost out of power last month during an unsuccessful spider and therefore needed all his friends.
The repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey have apparently also upset him.
There is also an economic motive.
Russian sanctions have had a strong impact - especially the cancellation of charter flights, which transports several million Russian tourists on the Turkish coast every year.
This figure has fallen by almost 90 %.
As far as Russia is concerned, tour operators and charter companies here will breathe when the flights are restored.
They make a Mediterranean travel trip at the end of the season.
Even this week, state television promised cheaper fruit and vegetables when the import of agricultural commodities from Turkey is re-authorised.
"Tourists there, paradise back here," as the news reported in the Vedemos newspaper.
The visit, however, had another political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West for what it considers to be a chabo reaction to a coup attempt.
In addition, the long-lasting impunity of long-term EU accession talks and Putin's accession - which is pushing for cooling to use and break Turkey's route to the West.
The Russian leader certainly won the bonus points when Ankara asked her for help from the elected authorities after the attempt on the spider.
You must understand that for Moscow, which is deeply rooted in fear of changing the regime, it is given.
So the summits in this pumped, primordial palace of Russia and Turkey were able to tell me what one analyst described me as "a union of incongruables": how they connect the forces of two countries that feel rejected and used in the West.
However, despite public reconciliation, there are fundamental differences between these two countries.
The first is Syria, where Moscow recently became a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey stand on opposite sides.
It could be said that after almost three-hour preliminary talks, both presidents at the press conference indicated that they had not even mentioned this issue.
The Turkish President deliberately answered the question of differences between them, while Putin decided to raise these differences.
There is no clear agreement on the basis of which both States could find a common language on the issue of Syria.
But after months of open hostility - and given the risk of a complete disaster when a member of NATO shot a Russian warplane - it is certainly better that both leaders speak again together.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears for customers outside Scotland
According to the Executive Director of the Bank, the RBS mark is to be pressed into the role of the back office.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be lost for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was connected to the bank's global ambitions.
She got rid of them when she almost disappeared eight years ago and had to be bought out of debt.
At that time, the strategic labels were used by RBS to protect other consumer finance brands.
There were millions of pounds spent on sponsoring international sports, from the six Nations football championship after the Winbled Andy Marray champion.
Now, however, it was decided that it would be better to make more appearances for more national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used by Scottish customers, but will not run new shops.
All references to RBS in England and Wales, with the exception of central and stock coding on the stock exchange, will be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already being used for customers in the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for private banking, which will get more ahead - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
During his trip to the customers and employees at the Inverness-shire, McEwan responded to questions from Ross McEwan.
The BBC Skotsko Station said: "The RBS badge will cease to be our investor brand and brand for which our employees are working, because now we become much more a brand bank."
Because the bank itself became a global brand, it became a global brand and RBS.
Now I'm saying we don't have global aspirations anymore, we have domestic-oriented efforts.
Each of these marks will mean something completely different in their own communities and our workers will work under these marks.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue in its sponsorship of the Six Nations Championship, prepared a profile of individual sports sponsorship marks.
"It has been a good time for us to move to a brand bank, because the basic question (which we are asking) is how to focus on becoming a better bank for customers?" said the Executive Director.
Three years ago, it would be very cynical if we said we'd become a great bank for customers, and they introduced the brands.
But along with how we focused on customer needs, not our own, I think there's a lot of change.
We can remember these marks again, I think it's time.
Frankie Dettori in Newmarket on the horse Predilection led to the goal of 3000th winner
Dettori shakes champagne after his double victory in Newmarket brings him 3,000 wins
Joe Frankie Dettori won the 3,000th victory in Britain on Friday in Newmarket.
This was achieved by his second victory of the evening on his local track - on the horse Predilection which John Gosden is training.
Fifty-five years of Italy is the sixth jockey, which has achieved such a result in egalitarian achievement.
His predecessors are Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddy and Willie Carson.
A three-fold champion named Dettori, who had won the Ghayyar horse, said, "It's special."
I'm very touched because my family is here, too.
I'm so glad it happened in Newmarket because I was stuck here 30 years ago.
It's not a huge event, it's not a Royal Ascot - it's Friday night on earth with 20,000 people.
I'm relieved, and I'm very grateful.
Dettori collects congratulations when he brings Predilection after victory
Two jockeys of this mill were achieved in obstacles - Richard Johnson's jockey champion and 20 consecutive champion at Sir Anthony McCoy, who, during his career, scored more than 4,300 winners.
Lester Piggott, nine-time winner Derby, 4,493 winners in the career
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of modern times, and it's no surprise that he's reached a mill that only a few riders have reached before him.
He's stylish and strong, but it's just his tactical fistron that distinguishes him from the other drivers in the stable.
He is a fantastic ambassador of knowledge, his enthusiasm and charisma attracted fans to this sport for years.
A few weeks ago, I told Frankie in Epsom that if he didn't just go on weekends and big hits, he'd already have 6,000 winners!
But the truth is that Frankie's been driving a winner in Great Britain for most of his 30-year career, and that's really something.
He's a living character, which is good for the British team sport, but more importantly, he's an incredible hockey player.
Frankie Dettori celebrated his success with his famous summer surprise
From the summer finals after the summer sepsis - Frankie Dettori was a messenger of British equalisation for two decades.
It was like a ride on a mountain road.
Unprecedented number of major race winners, including his famous "great sevens" in Ascot. But he also survived the plane crash and had a ban on the launch of drugs.
Three years ago, he was the first to step back after 6 months' ban, but proved incredible internal strength and returned in the best form to all doubters.
And maybe it won't last - Dettori already said he'd like to continue in the race for at least 50 years.
Russian President Putin missed the head of the president's office Sergei Ivanova
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly missed Sergei Ivanov on Friday from the post of head of the president's office.
Ivanov was one of Putin's closest associates after many years.
Thirty years old Ivanov was appointed a special representative for the environment and transport.
The Kremlin statement states that Putin “rescued Ivanova from his service by the head of the Russian Presidential Office”, but no reason was given.
We will take over Anton Vajno, who has been Ivanov's representative since 2012.
Forty-four years ago, Vayna was a diplomat.
He was born in the capital of Estonia Tallinn in 1972, promoted at the prestigious State Institute for International Relations in Moscow (MGIMO) and worked at the Embassy in Tokyo.
On the website (in Russian) it is stated that he later served as the head of the presidential protocol and the president's office.
When appointing Putin, he said, "Thank you for your trust."
I believe that the most important role of the administration is to support your head of state activities in terms of the draft laws and control of the extent to which your guidelines are respected.
Putin stated on Friday that Ivanov had asked her to be released from the post and recommended that he replace her just outside.
Convinced of smiles?
This step was completely mysticizing Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov was one of the closest collaborators of Vladimir Putin for a long time and worked for the KGB as well as Putin.
As the head of the president's office, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, who had broadcast state television, both men declared that they were leaving the office of the head of the president's office at their own request.
But the smiles in the cameras convinced only a few people - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So this is the result of some fight for power?
No one knows yet.
But the official statement that a man who was once considered a potential president wishes to lead Russia's environmental policy suddenly met with great mistrust.
On the Kremlin pages are quoted the comments addressed to Putin, in which Ivanov states: “It is true that in 2012 I asked you to give me this very difficult post, even a problematic post, believing in four years.
I seem to have been the head of the president's office for four years and eight months.
Ivanov was caught in December 2011.
He had previously held office as Vice-President of the Government and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and previously, like Putin, worked for the State Security Committee (KGB).
At the end of the 1990s, when Putin led the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed its representative.
When Putin came into power, Ivanov was one of his five closest associates.
It even speculated that Ivanov could become a successor to Putin in front of the state after his second election period because the third period would be anti-legislative for Putin.
But this post was taken over by another close co-worker of Putin Dmitrij Medvedev.
Putin became a prime minister about three and a half years later before his return to the presidential office.
Thomas Gibson, the star of the serial of the thought of a criminal, was released after the director struck
Gibson got involved in the physical exchange of views on the scene last month in Los Angeles.
The television stations ABC and CBS, which produce the series, have been notified in a joint declaration of release.
Gibson, who played special agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized on Thursday before announcing his release.
There have been creative differences on stage and disagreements.
I'm sorry it happened," he said in a statement.
According to the ABC and CBS television stations, details of how Gibson's character disappears from the series that follows the story of the FBI team's agents, a bit later.
The four-40-year-old actor, who celebrated the lead role in Dharma and Greg's sitcom, has been in the series since the first series in 2005.
"I love the thought of criminals and have given them hearts and souls over the past twelve years," Gibson said in his statement he issued on Friday.
I was hoping I'd be in him till the end, but it won't be possible right now.
I would still like to express my thanks to the authors, the producers, the actors, our amazing team and, above all, to the great fans in which this show could be hoped for.
The return of the series to the twelfth series is expected on September 28.
In the city of Banff secretly landed in the fish garden
A man from Banff town asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain is of the opinion that 75 pieces of fish can be the sand east that left the water.
Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, published a short film of his discovery on Periscope's channel in the belief that someone could help him explain how about 5 centimeters of fish in his garden.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connects to Fife
Project for 1.35 billion pounds is to be completed by May 2017
Engineers connected the north and Queensferry Crossing and viaduct - the bridge is now connecting to Fife.
This is the first of the four closures between the "big fans", which are now almost completed around each of the three pillars of the bridge.
The part of the bridge from Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It contains 10,000 tons of iron and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 wires.
The EUR 1.35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017.
Economic Secretary Keith Brown visited the building today and was among the first to come from the fortress on the bridge.
He said: “This is the historic moment and the symbolic moment of Queensferry Crossing.
On this project, we all testify to how construction engineers actually used more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel to construct this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive dimensions and weight of the bridge, the closure between the viaduct and the width of the bridge was a delicate operation that required extraordinary accuracy.
In its position, there is now a total of more than 79 % of the total surface of the bridge, concrete for the last part of the platform is now in Rosyth, so the entire area is ready to lift to the bridge.
Michael Martin, project manager for Fort Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: “The first closure of each bridge is always an important milestone.
On this wonderful project, this conclusion represents the tip of the earthly building.
After installing the last part of the road platform and its connection to the expanding North Tower platform, we had to close the last gap on the north side - towards the ground.
We did this by extending the north approaching viaduct 700 millimetres south.
This was massive and at the same time very delicate.
Massive because the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs about 6,000 tonnes and it was necessary to pull it by a step of about 3 %.
It's delicate because the tolerance with which the team worked was very small - just a few millimeters each way.
It all worked out very well.
Saved in Moelfre Bay: Three men are “happy that they are alive”
Three men are "happy that they are alive" after the waters of their fishing boat have melted away from England.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue ship station reported a fire on Friday at 13:20 a.m. after the crew saw an incident in Moelfre Bay.
All three men tried to swim in safety while their boat continued unresolved.
"We saw their ship circling in their vicinity and we thought it was the worst," said the rescue ship's ship Corridor Moelfre Vince Jones.
"The strong wind fortunately took her away from them even before we left," he added.
Two men saved the local fishing boat, the third man at 60 years of age was found without a life jacket worn out as the fighters hold.
All were transferred on board a coastal lifeboat and transported back to the lifeboat station
Jones said: “The three men who are thrown into the water are happy that they are alive and without any injury.
The engine of the ship had a wire for emergency shut-off, but somehow it came to disconnect it from the person who drove the boat when it came to reverse.
Someone's been holding a protective hand over those guys.
The judge refuses to handle the case because of Tluchoh's wife.
Petr Tluchoř is one of the three MPs who had to be charged with getting from Prime Minister Nezepa and his then head of cabinet Jana Nagy's political traffic, i.e. a lucrative post for political retreat.
In 2012, the tax package was approved.
Schnydr, Fuksa and Tluchoř made it possible with their resignations.
Then they appeared at influential positions in state firms.
That's why they also faced charges and ended up in jail for a month.
According to the court, however, there was no justification, and this amount of compensation amounted to almost 2 million crowns.
The defendant is now in charge of the case as a witness, after the Supreme Court.
His wife works in a fruit market courthouse and settles civil disputes.
However, she wants to be the judge of the Queen's custody (resolves criminal matters - see chap.) and to avoid possible objections.
The case is likely to cause concern to another Prague court district.
But the queen has already released the guilt of Jan Netimes, Nagy's former.
It was a alleged abuse of military intelligence to monitor the Prime Minister's first wife, Untime Radka.
In this case, Tluchoř did not appear.
According to Lawyer Jaroslav Ortman, this is an excessive reaction.
I believe that impartiality cannot be so ruled out that the court may be ruled out if the witnesses have a wife or relatives in court.
I'm afraid he wouldn't judge at all, he said for the diary.
"I think it's disgusting," he added.
In the case of political traffic, Roman Boček, a former officer, is also accused.
According to his lawyer, Peter Toman, however, a possible objection would have a chance of success.
On 13 June, the District Court of Prague brought an appeal against a former chief of the cabinet of Prime Minister Peter Nekzeze Jany Nagyov (now Nekzenov) and other accused of abuse of military intelligence.
There's no time for your husband to go to court.
The company was supposed to handle Perutkov's judgments.
For example, the wife of the exhibition was to judge President Milos Zeman's sentences on democratic pre-war journalist Ferdinand Perutkov.
Zeman said he was sympathetic to Adolf Hitler.
One of the schoolgirls is already dead!
The girl must have died on the plane's flight from the joint forces.
She and her two old friends flew to Syria last year at Gatwick Airport in February.
The British Ministry was not commenting on her death report.
Young Londoners who fled their homes were secretly transferred to Syria by police across the Turkish border.
Shamima Begumová, Amira Abase and Kadiza Sultana have joined the media for their other former London school partner, Bethnal Green Academy.
The case last year triggered a huge wave of attention and tensions in relations between Britain and Turkey.
British security records estimate that about 600 British Muslims have been taken to Syria, including about 50 young women and girls.
A number of them joined radicals from IS and other groups.
Those who return home represent a terrorist threat to Britain.
Dream work for a hundred grand.
Great paid jobs you don't even need a high school.
That's how it looks at the first look of the egg job.
And often the other one.
The advantage is not only extremely high wages in Czech terms (in Prague you will earn up to 180,000 Kč) but also extreme benefits.
The reason is a huge lack of IT specialists.
There are thousands of specialists missing.
According to estimates, almost 20,000 IT specialists are missing in the Czech Republic.
Among the most sought-after are programmers, developers, network engineers and application specialists according to the statistics of the Grafton Personal Agency.
The candidates can choose between several job offers.
The candidates do not therefore agree on the position, but on the position of the candidates, comments Jitka Soukkova, marketing manager Grafton Recruitment.
High school is not necessary.
Higher education, however, is not necessary for young people.
Higher education is a good foundation and is a general indicator of the intelligence and educational capacity of the candidate, but it is often not very common with knowledge of development.
Developers have to keep learning new things, which once studied high school doesn't make up, says Petr Kubačka, director Monster Career CZ.
It's going to make the most of Prague.
Egg wages are moving high across the Republican average.
For the most money they come to Prague and Brno, in the regions it's no longer such a hit parade.
"The wage conditions in Brno are comparable to those in Prague," Kubačka confirms.
Technical directors will achieve the highest benefit.
In Prague and Brno they can reach 120,000 - 180,000 Kč.
In other regions, the pay is lower, but it does not fall below 80,000 KZK.
Demands are also IT project managers.
They can make 60,000 - 100 000 CZK at the show.
The fight's about graduation.
While in some professions graduates often have to go straight to the employment office, they don't pay for it.
Therefore, if companies are to withdraw and transfer experts from another company, they would like to reach out to the graduates.
They can raise him according to their own.
They won't be able to escape without their tongue.
The knowledge of a foreign language is appropriate in every profession, but there is a need for a minimum of English.
Knowledge of at least one foreign language is in some IT positions of necessity.
On the other hand, we meet with a number of cases where companies are looking for a highly educated and experienced person in particular and are only satisfied with the average English knowledge.
However, if, for example, a support worker has more foreign words, it is interesting for his employer because he can serve more customers from different countries, the Director of Cuba will deliver.
Yoó in Google, there's paradise.
It's easy to envy the Czech employees of Google.
Of course, there is a flexible working time for them, the possibility of working from home or various short-term relationships, not just for mothers.
"The newly-cooked fathers provide the company with four weeks' leave after the birth of the child," says Martina Joneková, Google’s spokesman.
Hicking also carries health care for employees and family, meals, transportation, training, wellness or massages directly at the workplace.
Whoever wants to learn has green and doesn't depend on what he wants to learn.
But that doesn't end the benefits.
Such a full refrigerator for free is certainly not to be thrown.
Healthy lunch (in some places and breakfast and dinner) is available on site every day.
In addition, in every office there are so-called kitchenettes, where people always find a healthy meal, the speaker reflects.
And so that nothing can be thrown out, so what's wrong is he's giving it to the boxes that employees can take home tonight.
And the reason for these things on the Czech relations of incredible benefits?
Create a creative and motivating environment!
"For Google, it is not important for employees to sit in the office for eight hours a day, but the results of initiatives or projects, move or development, ideas and innovative solutions," the speaker said.
The United Nations has strongly criticised Bulgaria for the criminalization of refugees.
Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussain, UN Commissioner for Human Rights, accused Bulgaria of systematically violating the human rights of refugees.
The official strategy of the Bulgarian government "causes serious concern that Bulgaria does not comply with international law", said Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussain in a statement.
He noted that "it is particularly worrying to be a witness to how important and influential public figures express public support for criminal armed fighters who are holding hostage to refugees at the border between Bulgaria and Turkey".
"One of the most serious problems is that almost all people who go to Bulgaria are automatically arrested in an irregular way," Zeid stressed.
And what is worse - they are often beaten and imprisoned - for a year or longer - if they try to leave the land.
Their attempts to leave the country are criminalized despite the fact that everyone has the right under international law to leave any country, including their own.
Bulgaria held 14 000 migrants this year, last year for the same period of 21,000.
Pokémon Go - Honba for health and happiness that will pay
It's fascinating to watch the world change.
A number of people over the last decade lament that teenagers and children no longer play outside and prefer to spend free time in front of screens.
Pokémon takes people out of the interview and leads them to activity.
Time spent in front of the screens was originally on television, later on video games and latest on smart phones.
It's great to see that technology and activities outside are not mutually exclusive.
Of course, I'm talking about fashion that Pokémon Go is, applications based on sets that first appeared in video games at the end of the 1990s (later came the drawn series, playing cards and more).
As with many cultural phenomena, there was a decline in interest in the introduction of this new game at the beginning of July in the USA, Australia and New Zealand.
The introduction in other countries was then postponed because of the possible interest that led to the overload of servers.
Pokémon won him over several days more users than Tinder and almost as many users as he has Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, players on a smart phone go out looking for Pokémons who follow them using GPS, and when they find them, they can "photo" them (through screenshots on the phone) or "capture them".
Manie admired the generation that played the game at a younger age, took her from the seats and the woman out looking for Pokémony.
In the United States, this game has resulted in a marked increase in the number of steps that an "average" person will take every day.
The Cardiogram app for smart watches from Apple, which monitors 35,000 users, recently told Washington Post that during the two days since the game started, the number of people who practiced every day for 30 minutes jumped from 45 per cent to 53 per cent.
The company has no information about who plays Pokémon him - it only sees rough data about level exercises.
Many public campaigns aimed at “finding 30”, “getting up from the couch” and “active every day” fell on unpopular ground because most public health-oriented messages are boring and targeted to people who do not look well.
However, the importance of exercise should not be underestimated.
Those who practice regularly reduce the risk of cancer or depression.
Physical activity is involved in weight control, high blood pressure, sugars and a long list of benefits that we cannot state here.
But the beauty of the game Pokémon him lies in the fact that people go out and do something they're having.
You cover three health pillars - movement, fresh air and sun umbrellas, and fun.
Some people even get new friends when they're hunting for pedestals.
As in the past, of course, they will find so many boring patrons who are looking for any excuse to complain.
And yes, someone can get in the door.
What about, like?
There's been a break.
In their time applications for smart phones, like Fitbit, were able to monitor our activity, but they didn't give us reason to do something like that in this game.
The news is watching, and interest is starting to fall at a certain point.
However, thanks to the success of the Pokémons, there will be other games that will combine applications and virtual reality with activity in the real world and help a number of people in the pursuit of activity, health and better form.

Simone Biles won gold in the fight of women's gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget the excitement.
Simone Biles is immune to everything.
Dynamic to jump.
Without any money on the bet.
At the simples, everyone fainted.
Excellent in everything.
And now finally the Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast went on Thursday straight after the title in a multi-fight and the others in full line under the Olympic reflectors won.
The overall result of 62,198 clearly confirmed its leap before the silver medalist and member of the "final five" team Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medalist Aly Mustafin.
Simone Bilesová (USA) on Thursday during a stakeout at the finals of several players in sports gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics in brazilian Rio de Janeiro.
Biles has become the fourth American in a row that won several battles, and the fifth in total, when she confirmed her reputation as the best gymnast of her generation and perhaps even the best at all.
When her overall final score was on the table and her long journey to this point ended, she was shown on the face of tears.
This success ranks it into the same league of single athletes of its time as Michael Phelps, who added a new dimension to their sport:
Bile’s sport has dominated for the last three years, won 15 medals at world championships – including 10 gold. Its fascinating compositions are a mix of ambitions and precision and the 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton marked her as “the best gymnast she’s ever seen.”
The final test awaited her in Brazil, not between Biles and the rest of the race, but between her own and the burden of too great expectations.
Anything other than returning home to your family in Spring, Texas, with a hand full of gold medals, would be viewed as a disappointment.
Simone Bilesová (USA), left, and Aly Raismanová embraces the victory of gold and silver medals at the final of the women's multi-stakeholder in the 2016 Summer Olympics in the Brazilian Rio de Janeiro on Thursday.
The first Biles won on Tuesday, when she was a performer at the celebration of the national team coordinators of Martha Karolyi.
Biles insists that during her long journey at the summit she never looked forward, but it is not so true.
Part of her composition in the free - the one that contains her typical triple salt with a double turn - is inserted into Latin music, which would just fit home, into the streets outside the Olympic arena in Rio.
That's not an accident.
The girl was adopted by her grandparents as a battalion, and her talent was revealed by the mother of coach Aimee Boorman on the way to the gym where Boorman trained and won.
The competition has not been lost since 2013 - this is the result of a victory that can continue as long as Biles wants.
Although Mustafin took short lead thanks to two turns, it was just an illusion.
Kladina and the free - where Biles defends the world championship - wait.
She got back to the front with 15,433 points per bet - and ended with 15,933 points in free.
Raisman gently hugged her when they were waiting for the final score - only formality - and around the trepidated red, white and blue shadows revealed the Biles' tears when the wishes that she had ever written in her diary as a child.
Raisman's performance was so little payback for the Olympics four years ago, when she shared a third bean with Mustafin, then bronze for the sum of three best compositions.
This time, a 20-year-old team captain who the Americans call "baby" was quite ahead.
After her release, she sent an air kiss, which she was able to return, which at times seemed unsanitary.
For Biles, this 19-year-old athlete has made a very new contribution this week on Twitter, where he became a complete hit:
Police: Three victims in the case of a serial killer shot when listening to music in the car
According to the police report published on Thursday, two women and a girl aged 12 died during the most serious attack of the decade, in the case of the first serial killer in Phoenix. They were shot while sitting in the car, talking and listening to music.
The authorities announced that Angela Rochelle Liner, Stephanie R. Ellis and Ellis Maleah's daughter were shot 12 June in a car parked on the way.
The report states that the armed man stood on the side of the co-pilot and fired eight wounds from the handgun. Then he ran into another vehicle.
According to the police, there is no three-fold murder of thieves because the attacker did not take the money, nor the amount of $2,900 she had one of her adult victims.
Speaking Police in Phoenix, Sergeant Jonathan Howard said the investigators were investigating whether the shooting had any connection with any of the previous four attacks.
In two mostly Spanish quarters, a total of nine attacks occurred in four months, killing seven people and two others.
"This is happening in the villa district in front of the houses," Howard said earlier this month for the KPHO station's side.
Police believe the suspect used several cars, including sheep Nissan at the end of the 1990s, black BMW at the end of the 1990s and white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to disclose what evidence led them to conclude that the attacks were related and were carried out by the same killer.
Ellis (33) was transferred to a hospital where she later suffered from her injuries.
Linear (31) and the daughter of Ellis Maleah died on site.
A police witness reported that it was not unusual for women to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting, the target of which became an empty delivery only half an hour before a triple murder.
The investigators found the cartridges and from the rest of the bullets in the seat and from under the hood of the engine they made up the bullet.
The mother of a six-year-old kid with a microcephaly: "His condition is improving"
Edmund Picciuto, like most of his children, loves songs, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike his cousins, he suffers from microcephaly, which is the result of a genetic disorder his mother, Elizabeth Picciutová, did not know during pregnancy.
When he first came home, like the first time I thought I couldn't handle this.
I can't do this.
I'm not ready for this.
Which is not true at all - of course you are preparing for it," she said.
She and her husband, Vincent, learned that Edmund might never be known and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in the constitution.
"My first reaction was that I thought people weren't doing this anymore today," Picciutová explains.
Edmund's walking with a walk.
He wasn't supposed to sit down until he was three years old, and he's still not talking.
Some borders are now slowly filling in.
He walks with help and rides on a bike.
He also loves playing with his two brothers and loves singing.
Elizabeth is speaking a sign that Edmund says "Please sing to me."
"We're teaching him the sign language," Picciut for CBS News said.
But it's not a common sign word - he says Edmund invented some signs himself.
Microcephaly can occur from a number of different states: genetics such as Edmund, and post-infection in pregnant viruses such as insomnia or Zika.
Symptoms and prognosis may vary significantly.
It's too soon to tell us what the Zika virus will have to do with the lives of the infected.
Picciuta remembers a tax that chooses the future.
I keep asking myself, "What's next?"
What's next?
And she's still not sure.
Actually, I've never wondered what a total prediction is, because I don't expect anyone to tell me.
Picciutov has an encouraging report for mothers of all children who suffer from birth defects caused by Zika.
The situation is getting better.
Guess it'll be better.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rains and floods have called for rescue work in Louisiana, Mississippi
A strong rain and extensive floods in Louisiana led the governor to declare an emergency on Friday. Another rain is expected in the state on Saturday.
The National Meteorological Service (NWS) reported that after extreme flooding, a number of rivers in the southeast of Louisiana and in southern Mississippi will pour from their shores and threaten extensive flooding.
Governor Louisiana John Bel Edwards said that state officials are constantly in contact with local authorities and help is already on their way to the affected areas.
Mike Steele, a spokesperson for the Governor's Office for National Security and Preparedness for a Crisis Situation, said they are receiving applications for vehicles for water travel, boats and sandbags.
Steele said that only the Tangipahoe district asked for ten thousand sandbags.
In most of the southern Louisianas will remain working on Saturday.
The Meteorological Service stated in the statement that it can spray more than 8 to 13 centimeters over the sea.
In southern Alabama, there was a flood monitoring in preparation on Friday, when the rains continued in the area of the city of Mobile.
According to predictions, the Committees at Baton Rouge and Amite at Denham Springs have the weekend to culminate.
Meteorologist Alec Krautmann said they both said they could flood a number of homes in Baton Rouge's suburban areas.
He further stated that there is a danger of flooding after the stream in the Ascension district, when these distilled streams will drift into Lake Maurepas only slowly.
Tickfaw River, a little souther than the Mississippi State border in Liverpool in Louisiana, reached the highest recorded local time on Friday at 9 a.m.
The rescuers are still picking up people from the coastal waters of Amite County and Wilkinson in southwest Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and his own son were already among those saved at Gloster's.
Hansford (62) said that the water from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 120 meters from his home, fell quickly overnight.
He said he was alerted to his next non-owning son who lives nearby.
"We woke up and the water was approaching," Hansford said.
We had her in the band.
According to his wife, it's the highest level she's ever lived on the river in the last 48 years.
Hansford said that he and all his family members are disabled and he's the only one who can swim.
Hansford said that crisis workers saved all three huge military-style freight vehicles and moved them to a fire station in Gloster, where they stayed hidden on Friday.
Krautmann said that with the continuation of the rainy rains, floods “spread rapidly” and authorities consider evacuation.
According to Krautmann, the observer near Livinston announced that 35 centimeters of rainfall had fallen from midnight to Friday morning.
Krautmann said that the ground has been very dense since Wednesday.
The authorities indicated that the rain and paid roads had claimed to save the residents from their homes in the period of Tangipahoe and to cancel training in five school districts.
The WWL branch of CBS reported that 200 homes were flooded according to the elders of Tangier.
The inhabitants were evacuated into two churches, both of which are now flooded.
The mayor of the village of Robby Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven domestic animals that had been trapped by high water.
In the town of Amite and in Hammond there were shelters for those who were evacuated.
"I will be able to return home when the water begins to rain," he said.
In the county of Tangipahoea in Hammond, more than 20 streets were closed due to the flood, and local residents were given a sand bag that they could pick up and try to protect their homes and businesses from water.
"The last major floods we had here in March," said the city manager of Lacy Landrum.
Looks like these floods are gonna be similar.
Rupert Lacy, the crisis manager of Harrison County, Mississippi, said that the Persian Gulf continues to rain.
He said that on Thursday, a few homes were reported to be burned, but on Friday none of them were reported.
Keith Townson, head of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in several places where I've never seen it before," Townson said, "and it's still there."
Mahaj Brown (6) - "a boy shot in the right direction", survived a shooting in Philadelphia
According to the police, six-year-olds were shot in Philadelphia.
The parents of her child for CBS Philadelphia identified her as Mahaje Brown.
The parents say the boy suffered several gunshot wounds, including weakness, legs, thighs and abdomen, but when moving to the hospital he was conscious.
"He grasped it very much, his small body was shot as it were," said his grandmother, Delores Melendez.
I can't believe it.
The boy is in critical condition in the hospital and has undergone several operations.
The family for the station said the boy should get well.
He was supposed to be in the first grade of elementary school.
Mahaj Brown is among the four people who were shot in the Germantown part.
Three more men were shot: two at the age of 29 and one at the age of 32.
One of 29-year-old men is in critical condition, according to CBS Philadelphia there are two other victims in stabilized state.
According to the report, the child was found shot on the front seat of the vehicle along with a 19-year-old man in critical condition.
Two other victims weren't in the car, and the police are investigating whether any of the wounded men could be a shooter.
The investigators at CBS Philadelphia indicated that the shooter was likely among several armed men.
On the site were cartridges of an attack type belonging to a different attack weapon.
According to him, it was certainly a continuing battle.
On the street, there were cartridges on both sides of the corridor.
It seems, therefore, that there were several armed combatants who were actively involved here," Fiddlelf police captain Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Several homes and vehicles in the area were also hit.
No one's been detained, and the police are allegedly investigating video footage from the cameras.
Another six-year-old, this time a girl, was shot in the back of a wild shot on Tuesday in front of a house near West Oak Lane.
The girl's coming back, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why do we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie?
That's exactly how I imagine a women's team of gymnasiums for this year's Olympics, right now for a few reasons.
First of all, I've been at every summer Olympic since 1984 and the United States has never been so dominant.
And second, there are three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired so many young colored girls.
Everyone is proud of the composition of this team, which complements Aly Raisman, who is of Jewish origin, and Catholic Madison Kocian.
We finally have a team that looks like America.
He also confirmed the presence of blacks and Latin Americans at the tip of this sport.
The high school number one in the past four years was an African American.
Simone and Gabby were early for the first and second reasons.
That means something.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Dougals suddenly became a champion of the Olympics and America rode.
Now the world could testify to the incredible performance of three-fold world winners Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who presented unexpected but masterly gymnastic figures.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American to win gold in a female multiplicity of individuals.
And a member of the Aly Raisman team got the silver.
We're witnesses of the sports summit, but it doesn't look like this in gym class in the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie graduated from the Olympic team on the same path as Aly and Madison.
They are "final five", because the team will only be made up of four athletes, and this is the last year Marta Karolyi is training.
The reality is, however, that gymnastics is a financially demanding sport and gymnastics are mainly trained in private gymnastics clubs that keep parents who are paying for training, equipment, travel, clothing, competition fees, hotel accommodation (for coaches and their trusts and their families).
Most of these sports clubs are in rich areas in the suburbs that can support activities.
These clubs have all the gymnasiums and for the families of gymnasiums and gymnasiums it is a heavy and long-term commitment.
Aimee Boorman, coach Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach Laurie Hernandez, both trained athletes at the time they started high school.
It is our duty to bring gymnastics training that is more accessible and accessible to communities of countless young girls that Simone, Gabby and Laurie inspired.
I set up the gymnasium 20 years ago.
In my organisations, where we offer free or low-cost gymnastics in Harlem for more than 15,000 young people within the city (primarily black and Spanish origin) and we trained national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown), where we will provide quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and take advantage of this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develop strength, flexibility and coordination of the body and hard work, discipline and decision-making.
This combination means life benefits for good health, success in school and work.
This team's inspiration will send thousands of young girls to us who will want to do gymnastics, and that's great.
Participation in this sport is very important, especially for girls.
It's a very exciting time.
Thank you, Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison, for proving the "wild force" and winning the Olympic team gold. And thank you for motivating so many young girls of all origins to go on their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
After refusing to accept Jeremy Hunt's proposal, young doctors are ready to enter the next station.
Ministers hoped that after the conclusion of the revised contract with the representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA) there would be an end to the differences regarding changes, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 young doctors who participated in the contract refused.
Hunt discovered plans to conclude a contract in July that NHS was in "no one" and that further delays would have a detrimental effect on employees and patients.
The first young doctors have already signed a new contract, which includes changes in night and weekend work procedures with a view to improving care in non-social hours.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, president of the BMA Committee on Young Doctors, said last night: “Young doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, especially in the sense that the current labour crisis is increasing and therefore the fair treatment of all doctors.”
Only eight weeks before the first group of doctors enters the new contract, progress is necessary and time is coming.
The BMA's efforts to resolve the disputes through the negotiation met with the reluctant involvement of Dr and often with the audacious silence of the government.
And despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that this option is still open.
"Jeremy Hunt now has to act, push for expulsion and solve the concerns of young doctors."
If not, young doctors are ready to take further steps.
At the end of April, nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 visits were postponed, as nurses and specialists were called to represent doctors who were among the protestors.
Ministers hoped that after the conclusion of the revised contract with the representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA) there would be an agreement on changes.
BMA wants higher pay for weekend work for 54 000 young doctors who would be the subject of a contract.
Daniel Mortimer, the president of the NHS employees, called on young doctors not to enter any posts.
Mortimer said: “The field action will only achieve little or nothing, but there will be pressure on the already overloaded teams and services and growing concerns, exhaustion and disruption for patients, treating staff and their families.”
In the past two months, we have dealt with the advice of young doctors and with the Ministry of Health, and the others have responded positively to their concerns about the role of surveillance and informant.
Employers hoped that continuing positive involvement in other important issues - such as stress, flexibility in schools, further training for those who returned after the interruption of their career, training costs, mutual recognition of subjects, study freedom and gender pay gap - was evidence of how seriously employers, Health Education England and the Ministry of Health take agreements that were reached with BMA in November, February and May.
The medicine for 60 crowns per day can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of patients at risk of heart attack will be able to take a medicine that is estimated to contain about sixty crowns (two pounds).
Ticagrelor is a medicine that reduces the risk of resuscitation in people with heart disease.
The medicine is now administered for 12 months after the heart attack to reduce the risk of death or other seizures.
NHS watchdog NICE recommends that the medicine be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Now, however, NHS watchdog NICE recommends that it be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, about 140,000 people suffer from heart attacks every year, and a quarter of them experience another seizure or heart rate.
Heart attack and death are caused by the accumulation of fat that forms a related layer on the walls of the arteries.
If this layer is depressed, blood clots may occur, block access to the heart, and a heart attack.
If the infection is released, the blood vessel may continue to clot, block the flow of blood into the brain, and cause brain death.
People who have already developed a heart attack are exposed to a higher risk of further seizure.
Ticagrelor, who manufactures the British company AstraZeneca and is sold under the commercial name Brilique, reduces the risk of more likely outbreaks.
In the proposal for a Directive of NICE published today, it is recommended that patients receive 90 mg ticagrelor for 12 months and then 60 mg with aspirin twice daily for another three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Centre, said: “In spite of the availability of effective secondary prevention treatments, there are a quarter of patients who have had a heart attack or death - often with devastating consequences.”
The fear of repetition may have a significant negative effect on the quality of life of the patient.
Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of other cardiac arrests and deaths in people who have already experienced an attack.
It is our pleasure to see that, when Ticagrelor's preliminary recommendation is made, we can extend the treatment options that are available to many thousands of people who will be able to carry it.
Since information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor - especially about the risk of bleeding - is limited within three years, the proposed treatment over this period is not recommended.
Computer culture began to flourish in Muslim areas
The mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was dismissed last year for corruption, which was linked to the government's report.
The culture of political correctness has led to a review of widespread fraud in Muslim communities, the government report today.
Former Minister Sir Eric Pickles strongly criticises the police, election inspectors and advisers for ignoring the abuse of their will for "ethnicity and religion."
The former community secretary, now the head of anti-corruption measures, said that the intimidation of the voters on the basis of their religion is so bad that the police should protect the voters from the polls.
He recommended that the voters take the identity document with them and that they can prove who they are in the elections.
At present, the electorate is sufficient to enter its name and address.
The report further proposes that the person’s fingers should be placed on the floor when the vote is given, in order to prevent a person from choosing twice.
Whistleblowers should have greater protection, says Pickles.
It calls for greater access to documents from the meetings and decisions taken by the informal committees or by the working group.
"It is only about the protection against electoral fraud, but also about the protection of the local government from the wider corruption environment and the financial fraud, which goes hand in hand with it," he said.
The report requested Downing Street as a result of the election scandal in Tower Hamlets in West London.
Last year, the special electoral court decided that the mayor of Lutfur Rahman should be dismissed from his post after charges of corruption and illegal practices.
The Court found that Rahman "cynically struck" the religious feeling of his Muslim community and silenced his criticism of the accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
According to Rahman, “he conducted his campaign in such a way that it was the religious duty of devoted Muslims to vote for him.”
Up to 300 votes were questioned or as a result of identity theft, when a person votes and issues himself to someone else.
Sir Eric said there's evidence of fraud across the country.
He expressed particular concern about the fraud in the corresponding vote - which he said the senior Muslim communities during it were under pressure to vote for the candidates they elected.
Sir Eric, on the screen, gave several recommendations on how to clear the electoral system, including presentation of an identity document
His report states: “The evidence has been presented that vulnerable members of certain ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, have been pressured to vote according to the will of the elders, especially in communities from Pakistan and Bangladesh.”
"The concerns arise that... state institutions have put their eyes on such behaviour because of "politically correct" sensitivity to ethnic origin and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations on how to clean up the system, including for political activists to be forbidden to manipulate with a corresponding vote and to prevent such "voice abuse".
The report, which now evaluates Theresa May, also calls for more thorough control of registrations to prevent the use of electoral lists for immigration fraud and dose fraud.
Consider the possibility of asking voters to submit a document of identity before the vote.
The use of a non-degradable ink on the person's fingers when voting, in order to prevent a person from choosing twice.
To carry out systematic checks on the nationality of persons in order to ensure that they are able to choose.
Requests for automatic correspondence shall be limited to a period of three years.
To ban political agitators and activists from manipulating their voice and electoral envelopes.
To give the police permission to create around the electorate of the Cordon.
To amend the laws to make it easier to appeal to a person who is experiencing illegal pressure under the 1983 Reform Act.
To prohibit the posting of photographs into the polling rooms.
To require only the English (except Wales) to work in the polls.
To strengthen training and ensure that employees comply with the rule that voters go into polls individually.
Sir Eric criticises the London police and says it is "surprising", that after the Tower Hamlets case, no criminal charges were brought.
"The election court ruled out Lutfur Rahman and his agent for the litany of corruption and illegal practices," he said.
For a number of reasons, he was found guilty over the grounds of doubt - by evidence of a crime.
It also criticises the inconsistent "control of the polling stations" in the polling stations.
Sir Eric said: “The previous ruling of the court in the case of Tower Hamlets woke up.
Our nation has a proud link to the collapse of parliamentary democracy, but the disturbing and hidden spread of electoral fraud and the refusal of some authorities threatens this reputation.
Confusion of the Cyclical Doubles of Kate and other well-known personalities at the Rio Olympics
This week the fans of the 2016 Olympics went mad at the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who is apparently like the Duke of Cambridge.
But the four-and-a-half-year-old Olympic is not far from the only athlete trying to make gold this year, which can be praised by his own double of a number of well-known personalities - at least not by social networks.
At the celebration of the Olympics in Rio and all the well-known personalities that are currently appearing on our screens, the column for women FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympics that are more than far away similar to Hollywood celebrities.
As a hunting animal: A member of the American team of shooters, Brady Ellison (left) was compared to Leonard DiCapriv
Along with Kate's double on the cycling route, a number of people online quickly pointed out that a certain shooter could be a twin of the star Leonardo DiCapria.
A fighter from the U.S. shooting team, Brady Ellison, caused a storm on Twitter after his images were invented, which seemed like a Wall Street wolf.
Brady himself noticed the media madness and admitted that he was hearing about his appearance with Lee from a little girl.
"There is no such thing as a big similarity, except for the weights," Brady told Huffington Post.
"He's a guy and he looks good, so I think it's a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will undoubtedly be emphasized this year even more: the imaginary image between the British jump away from Greg Rutherford and the favorite actor Neil Patrick Harris.
About the Russian high school of Aliye Mustafins with her big, prominent eyes, it was said that she was a copy of the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And when we look at the swimming pool, Southern African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to the star of the Gel Matthew Morrison series for several years.
And for change: The user thinks that Nathan is an "athletic version" actor from the movie Home (Inception)
Another long-term comparison is the comparison of the tennis star Rafael Nadal and the actors Josh Hartnett, who have similar dense eyes and lips.
Russian silver swimmer Yulia Efimo's pride is not only the same meal of fur and blonde hair as Annalyn McCord's. And about Nathan Adrian from the U.S. team, fans say he looks like "the athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitta."
Women with strength: Hope Sol (left) and Dexter Jennifer Carpenter (right) have a similar shape of face and eyes
Not only one: The Twitter user was very pleased that they also noticed the similarities
On waves of theory: According to this user, there may be a reason for a similar view of couples
One Twitter user recently on the site expressed his satisfaction that "the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solová and Jennifer Carpenter are really identical."
The football star Hope Sol and the actress of the Dexter Jennifer Carpenter series have a truly amazingly similar shape of face and eyes.
Among other favourite comparisons is Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical with the smile of the actress Laura Linney, or the holder of the gold medal for the gymnastics Gabby Douglas, proud of her beautifully wide smile, which would copy the smile of Gabrielle Union, the stars of the movie Bravo, girls!
Commentary of the CBC station's Olympic Games apologized for saying about the Chinese Navy that it "exploited"
The mid-term live broadcast from the Olympics at the CBC station encouraged the performance of the fourteen-year-old Ai Yanhan by Byron MacDonald. The swimmer ended at the fourth place of women's race at 4x200 m free-style stafets
The Canadian CBC station was forced to apologize for what one of its commentators said was that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer was “sucking like a stink” and “blowing”.
Commentary Byron MacDonald felt that his microphone was turned off when at the end of the women's staff at 4x200 meters in free style began to shake his own opinions.
MacDonald, who had the CBC commentaries team to bring "recreation", said, among other things, "The 14-year-old from China gave up, you idiot."
Too much excitement, it's like a smell, it's blown up.
Thank you.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan (14) sailed the second stage of the race at 1:57.79 - that is, 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Ruck and allowed the Canadians to touch China.
The viewers in Canada began to shout online quickly and were frightened by the tone and language used by the commentator
Emmett Macfarlane wrote on Twitter: "The speaker on the CBC said that a 14-year-old swimmer from China "blowed"???"
That idiot didn't notice he was still on the show."
Ai Yanhan from China at the Women's Stafet race final at 4x200 meters in free style was described as: "The little 14-year-old from China gave it up, you idiot."
The criticism of Byron MacDonald on Twitter came from all sides and many asked for his withdrawal
When Twitter users found out how sensitive Byron MacDonald is, they didn't hold back.
Another user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: 'Wow #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and it sounds like we're a bunch of racists.
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russell, who was hosting the CBC's broadcast, apologized for MacDonald's live comment and said: "We apologize for the comment on the performance of the vessel that escaped the broadcast."
It was an unhappy choice of words, we're sorry it happened."
CBC Station finally apologized more than 90 times to people who tweeted in response to the comment
Col. Scott Russell had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald
CBC then copied and filed their apology for more than 90 Twitter users who complained about MacDonald's comments
The station also apologized and published a statement.
She's sincerely sorry that the words were taken out, she shouldn't get into the ether.
We quickly apologized to our viewers in the broadcast and to those who are watching us on social media.
To be clear, Byron's comments were about the performance of the swimmer, not the swimmer alone.
In other words, it was an inappropriate and unhappy choice of words. Byron is deeply sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, Byron MacDonald apologized in live broadcast and tried to explain his note by saying he did not want to sound like a personal attack.
"I would now like to apologize for the comment I made last night after the women's staff," I said in a broadcast from the CBC Olympics.
"I meant the performance of the swimmer and not the person of the swimmer as such."
"There is no need to say that I meant no disrespect and I am very sorry."
Customers in Primark abused by a woman who unashamedly tested her underwear in the middle of the store
When a woman took off to test her pants on a sales pitch in the middle of Primark, they were not buying a sure way to look.
To make it even worse, she tried how her size would fall, took off her pants and returned them back to the regula.
She continued her examination and finally tried four pair of pants in the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Flokeston.
Primark shop at Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone, where the woman tried her pants before returning to the regal
The mother of two children Jenny Davidson, who was in the shop at the time, said that after trying the underwear, the mysterious woman “dressed again and went out of the store without buying anything.”
She said, "People couldn't believe it with their own eyes."
She stood in the middle of the store, took off her pants, took off her own stockings and pants and put them on.
"She didn't even try to find a discreet place - just standing there, holding as monkeys."
"Everyone just watched her dress again and obviously didn't like her because she had returned to the regula."
She did the same with three more before she finally decided she didn't like anything, she got dressed again and left.
"She seemed not to mind at all who was watching - not even that she would think of the man who might buy the pants she tried."
Ms. Davidson (33), who lives in Kent, said: “This idea is that someone will take home a pair of pants that someone else had on them and that nobody cleaned them.
The event took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added: “When she left, I picked up things that she obviously tried to get out of the store – which is also the only right thing.”
"The idea would scare me to bring home a new coat and find that she had another woman on her face, dressed them, and that they were not washed."
The spokesperson for the Primark trade said: “The Primark knows about the incident that occurred in our trade in Folkeston on Tuesday, 9 August.”
All the products concerned were downloaded from the sale.
How to Defend the Attack of Guns by Krav Maga
The world out there is dangerous, but thanks to this video from Dailymail.com, it might be safer for you.
We talked to Rhon Mizrachi, the great federation Krav Magy, who lives in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at a close distance.
This video will show you how to suddenly get over the bully's weight, whether he's getting closer to you in the front or behind.
If you get close to the back, says Mizrachi, then the first thing you have to do is turn around to see your attacker and "have a free route of shooting".
Then you will catch a weapon between your front and your back just before you throw it into your face with a free bow.
Then he follows his knee to the weak, and while the attacker is sweating in pain, you shake his weapon out of his hand, hit his head in his face and begin to retreat, and then you will hold his weapon.
If an armed man approaches you in front of you, it's a similar technique - get your body from the firing line, grab the gun and kick it out so the doll can't shoot.
At the same time, put your force into the weapon and hit the attacker in the chest, then pull the weapon out of his armor and begin to retreat, while still resting on it.
Does that sound complicated?
Look at the video where you'll see exactly how Misrachi does it.
Remember, however, that the safest way to get out of the fall - if you are not the great Krav Maga - is to spend all your money.
Traveler Ian Wright Olysses the most filthy places in Europe to travel guide
The British traveler has decided to undergo a difficult test of his immune system and deep reflexes - by olysizing the most filthy and unpleasant places in Europe.
The moderator and travel author Ian Wright (51), originating in Suffolk, gave proof of the strength of his immune system a round-the-clock euro banknote, engraved on Piccadilly Circus, a button on the toilet in the train and the Russian public phone.
He used the luminometer to show himself and all of us what he was allowed to do.
An experiment based on the film Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, however, brought interesting results.
The attack on the oscillator button on the train that used thousands of other people may seem completely repulsive, however, in the kitchen drain there is actually much more harmful bacteria.
Throughout his journey across Europe, Ian Wright spoke to doctors and health professionals about strengthening the bacteria of wheat flowers and his own health.
Luckily, none of what he smelled left him nothing worse than a taste.
Ian Wright celebrated himself by testing the strength of his intestines on the roads around the world and by eating strange and wonderful things.
During this mission, he tested his immune system safely - from public checkpoints to train stations after reconnaissance
In the film that he recorded, he says: “I haven’t been much on my health since childhood and put everything in my mouth, from clay to worms and boiling water.”
In the film, the dozaist confirmed his reputation.
The only thing he refused was the dirty public toilets in Russia.
After a simple ceiling, the luminometer showed a value of more than 4,000 units.
For comparison, freshly washed hands should have less than 60.
One public toilet in Russia but the olympia refused after its luminometer showed more than 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have less than 60
Ian Wright and Finnish dairy producers Valio filmed the traveller's film entitled The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, which shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as in the bathroom
In the film he said, "This is almost the most disgusting thing I've ever felt in the bathroom."
Nothing more dirty than this!
I won't smell anything because it's disgusting here.
Film Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was recorded in collaboration with the Finnish dairy producer Valio.
Mr. Wright’s company provided Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid and vitamins C and D bacteria, which help people to strengthen the intestinal bacteria and the immune system.
Niko Vuorenmaa, senior vice president of Valio for nutrition, juice and new categories, said: “We wanted to offer consumers something really new.
Something that would monitor the capture, and at the same time, we would be able to explain the benefits of the probiotics.
We've invented a lot of crazy ideas that ended up calling Ian.
It is said that interest in the health of the stomach is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about producers, we wanted to put them into wider contexts - good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of stomach health and how it is connected to the immune system.
The growing interest in healthy grain is a global phenomenon, and through this document we have brought consumers more information in an interesting way.
I also think the movie has a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, adds: “Let’s say this, Ian would lose my respect if he would lick some of what I wanted for him – like the disgusting Russian toilet that appears in the film.”
Slicing some things was naturally easier for Ian, others rather difficult.
I'm glad we made some of those dirty things."
Valio carried out a study in 2015 that showed that 84% of respondents combined lactic acid bacteria primarily with stomach and intestine health and 58% of respondents indicated that at least occasionally they were using products containing added lactic acid bacteria.
The family socially needed before moving destroyed the general building in Saltash, Cornwall
The family of the socially needed left at its general home the damage of 50,000 pounds after they were accused of terrorizing their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were expelled from home in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long time of complaining against them.
After their violent expulsion from the house, the officials of the housing company were shocked when they found out that the property was in a state of emergency.
There were holes in the walls, the floor lid was torn, waste was thrown everywhere on the floor, and the walls were numbered.
Family has already moved away and it is considered that they live in private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, director of housing in Cornwall Houseing, said she was worried if the house would be saved.
She said: “It was a nightmare for people here, and I don’t think people should live like this.
A number of circumstances need to be considered, because this property is likely to become known as "not even the nice part" of Cornwall.
This family is not well-known and their names are not well-known.
A couple have three sons who lived in the house occasionally, and the police have indicated that the horrors that the family has suffered were street battles using baseball bats, intimidation of the surrounding population, drug use, drug distribution and loud shouting, fights and demonstrations.
Skeldon (47) whose name was mentioned in the lease, was sentenced in June for anti-social behaviour.
In a few rooms in a house that might be destroyed, exciting wastes were found.
In the house where drugs have been distributed in the past, there was a torn-off floor cover
Neighbors say they saw them on the street as they pears, and people regularly called the police here
Cornwall Housing and her partner forced her out of the house this week after they had received an additional 11 weeks to move voluntarily.
The eviction neighbors welcomed the fact that their lives were a living hell.
One of them said, "They didn't care about anyone at all."
We lived next to them for 20 years, and it's always been like this.
The number of times we've seen the police here, you can't count at all.
"We couldn't sleep this morning."
We got up because there was incredible silence - we're not used to it!
It'll be nice when they're finally gone.
Adam Fitzpatrick, the supervisor of Cornwall Housing, stated that the family could not cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, regularly called the police
Wastes and old toys rolled into a large part of the current house
She adds: “It is a shame that the tenant failed to accept responsibility for his own conduct and for the conduct of his family.
It was a very complicated case because their behavior was extreme and their actions were to frighten her neighbors, according to the Witness.
I appreciate all the work my team has done, the Devon and Cornwall police and local community members who have been able to inform us.
I hope that this step will bring some comfort to the neighbours, and at the same time it will bring with it a message that we will not tolerate non-social behaviour.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons of the tenants who lived in the house at different times were about 20 years old.
The contaminated mattress that remained on the floor of one of the bedrooms in the house after the move
Workers will now have to remove wastes that are left abandoned around the house
In 2014, the police carried out a raid in the house and found more than 70 grams of rope, weight, equipment and 1,700 pounds in cash.
Skeldon was punished when she was found guilty of holding class B drugs she wanted to sell.
She claimed that the money was based on a house for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
It is believed that Tanya and her partner are now living in private accommodation in Plymouth.
The graffiti were painted in many of the rooms.
Police say they'll try to expel tenants who violate the rules of their lease
Angela Crow of the Denov and Cornwall police indicated that the expulsion was a clear message for other tenants who would continue to violate the rules.
"This is a message to all who think they can behave without punishment and to those who would like to follow such conduct," she said.
Denov and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and non-civil behaviour and will continue to cooperate with partners in the protection of our communities.
Tourists in Portugal scared after a low overflight of a military jet over the beach
Tourists enjoying the sunflowers in Portugal Aveir were terrified of death
Portuguese military flight P-3C Orion flew to incredibly low
Military Air Force declared that it was a training flight and argued that there was no danger of safety
At a time when a low - flying treacle flew over a crowded beach, the frightened tourists were fascinated by panic.
At dramatic sights it is seen how the military plane gets to the distance to touch almost the sun with people on sandy beaches near the city of Aveiro in northern Portugal.
The tourists began to wake up after they were disturbed by the noise of the jet engines without seeing what was coming out of the darkness.
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon at Costa Nova near the city of Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of several recruiters who published video footage of a dramatic overflight on social networks, said: “The plane has been really low twice, and at one point it seemed to be disappearing.”
Nuno Arroja adds: “I was surfing and really thought the plane would fall on my head. ”
Tourists on the beach in Aveira were frightened when a low flying plane emerged from the darkness
The Portuguese military aircraft today declared that the pilot of P-3C Orion was on the exercise flight to identify fishing vessels by the coast and had to carry low because it was the only way to control the ships.
Letoon reportedly flew about something lower than usual due to the poor visibility caused by smoke from nearby forest fires. However, the flight continues that the safety of people was not threatened.
This summer, forest fires destroyed part of the mainland of Portugal and claimed four lives on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese military aircraft today declared that the pilot had to fly low due to the dense snow and smoke from the fires that prevented him from seeing
Flighton was on a train flight and the pilot was asked to identify fishing vessels during training.
Half of the funeral services do not comply with the rules.
Half of funeral service providers do not comply with the law.
The Czech Trade Inspectorate (ČOI) found this in the second quarter of the year.
According to it, funeral services do not most often inform others about their prices or do not issue written confirmation of the acceptance of the order.
CHOI paid 41 bribes in total worth of 73,000 crowns.
Today, her spokesman Jiří Fröhlich informed her.
The inspectors found a doubt at 47 out of 95 checks.
In addition to the lack of information on prices and lack of confirmation, some funeral services also sold products or provided services at other prices than those discussed.
In five cases, the products sold were not properly labelled and one seller used an officially uncertified measure.
The inspection therefore prohibited the sale of 23 products for a total of 7077 crowns.
It was about urns, candle covers and binders that were not properly marked with mandatory information.
"Since there is still a violation of the law in this specific area of services, the control action will continue in the next quarter of this year," Fröhlich added.
The London schoolgirl who joined IS was killed in Syria
It was reported that Kadiza Sultana, one of the three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join the IS, died in Syria.
Legal representative Tasnime Akunjee said that her family learned about her death in Syrian Rakce a few weeks ago.
ITV News announced Thursday that she was probably killed during the Russian air raid in Rakce, which is the estate of the group in the country.
Sultani was 17 years old, and according to her family, she died just as she was preparing to flee the war in the land and return to Britain.
"People want to believe that the only good thing about all this - as a message and a warning to others that these are real dangers associated with the road to the war zone - is that they do away with people from making decisions when they make them," Akunjee said.
Sultana and two other students from East London entered the flight to Turkey in February 2015 and then the bus to the Syrian border.
The Sultana family learned that she had married an IS warrior in Syria - and had been widowed for several months.
Reid says if Clinton is elected, he leaves Garland as the candidate of the Supreme Court.
The leader of the Senate on the democratic side of Harry Reid says he is convinced that the presidential election candidate for the Democrats Hillary Clinton nominated Judge Merrick Garland to the highest court in the case of his election.
The Republicans in the Senate blocked Garland's appointment, even though President Barack Obama nominated it in March.
The leader of the Senate majority Mitch McConnel says that the person who replaces the late judge of the Supreme Court will elect a future president.
Reid declared Thursday during the conference that he believed that Clinton chose Garland "with a certain degree of credibility".
Reid's spokesman later stated that he didn't talk to Clinton directly about whether Garland would name him and just speculate.
He assessed Garland and said that Clinton's team would not want to "understand the ship" by someone else's choice.
Garland is president of the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington.
Reid said that the republics that block Garland's appointment are "obligators" and "a jump" of the Republican candidate to the presidential office of Donald Trump.
He said Trump didn't fit into the office.
According to the magazine Treats are our calendars for “women and men”
The magazine Treats works closely with photographer David Bellemer to issue a 2017 calendar inspired by Pirelli's 70-year-old calendar.
But instead of the well-known personalities they are trying to find another generation top models for their 2017 calendar.
President Treats Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine was full of complaints from the old school from Playboy because "Playboy is for men."
I'm doing it for women.
Obviously, the calendar is supposed to be.
"We have to return to showing overtime and classic hints when women and men are pleasantly felt and are not inspired by pictures of the female body," Shaw said in a press release to issue the calendar.
Women want to be part of this project because it's a wonderful piece of art.
Models can send their images online or personally during open competitions in Los Angeles and New York.
Where does it point to vinyl: who really buys the gramophone plates?
Vinyl loves the loneliness of men of middle age.
Before you decide to pay the comment section with perfunctory notes under the pseudonym NeAllExperience MenIn the Middle Ages, we point out that this sentence is based on real data.
According to YouGov, so much discussion about the resurrection of gramophone boards is linked not to the boom of millennials who want to love the original property of the physical object, but to the nostalgia of the middle age.
Those who recently bought a vinyl album are the most likely people between the ages of 45 and 54.
Young people 18-24 are at least likely.
It's not really about collecting an exciting fan - it's all about emotional size: older people who buy gramophone records are probably trying to keep their feelings (56%) versus 53%) and are happy to be alone (69% versus 66%).
But are your results true?
If this blog was broadcast as a television report, the camera would follow me as I go out into the traffic street in Soho, dressed in a decade-old grey dress and gesticulating widely. Then I would stop, pull out my hands and say something authoritative, like, "Let's see this."
Let's take a look at this.
While Soho's heart slowly loses its charm and charm - buildings once occupied by independent salesmen, hotels, restaurants and restaurants, clothing and office needs are now filled with some fantastic specialized shops with gramophone boards.
I'd probably ask the camera to stop filming for a while.
Stuart (55), a relative from Glasgow, whom I follow from Sister Ray (numbers: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (numbers: eight middle-aged men, one woman around 20) has an afternoon meeting in London and looks at the shops to fill several hours of time.
I'm asking him if he's a collector.
"I think so," he says.
I've got three or four thousand recordings.
All these recordings are leaching the walls of his living room - on the image above (he sent me an e-mail, I didn't follow him home).
This huge amount of albums and singles also has because they can afford it: they can now buy gramophone boards that they could not afford when they came out from the beginning, and they buy again what they sold in their youth and had no wine.
“A lot of what I buy is from the end of the 60s and from the beginning of the 70s. These are things that would be issued when I was 11 or 12 then I was too small and couldn’t manage them,” he says.
He agrees that those who buy recordings are probably introverts who like themselves, and he adds: “I don’t smoke or drink too much.
This is my sin.
Wez (25) works in Sister Ray, and she also thinks that a number of customers she meets fall into the profile of YouGov.
He also noticed a new flood of people affected by the media wave. People who heard about the comeback and felt compelled to buy their old gramophone records back.
According to my interviews, the people of their collections were most often released between 1998 and 1999.
Customers who once sold their gramophone records and bought a CD are now selling their CDs to buy their gramophone records back," he says.
That could explain the boom lovers of the gramophone board of a certain age.
But what about the emotional importance of the gramophone boards?
It won't take you more than a few seconds to find in a store like Phoenix that you will find pleasant people with similar thoughts in a music store.
According to Weze, some older customers are particularly damaged by the non-contact payment system.
Some gramophone board beneficiaries may feel charged in the digital world and have decided for the familiar environment of the gramophone board envelopes, things that cause memories of peaceful adulthood.
"I think that filling a gap or ownership of something important can bring some comfort," Wez says.
I'm a collector myself, and I think a lot of people are.
It's an easy way to fill a place in your head.
"We are all like their social workers!" a collaborator is called from a collection of gramophone boards.
An ICM study in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought vinyl albums a month ago had not heard it.
According to the survey, 41% of the surveyed gramophones that never use, while 7% of those that buy gramophones do not have gramophones.
At this point in the report, he was probably really worried about going through a bunch of compilation bosses nova.
The aspect of "trophies" and the recovery of interest is something Jonny (42), who works in Sounds of the Universe (number: three middle-aged men).
"Someone recently came and said, "I don't have a gramophone yet, but I want to buy on the radiohead desk so we can put it on the shelf," he says.
It's not a big percentage of them, but it happens.
It's more about the product page than about music.
People come to us saying, "I don't have a gramophone."
They're younger people, not the older, grown-ups who get involved.
Fopp, where at the present time almost one square is replaced by a gramophone board, has many different visitors on my arrival.
There are a couple of seventy tourists who take pictures, pubers and women of the middle ages.
While the atmosphere is not as much relaxed as the shops before - from the speakers, instead of pulling jazz the latest pop from Wild Beasts full of synthesizers and sex, it is good to see different customers.
None of them seem particularly lonely, but you'll find it hard to estimate an intrusive mental trauma when you stand next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora (27) spends a few minutes in Fop and looks at various gramophone boards in the bass.
He's one of those who's looking through his exhibits more than he's going to have a hot run.
According to her words, she doesn't make much money, so she doesn't think she'd collect the gramophone records.
It's worth a lot of money.
It's easy to listen to music on a computer or something, but gramophone boards have their magic... "Excitely.
I can't explain it - it's unique.
My last stop is a store that supposedly inspired a new generation of gramophone board lovers: Urban Outfitters.
I look like I'm a very excited girl girl girl girl in high jeans and I'm following a bunch of naked girls who just gather around Polaroid cameras, and then their father and daughter decide to buy Crosley's gramophone.
On the left is the hall whose walls cover the gramophone boards Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary and classical music, the basis of any average collection of gramophone boards.
No one is looking at them -- maybe because they're just for decorations and some are so high on the wall that they can't be reached.
It's just a "wine trick".
But since any attraction to him could mean more money for the sector and send several customers to the depths of Soho for others, there is not much to complain about.
It is no surprise that the demographic area, where there is probably more time and money than in other areas, is also where the most luxurious goods, which vinyl certainly is, are lost.
But while my findings suggest that the results of YouTube are accurate - at least in Gramophone Desks, they do not take into account a large number of collectors and lovers of vinyl, who actually exist, in Gramophone Desks and online forums.
These people probably work hard in schools or offices.
It certainly does not take a Thursday morning to sneak out after a store with gramophone boards on Berwick Street, to walk through recordings, and to avoid seeing a strange, thirty-year-old fake TV moderator hiding behind the back of nothing-knowing middle-aged men.
Grönský zrałok is the longest living worker - video report
According to scientists, the granular shark has the longest average life span of all the planet's vertebrae.
Julius Nielsen, who studies sharks, says that the recording shows a female whose age is estimated between 272 and 512 years and measures five meters
The Court of Justice in France refused to open up trades in the Jungle refugee camp
The court in France rejected the order of the authorities in Calais to demolish dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
During the trial this week, authorities in Calais argued that the state should be able to abolish a total of 72 provisional shops where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes after energy drinks, to cut hair, to sell tea for 50 cents or basic food for several euros in provisional restaurants.
The Prefect's office in Calais argued that places need to be removed because they represent a parallel economy that does not pay taxes and because they represent a dangerous occurrence of fire and health risks.
The humanitarian organisations of the Court stated that shops and restaurants are vital and that the free food offered by the State-supported associations and other groups does not provide an additional food for the growing number of refugees in the camp.
Disputed provisional shops and restaurants often provide shelters and free food to people in need.
The Lille Court ruled that there was no legal basis to prevent people from carrying out 72 provisional transactions, but stated that the objections of Prefect Calais were "very understandable".
Judge Jean-François Molla said that food, coffee shops and restaurants have a much greater role to play than just feeding people who “live in extremely desperate conditions.”
He said that spaces provide peaceful places to meet refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened by the democracies was a café in the camp, Jungle Book Kids, which is operated by a non-profit organization and which daily offers 200 meals, hours of English and French and asylum advice for hundreds of vulnerable persons without escort in the camp.
More than 170,000 people signed a petition for the protection of the “child’s” cafe.
The Guardian received a letter saying that the closing of the cafe would “be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only 8 years old.”
The charity Help Refugee and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of refugees in the camp after a sharp increase of the arrivals over the years has grown to more than 9,000 - which is still the most over the entire period.
You thought he was dead.
Ulch crosses himself and the volleyball Uzti.
"From March I was able to normally train," he said at the start of the summer preparation in full strength.
What happened to you?
I had a double lung embolism, and that's why I had heart problems.
Because when I was at a university in Korea, I didn't know I had any blood problems.
So he made a long flight to Asia?
Two years I had a stroke, and I didn't know.
It hurt. Nobody found me anything.
Then the crash got up.
There's a broken vein in the year, it's gonna hurt all the time, especially when it's changing or changing the weather.
But nothing that would limit me is more aesthetic.
Were you worried about life?
He did.
Last year, I didn't know I had any embolism at the summer tournament in the Woods, and I couldn't even move there.
I threw out my blood tonight.
The doctors told me it was something completely different. I was still completely out of control for five days.
I actually thought I was dead, my girlfriend and my family.
I've seen you somewhere else.
How did you deal with it?
I guess I had to live with it. Now it's just gonna go upstairs.
I know I have some blood problems that I need to be more careful when I'm flying.
But you can do anything about it.
Just when I wanted to get back to prep last year, there were still problems with the heart.
It's all right now.
Since March, I have been preparing myself for home to be able to play again.
I'll lock it up. I'm physically better at it than before.
What do you expect from Ustsi?
I'm glad the party looks good, most guys I know.
I'm curious about the other two foreigners who're coming.
Well, I hope we sit down with the people so it can fit us together.
You're gonna pick Up the Mousty?
It was supposed to be a mystery, but every season is different.
Brno was eight years ago, now the second is over.
There's a new team in Ústí, there's only a few players left.
It was the last in extras, so there's a big room for improvement.
The way we use it, it's up to us.
We'll see who's gonna be exposed after the first rounds, maybe we won't.
Is it a guarantee of success for Brom's viewer?
He's already experienced and experienced a lot, he'll think of a better place than the last place.
But my coming didn't relate to him, I agreed before.
There were other coaches in the game, I was a big friend with each other and it was agreed that it would work here.
I won't say a name.
Finally Mr. Brom came and I'm glad.
My great name, he's been in good clubs, he's been training for many decades, he's an ex-good player.
Move us up.
What are you gonna bring?
This team will fight, which is my position.
I like to fight, I like to play, and I like to get an opportunity in a team that's not so good.
I've been in Pribramy for two years, but Ústí is a bigger challenge than being in the sixth team right now, because it starts from the bottom.
You mentioned foreigners, Australian Boehm is already training in Ústí.
What does it look like?
I know him by the way, at the university we played against each other in the group.
And sometimes we had fun together, sometimes we sat together after the fight, so we met friends.
We beat them 3:1, and I just put it on him at the start of the summer preparation in Ústí.
He's got a Slovenian girlfriend. He's a sympathetic.
The American Nadazdin and the Brazilian Ze are still coming.
Do you know anything about them?
I was writing with the American, looking like a good boy, Brazilian who's going to learn English.
You contacted an American?
I thought it was a good idea.
I'm a recorder, so whoever's making it, I should communicate with everyone.
Right away I found out what players are, I found myself on the internet, I saw some videos.
He showed up all right, the jumper boy, he's tall.
On Facebook we wrote a few messages, he seemed like a joke, he'd come down to us.
How do you look at the recording unit?
I didn't want to take anything else.
I'm only going to be 40 years old, and I don't have the right to go and get it done.
I'd rather be in the center of the event, I'd rather lead the team than be led by someone else.
I don't think I'd want to play if I were to be like a second recorder and devote myself to it for the full time.
How many times have you been one?
Half in Pribra, when it didn't go to Kusto as a captain, he got hurt, then there were problems with the money and he left.
Since then, we've been climbing up and I've been playing.
In Brno, whose lifeguard I was, I've got one and two.
The excellent year was in Old Town, after which I had a lot of offers and I chose Pribra.
From there, Budjejovice wanted me, I stayed, but I didn't finish the season because of the embolism.
Now it's a new start.
Gold number 22.
The short floor remains the Phelps domain.
"To be back on the stage winners and to hear the hymn is sweet as always," he laughed at Phelps and then again had eyes full of tears.
His fiancee and mother once again chiseled in view, the son of Boomer this time slept quietly with his ears.
I'm spending an unrealistic week at the end of my career.
It's crazy - 20 years ago I started swimming in a race and in a few hours it'll be after all, he said.
In the final after Phelps for almost two seconds, the silver Japanese Kosuke Hagino, who won a long head.
Bronz won Chinese Wang Shun, a bronze medalist in this discipline from the last world championship.
After Alu Oerter (disk) and Carl Lewis (distant) Michael Phelps is the third sportsman who controlled the same discipline in four games behind him.
After most of the race with Phelps, another American Ryan Lochte and the home of Thiago Perreira took the lead.
While gold defenders in the final royalties set themselves to the third finish, they lost out on the medal position.
The American superhero will have at least one more chance to expand its unique medal collection in Rio.
Shortly after the official announcement of the position, he went to the final race for 100 meters of motorcycles.
The legend could not even be obscured by Ryan Murphy, who won a double mark - after a century won a double track in Rio.
He left 37 sets of Australian swimmer Mitchell Larkin in the final, and the third finished the Russian Jevgenij Rylov.
While Murphy is only fifth of the world's last championship, in Rio he became a marked king.
From the thought-based throne, Larkin sat down, with the same double he did just on the last world championship.
At the Olympics, he won a medal just now.
In the cravary century, the Canadian Penny Oleksiakov and the American Simone Manuel were divided by gold.
For sixteen years Oleksiakov was the fourth medal in these games, for Manuel the second after silver from the staff.
Blue gold won at OH as the first African American in history.
I believe I can be an inspiration to others.
This medal is for all those who come after me, sport will become their love and they will get to where I am, said Aunt Manuel.
The third was Sarah Sjöström, who won a 100-metre motorcycle race in Rio in the world record and still has silver from a cravat double.
By the end of the sixth year, Australian Cate Campbell's world recordman was finished.
Japan's Rie Kanet won the first Olympic medal in the 1970s.
There is no precious metal from the world's championship, and it was the fourth most important place in this discipline in 2013.
The second silver in Rio was won by Ruska Julia Jeffimov, who, due to the start of the games in spite of the doping past, is faced with the inanimateness of spectators and rivals.
I made a big mistake once.
But I won in court and I don't know why I should still answer these questions.
I'm so tired of it, the Russian swimmer said.
The right to start in Rio failed until the special panel of sports arbitration CAS just before the start of the game.
They took care of my call and I won.
If someone likes it or not, or if he has another opinion, whether to refer to the arbitral tribunal, she added.
Hermann: Disappointment, we could have won.
And start at midnight?
I don't remember.
The Czechs had a special day.
Just an hour before the match, they found out who he was going to come up against.
They must have managed tactically.
And then, in a non-traditional time, they started the game on little jacket number one.
The first set didn't start well, then they pulled up the rivals, but they couldn't handle the final.
In the second, they were clearly better and more comparable, but the decisive tie-break did not come out.
Most of the services shown meant losing 10:15 and leaving with the Olympic tournament.
"We could have defeated the Russians," Hermann said regretfully.
How would you rate the match?
Hermann: After the unfortunate start before I played, we got pretty into the game.
At the end of the last balloon, I was hit by the income I was used to.
We lost that set, which was key.
In the next set, we came across them with an overview of the playground, another defense, and we pushed on the service.
In the tee-breaker, there was a terrible breakdown of the use, and we were wearing it on this page.
It was a disappointment because we could defeat the Russians.
The damage to the beginning of the first set, we ran away.
We were able to download it, but we missed the points.
The second set was great and in the third he decided to serve.
We made too many mistakes.
We gave them five points, and it was about those five, and we got a lot of crazy around there.
It's too bad because the Russians were playable.
How did you play in the little castle number one?
Sluková: Similar to in China in the adjacent gardens.
The media and the atmosphere were different.
There was one hour in the night, full silence, music didn't play, nothing.
That was the difference between the center and the center.
We wouldn't choose such conditions, but we can't choose.
What was the preparation for the match when you found out the name of the opponent an hour before the match?
Hermann: She was special.
We started practicing the game without knowing the counters, so we couldn't do tactical training as on other teams.
But Simon (the Nausch) came up with the tactic almost on all the options that were there.
He's got a lot of paper prepared with tactics, so we've been pretty well prepared on this page.
Do you remember ever starting a midnight game?
Hermann: Probably not.
We played at half eleven, but not at twelve.
Rusky Birlov's block in the play-off for OH in Rio.
Beach volleyballists Markét Sluková and Barbora Hermann in a pre-play-off ring at OH in Rio.
Was it unpleasant?
Sluková: By playing the last two games in the group since ten, we had a regime moved before.
This was two more hours.
It's strange, I can't imagine that another sport has a sportsman who has to give his best performance within 12 hours.
But I think we've prepared the best we could.
We knew it would, but it's not quite typical and it's probably not my favorite time to play.
How do you measure your Olympic experience?
Hermann: Since the process was our goal group, it's on one side okay, okay.
We did what we said.
But now I'm sad after the game.
Sluková: I will sleep out of it and I will remember only positively from tomorrow at the Olympics.
Big brother's here. The first sissy SIM comes.
You won't miss her.
The new rules are to apply to all persons without a Thai passport who, during their stay in Thailand, will decide to direct the SIM of one of the local operators.
So not only for tourists, but also for people with long-term visas who work in Thailand for example or close marriage there.
The Secretary-General of the National Broadcasting Office and the Telecommunication Commission Tatarn Tantasith informed that there would be no exceptions.
The SIM sales plan for exclusively foreign nationals was presented by the national telecommunications regulator at the beginning of August.
The new measures to allow monitoring of their position shall be adopted by the authorities within six months.
According to Tantasith, it is a means of maintaining national security, which will enable the criminal activity to be handled by foreigners.
In addition, so-called tourist SIMs should help discover those who exceed the authorised duration of their stay.
In the case of sellers, they would have to discover a special SIM for foreigners by side of the SIM intended exclusively for Thais.
The difference will be precisely the monitoring function that will be permanently enabled for charts for individuals without Thai passports.
It won't be possible to turn it off.
"This SIM function for Thai isn't because you can always watch easily," Tantasith added.
It must be added that there are no subscriptions in Thailand anonymous as in the Czech Republic.
The seller requires proof of identity.
On the other hand, for several years one of the operators distributed free start-up SIM to tourists at airports.
You were so anonymous.
The imposition of the same measure as Thailand also takes into account ten telecommunications regulators from other Asian countries, such as Malaysia or Singapore.
They are also currently subject to mandatory SIM registration, but the legal use of the monitoring system is not possible.
However, the planned measures do not mean for a foreigner the obligation to arrange for entry into the country of the local operator’s SIM.
Of course, they can use roaming services with their own home SIM, in which case the Thai authorities will be brief.
Operators of the country concerned only know relevant network information after crossing the border, i.e. after the SIM has been registered to their network.
So they know the phone number, not the owner information.
However, the difference in roaming prices against the rates of local operators is so devastating that during their stay in Thailand, the majority of tourists start looking at local SIMs.
The efforts of the authorities to oversee the movement of foreigners have been legally criticized by foreigners living in Thailand.
The Tanzanian situation calms down and, in relation to the protection of privacy, the planned system compares to the obligation to provide a residence address in immigration documents.
In addition, the police will need a court order if a particular person is to be monitored.
Any abuse of the system will endanger an unspecified punishment.
"If the service provider follows the SIM position without a court order, he will be charged with a criminal offence," Tantasith added.
The system should also maximize the use of prepaid cards.
While there is currently a recycling of a specific number until after the 90-day deadline after which the SIM has failed to sign up to the network, it may be possible to recover the number after fifteen days in the event of a departure from Thailand.
Luxury apartment in the new building on Vinohradech has a swimming pool and a veranda on the terrace.
Why did you choose to build a new apartment?
We've been looking for a carefree apartment where most of the property is owned by the manager.
The condition was that there were enough parking spaces and lifts in the house, which basically disqualified the older building.
Not about the problem acoustics in old houses, problems with climbing the floor, high energy stresses and so on.
There were also large terraces, which the old building is unable to offer.
More interesting visits can be found in the magazine Modern Apartment.
The entire interior for you was designed by architect Lenka Langer with his colleague Kamilo Polákov from Artiga.
Why did you just address them?
Would you recommend collaborating with each expert?
We would recommend cooperation with the architect to everyone, if he proposes the apartment from the beginning, that is, it is a very complex technical process.
The second equation is the interior design itself: designers have a much better idea of the scale of possible materials and based on the customer's wishes they are able to sweeten the interior properly.
With architect Lenko Langer, we have already cooperated on our mountain apartment, then based on the personal recommendation of another client, and since everything worked well, it was a clear choice for us even when rebuilding our new apartment in Vinohradech.
What were your practical and aesthetic requirements?
We wanted a magnificent community-dwelling space with a suitable background for a four-member family, described as a modern, but not a cold interior.
The priority was to connect the apartment to the terraces and realize intelligent household control.
And, of course, the quality of implementation had to be cleared.
Did you leave everything on the experts, or did you hit yourself in the final form of the interior?
All proposals, including technical drawings and samples of materials, have been approved, but the proposal has always been taken from architects.
At first, we decided what we expect from the design, and showed some elements of the interior that we would like to include in the proposal, such as cover or image.
I think that our collection of mostly Czech authors including works by Karl Malich, Karl Vysuhila, Václav Spála or Otto Gutfreunda architect helped guide us in our taste.
The combination of black, white and pine wood was also the idea of architects as well as individual pieces of furniture, walls, floors, lighting, blankets, textiles, art etc. We then jointly verified with visualization.
Did they come up with any complications that led you to give up your original ideas, or did they come up with new ideas?
Perhaps only in the initial phase of the project when we came to the building at a time when it was first possible to appear to the height of our floor, and they found that the prospects that we were planning are actually the shadow of the surrounding building.
Then we changed the layout literally overnight from the base.
The spoon was used on the kitchen line as well as on the cover of the chest wall.
The interior is then dominated by wooden surfaces of added skin, such as the heating of Norma’s Arper’s dining and bar chairs.
How would you characterize the interior?
Are you going to make any changes here, or is there something you'd like to have different today?
I mean, it's a modern air interior that mostly fulfills its purpose.
We don't expect any changes, most of the adjustments after the move took place in the level of shade and the dwelling of the terrace.
I hope the only climb is on the floor when the pine tree is shown to us as too shallow in the home with the dog.
The word architects, Ing.arch. Lenka Langerová and MgA. Kamila Hornychová, authors of realization.
The apartment is in the last floor of the new building, so it was possible within the building to make completely new available solutions and several other adjustments.
For the interior, it is an important element to place the lights into the hall roof and the main toilet.
That's how we got daylight into the darker space of the apartment.
The direct entrance from the main bathroom to the roof terrace to the pool from USSPA is also one of the construction adjustments that was very beneficial for the entire apartment.
It's also a pool and a vertebrae.
You're not negative compared to the French, says a Muslim living in Prague.
You're from France.
Where did you live before you moved to Prague?
My parents are from Algeria.
I was born in southern France, a bit from the Spanish border.
I've moved enough.
I lived in Toulouse, Lyon and Marseille.
In France, I studied journalism, so I got to work in one magazine.
So why did you decide to move out of the country?
I started to feel like I was breathing in France.
I just didn't want to live there anymore.
Especially because of the atmosphere among people.
I thought every Frenchman was very negative.
People in France are negatively controlled in general, but lately it has worsened.
It's interesting that you're just referring to negatism.
Some people are so appraised by the Czech character.
Trust me, compared to the French, you're not negative.
Some people don't like it when they come to France because they don't like it as tourists.
But it was too much for me.
A big deal is money.
People feel they have little money, but the minimum wage in France is fifteen hundred euros, which I think is enough.
Now there's also a problem with people's behavior towards Muslims.
That's completely incomprehensible to me.
For example, in the street where I lived, my non-Muslim neighbor started looking through my fingers just because I was a Muslim.
It's like I'm some kind of evil.
That's why I didn't feel good in France.
My family stayed there.
So you decided to go to another country.
Why did you choose the Czech Republic?
I was looking for a job basically anywhere else and I ran into a free place with Air France here in Prague.
I admit I didn't even know Prague from the beginning.
I knew something about the Czech Republic, my father even told me about what was going on in Czechoslovakia, but I didn't know what to expect from Prague.
I've been here for three years now, and I can't imagine being here.
Was it a big difference when you moved from France to Prague?
Especially because of a completely different atmosphere.
Maybe it's because I don't speak Czech, so I can't catch any negative reactions or assignments, but I feel like people here are more free.
That I can do anything, get dressed, and no one's gonna judge me.
Someone in France is always looking at you, maybe when you have special clothes and something like that.
I started to feel really free in Prague.
I don't think they care about things like that.
Where do you work now?
After working in Air France, I worked for one travel website.
Then another friend and I set up websites that people are offering and searching for shared housing.
So far, we are only acting in Prague, but we would like to extend it to Central Europe.
Do you have any Czech friends in Prague?
I have two very close friends here who are Czechs from half, and two more Czech friends.
I have to say that the other specificity of the Czechs is that they're getting more out of line at first.
He won't let someone down like this right now.
It's quite different from where I grew up.
Everybody in the south embraces and kisses their face.
It's different here, but I understand it's a cultural matter, so I'm trying to adapt.
You mentioned you don't speak Czech.
Is your language barrier a problem?
On the contrary, I have a lot of simplicity in Prague because everyone here speaks English.
Even in the evenings or in the food.
I'd like to learn Czech, but I don't have much time.
And by making everyone communicate at least a little bit in English, I don't need to learn the language quickly.
And every time I have a problem, there's someone who can help me.
Have you met with any negative reactions?
Maybe because you're a Muslim?
Not really.
It may also be that I work in an international environment that is more tolerant.
There's one experience I've been thinking about.
My leader, Czech, once told me about the French football team and said something in the sense that they're not French, but Africans.
That's quite what touched me.
But if someone had a problem with being a Muslim, I haven't had it yet.
And even though my colleague once reminded me of some anti-Muslim demonstration.
He said don't let me go to the center and they'll put me there.
The anti-Muslim demonstration is partly related to terrorist attacks.
How does the current situation affect you?
Are you afraid that something like Paris, Nice or Brussels can happen even in Prague?
I feel safe in Prague.
But the problem is, today can happen anywhere.
I may not have been able to imagine that something like this would happen in France.
And it's not just Muslims.
Islam also doesn't recognize violence at all.
For me, people who kill are not Muslims.
The Koran says that man has no right to kill because he is not God.
How do you feel when terrorists protect your faith?
It's very difficult.
I feel cold and guilty, even though I shouldn't feel that way at all.
I try not to follow the reports of violence, but every time I read something, I need to apologize for something that's not really my fault.
I'm a completely different person, so why should I apologize for the terrorists?
We met at the site of Jiři from Podebrad.
In the middle of the day, the common Muslims and Christians demonstrated themselves against violence.
Did you record it?
I didn't know about that.
But I understand that people feel the need to prove that they don't agree with violence.
I don't think they'd have to do something like that.
Why should they feel guilty for something they haven't done?
Do you meet with other Muslims in Prague?
For example, my associates are from Egypt and other Muslim countries.
They're a little more religious than I am, so sometimes we have a pretty wild discussion about Islam, because we all think it's a little different.
I'm coming from France, so I've been through some other education, and they may have been studying at school.
We have different approaches, but we respect each other.
Sometimes people associate Islam with the subordinated status of a woman.
How do you feel?
I don't fit under any circumstances.
On the contrary.
I'm a woman, I'm strong.
It's also true that you don't wear any head covering.
For example, hijabs?
And it's signed mostly the way I was raised.
For example, my mom's a really fundamental Muslim.
They pray five times a day, but the dress just doesn't wear.
She always taught me that faith is a purely personal thing.
It depends on everyone how he interprets it.
When a person reads the Koran, he should have his own opinion on those things.
So when I read in the Qur'an a passage that says that God told the Prophet to hide his wives from others, I said, "I am not the Prophet's wife, so why should I hide?"
On the other hand, I respect it, and if I travel to Iran or Saudi Arabia, where the dress is required, I will take it.
Are you planning on staying in Prague?
So far, yes.
I didn't feel so good anywhere else.
I've been thinking about Poland for a while, but it's great in Prague.
I'm even going to introduce myself to raising my own kids here.
I think dust is an ideal city for it.
The Czech Muslims, along with Christians, demonstrated against violence.
The hunter Kozelski Fencl's wind in Rio hit the promenades.
Five trips to the sea in Brazil's Rio de Janeiro were by Czech hunter Veronica Kozelské Fenclová.
In the class Laser Radial moved in front of the final two trips to the tenth place.
That would ensure Czech participation in the final ride.
You're picking up packages like pokemoons.
They want to compete with the transporters.
The idea of using already planned routes for the transport of shipments is by the television director Matej Liška and the manager of the Prague Music Club Marek Greger.
The idea was that three applications with different geographical ranges were breathed into their lives.
We released the national transport application in May.
At this point, there are thousands of cities and networks that we will expand.
In the Czech Republic, we first want to learn this before we focus more on abroad, says in the interview for the IDNES.cz a 40-year-old manager.
How does the Transport app work, and who can benefit from it?
You'll download it and register for free.
Then you can enter the route and the details of how big a package you can transfer and how much you want.
Someone might ask for transportation that day.
When the route and the delivery time meet, it's a struggle, and they both get each other's notifications.
At this point, a chat will open, where the two will arrange a surrender.
How many people would you think would have to register for each package to always find its courier?
I don't know the ideal condition, I can't estimate how many registered and how many journeys it takes to make the coverage perfectly optimal and each offer is struggling with demand.
It's already working on the main dishes and it's logically simpler than it should be on the road between villages.
The more people, the more the potential of speed and accuracy.
People are still building trust and finding out that no one's running away with the package.
So far, you didn't have to solve this case?
How many users have service after two months of release?
Right now, we have about 5 to 6 thousand people who make their way.
We consider it a success, and we believe that there will be more.
Doesn't the sender have to wait too long?
We hope that we will be competing for large conglomerates only for the reason that we are able to deliver the matter on the same day and at a price break.
In the big company for delivery within two hours, you will pay several thousand.
You'll pay here a hundred or less because it's the way someone's already doing it.
Should traditional carriers be afraid of the potential customer exposure in the future?
We hope so.
The market has a huge potential, it feeds huge multinational carriers, as well as commercial chains, where everyone began to buy and gradually found that quality does not correspond to what they are paying for.
No one wants to find it in the card box with a message that he should pick up the shipment on the sidewalk, and that's the first day after 7:00.
At the time, I needed six hours of packaging, and I waited at home because it was important.
We want a better, faster and functional service that won't hurt anyone and send out competition signals to try.
Marek Gregor (41) and Matej Liška (39).
Not one of them has ever been involved in information technology.
Marek Greger works as a music club manager, Matej Liška as a television director.
In 2014, Shippancee LTD applications began to be prepared, which uses the routes already planned for the transport of packages between world metropolises, in particular the aircraft.
In 2015, they launched a project to process a company that created applications for MALL.cz, Jobs.cz or ČSFD.
The programming lasted three-quarters of the year and the application was placed on the market in March 2016.
The transfer applications began to develop in December last year and published this year in May.
This is a local version of Shippanese adjusted for the Czech market.
The applications Mesíke and Mesíke Profi developed since this year's January and made them available to users at the end of July 2016.
The intention was to do all these applications from the beginning that one day they connect into one.
In the Czech Republic, they want the app to come to an end and then, in cooperation with a strong investor, focus more on the global market.
The shared economy has been a topic lately and this is an AirBnB or Uber service.
You don't have any concerns about action in a field that no one can say so far, where is the boundary of sharing and where is the grey economy?
It's the same, just another product.
It is clear to us that if it succeeds and we go up there, we will see another hole through the grey economy.
But even if someone saves and somebody makes, it's not the intention of covering the financial authorities and tax controls.
Each user, whether on one side or on the other, will be asked to pay his income if he does.
What makes you think the service has such a potential?
The consignor shall save and the carrier shall earn, and shall reduce the cost of the journey accordingly.
That's the strong idea that connects interest on both sides.
In the time of social networks that divide people, we would like this to be brought closer.
They can have nice stories, people are happy to help someone, and they'll tell themselves.
Maybe someone will bring you the missing glasses, keys or pills.
According to me, people have been missing personal access for a long time, and we say that this application is a service to people.
So how do you guarantee that the chicken with the package won't break?
Each user of the application together with registration shall draw up a civil certificate and enter a bank connection, payment or credit card.
These are the channels that give service and man's credibility.
The couriers also collect the stars on the basis of the shippers' assessment.
We offer insurance, we still ship details.
For an uninsured consignment in the event of loss or damage, the courier shall hold, but shall not be liable under criminal law for the content if there is anything illegal inside and does not know about it.
If the police stop him and find him in a closed box in his bag, he'll lose his criminal liability to the consignor.
Isn't it dangerous to abuse sensitive data from the database?
They are registered, where necessary, by the investigating administrative authority, which as the only one who will be able to look into it, nor are we able to see them ourselves, data are protected against abuse.
How much money will the courier get after successful delivery?
The courier determines the price and gets the full amount he says.
The sender shall be charged several percent more for contact.
This money is our profit, but it's just a few percent, because we want to push on volume.
No one can accuse the courier of not adding the consignment when he actually delivered it, takeover and delivery is verified using QR codes.
Are there any restrictions?
Whether in relation to the size or contents of the package?
You can transfer anything.
We have three sizes, small as a piece of butter, medium as a plate of eggs and large as a bass of beer.
Then there's no further restrictions, and if anyone has a seat in the car, maybe they'll transport the fridge.
Plus the sender has the option to take a picture of the package application, so the courier sees what he wants.
You don't even have to pack things if you don't want to hide the contents of the exhibit.
You're gonna put a forgotten mike in your hand, and that's it.
Who came up with the idea, and how long did it take to start?
A friend had an idea more than two years ago, when I didn't pay much attention to it.
Then he showed me the demo application with the supranational reach, which aims primarily at the traveling plane.
At the moment, I told him I wasn't looking for an investor, but I'd like to stand up for him and save myself.
Another year it lasted for development than we established in London Shippance LTD because of the greater credibility of the whole product.
But this isn't the version you're focusing on.
No, we marketing focused on the Czech Republic, where we are trying to catch the app because it all had birth pains and still something to solve and improve.
We are trying to react to the feedback from customers and we are not currently dealing with the foreign market.
We know it's a long race, but we don't take it, we want to create a really good product for people.
Shippancee LTD was the most basic and expensive application, the other two were in their way of upgrading.
The transfer occurred when we said that the national segment could be far more interesting and that we would at least learn it in the Czech Republic.
The third application of Mesíka is local for the city.
But he can send a package to the right address and to the other end of the world.
It works for the senders just like the Transport, but the difference is that you see the parcels in the form of points on the map that are closest to you, thanks to the geolocator in your cell.
Apps for couriers who want to live with them, we called the Mesík Profi.
So someone can get exposed to the fact that they're gonna pick up packages in the city?
That's right, the last app will download in Prague perhaps a taxi driver, student, mother on parental leave, someone who wants to make the trip to work.
As everyone's fooling around with those peckers now, they can collect this all the same.
A person sees where orders are in the city, comes to it, clicks and sees when it has to be delivered and the shipment.
It's set cheaper than competition services.
At this point, we are still doing web interfaces that will be difficult for companies to send shipments, and they will fill in on the web, so they create points on the map.
Then we're able to use their service every month.
Do you now focus on full involvement?
It's bothering us, but we normally have it when we work so we can use and develop the project.
We're not hiding behind a strong supranational investor, we're two guys, one of whom had a brilliant idea and the other jumped into it with other incentives and ideas.
Now we are looking for an investor strong enough to be able to compete with us, not the Czech market, but who should go with us to the world product and become another huge player on the market like AirBnB and Uber.
The historical section of Titanfall 2 should bring a sequence of forgotten pastorities.
This will fix the second part and only the game in it will be according to the first information more fonder than in Call of Duty.
The length will move around the standard eight hours and the full will come from just the concept of net loading in the first part.
It is therefore possible to enjoy the freedom of movement, which includes, in addition to running, the possibility of using combat titanium.
In addition to the action passports, the game will contain a level focused precisely on the reverse movement.
They'll remember the plates and include the ribs.
For their convictions, therefore, the main example is double jumps, running across walls and wire loops.
Sometimes, however, it will also be necessary to eliminate the enemy.
There will be no missing maps of the site and level with special concepts.
In one example, you can also pull up the plates and close the possible door.
You'll manage this way to form a battlefield.
The pace of the game should therefore be acclimatized between the louder action and the calmer moments for exploring an unknown planet.
We're going to play Jack Cooper's footing with the driver's career.
Cooper at the beginning of the campaign with Captain Lastimos spends his time on the alien planet Typhon, inhabited by enemy soldiers.
And there won't even be a dark savage.
In addition, Lastimosa will cause fatal injuries in the event of an accident, and therefore Cooper will be assigned the task of carrying out the captain of the Titan.
His dream of a pilot's career will be fulfilled before he expected.
The first step will be to steal the battery needed to repair the robot.
Also important will be Cooper's calls with the Titan.
The players will serve as a source of information about the military's past, while the robot's personal communication will create humorous moments.
For example, when the Titan is going to appoint a dry spot for all the injuries that Cooper is threatening at the planned jump.
The first information about the campaign in Titanfall 2 brought the server Polygon.
The result will also be judged in two months and Bonusweb will bring you the first impressions of the network game after Gamecom.
Titanfall 2 comes from October 28, which is for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
The THQ mark is alive, but the original edition remains dead.
Swedish Nordic company changes its name to THQ Nordic.
After the collapse of THQ publishing in 2013, the company acquired a number of its brand and the right to use the logo and company name.
Nordic, for example, released Darksiders 2 Deathnative Edition or Red Faction Collection package.
In addition, there are 23 more games for publishing and 13 of them have not yet been discovered by the company.
Thirty years ago, at the time I retired, my wife, after thirty years of marriage, found a younger man, our neighbor.
I knew it from the beginning - first of all, it was obviously a longer time, and then they came together.
He's such a big guy, probably her type, because she went in front of me.
She's completely crazy about him.
In those first days, her voice even changed, she had such a girl, in love.
But when I told her I knew what was going on, she threw it away.
But I've noticed it all.
He was out of work regularly at half a quarter of the time, and so she always went out in three to buy.
Every day she tried to see him.
Later I found out they were meeting him at the bar, in the laundry.
How many times did I know they were there?
I got my keys, he was determined to get them there.
But I don't know why. I've always stayed home.
I've never been able to go there, take that decisive step.
Maybe you'll laugh at me, but I believe my wife thought I was in control.
Soon I found out that I could do whatever she wanted.
And I really did.
Maybe I'm just such a bartender.
At the time, my neighbors pointed out that he knew about it too.
I was such an idiot that I never asked them what to do.
I was afraid if it all broke, it would be bad.
That it's going to happen to everyone in the family, she only knew something about her daughter.
So I always put it down, go on and on.
But one time I went to his apartment to get me some help in the laundry.
He went there with me and I told him that I got an anonymity, that he was meeting my wife, and that he'd prove it all.
I asked him what he was gonna say.
He stood there, shook his shoulders, looked into the ground and didn't say a word.
Then I met his wife on the road from the store.
I told her, but she didn't believe it at all.
She didn't respond, and she didn't tell me anything either.
No one told me back then.
I'm a man who's never gone too far who's got a problem with getting to know someone, so find a woman.
So I didn't even think about divorce.
I've always relied on it to end one day.
I thought I'd forgive her everything and life will go on.
It wasn't like that.
And I've never really dealt with it.
I've got it in me today.
I used to give it to her quite often, but I finally left it to calm down.
He's still living in the next house, and I'm still living with her.
It's just more than my wife's housewife.
She always did everything at home - cooking, washing, cleaning.
She's working.
She always tried to make me feel that I had no other reason to complain.
And it can be said that it's good.
But sometimes I'd like to check on her, hug her, and she won't let go.
We go for walks and shopping together, and everyone thinks what a happy marriage we have.
But she used to tell me she never loved me.
She liked me, but she didn't love me.
And I see that she loves him so far, that's her god.
And I don't like that kind of life.
As soon as it started, and I carried it very badly, I once told her that she didn't want to live, and I wondered what she would say if I ended it.
I wanted to know if she'd agree with it or not.
And that's what I wanted to hear from her: Yes or no.
But she thought, and finally she said, "But there's plenty of room here."
Prime Minister Manuel Valls wants to create a new French Islamic foundation that should serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim inhabitants.
After terrorist attacks, France is fighting radical Islamists and calling for help from the government and the local Muslim minority.
"If Muslims themselves do not help the state against those who violate public freedom, it will be even harder for France to guarantee their freedom of recognition," said Prime Minister Manuel Valls.
He intends to ensure that only spiritual education in France is taught in the country.
To stop funding also wants to mix from abroad, when teachers often come with money to see jihad.
By October, Prime Minister Valls wanted to create a new French Islamic foundation, which should serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim inhabitants.
The new institution replaces the current French Foundation for Islam, which was founded by then Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin in 2005.
It was already expected to contribute to the review of the financial flows between the mixtures and the countries that are financing their construction.
Soon, though, her internal conflict was struck, and she never worked properly.
"It's a total failure," Valls said.
In front of the new foundation, the former Minister of the Interior and Defence Jean-Pierre Chevnement, who is known as the patron of the secular state, will probably become the head of the new foundation.
In France, there are about 2,500 mixtures and prayer, about 120 of them serving radical Islam.
Since 2012, about 80 Islamic clergy have been expelled from the country by the French authorities, and several decades later they consider this step.
This week the German police also attacked the jihadist clergy.
They reportedly recruited fighters for the Islamic state.
One of them operated a space where believers were allegedly radicalized and later attacked the Sikh temple in Essen.
Immediately after the attacks on Charlie Hebdo in January 2015, a debate on a new institution was held in France, replacing the non-functional foundation.
All have accelerated further terrorist attacks that have been carried out by radical Islamists on behalf of the Islamic State.
The new foundation will have two main tasks - to ensure the financing of mixtures from domestic sources and also to monitor assets.
But it's not clear where he gets the money, even though he's considering a few proposals.
One of them is a special charge on food halls, that is, on meat coming from defeats according to Islamic principles.
In practice, this tax would be paid by the sellers to collect food, which is for the grant of permission.
Then some of the money would travel right into the budget of the fund.
A contribution of between 10 and 20 euros could also be paid by French passengers who go to Mecca.
Every year they leave France for a traditional trip to Saudi Arabia about 30,000.
In addition, in French blends, only teachers who have gone through education programs at dark universities should be affected.
As a result, their preaching should be in line with democracy.
The government also shuts down radical mixtures.
"From December we have closed them twenty and the others will follow," said Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve.
"There is no place in France for those who report hatred and do not respect the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men," he said.
Zaragoza.
His ex-wife was severely injured by an unknown shooter on Friday morning at the shopping center in northern Spain Zaragoza, says the Independent newspaper.
There was a shooting after the woman and her daughter left the garage in their car.
The man was waiting in the car in front of the shopping mall, where he also started shooting.
According to the witnesses, the man then turned his weapon against himself, says the Independent.
The woman was taken to the hospital by an uninjured daughter, who had to get a ambulance for a man in critical condition.
The crime occurred around 11 a.m. in the central part of the Autonomous Metropolis of Aragonia, near the local university.
With reference to the Spanish agency Europa Press, the Independent writes that the motive was probably unresolved recent divorce of both partners.
Bracelets with Christ, we wake up with rakes, locks and chili sauce.
This summer desires a light, good-fated food, but we Czechs are rebellious and have our tastes and our heads.
And so from the summer gardens, it smells like grilled rabbits, dolls, cockroaches.
Nothing too healthy, nothing too easy, so sometimes with the exception of salad or cooked vegetables.
True, grilling is expensive for time and furniture, and it's a social matter, and no one has to be locked in the kitchen.
But there are other alternatives to how to do well-being, which is a special setting, their preparation is a small ritual, but there is no need to cook, fry, or breathe for long.
And they're still contributing to our health.
Whether it's a home sushi or sashi, where quality raw materials and a few well-claimed graffiti are enough to make the preparation fun and eat the only real exotic laundromat.
Like even easier rolls in rice paper from today's recipe.
Here, even more time-consuming cooking and cooling of rice is lost.
The paper can only slow down for a moment and then only depends on the chef's fantasy, how he intends to play with fillings and supplements.
It's not a race like a race.
The advantage of a number of Asian cuisines is today that raw materials are usually available.
Including a pre-saturated sweetener, which is one of the basic flavors of accompanying sushi or fresh roll.
You can prepare it at home, but the right pink garage has a unique picantic oyster and at the same time a pleasant taste thanks to a secret recipe, according to which it mixes from several kinds of octopus and octopus.
It is therefore enough to buy a bag of suitable size, and the Annex with demonstrated antibacterial effects, which supports digestion and resistance to cough or flu, is ready.
Banana leaves.
They are used, in particular, in Buddhist and Hindu cultures in the service and preparation of meals within the most diverse celebrations and rituals.
The long ribbed banana leaves are also widely distributed in the Asian or South American countries as "helps" for the preparation of the most diverse baked, cooked and roasted foods that are packed into them as well as into the alobal.
The banana leaf then transmits food with a specific flavor.
We are allowed to buy in shops with exotic fruit and vegetables, even previously cut into the shape of wheels.
But choose from among the green pastures, and choose from among the green pastures, and choose from among them, a pure shade and a bitter shade.
Similarly, it is easy to prepare salads from the vajam, sesame and sesame oil.
He can buy himself frozen again.
Who often or prepares sushi, I think he'll know a lot of crazy.
In Japan, this is one of the most important species of marine species, from which it is produced by pollinating, licking and drying the so-called nutrient list - therefore wages intended for the production of sushi.
Wakame – a dark green breed growing in the waters around the island of Hokkaido – is also fresh and dried and is as popular as a nut breed.
By the way, who doesn't know how to cook with the Wax, it's supposed that Asian women are using it to reclaim after birth.
And at all times, this kind of effect is almost miraculous.
Clean blood, enhances blood circulation, even supposedly prohibits hair graying and is literally charged with mineral substances.
Dried and unsweetened wax also serves as a root, for example, for the taste of rice.
The fresh breeds first let themselves go in the water, then melt, put into the water and cook half a minute.
Then it cools in the ice water, the middle ribs are cut and further adjusted, perhaps as a favorite salad.
Of course, buying it is the easiest solution, ready, frozen.
So it's only left to wrap the roll with easy vegetable filling, gentle and easy, full of healthy tastes.
Such a long-lasting bomb.
If you can and don't get any more grilled beans.
Eating healthy, light and summer.
The Asians know how to do this.
Enough of a few special raw materials and a little bit of skill, and you have interesting fresh food that gently combines taste.
And it's done once and for twice.
Four pieces of rice paper, 40 g of carrots, 40 g of white currants, 100 g of green crucibles, 60 g of salad confectionery, 60 g of raspberry and 60 g of sweet chili sauce.
A handful of silky coriander, black sesame spoon, cheese spoon chili sauce, 20 g of manga and 40 g of loaded fence, some pine nuts.
First we'll get the bandages ready.
We'll wet the rice paper for five seconds into cold water.
Then we'll take her out and wait until she gets tired.
In the meantime, in hot water, we will soon cook Christ’s exits, about three minutes later we will allow them to cool quickly into the ice water so that they do not lose their color.
We put a lot of green paper on it and we'll pack it.
Let's make it full of white rares, carrots and saladcakes that we end up on fine noodles, mix them with sweet chili sauce, add saturated coriander, mix thoroughly and put on rice paper.
On the banana leaf, we put the crucibles, add the beads, and finish the whole meal with a series of vajam, loaded with a bellow, with a manganese plate, add a black sauce and add a couple of pine nuts.
Britain must settle for silver in the seventh row, Fiji takes gold
The impressive performance of Britain in the seventh race ended with an end to the last obstacle, Fiji won the final match on Thursday night at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio at 43:7.
The Fijians taught the master's lesson in processing, composition, movement, support games, the running of shit and brutal forces - and they won gold, their first Olympic medal at all.
The defeat came with an unsurpassed price of consolation as a silver medal - for Britain on the third day - and the British could have been at their performances at the opening of the seven-year-old football tournament, defeated New Zealand, Argentina, and the South African Republic.
The victory over South Africans 7:5 in the semifinal on the same day, may have been frozen in the final.
Of course, Fiji would also defeat a 15-member team in full health.
I guess it won't be comforting for Brits, but they can be glad that at least one of them will have gold medals around their neck tomorrow: the main fan of the Fijians is Ben Ryan, former chief of England from Wimbledon.
Great Britain has hit a piece of the road.
Eight years ago, under Ryan's leadership, they lost every match in Adelaide Sevens.
They lost the only one here.
This defeat is painful, but progress is unbearable.
Fiji began to grow, the British ancestors reflected for joy.
For Captain Tom Mitchell and other associates it was like running a series of buses in motion and World Cup champions led 5:0 when after the corner came out of Osea Kolinisau.
The timer showed four minutes and Jerry Tuwai added another down on the right wing from which she was converted.
12:0 and Britain's having trouble touching the ball.
Great Mitchell tried to stop the huge Leon Nakaraw and stop him from scored third, but only the Fijians slowed down.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua threw touchdown into the right corner and the British lost 17:0.
Nakarawa added another one after the return and there was still more than 1 minute left in the hours... from the first half.
Then Vatemo Rav came across the tiny British and joined the shit where he scored.
After the conversion to bet 29:0, the break followed.
It was like Fiji was born for the 7s frogs, while the British were still learning to teach.
That's exactly how it is.
After the British had made a massive change and the effort of the Fijians had stopped... for the entire four minutes, which was good compared to the first half until after the brilliant break of Fiji Joshua Tuis.
Dan Norton tried to get an opportunity for Britain, threw touchdown into the left corner to increase and 36:7. But the raids had long been won by the inhabitants of the Pacific islands and their fans on the goose sang, had flags and danced.
It was difficult not to admire the perfectly excited attitude of the Fijians.
In the final moments, Mata William still cooled down another attempt to win the Fijians.
She called the gunman, the Fijians hugged and the Brits fell on the lawn all the way.
Earlier that same day Fiji defeated Japan 20:5 in the semifinal and Great Britain defeated the South African Republic in the close semifinal - for the difference of one conversion.
Kyle Brown got the South Africans in the first half, but Dan Norton, thanks to his basic work, crossed the defense line and scored in the second half under the hook.
The great latecomer Marcus Watson, Anthony’s brother from the 15th England team, won the victory - and finally the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired a coach fight with cancer to win the competition
You won't find more emotional gold in these games - and that's what you say.
From the first collection to the last, during 220 phasing-outs in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found another meaning in their golden moment at Estacio de Lagoa.
Even though two were happy, there were three voices in the ship. When the ship lit up to the level of the second Olympic gold behind them in the women's race, there was with them still the voice of coach Robin Williams present. They are the first women in the history of British sports that have achieved such a result.
Their weight was absolute, overall it was their 39th race, in which they remained unsurpassed.
What we see - two excellent athletes, how the water level flies with the elegance of the labyrinth - does not reflect the character of victory completely.
For every gold medal in the beading is a battalion of helpful hands, which a piece by piece means a difference. And no hands were more helpful than the hands of a coach who didn't know 30 months ago whether he would experience this day when he was diagnosed with cancer.
According to his words, it was not true.
I suffered from the cancer of the bladder that can be operated on, and I underwent this operation.
Without an operation, anything could happen.
It would be a very bad situation.
Somehow it will change your view of the matter.
Cancer was discovered to Williams in December 2013.
Fortunately for the entire trio, he was able to undergo treatment at the beginning of 2014, except for the season, and thus reduce the accident to a minimum - if that's what we can call it under such circumstances.
I needed to make money, so I had to get fast together.
That's what it was.
I was in the hospital and I went to the room - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at the time when they said a few steps was enough.
That's how it started.
The wedding itself is a journey, but it was more difficult.
Immediately after the victory, their first thoughts on Williams, who was very nervous in the morning, spoke less than usual as he tried to manage his own unrest.
Stanning, the captain of the Royal High School, who is behind the mission in Afghanistan, said: "This week I was with emotion at the bottom, maybe it's a little extreme, but it means so much."
Again, it emphasizes how much it means to me, how much Helen and Robin worked, too.
So far, it's been three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin we wouldn't be anybody, so thanks to him, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't wish for a better man for a coach or a better bitch.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost the only race in five years.
Two of them had an amazing rhythm that their rivals couldn't match.
Even in the final 500 metres, when crews from New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover had a very large reserve.
We've concentrated as much at the moment as possible.
Helen yelled, "Don't stop, don't stop."
It's really important not to give up.
We had a good start, and at the same time we didn't wish to achieve something famous.
We weren't happy about today's fireworks, we just wanted to make a good head start, go out and win the race, which we did.
He'll take two years to think before they decide what's next.
Glover's getting married next week. She's a TV show starring Steve Backshall.
Now he wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say it was my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
It took about six months in London before they found out I was an Olympic champion.
It was all so new, and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes.
I have a much better feeling about it," she said.

Prison?
Instead of driving people for free, a cabman named Rubes says he's in charge of breaking charges.
Six taxi drivers and former magistrate in Prague are, according to ČT, the charges.
You've made a series of reports that you've discovered fake practices and those that are supposed to be in the group that's going to be in court.
You've been dealing with a few unpleasant jokes with discovered actors.
How much is the report of the members of the organised group too bad for you?
I was waiting for some court to come.
I'm mostly interested in judgment.
But I don't think they should be in jail.
It's nothing.
First of all, they should get all the stolen money back.
And they should get them back so they can drive all people free.
It's kind of a different solution.
Does this mean that you don't take the punishment as effective enough?
It's enough for me that some of them are so afraid that they don't work anymore.
For example, one makes a stick, another weighs a pizza, and one has completely slipped into it.
Indictees can theoretically get two to eight years in prison.
Do you think it's an adequate rate?
Generally, I have a problem with deprivation of liberty.
I think it's a bad punishment.
To put someone in prison, especially in such a case, is nonsense.
Such people should return to the companies that took her.
For a quarter of a century, it was a crime to destroy our country and simply steal people.
So let's make a good visit now and discuss people for free.
I can't imagine.
It would work as a public service.
As someone goes to collect waste, they'd get a car and they'd drive people to Prague for free.
No, I really think they'll finally get a condition and they don't care.
They'll find another way to cheat somewhere.
He studied at the Miroslav Ondříčka Film Academy in Pisa and then at Tomáš Bati University in Zlina.
It belongs to people in the Czech Republic who started with viral videos and videos directly for the web.
He works as an editor for Internet TV Stream.cz, where he participates in a series of shows, he is now preparing a Prague Guide series, which is intended primarily for foreign viewers.
These Rubès, in the form of short reports, advises on what services to avoid in Prague and on what the contrary is recommended to use without fear.
Previously filmed a series entitled How to do this, City of Fame?, Life in luxury, And Enough! and Prague vs. Prachy.
In the appeal, they are referred to as an organized group.
The police have been following her for months.
Can such a network of fake taxi drivers be identified as a mafia?
They're such cute mafians, not as we know from Kmother.
It's more about mafia, juniors, but the organized are sure.
It's just that they're watching each other's sticks.
The dust is completely broken.
I followed that, for example, the main station doesn't like Paris, Paris doesn't like the taxi drivers waiting at Karl's Lázní (disco club)
Everyone just keeps an eye on their own place and every group is somehow organized.
It's obviously a complex network.
However, only seven people, six taxi drivers, and one former magistrate who warned the driver of the controls were charged.
As you're saying, the side effects of the street didn't disappear.
So, what is the percentage among Praguen cheaters in the taxi service according to your estimate?
It's a very small percentage.
The worst ones on the street are still.
I'm talking about Alex Ryacz.
It's a man who's really dangerous - he rides telescopic shoes in his car, and every Friday and Saturday he stands by the bridge and he drives people.
Last time I went with him, he wanted me seven hundred miles.
His police didn't stop for any reason.
Only a few people from all over the big group were selected.
The same situation, however, is also in other places in Prague.
So seven people's complaint is difficult to get rid of an already pronounced Prague mess, which is probably much larger.
Of course it's nothing.
It will help, but all evil will not be removed, that's true.
Do taxi drivers who steal foreign tourists still appear in the same places you showed in the reports, that is, at the Karl Bridge or on the Paris Street?
Yes, that's right.
They stand in these locations every day, and every day they break the announcements.
He ignores both the city police and the Prague magistrate.
It's no longer a chicken, but it's a complete mess.
Business of Prague taxis in numbers
However, some of them, whether they are just part of the group, will be brought before the court.
It's already a breach.
That's why I have to ask, do you feel enough?
If I took it as a sufficient amount, it would be wrong because it was my goal, and it will always be to improve the centre of Prague.
And even if I feel it's a little bit better, I'll keep going on.
You need to press the door on the other side.
Even if the last thief stays there, we should still do something to remove him.
You can't take it easy.
But it's not, of course, more.
Are you still trying to confront them directly in taxis?
Sometimes I do test rides and I have to say it's still bad.
Just last week I caught a cabman, by the way, from the same group, and he was very surprised to see me again.
He paid 560 kroner for three kilometers, although he then claimed that it was 56 kroner (used a decimal spell trick).
He had a warrant, the police arrived, and this cab driver was so excited that he was still following those cops and asking them when someone was finally giving him the 56 crowns.
It's a similar case.
A taxi on the taximeter took over a dozen letters and stole tourists with 357 crowns.
Is it to be said that the strength of the cheated taxi drivers did not rise even after you showed the faces of those who counted the illogical amounts in a short drive?
Their strength is still incredible.
How did the 56 kroner get that?
The cops sent him away because they couldn't talk to him on the spot because he posted a bill.
And that's going to be, I think, a problem with the court (six taxi drivers and one ex-director).
On the one hand, there will be a taxi driver with his bills, on the other hand, the police.
However, according to the decision of the Supreme Administrative Court, the magistrate may not use the secret records of the taxi service vehicle as evidence at the court.
When I filmed the parts about their frauds, the taxi drivers themselves warned me about this precedent.
I used to take pictures, but I always wanted to use them in the report.
Are you afraid that this reality could protect them from court?
I hope every judge will understand that no taxi driver could ride six or ten kroner miles because he wouldn't live there.
You've been talking about a trick with a tens of characters, especially in front of foreign customers by underwater taxi drivers.
Is it still up-to-date, or are they afraid to use this figurine after publishing your reports?
I think we've been popularizing this trick by sending the series.
I recently went with a cab driver, bragged to me that he was the honest cab driver.
Then I noticed that on the taximeter side, a sticker attached to the black sticker.
When I asked him what it had, he said to me, "You know what it is."
If a taxi driver didn't work too well, could a court judge with their colleagues warn them?
Is there anything you can do about it?
You've been talking about the way you think you're going to cheat, they'll always find it.
I don't think there's anything you can do.
But someone can push them out of these places.
And they're fair taxi drivers who should take more work to get them out of there.
From my experience, I have to say that these fair taxi drivers in Prague are fortunately overestimating.
But are they willing to go against those who deny their service?
They like it, but they're missing their mind.
She can't walk in it and she can't say exactly what they want.
When they arranged this demonstration (as a result of a proposal for comprehensive restrictions from Adriana Krnáč's office), they did not express very clearly what they really wanted.
They once said they didn't object to Uber, that they just wanted the same conditions as they had this service, and then they said they wanted more than Uber.
It turned out that they just blocked Prague and that only created the best possible advertising for Uber.
How do you overall evaluate the access of the Prague magistrate to the problem of driving?
It's obvious that she had to get into this until the criminal police found something out.
The magistrate was short on it.
There was a mole there that produced information, which means that the taxi department has been doing its job for several years completely out of control.
I hope that the officer will be charged with the final inspection of all the checks he's been subjected to to to be aware of what he's done.
That's the worst thing I've ever seen.
I was even with him on a check-in trip, which I found out until after their appointment.
It's been months since the last series was published.
What's the answer?
I'm thinking mainly of foreign spectators, rather than actually the most focused series.
Every time I have friends from abroad, I'll let them go.
And then when we go to the Old Town Square, there's a surprise that the same people who are seen on the scenes are really standing there.
Unfavorable Prague celebrities.
Oh, really.
I'd put a plate around them to keep people looking at them.
The Museum of Communism directly on the street.
My last question is clear.
Do you drive a taxi when you need it?
Sure.
I'm in a service that I don't have to pay for, but a card.
I use services like Uber or Liftago where there is no possibility of deception.
But there's a lot of dicks that are fair.
I've been taking a cab on the street since then.
The driver told me after he got into the car, "Well, you've got the courage."
I'll be in the dressing room for an Italian tourist.
It was written about the fraudulent practices of taxi drivers in 2005.
In the same year, a former Prime Minister, Paul Im, took a check trip to the Italian tourist resort and immediately went to her driver’s first attempt for two hundred.
But editor Rubes had worse experience.
The taxi drivers taught him to drive from Old Town to Václav Square 820 kroner, which is about 195 kroner per kilometer, as reported by the reporters.
The Prague Magistrate, however, set a maximum price of 28 kroner per kilometer.
The report also includes other surprising sums: for example, a two-kilometre trip from Paris Street to Trohlářýstá na turtu 400 koruna.
The expensive rides also provided taxis waiting for Karl's bridge.
For a trip to the Angel, which is five miles [2.5 km] away, they'll have to charge up to six hundred crowns.
The marble is washed mostly with clean water, the most without chemistry and the longer it lasts, the better.
The impurities from it go well, although sometimes the dirty must be put down with a scalpel, it must be removed from the jaws.
It's not easy, and it's not going to happen fast. It's getting close to your work by the restaurant Vanessa Trostová from Oldrich in The Hague.
Downstairs before it: the tomb is built by a leash, after which it is necessary to go out and descend again.
"The restaurant should be careful, patient and uncompromising in the working environment," she noted.
In Friedlance, it's not far from her first restoration work.
Thanks to it, for example, the stone elements of the facade were restored in the back of the Friedland Council, it also restored the statues of St. Mary Magdalena in Zatiš, St. John Nepomuck in Friedland, Piet in Friedland County Street, Mariana column in Friedland or atlanta in the pass of the spa in New City under Smrk.
With the reconstruction of Melchior, Kristof and Katerina from Rederna, it began in Friedlant in 2011.
Now the surface of the stone elements is cleansed from the stain of uncleanness and cross, the loose parts of the stone will be secured against falling and moving; either to the wall or to each other.
It is also waiting for treatment and preservation of the surface.
The inscriptions on the tomb will be gold again.
"Then it begins by grading the inscriptions on marble boards with red plate gold," said the State Memorial Care Rapporteur of the City Office in Frydlanto Véra Sobotová.
There are no records from the past that the tomb would have been repaired.
At a closer look, the openings turned into marble columns will be taken.
They're hundreds of years old and they're about the remains after the tomb is laid.
He was very handsome. Unfortunately, after the Swedish raid on the Thirty Years of War, everything disappeared.
They literally looked at the tomb, she noticed Sobot.
In the church of the founding of the Holy Cross there are the restaurants with a slight surprise as home.
After the flood in 2010, it was necessary to arrange the tombs that were felt under the water, restored the baptismal services, walled paintings in the tomb and now the tomb.
"We'd also like to go into the vitration in the future," Sobot said.
Otherwise the church is in a very good condition, every year to maintain and repair money.
Restoration work on the restoration of the Rederov grave will total 128 thousand crowns.
They will be played with grants, the city will not invest any money in this part of the renovation.
Hundreds of thousands of crowns will come from the national round of the historic city of 2015, the remaining 28 thousand crowns are the contribution of the Ministry of Culture, said Mayor Frydlanto Dan Ramzer.
The representative decided to release the victory for the restoration of the tomb.
Opinions of experts on future developments in selected foreign markets followed by indices and comparisons with the Czech Capital Market (PX) in the horizon of one month and a half years.
Low volatility and growth dominate markets.
Who would have said that at the beginning of the year?
The American S&P500 index, which went through 12% of the corrections in February, is today at a new historical peak and has already subscribed 7% since the beginning of the year.
Once again, the iron rule is confirmed that traders should never go against the interests of central banks, which have finally reached their own reach.
In a situation where US shares at the historical maximum are again failing volatility, which is currently the lowest since 2014, when markets grew satisfactorily and without fear due to the quantitative release of the US Central Bank and when, like today, the Volatility Index (VIX) remained stable below the 12% threshold.
And don't.
Although the Fed market is still preparing for a gradual increase in interest rates, quantitative release in Europe and Japan is in full flow and last week has also added its hand to the work of the Bank of England, which will purchase 70 billion pounds in the coming six months.
Thus, the new wave of quantitative release is already pushing so low results even lower and contributing to almost complete elimination of risks and fears from the future.
How long will this state last?
That's, of course, a million question.
At the moment, however, there are no risks at all, the world economy is going through almost constant growth without any major fluctuations, the situation in the commodity market and in China is stabilizing and Brexit is basically no longer the subject, so we should probably not be too surprised if the American stock remained in a similar calm regime.
It's a shame that Junker doesn't study Klaus!
I'm very glad my friend Michel Barnier took on this important and demanding task.
I wanted this difficult work of experienced policy, said the European Commission's chief Juncker, when the French policy (really experienced, because of so many of the diverse transnational political functions that we would look for a better example of the so-called European elite) appointed the European Commission's main negotiator to the terms of departure from the EU.
Juncker's election failed the signs hope that it is in the EU's serious interest to look with Britain for the form of future friendly coexistence.
However, most British media adopted the name Barnier as Juncker's war act.
Barnier is a rock European federalist.
Great Britain hates it.
As the European Commissioner for the Internal Market (2009-2014), he was concerned about the reform of European banking law.
He led her as he could only understand her: a hardened enemy of England's concept of free market and model of capitalism.
The presence of multilateral regulations was a co-author of the so-called banking union and is protecting against everything that comes from the London Financial Centre City.
So this Michel Barnier, the representative of Paris in dispute with London, will be a tough, unmistakable, and apparently an unbiased negotiator.
I don't think that's good news.
How can you not recall in this context the peaceful and friendly division of the Czechoslovak Federation, which has contributed so much to the balance, overview and capacity of Prime Minister Václav Klaus' empathy.
That's why today Czechs can be the closest friends and allies.
It's a shame Juncker didn't learn from Václav Clause - at least in this one.
It would be for everyone!
Earthquake around Putin?
Master Kremlin missed his close Ivan.
Russian President Vladimir Putin missed Sergei Ivanov on Friday from the post of head of the president's office.
Let's take his place, Anton Wynn.
She informed the Russian media about this by appealing to the Kremlu press release.
Putin indicated, however, that Ivano was leaving at his own request.
At a meeting broadcast by the 24th TV station of Rossia, the president said that he was going to meet Ivanov's wishes when he came to the office that he wanted to be the head of the president's office for a maximum of four years.
At the same time, he announced that Ivanov would be his special representative for the environment and transport.
The report on the exchange in front of the President of the Administration, now led by Ivanov's current representative, is considered relatively surprising.
Ivanov, who is 63 years old, is named one of Putin's closest associates.
This former KGB officer in the past, for example, served as Minister of Defence and Vice-President of the Government.
The President's seat of the Security Council is now also vacant.
Ivanov, at his meeting with Putin, said that he was actually a recordman at the head of the state administration.
He's been in it for four years and eight months.
In this regard, he recalled that 11 people had already been appointed for this function in 25 years since its establishment.
The Whites and the Deblists Strycs don't play the finals with Shafár.
So far, not one of the five tennis matches has been able to change in final participation.
As his first battle, Peter Quetová lost, which was subjected to the Puerto Rican surprise of Monica Puig after centuries 4:4, 6:1 and 3:6.
After a while, the Czech delilists also followed Shafári with Stryce.
The survivors of the Williams Sisters in the first set saw after the victory, however, two setboles were wasted and Russia finally used the set in the short game.
The second set then lost 4-6 ratios.
The Polish success in the early morning program in Rio recorded the Czech announcement: skier Ondřij Sonek won his semifinals with a review, when the second Damira Martina from Croatia won in almost a second, even after his release.
Today's good, the conditions were great, the wind calmed down.
I've been trying to save as much as I can, I've told the Son.
His opponents had to fight against him.
So it took some power off them, that might be easier tomorrow.
But I'm not saying it's gonna be easy, it's just playing in my karate, the Prussian Dukly messenger.
Mirka Topinkova-Knapkova but didn't walk in the Snow Whites.
A 15-year-old nanny sat in her fourth position in the semifinal today and on Saturday she is waiting for her start at the B final and fight at 7-12th.
The gold from London doesn't protect it.
For the first time, I didn't go to the finals at the Olympics.
I'm a little sorry, but on the other hand, I went to a high-quality race and I put everything in it.
The rivals were just better, the Topin's button was moving in front of them.
She fought to the end and believed that she would win in her fourth match between the elite six.
The fight gave up right before the target.
I knew the girls were balanced, that anyone in the field could get down.
I was surprised by the Chinese that she had such a finish.
And I thought I could get through the Rakushank to the final.
Unfortunately, today's life race went on, she told the 2011 World Championships.
Far beyond the final gates of Rio, young shooter Filip Nepeichal remained, who failed to get rid of his qualifications this time.
In it Nepeichal occupied 33rd place.
The qualification was the best for the Russians.
From the first line, Sergei Kamenskij descended with 629 points, from the second Kirill Grigorjan (628.9).
Nepeichal's shot had a value of 620.5 points.
For the first time in Rio, athletes also spoke, including Czech seven-man Kateřina Cachová and Eliška Klučinová.
The Cachs belong to the 11th place after the second discipline of the Olympic competition, the Czech recordman Eliška Klučinová is twenty-one.
British leader Katarina Johnson-Thampson, who jumped to a height of 198 centimeters as well as the second Belgian Nafissatou Thiam.
Both have taken care of the historically best expansion performance within the 7th.
They tried to jump 201 centimeters yet, but they didn't make it.
German, Russian, who's worse?
When we look at the absurdity of the questions raised here: The German society has gone through a deep seberflex, which is not Russian.
In both major Eurasian nations, dictators emerged in the 20th century and came to power by regimes that were inhuman, brutal and terrible.
From 1917 to 1989, Russian Bolsheviks have contributed a great deal to the 94 million victims of Communism, which the Black Book of Communism introduces, whether it is daily individual repression, targeted hunger, incompetent war management or non-human experiments.
In a non - German way, about 6 million Jews were starving, and the total victims of World War II are estimated to be 60 million.
In occupied or abandoned territories, the animals were carried out by the Germans and the Soviets.
In Germany and the USSR there were not only a few individuals, but a large part of the nation participated in these crimes either actively, passively or simply by rescuing their heads in the sand.
It's not just the specificities of these nations, we Czechs are likewise guilty.
In Germany, the immediate end of the war came denouncing, the Nuremberg Court.
But the most important thing came later.
When the children grew up, they began to ask: Father, grandfather, why did you participate in such superstitions?
How could you?
This has brought real reflection and healing to society.
German elites have recently taken care mainly of the prosperity of the country, the elimination of poverty, the welfare of their citizens.
Now they also have other (often naively idealistic) goals, but certainly they can't connect it back to Alsace-Lotrinski or someone - to rematch - military attack - maybe everyone will admit it.
There was no great reflection after the cold war in Russia.
The window of possible positive changes was definitely closed at the end of the millennium when the former KGB officer (sic!)Vladimír Putin came to power.
Often the criminal past is celebrated in Russia today.
Putinovske Russia's policy is revenge, acquisition of lost areas, humiliation of the West.
Health, prosperity and the future of its own people are of no value.
Fight yours, and the strangers will be afraid.
I still believe that it is only through those decades of despotic regime that the Russians are not genetically or culturally undermining - destined for Asian (self) tyranny.
Who's growing tension around Crimea?
Ukrainian army.
In recent days and hours there has been a deterioration of the situation at the Ukrainian-Russian border in the area of Crimea.
To whom does the growth of tension spring?
After a longer period of relative peace, there has been a further deterioration of relations between Ukraine and Russia.
The Ukrainian side's castle became the island of Crimea, which was connected to Russia more than 2 years ago and is part of its territory.
The reports from both sides of the enemy are, of course, contradictory and difficult to verify independently, so we have only the possibility of thinking about the old known question to whom?
According to reports from Moscow, terrorist attacks on Crimea have occurred on the Ukrainian side, which is clearly Ukraine's refusal and on the contrary, the Kremlin accuses of provocation.
For information on the arrest of members of Ukrainian special units in the territory of Russia, it has already come from the pilot Savchenkov's known response that they were allegedly abducted in the territory of Russia.
If we were to join the Ukrainian version, what would Russia benefit from the deterioration of the situation around Crimea?
The simple answer is: nothing.
The escalation of tension around Crimea can only harm Russia, mainly from the West, in the form of further sanctioning and strengthening the anti-Russia campaign.
In the last year, the immigration crisis in Europe has led to a decline in attention from the situation in Ukraine.
Ukrainian leadership has already lost all credit before its inhabitants, when the current support of President Poroshenko moves about 15%.
Ukraine's economy would have long since been bankrupt because of the lack of cheap financial injection by the EU and especially by the IMF.
In this situation, the Ukrainian regime needs to pay close attention to its country again to justify its further requests for financial assistance and to try to improve its reputation before voters in its country.
President Poroshenko and other members of the management of the force components want to show themselves again as strong men who are afraid of becoming a great Russian.
It is only hoped that all those who are trying to resolve an open conflict between Ukraine and Russia will finally realize their huge responsibility for the lives of not only soldiers but all ordinary people on both sides of the enemy and stop their enemy action.
Bulgaria first showed inflation in eight months
According to national statistics, in Bulgaria, the monthly rate of inflation reached 1 % in July.
This is the highest value for several years (since June 2012) and the first non-zero value since October last year when a positive inflation rate of 0,2 % was published.
The annual average rate of inflation measured by the CPI index in the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared with the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8 %.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101,0 %, the monthly inflation was 1,0 %.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (June 2016 versus December 2015) was -0.2 % and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 against July 2015 was -0.2 %.
In contrast to the previous month, in July 2016, there was an increase in the travel of these consumer groups: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transport (1.8%), culture and recreation (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), other goods and services (0.3%).
A decrease in prices occurred in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household equipment and normal maintenance (0.5%), health (0.1%).
At the same level as the previous month, prices remained for alcoholic beverages and tobacco products, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communication and education.
The U.S. secret services watched the Russian hacker attacks last year.
Information on Russian attacks was obtained to the public last month when the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced that it was responsible for the attack on servers of the site centre of the Democrats.
But there's no official report on Russia's involvement in the attack.
Moscow's share of the attack has been denied.
The report on the monitoring of the alleged Russian attack was extremely secret, because its expression would reveal that US secret services were monitoring and revealing a hacker attack could also be the way they do it and the resources they use.
Two Russian intelligence services were involved in the attack.
New Advisory Body for Cybersecurity
The Russian track tracking material was coded and only a small group of experts had access to it, wrote Reuters.
Only a small group of eight Congressional Members, called the United States gang, was informed of public factors.
It is composed of both the Chief Chambers of Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, the Presidents of the two Chambers of Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid, and four members of the Defence and Security Committees of Congress.
On Thursday, the head of the Democratic Party of Donna Brazil announced that he is setting up a cyber security advisory committee to "stop future attacks and ensure the first-class protection of the servers of the Democratic Party".
There was a dangerous parasite in the seized salmon from Albert.
The priest apologized.
On the basis of the consumer's incentive for health problems after consumption of the food Losos wildeze - pieces 100 g, date of consumption 22.11.2016, Prague hygienics carried out control in Albert's shops at Václav Square and Na Můstka.
The verification found that the charges L23012562/T4 with the date of consumption 22.11.2016, on which the customer pointed out that no longer available, and therefore the product of the same charge with the date of consumption was obtained on 11.12.2016.
The presence of Anisakis spp. Anisakis simplex was confirmed by laboratory examination.
It's a parasitic worm of the seaweed grass.
This is dangerous to man - larvae in the body cavity or in the body fish are a strong allergen and man-skinned live larvae can penetrate through the stomach wall into the internal organs, says Štich.
Customers are very sorry for the problems with this brand product.
We immediately withdrew that charge from the sale and for preventive reasons we withdrew all other charges of this item.
There was a doubt on the supplier's side that we were dealing with, and at the same time we let this product test ourselves, said Newsman Albert Barbor Vanko.
If the customer buys this product, he can return it in any of the stores chain and get the money back.
Larynx destroys frost and enough heat correction
The seller was the company Nekton - Vrnáta.
The health authorities informed the Prague and Central Czech veterinary authorities of the existence of a dangerous product.
According to the food safety server.cz people after sighting of the parasite may be ill with an ansaciosis that occurs with severe abdominal pain, vomiting and nausea, or disease can occur indiscriminately, the CHK said.
Symptoms will be delivered up to two weeks after consumption of insufficiently heat-treated infected fish.
After three weeks from the start of the larvae disease, the majority will spontaneously leave the tract.
Adult worms and larvae are sensitive to high and low temperatures, so they are killed either by sufficient heat processing of fish meat or by freezing it.
The veterinarians were currently checking the salmon also with the recipient of imported goods in the Mediterranean region.
Three of the five samples studied had parasites in them.
The consignment arrived in the Czech Republic in 1700 according to the State Veterinary Administration (SVS) at the beginning of April.
Dispatched, in the absolute majority of the Ahold chain, there were 919 packages to this day.
Currently, there is a download of unsold stock of the product from the sales, spokesperson SVS Petr Peichal said on Friday.
As soon as positive samples were found, the veterinarians prohibited the dispatch of other products from the warehouse.
Seventeen-year-old Britk wanted to get out of Rakka, probably killed her by a Russian raid.
After the initial excitement and the fast girl with the jihadist who was killed by the attacks, there was an explosion.
The expected paradise of the caliph turned for British girls into hell on earth from which there was no escape.
The girl was related to her sister Halimo.
She called Britain repeatedly and believed she wanted to go home.
Leaving the Islamic State is like trying to escape Alcatraz.
They have no intention of shooting, quoted The Telegraph of the family lawyer Tasnim Akunjee.
The last steps led to Rakka, from there the girl called last.
Then there's just a report about her death, but she can't be verified.
The family communicated with her from an apartment in East London.
They discussed how she could get out of Rakka and cross the Turkish border.
That's where they hoped they'd meet the former student again.
Cadiz, however, was probably killed before she could escape because the house she was staying in was compared to the country in May, British ITV News reported.
Television added that the bomb was apparently dropped by a Russian aircraft that attacked the IS garden in Syria.
You'd be able to take the blue out of the sky just to get your child out of a dangerous area, said Tasnim Akunjee, a family lawyer.
In the week that she (Kadiza) was thinking about escape from the territory of the Islamic State, one Rakušanka was caught while trying to escape and was publicly killed to death, according to the information available.
I think that's what Kadiza said as a warning, and she decided to worry, which is according to BBC Akunjee.
The family would do anything.
Kadiza Sutlana, along with 15-year-old friends from Shamimo Begumov School and Amir Abass, were released on the 17th of February last year.
The only thing they said at home was they were going out.
But they headed to Gatwick Airport and from there across Turkey to the territory of the controlled IS.
The girl's family according to the lawyer did everything in her power to get Kadiz back.
You would take the blue out of the sky just to get your child out of a dangerous area and this family did everything she could to get her daughter home.
But it wasn't possible without the risk of being caught by the lawyer himself.
The only positive thing he believes is that Kadiz's fate can serve as a frightening case for other girls or even boys who let themselves be fooled by Islamic propaganda.
"There are many cases where people went there, realized how things were, understood how far it was from the promises of the Islamic State propaganda, and wanted to return," Akunjee further noted.
The fate of Kadiz's associates is unknown.
However, because they have also been silent, their families must be at peace with the fact that they are most likely dead.
To prison for money.
In Scotland, you can go online without committing a crime.
For many centuries Inveraray was the regional center and settlement of the archbishop of Argyll.
Since the middle of the 18th century, courts have been held at the councilhouse and there has been a subterranean service as a local prison.
The conditions in which they lived were sad and many prisoners tried to escape.
A lot of them have been successful.
That's why the city's representatives decided to move the prison's premises to a new place.
The new building was completed in 1848 and was much more attractive, warm and gas lighting to the prisoners.
It has not been in operation for a long time since the end of August 1889 for economic reasons, since smaller repairs were expensive and did not pay too much.
The stories of the gymnasts and the ghost hunt.
For the public, the prison opened in a century later, visitors can compare the old building to a new one to see for themselves how different conditions prevailed.
Guides in age costumes are still strengthening their authentic experience.
To see, there is also a torture room where visitors can learn what forms of punishment were applied to criminals, whether it was the grinding of fingers or the burning of marks on the body.
During the tour, tourists may be allowed to close themselves to one of the goals, mostly because of the photo on the memory, or to convey the sense of the prisoners living on the grid.
In addition, the Inveraray prison is one of the most famous Scottish localities, where he allegedly fears.
Several groups of paranormal hunters have already been released and today the museum allows people to come and catch some ghosts.
That night, however, will amount to 300 pounds, which is estimated to be about 9500 crowns.
In addition to this popular tourist attraction, the village is also looking for great food, surrounding panoramas and history.
"Anime" effect on Snapchat is criticized as Asian cartoon
According to Snapchat, this filter is inspired by animity, but some observers say it is racially sensitive.
The Snapchat app every day allows about 150 million users to change reality and play with the identity of ways that border with absurdity.
You can make yourself a pineapple, a dog or a character that looks like it's coming out of Roye Lichtenstein's picture.
Filters are simple tools that deform reality and every day generate more than 30 million improved selfishs.
Any mistake will be made immediately.
Snapchat filters in the past served a criticism of the claim that the application promotes blackfacing or that it supports white shades of skin as an ideal beauty.
So when this week she offered the users a filter that made them look smooth, curved teeth and swollen faces, some critics called it the Asian racist character - "yellowface."
And they asked if these repeated controversial questions did not indicate a greater problem for society - a problem with diversity.
On Wednesday Verge and Motherboard wrote and the news and the excitement spread rapidly and Snapchat immediately indicated that he had canceled the function.
The company offered an explanation: The filter was meant as an expression of the account of the characters, not as an Asian cartoon.
But to observers who were witnesses of racism, the filter detected painful stereotypes in action.
The others with no packaging compared to the anims refused.
Grace Spapani, a student of American art from Korea whose tweet about photographs was widely shared, said in an e-mail that the filter was "at least harmful and embarrassing."
She added that “it is difficult to argue against the comparison of the obvious Asian character and the effects of the filter.
It is shown that the filter is not only about the yellow face (yellow face), but that the yellow face is involved in the ugly extremities.
Snapchat is not the only company that exceeded these cultural boundaries.
It seems that American culture has an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from sitting down in companies after Hollywood and the equipment that we all carry in our hands.
And the huge number of young people in Snapchat - who are more racially diverse than their older partners - can mean that even greater sensitivity can be expected.
“When one Snapchat filter creates an image that is offensive to some user,” said fifty-five Katie Zhu on Thursday in the conversation, “only very difficult these things are going around today without notice, as it was before.”
Katie Zhuová, the product manager and designer who works for Medium, decided on Thursday to put her account on Snapchat and invited others to do the same.
In the article for the Media and in the telephone interview, she stated that she was convinced that racially motivated problems reflected the lack of diversity in the workforce in Snapchat.
Katie Zhuová criticised the top white, completely male management of the company, and the article matched the hash tag: #DeleteSnapchat.
“It’s either that there is no diversity and color people between employees at the time they decide on these things,” said Zhu, who has Chinese-American origin, “or color people work there, but not in positions to feel safe or pleasant to talk about.”
The other observers share her opinion - the complaint that Snapchat left to a considerable extent without an answer.
The company does not publish numbers relating to the diversity of its employees by having private company status.
On Thursday Snapchat refused to talk about the racial origin of his employees, but according to the spokesperson, she recently accepted a recruiter who should focus on the poorly represented population and on the internal management of inclusion.
Zhuová adds: “I wonder if they really need other users who can say that it’s not okay,” with their account being cancelled.
The military officials drew up the report on the IS, the parliamentary committee said.
In a report issued on Thursday, the parliamentary committee stated that officials from the United States Central Command had changed the reports of the reporting services in order to express a more optimistic image of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than they had provided.
According to the preliminary report of the Working Group drawn up by the President of the Republican Armed Forces Committee, the Committee on Reporting Services and the Defence Sub-Committee, a "extensive Dissatisfaction" was identified between the central intelligence services analysis, according to which their supervisors changed their assessment of the American effort to defeat the Islamic State.
The Central Command, known as CentCom, is an army headquarters in Tampea, Florida, which oversees American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The press release states: “The results of the secret intelligence services approved by Centcom officials usually offered a more positive picture of the counter-terrorism efforts of the United States than were confirmed by the facts on earth and were consistently more positive than the analyses obtained from other parts of the reporting community.”
"What happened in Centcom is unacceptable - our fighters are damaged when a misanalysis is presented to political leaders," said Ken Calvert, congressman and Republican from California.
The failure to lead Centcom reaches the top of the organization.
The ten-page report describes in detail the ongoing problems of the Central Staff in describing and analysing American efforts in training Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
Although there is no decisive evidence that the top representatives of Obama's administration ordered the reports to be modified, it is reported that analysts had the impression that they were under pressure by the Centcom leaders to present a more optimistic view of the dangers posed by the Islamic State or the IS.
"In the first half of 2015, many Central Staff press reports, statements and statements from Congress were much more positive than what they actually were," the report states.
For example, the representative of Centcom publicly announced that a major military attack on Mosul's takeover could begin in April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"This is quite clear after months of investigation," said Ambassador Mike Pompeo, representative of the Republican side of Kansas in the statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the highest position staff of the U.S. Central Intelligence Service have manipulated the staff's outputs in order to exacerbate the threat of IS in Iraq.
The Republicans formed a working group after they learned about the concerns of analysts that the information of the intelligence services concerning the Islamic State was manipulated.
After the report published on Thursday, further examination must be followed by further examination.
Centcom's reporting services are still conducting further investigations conducted by the Ministry of Defence's Chief Inspector.
Democratic members of the Committee on Reporting Services published their own findings on Thursday, which corresponded to some of the conclusions of the Working Group of the Republicans.
" Between 2014 and 2015 Centcom has created a very close process for compiling the evaluation of information on IS and Iraqi security components," said representative Adam B. Schiff, Chairman of the Committee and representative of the Democrats.
According to Adam Schiff, this process " led to the conversion of the outputs of the intelligence services", damaged the morale between analytics and "inadequately took into account inconsistencies".
However, Schiff and the Democrats claim that they did not find any evidence that the White House would try to press on Centcom's analysis to correct their conclusions according to the "proposals or political situation".
Preliminary results of the parliamentary investigation were published in the Daily Beast on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times reported on the ongoing investigation of Inspector General Pentagon, which was initiated following the complaints of Centcom analysts.
Commander-in-chief Patrick Evans, spokesperson for the Pentagon, stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the parliamentary report because the investigation of the Inspector General is still ongoing.
He said, however, that "experts sometimes do not agree to the interpretation of complex data and that the reporting community and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these fundamental issues of national security."
The investigation has an impact on the framework of the question whether the Americans are successful in bombing Iraq and Syria (a sentence now declaring an increasing number of defence representatives).
However, last year's indictment raised questions about the extent to which President Obama can rely on the central headquarters's honest evaluation of the military operation in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
The criticism of the report on the Islamic State has reflected conflicts for more than ten years, when an analyst at Centcom's intelligence services, Gregory Hooker, wrote a research work stating that the administration of President George W. Bush - despite the opposition of many analysts - defended a small unit in Iraq and spent only a little time thinking about what would follow the invasion in 2003.
Hooker also played a key role in resistance to the Islamic state's intelligence services.
Last year the authorities announced that Hooker's team had concluded that despite the public statement of opposition, the air strikes against the Islamic state's refineries did not significantly weaken the financial resources of this terrorist group because the group had built temporary refineries and oil sales on the black market.
The Times reported in September that the investigation was not transferred outside the Central Staff.
Commander Centcom, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was then criticized last year after many legislators sought the Senate's testimony by too positive a war assessment.
General Austin resigned in April and replaced Gen Joseph L. Votel in Centcom.
United States won the fourth match in the ground hockey series, so today a decisive match will be played in the UK team
Katie Bamov in the match against Japan, which ended with victory 6:1, shot three branches and only a day later for the American women's team of ground hockey shot the first two branches of the match in which America defeated India 3:0 on Thursday.
Five branches in two matches are a good memory, but Bamová (27) said she was not sure if something like that ever happened.
"I have no idea," she said.
I don't belong to those who write down their branches.
But this is what he knows: The Americans at the Olympics lead to the 4th and are divided into the first place in the group with Great Britain, which remained on Thursday after the defeat of Japan 2:0 remained unbeatable.
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last round.
Both teams qualified to the quarter final and the match will decide which of the six teams will end in the first and who will end in the second.
A team from the first place will be spared for a while the strong days that are in front of the second group.
Whatever the end of the Saturday game, the Americans here caused their surprise ride, four years after they ended up among the 12 teams playing in London.
There was Bam on the team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and took a hockey game on the ground when she was 3 years old (her older twin sisters played in Drexel) and joined the national team when she was 16 and became his youngest player at all.
The 2008 Olympics were avoided because they didn't get on the final list.
Then came the year 2012, when neither she nor the members of her team were successful.
Next year he was appointed a coach named Englishman Craig Parnham and things started to change.
"Cultural change, mental change, physical change," Bamová said.
In London, we didn't have the rate of work we have today.
We've made a full turn.
On Thursday night Bam began the first half of the shooting of a branch known as the neighborhood.
India entered the match without winning the tournament, but the team proved to be surprisingly hard and kept score 1:0 until the end of the third quarter, when Bam used the opportunity.
She ran off the left side of the playing field, then called in the middle and shot the ball into the branch to get the Americans in command 2:0.
Melissa Gonzalez added the last branch in half a quarter.
The exclusion of the U.S. industry, Jackie Briggs, who in each of the three wins helped to one goal, was at least the first on the tournament.
He's in excellent shape.
Just like Bam.
"Now we are in a good place," Parnham said, but how good it is, it will depend on the result of the Saturday match.
Zen trampoline in the middle of the Olympic season
It doesn't matter where you are, it doesn't matter what time it is - it's an Olympic.
From the events in Rio de Janeiro, there is a feeling of sustained, indescribable and excited concentration of competition and effort.
It's like the Olympic descent itself is a hot rod wheel that is handed over from the shooter to the swimmer, the gymnast and the triathlonist.
You can't turn on the TV, read the paper or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the front of the cafe without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the inanimateness between Michael Phelps and Chad Le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who comes in love with women with dolls in his face, is on the Olympics for the first time, and could also be among those whose names will ring in the homes in the main broadcast time between advertising and sponsorship spots, if he is a swimmer, gymnast or even a Shemmir.
But Dooley (28) from Lake Forest in California is fighting for Olympic gold in the trampoline jumps.
The Olympic fire doesn't shine on all the competitions anyway.
Far from the middle, there are some in the shadow sports that are not generally recognized: air gun shooting, gun shooting, badminton, taekvondo.
We'll always succeed in classic swim style - and we'll probably rule for a long time.
But if I can name my extraordinary favorite, let me point to the ingenious magic of trampoline.
Although there are jumps on the trampoline Olympic sport since 2000, when they were first mentioned in the games in Sydney, after 16 years of intervention this sport remains almost unnoticed - many people I questioned didn't even know it was an Olympic sport.
It could be regional bankruptcy.
The United States never won a medal in the trampoline jumps and by 2012 none of the athletes got to the finish.
Prices in the male category are usually divided between China and Russia and in the female category between China and Canada.
This year the gold medals from London will watch Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada.
The jumps on the trampoline have yet another pity, partly because the ear of the unaccompanied will seem to be more suitable at the clown university than at the Olympics.
I have to admit that I'm not an expert, but just an emotion following from the ground.
It has a comic potential - a comic vibration of endless reflection - but also a variety of gymnastics and diving, two sports that combine.
The word "trampoline" is derived from the Spanish word "el trampoline", which means "Scocan board".
The aspiring champions jump on a huge trampoline that shoots it up to nearly 10 meters and conducts compositions with several elements (salts, fevers and combinations) before finally landing on their feet again.
According to the official Olympic programme, performance, difficulties and "airtime" are assessed.
In Rio, he will compete for twenty athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women.
The usual route of the Olympic road is ahead.
The gold medal fighters must go on, faster and even higher, sometimes to the end, sometimes back and forth, up and down.
He is trying to achieve not only the target band or the start-up wall, but also, as TV news reports indicate, a different line of thought: a world record or an Olympic record.
This one-thinking effort is noble, amazing, a little fanatical - and enough to make the spectators cry.
But I think it's a little exhausting while watching the Olympics.
Jumps to the trampoline in this regard bring the left.
The track of the athlete on the trampoline is heading up.
It doesn't make sense to move forward.
He or she reflects as if they were in a state of no weight like astronauts, flying up, down, and then again without any movement up.
Without competition and, of course, no difficulty, but during the duration of the composition, there will be no vicious fight to achieve the goal, no measurement of distance, but only perfect, smooth delivery of time and gravity.
This is only the closest when the Olympics and the Zens are approaching.
Qualifications and finals of women take place on Friday afternoon, 13 hours east time, then male competitions on Saturday at the same time.
The NBC station will finally be broadcast within the afternoon block, which starts after both days within 14 hours.
In the midst of the Olympic madness, they promise a peaceful, pleasant time that you will likely review in the course of the other fights.
And if he has the attention to achieve only that male athletes will be the subject of loving views and distractions - as the Wall Street Journal has recently suggested by the U.S. High Schools - then Logan Dooley is only waiting for his new fans who are breathing.
“Protesting generation” in Ethiopia, long-term United States
Violent protests in Ethiopia
The demonstrators demanding political changes in Ethiopia have attacked the violent resistance of the government.
The witnesses claim that many protestors were shot during the meetings with the police.
Is there a threat of war in Ethiopia?
In recent decades it has been one of the most stable nations in Africa, a strong Western alliance with a rapidly growing economy.
Over the last few months, however, the country has been fascinated by counter-government unrest, which has spread to more and more areas.
Only in the last week have thousands of people who are demanding fundamental political changes been put on the streets.
According to human rights organisations, the government's reaction was unmerciful.
The witnesses claim that the police shot and killed representatives of unarmed demonstrators.
On rolling video footage from protests that are probably from the end of last year or the beginning of this year, security forces are captured as young people are beaten by holes after being forced to stand on the wall.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights is now requesting a thorough investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country together and to take a step forward will be even harder," said Rashid Abdi, the leader of the Horn of Africa project for the International Crisis Group.
Ethiopia is the second most populous nation in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is supported by the West.
The US military and intelligence services work closely with Ethiopia to eliminate the threat of a terrorist attack in the area, especially in Somalia, and many from African countries, if any, receive such assistance from the West.
The economy of Ethiopia has developed at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has improved in a fundamental way - in Addis Ababa, the main city, even a new suburban train.
And the streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia can hardly be described as a model of democracy - an organization fighting for human rights without standing speaks of government repression - opposition in the country was suppressed, dissidents were effectively silenced.
Many were pronounced, imprisoned, executed, or driven far into the wilderness.
But that can change.
"When people are suffocated and they have no option but to protest, there will be a breach," said Seyoum Teshome, who teaches at the university in central Ethiopia.
All young people are protesting.
He's been protesting the whole generation.
The complaint is a lot and concerns all of the disputes about the ground after absolute control of the power of the ruling coalition.
After the last elections, which have been widely criticised, the ruling party and its allies have won the last seat of the opposition and now controls 100 per cent in parliament.
At the same time, there is increasing pressure on the border with Eritrea. The conflict along this inaccurate, controversial border has claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups, who have been mostly oppressed over the past few years, such as the Oromsk Liberation Front or the Ugandan National Liberation Front, may try to use confusion and rearm themselves.
There are several factors that explain why, now after years of exposure to the surface, these bitter feelings have been rekindled.
The first of them is apparently harmless: smart phones.
Many Ethiopians can communicate through social networks up to the last few years, when they have become commonly more affordable cheap phones and improved the provision of Internet services.
And even though the government prohibits access to Facebook or Twitter, as is usually the case during protests, many people can still communicate via the internet proxy that hides the position of these people.
Several young Ethiopians spoke about how they met for protests.
There is also greater solidarity between Oromy and Amhary, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Arums and the Amhars are not natural allies.
After a long time Amhar, mostly from the Christian peaks of Ethiopia, they emerged in politics and trade and used Oroms, many of whom are Muslims and live in humble dwellings.
But it's changing, too.
"We are on our way to united leadership," said Mulata Gemech, leader of Oromo.
The biggest protests were in the areas of Amhary and Oromy.
Many Amharians and Oromas believe that Ethiopia is illegally dominated by the Tigris ethnic members, who make up about 6 per cent of the population and control the army, the intelligence services, trade and politics.
The third cause of anxiety is Melese Zenawi's death.
Zenawi, the former leader of the rebels, was the Ethiopian president of the government for the entire 17 years until his death in 2012, when he suffered from that disease.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could see a horn.
Analysts say that especially skillfully he was able to detect the initial signals of discontent and use the senders to process and gain the opponents on his side.
"The current regime is losing fundamental awareness," said Abdi, an analyst for the conflict.
The new President of the Government of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn, was drawn from a relative ignorance to replace Zenawi.
Unlike Zenawi, who came from the Tigris region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he has no confidence in the security services of the Tigers.
Many fear that the result will be another bloodshed.
Finally, Ethiopia experienced such unrest in 2005 after thousands of people protested against what analysts labeled as elections that the government had taken and then stole.
He was following a hard strike, during which many protesting deaths - although less than in recent months - had passed relatively quickly.
Development experts assessed the Ethiopian leaders for visionary infrastructure planning, which is a new suburban train and measurable progress in the fight against poverty.
It is clear, however, that the gradual increase in disputes within the Ethiopian government has not stopped it.
And it comes to dangerous ethnic formation.
Last month, trade firms belonging to the Tigers and protection against the Tigers on social networks attacked Gondar in the city of Amharic.
Analysts say the protests lead to an unpleasant situation in the United States and other Western allies.
The U.S. government is using Ethiopia as a base for drone crossings over neighboring Somalia, although it recently declared that the base was closed.
While the West wants to clearly support democracy, at the same time it does not want its allies to break up in such an uninhabited area.
"That," said Abdi, "is a very sharp limit of sharpness."
Donald Trump explains his statement about Obama and funding IS as "sarkasmus"
On Friday, Donald J. Trump tried to bagatize the latest controversy that flooded his campaign by declaring that he did not mean seriously when several times this week he insisted that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the terrorist group of the Islamic State.
The explanation raised new questions about the ability of the Republican candidate to speak clearly to the American public.
It also puts his stand in an unpleasant situation, which in an effort to defend him in a stormy time, and must explain that he may not have thought seriously about his remarks.
After this proposal at a meeting Wednesday night Trump confirmed his statement on Thursday and argued in the talks that he really had no intention of saying that President and H. Clinton's IS had been created.
However, in his contribution to Twitter on Friday morning, Trump said he was only sarcastic.
The contribution was once again the claim of the old only one day when Trump said in several interviews that he was serious about his accusation.
When conservative moderator Hugh Hewitt tried to calm down Trump's remark that Obama was trying to destroy the IS, the Republican candidate did not respond to the president.
The latest storm comes at a time when Trump has tried to focus his campaign on the economy, while his preferences in pre-election research are declining.
Trump and Clinton took part in a duel in Michigan this week on economic issues.
On Friday, Trump tried to get back to this topic.
On Twitter he warned again that Clinton's proposals were linked to tax increases, and he said her speech was boring.
Trump used the defense sarcasm before.
At the end of July, when he heard a wave of criticism when he proposed that the Russians should go through Clinton's e-mails, explain his note later: "I am of course sarcastic."
This approach enables Trump to push the limits of political statements and to reduce them as necessary.
“I think it’s his way of testing, to what extent some reports have a response to his supporters to find out how they react, and then, in response to one or the other, “give an explanation”, said Ruth Sherman, a communication specialist who monitored the language that both candidates used.
But I also think that it is in its declarations that it is reverse and knows that they are sufficiently important to be able to explain it differently.
Because the results of pre-election research continue to decrease in its benefits, Trump has chosen even more ostentatious tone in recent days, instead of reducing things for general voters.
The new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist survey, which was published on Friday, showed that Tump is with a great distance to Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado and very close to her in Florida.
Trump is at all trying to avoid apologizing for provocative sentences he says, but often his criticism blames him for his mistaken interpretation of his words or for not understanding his sense of humor.
But along with the fact that Trump is facing increased attention in the final months of the presidential campaign, Trump's jokes have led to the unpleasant situation of his loyal stand, which must be publicly behind him, whatever his remarks are.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former prime minister of New York City, one of the most prominent members of Trump's ranks, had to defend the candidate for CNN on Thursday.
"I think what he says is a legitimate political comment," Giuliani said when asked about the credibility of Trump's claim that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
That is true in the sense that before Obama, IS was almost unknown, a small organization that he wrongly called a novelist, and it came to be because he had landed his army from Iraq.
Most of the ordinary Republicans are trying to argue that Obama's government, in which Clinton has acted as foreign ministers, has allowed the IS to flourish and fail to manage the situation aggressively in the Middle East.
Before Friday's meetings in Pennsylvania Trump continued on Twitter, he kept himself on fire to the media because they were changing each of his words and are interested in him.
He spoke to the "poor, pathetic" TV students who are trying to understand it and said, "It can't!"
Several Democrats have apologised to Trump that this is just another proof that he is not eligible for the presidency.
The coffee shop was pushed out of the price market.
The Verb Cafe coffee shop was a fancy place in Williamsburg where you could only pay in cash, without Wi-Fi, but where coffee has been served for 15 years.
Of course, it turns out that she was pushed from the front door to the Bedford Avenue.
Soap Cherie - the shop that Verb replaced in 2014 - sells soap in the form of cakes.
The locals regretted it as the last loss of a growing city.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: "New York is a change, I know, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, hotel Chelsea is executed, and from Verb is now a trading medium."
But if New York's changed, then it's also reappearing.
The resurrected Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new Verb has WiFi and accepts payment cards, but there are some of the original employees working there and there is a similar, modest atmosphere.
Coffee's still good, too.
The manager of the new Word is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-term employee of the original coffee shop, who is at the same time the owner and executive director of the new place.
In Verb he started in 2001 and remained until the end.
When one of his clients offered him to pay for the move to a new place, he said he would do it with joy.
Rodriguez (36) left a lot of things as they were.
Verb still has the same baker and bought the same model machine for espresso.
He even again used the light from the old Word.
But Rodriguez said he also wanted to try something new.
He started using new sentences.
In the offer are sandwiches with ham, egg and cheese and toppings such as capes and fried onion.
You'll also find a bowl of rice.
The coffee shop no longer supplies beer, but offers you fresh fruit juices.
After nine months, Rodriguez noticed a constant flood of original printers.
"The number of original customers from Williamsburg also had to move away because of prices," he said.
Last week there was one of those clients, Rebecca Oliveirov.
Mrs. Oliveirová (34) lived in Williamsburg and went to Verb Cafe often.
She even came when the coffee shop moved to Greenpoint.
She said that when Verb closed up, she stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I found out that what I like is coffee and culture in Verb," she said.
Now he's drinking coffee again, but on that day, instead of his usual ice coffee, he gave himself a mixed chai, another news item.
Tom Rosenthal, another long-term customer, has been faithfully going to Verb since 2003.
He goes before work and orders the same thing.
"In the fourth and eighth days, every day, like the hours, I will come and already prepare for me my goose with everything and butter," he said.
Photo: Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new and add a new quote.
Mr. Rosenthal is still ordering what he usually likes, but sometimes on his own he's gonna let everything go with bacon, eggs and ham.
Rodriguez said he's not sorry that the soap shop took his old place.
The truth is that the owners of Soap Cherie offered him to produce special soap for Verb and use filtered coffee from the coffee shop as a substitute.
"I think we could still use it," said Rodriguez.
The traditional Polish residents of Greenpoint also welcomed the coffee shop.
One of the new customers translated the offer into Polish, and Rodriguez said he wanted to find a place where he would soon show it so that his new neighbors would feel at home.
The new place has other advantages.
Local fruit growers want to stick into the bottle and sell filtered coffee.
There is a possibility that the coffee shop will expand into a neighboring building.
A lot of customers are enough to get their old favorite back.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer, and when the coffee shop closed, his heart broke.
Mr. Whitt says when the coffee shop opened again, going in and having coffee is like coming home.
"I missed the smell," he said.
Depressive food from the time of the crisis - in "Square Meal"
Shortly after joining the president's office in March 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat at the Oval's workshop and lunch.
Labužník President Roosevelt enjoyed selected food from the 5th Avenue, like a chicken puppie and a Maryland turtle soup.
His menu for this day was more modest: eggs in the devil's way in a paradise sauce, potatoes, and as dessert of a svestsk pudding.
"It was an act of cooking solidarity with the people who suffered," Jane Ziegelman said.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, added: “It was also a message for Americans to eat.”
A couple living in Brooklyn Heights are devoted to gastronomic history.
The last book by Andrew Coea "Chop Suey" was about Chinese cuisine in America, while Jane in her book "97 Orchard" told the life story of the house on the Lower East Side through food.
Their new "A Square Meal" joint work, published by Harper on Tuesday, is the history of the American cuisine during the great economic crisis.
They have shown their solidarity with the cook and met with the reporter at dinner in Eisenberg's shop with sandwiches, a small strict buffet in the area of Flatiron, which has been in operation since the crisis, since 1929.
Jane (54) ordered cream cheese and a sandwich with chopped olives, Andrew (57) gave it a crocan, potato cheese and mixed vegetables.
The reporter ordered a mass carbanate that, according to a couple, went to a very good food interview during the crisis.
"Carbanáts were very popular," said Ms. Ziegelman.
He was selling buraca, liver and pheasant carbanate.
They were made from that mixture and other cheap foods that set up the ingredient.
Stop the bunch of bullies you'd have to eat for dinner.
Andrew Coe got hurt.
"They would lie in your stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the crisis, the American cuisine, especially in rural areas, was given as a buffet of what you dream.
The women's teams cooked for farm workers and served breakfast, lunch and dinner with a freshly baked cake.
They were the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the first world war. "A Square Meal" is watching how the nation compares itself with that it was not a land of fertility.
"It was the time when the food became a central, feared point for the American people," Coe said in an explanation why he and his wife decided to write about it.
A new budget diet was also feared: secret food, such as carbunettes and castral foods, castral as "a wonderful way to use the remains," Ziegelman said, as cooks could hide non-esthetic dishes under the layer of cream sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
The meat - after a long year of central American food - became cheaply allocated to luxury.
The strange blends, which were to serve as calorie and nutrients, had a preference before taste or even healthy sense of cooking.
During the study for a book containing recipes, Ms. Ziegelman prepared a meal of baked onion filled with burak butter.
"It wasn't a favorite dinner table growth," Andrew Coe said.
Jane Ziegelman stressed: "It was surreal."
Burak butter with baked onions doesn't go together.
It was typical for a lot of home recipes.
As never before and never after, domestic economists - among them Louise Stanley, the head of the Federal Office of the Home Economy in 1923 to 1943 - guided the country’s digestive habits.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they called on women to take over the budget, and they turned cream spaghetti with carrots into delicious foods.
The book "A Square Meal" is a celebration of historical observances.
In particular, the food was produced in response to the government's hunger for its citizens, as it may be, outside President Herbert Hoover, "I will have a cake".
While publicly praising the simple Iow Farmer's kitchen of his childhood, he served as the chosen millionaire to whom he became.
"He liked eating continental cuisine, such as fish with currant sauce," Andrew Coe said.
He was eating in a pretty fancy room, wearing a tuxedo.
He was incredibly old-fashioned.
President Roosevelt would probably have made the same mistakes if his wife, Eleanor, did not accept him as an example of her own stomach.
According to the book, Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housewife who was not interested in the taste at all. This led to the White House “not having been given almost the most delicious food throughout Washington, but also in the most uncomfortable way prepared.”
A number of eating habits from the time of the crisis took off as soon as the country got back on its feet.
The link remained in our constant examination of calories and nutritional values, says Ms. Ziegelman, and in the way science applies to cooking.
Some say that during the writing of the book they better understood the digestive habits of Miss Ziegelman’s mother - perhaps why she couldn’t throw away her food.
"She was really afraid of wasting food," Andrew Coe said.
Ziegelman said, "People were wrong about her."
There's been an accident with the wig.
When it was at Eisenberg's clean tables, she and Mr. Coe pulled out a dessert that they prepared at home: a Swiss dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called svetska cream," Ziegelman said and added that the usual trick was to give modest recipes an elegant name.
There wasn't any cream there, just sweats, a little wet, sugar, water and chicken.
Every one of them would be willing to throw a spoon into a bunch of brown matter.
Surprisedly, it was wrong.
Andrew Coe added, and then again.
And as the right owner said to his wife, "It would be a bit of broken hair."
Europeans: Migrants are looking for doses.
Most refugees who fall into Europe come for economic reasons.
Young Russians are making fun of themselves.
That's what the show would look like if we turned them around.
A group of Russian artists, called 2D Among Us, is making fun of their country.
With the help of the photoshop, they create collages that show funny how it would look if famous shows and movies were filmed in Russia.
Gilead has a claim for compensation for the legal representation costs in the case of a patent against yellowing type C against Merck
The Judge of the Court of Justice has decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to pay fees for lawyers who have been awarded it in respect of the patent against yellowing type C against Merck & Co Inc.
In June, the judgment was annulled, according to which Gilead had to pay 200 million for damage to the two Merck patents in connection with the very successful medicines of Gilead, Sovaldi and Harvoni, after the federal judge had repeatedly found out the anti-legislative proceedings on the part of Merck, besides the lie under oath and other non-ethical practices.
On Thursday, Federal Judge Beth Labson Freeman pointed out that Gilead is entitled to a drop in the fees incurred in connection with representation in the case.
Merck is trying to get Gilead, which dominates the new generation of medicines against type C yellowing, which can cure more than 90% of patients with this liver disease.
The case arose in 2013 when Gilead and Merck complained to each other and claimed that they were the owner of the basic laboratory research for sofosbuvir, the active ingredient of medicines from Gilead.
US-supported military units claim to have gained full control of Manbijj
The U.S.-assisted military units gained full control over the northern town of Manbídz near the border with Turkey after the last Islamic state fighters fled the city, he introduced a group of speakers on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) is now relieving the city of the remains of a group of radicals who were hiding in the city.
The units released over 2,000 civilians who were radically detained, said Reuters Sharfan Darwish from the SDF Alliance and the Manbídje Military Council.
"The city is now fully under our control, but we are still looking for it," said Reuters.
Clinton made $10.75 million in 2015 and paid a federal tax rate 34.2 per cent
Hillary Clinton published her 2015 tax receipt on Friday, stating that the presidential candidate and her husband had a revenue of $10.75 million in this year and were taxed at 34.2 per cent.
Clinton spent $1 million on charity in 2015, mainly in the Clinton Foundation. President Bill Clinton contributed almost $5.3 million in total for lectures, and the former foreign minister granted $3 million from Simon & Schuster's loading book on his foreign ministry.
Clinton's co-sponsored, US Senator Tim Caine of the State of Virginia, together with his wife Anne Holton, published a ten-year tax confession.
In 2015, they paid a real tax of 20.3 per cent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Caine are still a model of financial transparency," said Jennifer Palmiera, who helped Clinton with the campaign.
Against this, Donald Trump hides himself for false excuses and withdraws from his earlier promises that his tax confession will be public.
It is customary that candidates to the President of the United States will publish their tax receipts, even if they are not subject to the law.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers quoted the audit of the U.S. Department of Finance’s Tax Board as the reason for his refusal to publish the tax confession.
"Your move," said Hillary Clinton's campaign campaign on Twitter and linked it to the tax recognition of a democratic candidate.
Michael Cohen, Special Adviser to Trump, said on Thursday CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish tax receipts until the audits have been completed.
According to Trump's criticisms, among them the Republican candidate for the 2012 President Mitt Romney and other members of the Republican Party agree that his refusal raises questions about his net profit, contributions to charity, trade transactions and other relations, including relations with Russia.
Clinton's issue is very strong and she published a video on Friday, which reminds us of how high the position of the Republic of Trump insists that he publish his tax confession.
On Thursday, he mentioned in his speech on economic issues in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what all the other candidates did to the presidential office after decades - publish their tax confession," he said in front of people.
Politico stated that Trump has paid no or very low taxes in the last two years of the 1990s, and the New York Times journalist quoted a number of tax advisors and accountants who claim it can be the same today.
Federal tax rates became the subject of the election of the President.
Clinton advocates a rule named after billionaire Warren Buffett, which would ensure that all who make more than $1 million a year will pay a tax of at least 30 per cent.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
Last week, Buffet called for a meeting of Clinton in Omaza, Nebraska State, where Buffet's conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway, invited Trump to meet and exchange tax receipts.
Buffett said he also went through the IRS audit and that Trump is not "fearing" the financial office, but volunteers.
Clinton's campaign published tax returns until 2007.
Clinton, who now lives in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average federal tax of 32 per cent between 2007 and 2014, and a combined tax of approximately 40.5 per cent.
In 2015, Clinton’s tax return is that unlike most Americans, they pay only $100 in their earnings.
Their main investments were the low-cost mutual index fund from which Clinton received dividends and interest of 109,000 dollars.

Condoms filled with chilli or an elephant protection firearm in Tanzania
Nature protectors in Tanzania use a non-orthodox way to prevent elephants from walking into human habitats - throwing condoms filled with chilli powder.
This process has been proven and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with the idea several years ago, along with the American Environmental Organization The Nature Conservation, promotes this process and schools volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania, using this non-violent procedure in four steps to protect their homes and crops without harming animals.
A lot of them used to be digging for their defense.
Friday is a world elephant day dedicated to the protection of these animals.
“From the time they developed this ... tool file, we have seen a change of behavior in these communities. People believe much more that they can keep elephants out of their fields without hurting them,” said the executive director of the Honeyguide Damian Bell Foundation in the statement.
The first and second steps are on the passing elephant to light up the battery and start the claxon.
If it does not, the so-called "chilli" will be released.
Chilli powder mixed with salt with petardo will be packed into the condom, its end will be soaked that he will only watch his nails.
After the fire, the condom will explode and the fine chicken powder will spread into the air.
Most of the time, there's only one curtain, and the elephant's coming in a different direction.
The last option is to turn off a fire extinguisher that triggers a clear, clear explosion.
The Jewish director joined the Berlin hotel for removing the code for calling to Israel for "the request" of the Arabs - RT News
The French film director of Jewish origin caused a stir in the media after finding out that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin does not have a code for calling to Israel, according to the employee's words on the basis of the "requirement" of Arab clients.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the documentary about the Holocaust “Shoah”, ventilated his frustration at the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin in an open letter to the German daily FAZ.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the hotel call code list.
However, the State was not listed among the countries where direct calls can be made from the room.
How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital city of Germany, Israel was removed and destroyed?
He wrote Lanzmann.
Hotel Kempinski Bristol instead offers an opportunity to call Israel through its own call center.
The director was looking for an explanation and was having a problem at the hotel reception.
The answer he received was that Lanzmann said he was "shocking".
The hotel worker replied that the measure was "decided after consideration of the management of Kempinski Hotels".
The director's reason for this move was even more inflated.
"Most of our guests are Arabs and they demanded that the calling code of Israel be deleted," Lanzmann quoted the employee in his letter.
According to Suddeutsche Zeitung, the Israeli ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, referred to the case as "a lot of shame".
We were scared and shocked.
It's a huge shame about itself.
The fact that something like this happened in Germany and also in such a hotel chain is even more embarrassing.
There's no need for any further explanation.
We expect the hotel to produce the right conclusions," he said.
The event triggered a strong online reaction, people labeled it a scandal.
Some believe that the Kempinski hotel simply "lost" in the demands of Arab customers.
“Hanba you” is mentioned in another contribution, which indicates that the hotel, which is located on the Nobles Street Kurfurstendamm, is located near the synagogue.
According to Spiegel's newspaper, the hotel itself quickly withdrew any charge by marking the event as a "surveillance" and to Lanzman as an "apologetic".
"Never a direct order was issued" does not include Israel in the list of call codes, quoted Suddeutsche Zeitung, representative of the Kempinski Hotel.
He adds that the call code was added to the list.
Police used tear gas and rubber missiles against protesting Brazilian students
There were students and police in San Paul, Brazil, on Thursday, when the students met for a demonstration against government reforms in the public education system.
The police against the protestant used tear gas and rubber missiles.
The problem was overcome when the government's order services tried to dislodge the students, which ended by the police using rubber missiles and tear gas.
Demonstration took place several hundred students to express their concerns about plans.
Among the proposals of the governor of San Paulo Gerald Alckmin to save money is the closure of almost a hundred public schools and the relocation of 300,000 students.
Some of the participants in the demonstration were able to see how they were taking the inscriptions against temporary President Michel Temer on the wall.
The latest protest comes only a few days after the demonstrators marched together to support President Dilmy Rousseff's meeting, when the Senate in the country has decided to appeal to her.
Trade between Russia and Iran increased by 71% - RT Business
According to the Russian embassy in Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan grew after the abolition of sanctions between Moscow and Tehran by 70.9 per cent in the interim comparison.
As the ambassador pointed out, since the abolition of international sanctions against Iran, there has been an increase in interest by Russian companies trading in the country.
Russian companies renew existing ties with Iran while new companies are ready to enter the market.
Another expansion of trade is, of course, one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," Dzhagarianan said.
He noted that during the first five months of 2016 the turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the same period in 2015 and reached $856 million.
Specifically, Russia's exports to Iran amounted to 91.5 per cent and reached $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 per cent by $158 million.
The leap increase in trade ensured supplies of equipment, ground vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
Dzhagarian also expects Russia to visit a record number of tourists from Iran this year.
Last year, the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran issued some 35,000 visas to Iran's citizens, mostly travel.
Furthermore, Iran was first received among top 20 countries according to the number of tourists arriving in Russia.
It is safe to say that the record numbers of tourists from Iran in Russia from last year will be overcome," he said.
At the same time, however, Iran is visiting a relatively small number of Russians. The Ambassador hopes that this will change.
"I can personally recommend a visit to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, where the memory of the ancient Persian civilization is well preserved," he said.
Scott Callum Skinner rushes home after the British get gold in the cyclist
Callum Skinner from Scotland entered the dawn last night in a male sprint team in Rio, when three VB teams defended the title from London 2012.
A 30-year-old relative from Glasgow was in the role of the brake that he took as his Scotland Sir Chris Hoy, and a young man of legend was delighted when he came to the goal and stole the victory from the favorite New Zealand.
Britain won a surprise four years ago, and Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And the same trick was repeated after the end of the humble sixth World Championship in the road cyclist in March, even though Hoy finished his career in the meantime.
The problem between Beijing and London was the reward for Jamie Staff's specialized in leading.
So Hindus showed up just in time.
After leaving Hoye also set free the place he tried to fill out the Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton.
Skinner was a British coach man and the search for potential has now been confirmed.
Kenny Hindes, who was with Hoy's champion four years ago, and with Skinner, they scored the Olympics in qualification, but he took the shirt in the first round of New Zealand.
And the British trio got gold in the team sprint.
Hindes was right behind his wheel, but Kenny pushed the team forward and Skinner held the lead.
The change in strategy was a major part of the transformation when Hindus went to higher translation to slow down and enable Kenny and partly Skinner to maintain pace.
Today's competition was watching from his BBC commentary position and when Skinner, Kenny, and Hindus went to the stage, he didn't let their eyes go.
Thirty-year-old Skinner, a relative from Glasgow, said, "It's a lousy comparison."
I'm here to get the best of myself and honor my name.
We created an Olympic record in the finals and we beat the best.
It was just unbelievable.
There's no better way to win.
After the triumph next to Kenny and Hoye in London in 2012, Hindus admitted that he had fallen off the road approved after the weak start.
The note came back later, and the British rivals had no opportunity to withdraw.
There was no such problem this time around this victory.
Hindus said: “With all those British flags on the thrones, I felt like in London.”
In the last three months, we've all been together as a team.
We've lost in many world races, so winning the Olympics again is just amazing.
It's one event, one gold medal for a nation that won seven out of ten competitions in Beijing and London.
If it's supposed to be an indicator of progress in the last five months, it's been waiting for us on the highway for five days.
In the form that Kenny introduced, it is not unlikely that he would repeat Hoy's success and win three gold medals at the same time.
This would then be for Kenny - who is just 12 years younger than Hoy, also has a birthday on March 23rd (this date appears to be sacred for British sport, this day also celebrates the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - meant a total of six gold and one silver medal.
No matter how much Hoy got.
As another Kenny will participate in a sprint that starts today and lasts for another three days.
An 18 - year - old relative from Bolton said: “I am now enjoying this.
Team race is always the best.
You win with the others.
To tell the truth, winning for yourself is a little lonely.
Hindus said: “If he wins another two gold medals, he should get a knightship title.”
It was the only medal competition that day, but the British were still waiting for more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doll qualified as the fastest to compete for four kilometers.
It's over at 3:51,943.
The world record that fell in London in 2012 is 3:51,659.
The first round and the finals (2:42) are held today's second day of the race to which Wiggins will be directed.
Yesterday before the qualifying competition, he was discussing with the commissioners when her decision-makers called for a measure of height.
In a similar race, women who continue and finish tomorrow reached Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milgavie of the world record with time 4:13,260.
The VB team relied on its strong team of career cyclists and controlled the mid-term Olympics and won a lot of medals.
After the truly exceptional performances, which showed a complete overhaul in Beijing and London, it decreased during the preparation for Rio's expectations.
In the background, dramatic events took place, in the last row of the technical director Shane Sutton's resignation in April due to allegations of sexism and discrimination, and the termination of a career of grandiose men such as Hoy or Victoria Pendleton.
However, as the first night of the race on the highway shows, the legendary reputation seems to be that the UK team can give a peak performance with perfect timing, so it can be confirmed again.
There will be no future for the Portland tabernacle after the end of the energy supply contract
The future of the Portland tabernacle of Aluminium in Victoria - and the jobs of hundreds of workers - is not due to the electricity that the company supplies electricity and that informed about the intention of one of the owners of the tabernacle of the contract to terminate the electricity supply. All electricity supply contracts are expected to be reduced.
This step follows the decision of the Victorian Government earlier this year that it will not extend the granting of grants that the company maintains in progress.
The validity of a fixed 20-year grant will expire in November.
Alcoa Portland may be in danger of up to 2000 jobs.
At the time of closure, up to 2000 jobs - direct or indirect jobs may be threatened.
And since the tavern consumes about 10% of the total electricity produced in Victoria, it can have other avian effects.
Alcoa closed Point Henry's camp in 2014, leading to the closure of England's power plant last year.
Alcoa's tent in Portland is transitory and threatens to close it.
This step follows several years of speculation about the future of the company, initially in response to the strong Australian dollar and recently due to prices for the production of the competition.
AGL, which supplies electricity from the Loy Yang A power plant in the valley of Latrobe Valley, announced that it expects that some of the other three owners will also decide to terminate the contract.
The majority of the company is owned by Alcoa and Aluminum, the small business shares held by the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp.
"AGL expects the Portland competition to continue to function, in other words, that the demand for electricity from the tavern will continue," she said.
AGL stated that the contracts were so-called ‘insurance contracts’ that they were to enter into force as of November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so their validity will actually expire in 2017.
‘AGL continues to assume that the contracts will be divided into profits for fiscal year 2017’, the power plant declared.
Any possible impact on AGL’s profits since fiscal year 2018 is currently limited due to the strong outlook of the commodity market for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL stated that it had already written down the value of the contracts according to its books of account of $187 million "in case it would end".
Alcoa stated that the decision to terminate the contract “has no impact on its ... ability to operate the tavern or to secure the supply of electricity to the tavern.”
The US company stated that in 2010 it had entered into a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, which was to start paying since November of this year, even though it still had to explain why it had dropped from the contract.
The analysts are very careful with regard to the possible closure of the portland tavern in Victoria and the Tomago race near Newcastle as a result of a poor economy in the sector.
AGL Stehpen Mikkelsen, who turned to analytics at the beginning of this week, said that Portland annually consumes about 600 megawatts of electricity and around 900 megawatts of Tomago.
If both companies were to withdraw from the market, this would mean a substantial reduction in demand on the market [electric energy].
It wouldn't be good for us as a manufacturer," he said.
Kendall is not only a star reality TV show Kardashian - now is the cover of the shadow Vogue
Kendall Jenner (20), the model and the fourth daughter of the mother-manager of the Kris Kardashian-Jenner clan, appeared on the title page of the September issue of the American magazine Vogue.
Kendall, the Ambassador of the stamp Estee Lauder, who presented the news on Thursday on his Instagram account for the weekend in Milan, Paris and New York.
"In a room full of people I love, I want to cry in view of this title page," wrote Kendall.
The discovery of the title page was followed by a bizarre (or simply humourous continuation in Kardashian?) scened video containing the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (baroist Rob and Caitly and along with them all of their favorite showcase uncles, producer Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest). They forgot about their sister's cover just so that the scene could end with a classic turn: they prepare a secret party.
It's a protected history line almost every "birthday" part of a children's television show (Seacrest says: "Did you think we forgot about you?" with the honesty of a cartoon queen in eight o'clock in the morning), but Kris needed to somehow ensure that other girls could live on this advertisement.
Because when we look at the issue of the magazine Vogue, we are sure to enter the new era of Kardashian.
Senior sister Kim may have pushed Kendall on the cover of Vogue (she was with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the title of the September issue of the magazine is another league.
The release of the magazine Vogue is the most widely sold issue of the year.
The edition, which reminds its fat more of the book for advertising purposes than a fashion magazine, attracts a whole series of advertisements (Fashionist calculated that from 832 pages in the previous edition there were 615 pages with advertising content).
The discovery of the star that appears on the title page is unmistakably expected, so it is not surprising that in the past two years, the pictures of the magazine have been avoided even before its official publication.
Among the women who appeared on the cover in the past are Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelist or Kate Moss.
In recent years more "celebrates that make models" than "models that are celebrities" have appeared on the title page.
Jennifer Lawrence, the holder of Oscar and the ambassador of the Dior brand, appeared on the title in 2013, a year later she had the honour of Lagy Gaga.
But although it is very unlikely that Kendall - which magazine describes as her generation's "breakdown model" - will fall into the first category, will be in a very good society.
These celebrities are not relatives of known people, nor stars of reality shows, or children today who know how to make well-cut videos (even though Jenner represents all of this).
They're provenly talented women who excel in the entertainment industry.
Beyoncé, who appeared on the title page last year, had one of the strongest years in her career thanks to the release of the album Lemonade.
Of course not everyone is excited about Jenner's success.
Her position in the fashion world will always be difficult because of her participation in reality show.
Stephanie Seymorová, the original Victoria's Secret model in June criticised Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid and called them "the girls of the moment".
These feelings were rekindled with a report that Jenner appeared on the cover of Vogue.
But this dissatisfaction isn't in place.
Kendall Jenner's on the cover of the light Vogue.
It's a supermodel in the right sense.
He's running for Mark Jacobs.
He's selling you make-up from Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters are selling you pictures of themselves on their own payrolls.
He's selling pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter who took pictures for the Love magazine.
And at free time it works in reality show, maybe just as one of the ways to see Kurtney and her kids.
Community legal aid centres will reject 160,000 people annually
More than 160,000 of the most vulnerable citizens are denied legal aid every year in Community centres, and in the sector itself they are going to be affected by further financial constraints on the already overloaded services.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly those of advanced age, immigrants, menaces of workers, victims of violence and people without financial means to fight unjust immigration and so on - are rejections at a time when they are looking for free legal aid and representation.
Community legal services, which are already so strained to break down, are going to go to other scraps.
From June next year, these legal aid centres will lose another 30 per cent of federal funding.
The director of the Community Legal Assistance Centre in Queensland, James Farrell, said that according to the latest summary report, the National Association of Community Legal Assistance Centres has been found to be denied five thousand people annually.
Mr. Farrell said that without cancelling the federal government's decision, the situation would get worse.
"The Community legal centres in Queensland are chronically underfunded, which means that thousands of people are denied the vital services they need," he said.
People who have avoided relations with a violent man, people with excessive and protective debts, families who are being separated, workers who are unjustly released - all these people have problems with legal dimensions and this report shows that they do not have the chance to get the help they need.
As of June 2017, the federal government will reduce funding by 30%, leading to the fact that thousands of other people at risk from Queensland will have to focus on complex legal problems without assistance.
We call on the State Representative and Senator George Brandise to stop this financial cut-off right now so that people can get the help they need when they get into legal problems.
In the past year, the government has been given its obligation to ensure the financing of legal aid up to the level of the international average.
Now is the time to look at the needs of the community's legal aid centres and the community of their clients and the Palestinian government must invest in this important work.
Appeal for Donald Trump's campaign after a member of the team allegedly targeted the weapon
New York: Donald Trump’s campaign brought a complaint of alleged inaction after they were informed that the director of operations in North Carolina had in February targeted a gun to a member of the staff during a jeep ride.
The incident was described in the court file, which, on Wednesday at the State Court in Charlotte, handed down Vincent Bordini, a former software teacher in the state.
Bordini said he waited months for the situation to be resolved internally before he concluded that "it won't happen".
Director Earl Phillip "pointed his fingers at the gun, gave the right arrow to the trigger and directed the head to Vincent in the Czech," Bordini said in a complaint.
The record says that after Bordini complained about the local and regional leadership campaign, he found that at least four other people had the same experience with Phillip.
"The weapons must not be fired to cause harm," Bordini said in a complaint.
The appeal comes only two days after the Republican candidate called the president for an exaltation when voters in North Carolina said they could step up the arms owners and holders (which is adjusted in the USA in the second addition to the Constitution), if his opponent Hillary Clinton was elected and could appoint his judge.
Trump's campaign says the media got his words out of context and that Trump wasn't violent.
Bordini seeks compensation for the campaign for careful supervision and Phillip for the threat of personal security, the illegal use of violence and the cause of emotional harm.
Trump's spokesperson Hope Hicks didn't respond immediately to a report requesting a comment.
Trying to get a statement from Phillip was a failure.
The WCCB, a local reporter in Charlotte, announced that Phillip had recently left the campaign.
Calling his consulting company Innovative Consulting Services has not been answered within a short period of time.
The Republican candidate for President Donald Trump is conducting a controversial pre-election campaign.

Britain must expand its Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also be a source of renewal and prosperity not only for our local communities and across London, but throughout the country.
For me, Heathrow is very attractive, just as it was in London 2012, when we made extraordinary efforts to ensure that all our nations and regions will be able to compete from the Olympics.
The Olympics meant huge benefits for Startford and East End.
And we'll do it again by creating opportunities for local people and companies near Heathrow.
Only for our local communities will we create 10,000 new schools, 40,000 new jobs and end up with youth unemployment around the airport.
As before the 2012 London Olympics, there are also those who will think that Heathrow expansion is too large.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympics and that we would be making fun of ourselves on the world stage.
The doubters were wrong in 2012 and even in Heathrow it will be shown that they were not right.
Heathrow will always have to overcome obstacles, but heathrow can answer every question he has.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project that involves many people and companies, not just a few.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create 180,000 new jobs, an economic growth of 211 billion pounds, to leave heritage in the form of skills and employment both in the airport and throughout Britain.
We have a great team on Heathrow, who, in time and with the budget set up an infrastructure investment programme of 11 billion pounds, starts with the T5 terminal - which was chosen by the best terminal in the world five years after itself, after the T2 terminal, which was built between the two most mobile wounds in the world.
Now they are ready to add a third level, which is worth 16 billion pounds of private investment.
The games in London in 2012 were a huge success in Britain and I am convinced that the extension of Heathrow will also be there.
It is time for us to continue to spread the spirit of the Olympics and expand Heathrow, ensure trade in the future and leave the legacy of skills and jobs that Britain may be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is the president of the Board of Representatives and the former deputy for the business affairs of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus - Facebook in the game on the cat and mouse in blocking advertising
From the attempts to circumvent advertising blocking programs, for companies that make online marketing, has become a game of cat and mouse. At least one of the companies that program such software claims it.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block advertising filters on its desktop pages, Adblock Plus on its websites published a contribution stating that users can update filters in their program and block advertising on this social network again.
Facebook stated on Tuesday that its desktop website will change the coding around advertising to make it more difficult for advertising filters to find out which parts of the website are advertising.
Now, Adblock says the new codes are already around.
Adblock's Adblock Ben Williams wrote in a blog that "this kind of war between the open source community and those trying to surround it is going on since the blocking of advertising was found," and that Facebook is probably coming with another own repair.
The fact that the company that owns the largest social network in the world has been involved in war only proves how the problem of blocking advertising for industry has become a major problem.
According to the study, last year Pagefair and Adobe used advertising filters around 200 million people worldwide - almost four times before that was in 2013.
Mobile advertising now accounts for 84 per cent of the benefits of Facebook advertising, and every day Facebook from mobile devices visits 1.03 billion active users.
The speaker stated, however, that the company is against advertising filters on the desktops because mobile advertising filters on mobile applications for social networks and Instagram are not working.
Desktop ads still represent profit so high that Facebook decides to invest in it.
Facebook also announced on Tuesday that it will update the "ad preferences" tool to allow people to better control how their ads are displayed.
On Thursday Facebook he said that Adblock's new filters are concerned because they could also block content that does not relate to advertising on the site.
"It is not a pleasant experience for people and we want to solve this problem," Facebook spokesperson said in an e-mail statement.
Blocking advertising is an insensitive tool, and that's why we'd rather focus on building tools such as Ad Preferences that give control to people.
A woman hit a Swiss road car
The victim was lying on the street in the middle of the night.
Police are looking for witnesses of an event where on Thursday mornings several cars were taken over by a woman who was probably trying to commit suicide.
There was an accident on the A1 road near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight in the basement.
The police in Vaud said in a statement that the actor "toothing" was lying in the dark on the road and passing it several cars.
Clearly, the victim, a woman at 49, wanted to kill herself and hit her several cars, including a truck.
She died on the spot.
Several drivers have already been interrogated, but according to the police, not all of them have been identified.
A criminal investigation was opened, a "logical" step in a situation such as this, said to Le Tribune de Geneve legal representative Gilles Hofsetter.
It is still necessary to determine whether any of the drivers involved will face any accusation.
Was it possible to prevent the attack?
This must be what the plaintiff has to find out," Hofsetter said.
Based on two similar cases in the last five years, drivers do not seem to be responsible.
In both cases - one of which was about a person on the road - it was decided that motorists could not expect a walk that passed through the street in the middle of the night, as the newspaper said.
Last year, the police officer was acquitted of the charge for the death of carelessness after she struck and killed a man on A1 road near Payner.
The court found that the victim was drinking alcohol at the age of 22 and was on the road.
The court found that the police officer - who responded to the emergency call - was in an appropriate manner and that the presence of a man on the road was "a very exceptional and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone with information on the quarter incident that took place at Morges should report to the police on telephone numbers 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
Tolerant city.
Prague is the popular destination of the LGBT community.
The association of Czech Travel Offices and Agency (AČCKA) expects up to 20,000 visitors to Prague.
On Friday, the executive director of AČCKA Kateřín Petríčková announced this.
The sixth anniversary of Prague Pride began on 8 August, the festival brings the life of lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transsexuals (LGBT).
Last year, about 35,000 people attended the event.
"Praha is one of the most popular destinations of the LGBT community, for a high level of tolerance and a wide range of specialized companies," Petríčeková said.
According to a survey by the editors, foreign visitors spend an average of 3100 kroner per person per day.
Gay tourists have special maps of Prague with a complete list of Prague gays and gay-friends bars, clubs, cafes and restaurants in the form of mobile apps etc.
"For travel generally, LGBT customers are very lucrative, are interested in higher price relationships with high standard travel services and are losing more than others," Petríčeková said.
The first Pride Tourism Symposium is also under the festival programme this year.
It is presented by experts from the LGBT travel sector from Europe, the USA and China.
The festival will continue until Sunday, August 14.
The main theme of this year is love, but the action will also focus on several thematic areas, including family, AIDS prevention and transgender issues.
The festival will be the top of the festival on Saturday with allegorical vehicles coming from Václav Square in Latvia.
The origin, attended by thousands of people in recent years, this year will worship the silent memory of the victims of the June attack at the Orlando Night Club, where the attacker shot 49 people, mostly homosexuals.
Pat and Matt celebrate for forty years.
Pat and Matt, the invincible keel whose effort usually ends with a disaster, has enjoyed small and large spectators for forty years.
The pilot part of this evening's show by director Lubomír Beneš was premiered on August 12, 1976.
Following the creation of this animated series, which now knows viewers in more than a hundred countries of the world, were drawn by the authors' jokes and director Lubomír Benes, who designed for the magazine with two boxes of Mr. Ooholička and Mr. Sedleč.
Benes then called for the collaboration of the dramaturg Jiří Kubíč and author Vladimir Jiranka and together they created a film by the Kutács.
Today's image with a yellow and red trick and a bullet and a radio was created in 1979, when he started a series for Slovenian TV in the Prague Short Film.
The names Pat and Matt were then given in 1985, this time it was already directed directly for the Short Film Prague.
In 1990, Lubomír Beneš founded his own studio of the animated AIF Studio film in Prague and Curych, where other parts were created.
After his death in 1995, other works continued with other creations, many of which were shared by Beneš ’ son Marek.
There are now more than 90 episodes of the stories of these cubs, which all lie under their hands, but never get angry with themselves and are always full of optimism, ideas and cubs' enthusiasm, and finally they are content with their part, which gives a known gesture "...and that is it!".
Pat and Matt even moved from television to books, to DVDs and to theatres and to other toys with the image of Pat and Mata are the threat of every toy.
A shot for Fiji and for two years of harmony.
At the end of the week, we've chosen one sport and one of our lives for you.
They both have a good ending.
Let's see.
Fiji has achieved historic success.
What is the reason for the joy of the whole earth?
A two-year-old British girl has an identical friend and she's happy with her.
And for what things do people lose most at airports?
It's a Friday review from the world's websites.
The first medals from the Olympics.
The historic success is celebrated by the island state of Fiji.
Ragby's selection of this co-existence won at the finals of the seven-week football tournament of the United Kingdom team.
It's such a first medal that Fiji won for herself at the Olympics.
Waiting for the profit of the first precious metal lasted sixty years since the first expedition to the Olympics.
Coach Fiji is a great asset to success.
It's ironic, though, that Brit Ben Ryan is.
The team has been running since 2013 and after the finals what the British citizen could have been happy with unlike his countrymen.
"Let's play freely and easily and see if the greatest match in our history can be managed," the coach said before the finals.
Finally, Fiji has sovereign control and a small state with 900 thousand inhabitants now experience an Olympic history.
Reported by the French daily Le Monde.
A new friend and luck for a little girl.
Two-year-old Harmony-Rose Ivy Allen, who has been living without a hand for 11 months and has got a new friend.
A doll that looks like her.
"Mother, she's like me," the two-year-old girl rejoiced as her mother poured out for ABC News.
She added that her daughter likes to pence her hands and legs and then sit together without prosthesis.
Harmony was diagnosed with type B meningitis in a few years of life, and the doctors gave it only a ten percent chance of survival.
There's nothing I wouldn't love about her.
She's beautiful, smart, funny and she never gives up.
He's got an oversight.
I saw her pretending to be the other kids with the words Hello, I'm Harmony and I don't have a hand, my mother added.
Look at the joy of the doll.
What do we lose most in the airport for?
CNN brings in the findings that people at airports lose most of their water.
The network sold Hudson's travel essential stores published data in the last year, where it contains 10 products that customers buy at airports the most.
The water was a sovereign first.
The drinks were generally very popular, in the first decade they were placed by eight.
The ninth place contained a large packaging of M&M beans with a coconut sensation.
And you can figure out who closes the first ten?
As one of the above, you can't eat.
According to CNN, it's The Wall Street Journal.
Other popular newspapers sold at airports include: New York Post, The New York Times USA Today.
Among the magazines are US Weekly, In Touch and The Economist.
The Sovereign of the universe.
We're just going to win. They were laughing at Murray and Bond.
Eric Murray and Hamish Bond from New Zealand have sovereignly ruled the category of twins without a driver for seven years and their Dominants have also confirmed in the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
At first glance, the unborn twins have moved to a smaller team after the Beijing Olympics and have competed since 2009.
At the Rodriga de Freitase lagoon in the fourth final, they scored 69th in a row.
What are we in other than the others?
We're just nicer, Murray joked already during the Olympic regatta when he was supposed to answer questions about the domination of the New Zealand twin.
Honestly, we don't do anything different to each other.
We're just really training, really hard.
And we're still trying to improve our technique, that's our philosophy, Murray said more seriously.
Their powers are also remarkable because they are physically different.
Murray is almost two-foot and stockpiles watchman, academically looking at Bond is five centimeters smaller and 15 kilograms lighter.
Besides, they have a different nature.
Bond studies and deals with finance, Murray has for example a charity boxing match.
That's why it doesn't take too much time together outside of marriage.
Eric's going into the ship basically because we can't lose.
We're just going to win.
I have a tendency to think about what might be shown, he admitted Bond, who even at the press conference allegedly suggested that the dominant in the crew is Murray.
He was always the first to respond, and Bond was waiting for his chance.
On the water, however, the enemy destroys by peaceful force.
They are running their pace, and although often in the middle of the track they are not at the front, at their progressive acceleration, the opponents have not yet found a prescription.
We run on a two-kilometre track, and we never wanted to go the first mile up.
We're just trying to go at a pace that no one else can.
We know what we have to do to win, said forty-four years old Murray.
With his younger partner in four years, he won seven gold medals for the world’s championship.
They also won in 2007, when both members were gold four without a driver.
Just after the unexpected failure of the larger team at the Beijing Olympics a year later, they decided to move to two without a driver.
At the Olympics in London, it is likely that the greatest defeat of their careers was opened and the Dominants confirmed it in Rio.
London was very intense.
We did everything the coach told us, and they didn't ask for anything.
This time it was a little more fun.
We knew it would be fucking hard, and we had to make sure that we were mentally well, Murray said.
We know that we all want to be thrown out of the throne.
We still have that target on our back.
But we're trying to be half a step ahead of everyone, he added.
NASA climate model: Venus was once inhabited
According to NASA's new climate model, Venus was once inhabited.
Scientists at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies have developed a model for testing Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether once on Venus, the surface of which is hot, without water and fuelled CO2, could rule under conditions similar to conditions on Earth.
Scientists have previously suggested that the low speed of turning Venus can explain its dense atmosphere.
According to the latest simulations, though, Venus could have been proud of a rare atmosphere similar to the Earth and turned slowly.
The model also dealt with Venus' earlier topography.
On the planet, areas were probably dryer than on Earth, but once on it was enough water and spatial diversity to rule over life and provide protection against rapid evaporation.
Venus used the sun, which was 30% thicker.
"In the simulation of the GISS Venus model, during slow rotation, exhibits its day-to-day side to the sun almost two months at once," explained the scientist from GISS Anthony Del Genio in a new report.
This results in heating the surface and creating rain, which creates a dense layer of clouds that are treated as rainy and surface protected from excessive solar heat.
The result is climate with average temperatures that are actually slightly lower than at present on Earth.
The model made up the story of Venus similar to the evolution that planetary scientists had previously hypothetically compiled.
Although Venus was probably habitable in the past -- over billions of years -- was exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet radiation.
Its oceans were drained and water pairs were burned with ultraviolet light.
The hydrogen escaped and only remained a dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with the deadly effect of greenhouse gas -- it's Venus, as we know it today.
Researchers published their results from the new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters magazine.
Patrick Roy resigned to the team coach post Colorado Avalanche
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday to his position as coach and Vice-President of the Colorado Avalanche hockey operations, as a reason for not participating in the team decision-making process.
The Executive Vice-President/General Colorado Joe Sakic confirmed the step and said that the club will start looking for a new coach immediately.
"For the last three years, I have acted as chief coach and vice-president of hockey operations for Colorado Avalanche, with energy, passion and decision," said 50-year-old Roy in a statement.
Over the years, I've been thinking about how I can improve the team, give him the depth he needs, and get it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, it is necessary that the vision of the coach and the Vice-President of hockey operations be in line with the vision of the organisation.
It must also be able to participate in decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who accepted Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his team benefits.
"Patric informed me of his decision today," Sakic said.
We appreciate everything he's done for our organization, and we wish him a lot of happiness in the future.
Roy was nominated to win Jack Adams as the best league coach during his first season with Avalanche 2013/2014.
He led the team to profit 112 points and first place in the Central Division. Colorado, however, met Minnesota in the first round of play-offs and during the last two years he had not always won the match after the season.
The Avalanche team in the 2015/2016 season reached score 39:39:4 and he missed five points to get a second wild card at the Western Conference.
The company Roy, who was registered in China, won Stanley Cup four times -- twice with Montreal Canadiens and twice with Avalanche.
Employees on the North Sea oil platform renew their interviews and interrupt their shift
The senior representatives of the parties to the proceedings indicated that the allowances for employees of the North Sea oil area were interrupted, while all the parties to the dispute agreed on a new round of negotiations.
At the meetings against the Wood Group oil services company, it was located in the areas of the North Sea, which is operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"The Wood Group and the United Nations and RMT trade union organisations can confirm that they have agreed to renew the process of resolving current conflicts," the statement states.
It starts next week we'll have in the next few weeks a series of meetings, where we'll try to look at problems from new angles.
According to experts, their recent action, which they said was the first in more than 25 years, is to protest wage cuts up to 30%.
Wood Group this year reduced its rates and paid its suppliers in the North Sea by about 9% less due to negative market pressure.
The reduction in company rates follows a 10% reduction for coastal companies in 2014.
The company argues that further cuts would allow companies to compensate for the market decline.
On the other hand, Shell took thousands of people out of its payroll and announced plans to abandon oil and gas operations to 10 countries for modernising its processes - immediately after the mega fusion with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure from the low oil prices, the economic situation associated with the June decision to leave the European Union.
At the beginning of this week, a member of the Parliament from Scotland, Dave Anderson, met with committee members to discuss one of the biggest job conflicts of the whole generation leading to the North Sea.
The North Sea, as he said, is vital for the economy in the region.
"In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that works for everyone, not just for some," he said in a statement.
For comparison, almost $1.4 billion of investment in new North Sea projects is expected in 2016, while the average over the past five years has been about $7 billion.
Kepler measures the speed of star rotation in Pleiades
The latest mission of Kepler's Space Telescope to help astronomers is to get an almost complete list of the speeds of turning stars from the Pleiade Star Cup.
New data helps astronomers understand why the stars in the constellation are moving at different speeds, and also how the time of rotation relates to the formation of the planet.
"We hope that when comparing our results with other stars, we will learn more about the relationship between the star mass, its age and even history in its solar system," said Luis Rebullová, a research worker at the Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena.
The Pleiade Star Cup is located 445 light years from Earth.
Many stars in the constellation are now reaching the state of growth and have been born over 125 million years.
Now it's turning faster.
At the maximum speed, these adult stars release the vast amount of star winds.
Because these winds are moving along the magnetic fields of stars, they have a slowing effect on them.
Along with the age of the star, its speed of rotation slows down.
Kepler measures the speed of each star's rotation by measuring the time between the discovery of recognizable points on the stars -- similar to the sun's rays.
According to the latest data on speeds of rotation, larger stars turn slower than less massive stars.
The rebel compares stars to dancers, making pirates slower than those.
"In the "ballet" Pleiade we see that the slower the turning stars are more massive, while the faster the ones are usually very light stars," Rebullova said.
Because the Pleiade Star Cup is so close, it serves as an ideal space laboratory for comparing the quality of stars and the speed of rotation.
"The bats provide us with an anchor for theoretical models of star rotation in both directions, with younger and older stars," Rebullová said.
There is still much we want to learn about how, when, and why the stars slow down their turn and so say "he'll hang his dance shoes on his spine".
The rebel and her colleagues described in detail the latest speed analysis of Pleiades in three studies, which will soon be published in the journal Astronomical Journal.
Is the qualification agreement necessary?
If I didn't sign up, then wouldn't the qualification agreement be concluded and after a few months I could go to another hospital?
Is it possible to work after study without applying for special education?
It seems to me that in the area where I would like to work, there is now only a free place of work in some distant hospital, but about a half a year it might be possible to free a place in another place where I would like to work.
So I don't know how the situation is about half solved, so the question continues.
Mr. Lenka Vlk's answer.
There is no legal obligation to conclude a qualification agreement with an employer - a hospital.
The Qualification Agreement shall be a legal institution governed by the labour law and may be concluded between the employee and the employee in order to ensure the reimbursement of the costs incurred by increasing or deepening the qualifications of the employee.
In the field of health, however, a long-term pressure is being placed on the non-conclusion of these agreements with a view to ensuring the mobility of healthcare workers and not all hospitals currently require this agreement.
According to Law No. 95/2004, the conditions for obtaining and recognising professional qualifications and specialised skills for performing medical professions of a doctor, dentist and pharmacist are expressly valid, but the participation in specialised education is considered to be an in-depth qualification (not to increase it).
This means that a qualification agreement may be concluded under the labour law only if the costs reach at least CZK 75,000.
No legislation or obligation to apply for special training shall be imposed.
The law only lays down the conditions for the application for inclusion in the field of specialised education.
However, your doctor is authorized by law to perform your doctor’s appointment by the completion of the necessary university study, even under the prescribed conditions (under the supervision of a doctor with specialised skills in the relevant field).
The law provides for a situation where a doctor’s professional practice in another field of specialisation may be included in special training if its content and extent correspond to the relevant educational programme.
Theoretically, it would be possible to start a time worked elsewhere, which would correspond to the situation.
However, given that I do not know the circumstances of this case, it can be recommended to consult the relevant Committee of the Ministry of Health (the Scientific and Medical Committee) as the Ministry of Health provides advice and consultation services related to the classification of specialized education and its course.
The advisory service shall also be provided free of charge by the Czech Medical Chamber, to which each doctor must be a member.
Syrian Halab doctors are asking for U.S. intervention.
The United States did not make any effort to end the siege (the constitutional part of the city by government forces) and did not use its influence in the defence of civilians, quote from a letter addressed to the White House of the AFP Agency.
"We don't need tears, compassion, and even prayers; unfortunately, we need to create over the eastern halab zone to stop the attacks, and we need international action to ensure that halab won't get around again," the doctors said.
The Russian forces, which support the army of faithful President Bashar Asad, have announced that they will stop every day for three hours of attacks in the area of Halab to allow a safe passage of humanitarian convoys.
From 9:00 till 12:00 SELČ should be stopped all military activities, air raids and gunfire.
The chief of humanitarian operations of the United Nations Stephen O'Brien welcomed it, however, stressed the need for at least two-day arrangements.
According to the AFP, 15 of the 35 doctors acting in the eastern part of Halab were already in the control of the rebels.
It says that during the five-year war, witnesses were violent, cruel deaths of countless patients, friends and colleagues.
The world is watching and finding how complicated Syria is, but it's only doing little to protect us.
Recent offers of evacuation citizens from the Syrian regime and Russia sound like only slightly endangered threats, affected by pediatricians, surgeons and other doctors.
The doctors indicated that 42 attacks on medical devices in Syria were reported last month, 15 of which were reported in the hospital where they worked.
The saddest thing is that we have to decide who lives and who dies.
There are young children with such serious injuries that we have to choose from among them those who are most likely to survive.
And sometimes we don't even have the necessary material to help them, the doctors have described.
Two weeks ago, four newborns were drowned when the explosion interrupted oxygen supply to their incubators.
They were breathing and then their lives ended - before they could really start, they remembered.
The army loyal to President Bashar Asad, supported by the Russian forces, surrounded the rebels in recent weeks by a controlled eastern part of Halabu, with no food supply of more than 200,000 people inside.
Rebels under constant attacks of Russian and Syrian flight failed to break and start anti-offensive on Saturday after three weeks.
Both sides then arrived in the city and their surroundings strengthened.
