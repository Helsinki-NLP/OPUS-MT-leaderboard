Triumph of the legal populists in Austria, total they reach 29 percent
A significant weakening of the two parties of the former Great Coalition and a clear strengthening of the legal populist parties led, after the first preliminary results, to the previous parliamentary elections from Sunday in Austria.
In particular, the Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) suffers losses, where the position of former President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously at stake.
In contrast, the head of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), the Kärntner Landeshauptmann Jörg Haider, is preparing for a triumphal return to the federal policy.
According to the previous results, social democracy (SPO) remains the strongest force in the country with 29.8 per cent of the votes, but against the last elections in 2006 it loses 5.5 per cent of the votes.
It is even worse to cut off the EVP, which loses almost nine percent of the votes by 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results of these two major parties in the post-war history of Austria, and especially in the People's Party that had called for the pre-election elections, this is a truly catastrophic result.
At the beginning of July, when the EVP was released from the coalition, the People's Party had a clear lead in front of the SPÖ.
But the voters probably punished the party for failing the government.
In the first reactions to the results, speculations were made about the possible resignation of the Chairman of the Party and former Deputy Chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could be the case already on Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the committee.
Such a development would probably pave the way for the most likely exit from the elections, i.e. for a renewal of the large coalition from SPÖ and EVP.
In view of the strengthening of both law-enforcement parties - the Liberals (FPÖ) received 18 per cent, the BZÖ received 11 per cent of the votes - the Social Democrats expressed their fears at the same time that the year 1999 could be repeated when the People's Party met with the populist talks (then the FPÖ was still united, in 2005 it was separated from the BZÖ) with regard to a common government, which even led to sanctions from the European Union.
On this development, Jörg Haider, who has already declared himself ready to cooperate with each party and to move from a return to Vienna to the Austrian federal policy.
In addition, the party of the Greens also joined Parliament, which suffered slight losses and dropped from third to fifth place among the Austrian political parties.
No other party has probably mastered the four-percentage rate and therefore did not enter Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can cool
If it is not possible to solve the problem with the Czech scientists who have been accused in India because of the illegal collection of käfers, the Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg may find it possible to cool down the Czech-India relations.
This was highlighted by the Minister in New York after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart, Pranab Mukherdshi.
"If this doesn't clear, then it's safe to cool down," he explained after a meeting that took place on a Czech initiative.
Mukherdshi said after the talks, in judicial cases the executives can only take serious action.
Nevertheless, he argued that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was acquitted of the charge and received a fine that the central government wants with the local government in Dardjiling, whose case is the case.
"His problem could be solved," said the Minister.
For Emil Kučera, who has been sentenced to three years' imprisonment, it would be best for Mukherdshi's view if he went to a higher court.
He could therefore seek release for bail and wait for his sentence, the Minister said.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner had also spoken in negotiations.
"He recommends an appeal to a higher court, then he will be questioned," said the head of the Czech Diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can intervene in the whole matter is to indicate the convicted "competent legal support", the Indian minister said.
At the same time, he said such help will already be offered to them by the Indian side.
"We have a great interest in maintaining good contacts with India that have a long-term tradition.
The Indians also say that," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, he confirmed the importance of the Czech press agency ČTK in front of his partner, the Czech Republic to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really consider it a great mistake to arrest and prosecute these Czech scientists," he explained.
One answer to the question whether he has received the commitment from India to deal with the matter, the Minister is off.
"I've already been promised quite a lot," he just said.
A Czech directs the ring around the seabed
It comes with an electronic map, illustrated on Australia and the adjacent sea areas.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but in a small point, lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and along with it also the adjacent seabed.
The area is as large as the continent itself," says Italian jurist Luigi Santosuosso, who is one of the thirty-fourth-member UN Division of Oceans and Oceans.
His head, the Director of Division, the Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, pursues the interpretation and complements it.
Here is the rule of labor and enthusiasm.
The seabed has so far produced only a few known worlds that are rich in natural sources.
Here is oil to be found, further ores and other non-adult raw materials, but also unknown living organisms, which, for example, bear in mind the key to developing a drug against cancer.
A seabed larger than the mainland
The coastal states today strongly announced their claim to the new maritime areas.
According to a UN convention, they make use of their rights, which they agreed on in 1982 in Montego Bay in Jamaica.
This is particularly the area of the so-called continental rock, which often reaches up to a hundred kilometres from the shore of a country into the sea.
According to the Convention, this country has an exclusive claim to all the sources of continental anxiety.
"Simplicitly expressed as continental rock is considered the part of the sea floor and its soles, which represents a natural continuation of the continent below the sea surface.
It exceeds the limits of the coastal sea, often also the limits of two hundred sea miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone," explains Mikulka.
The application submitted by the Commission country concerned to establish the external borders of the continental shelf must be based on extensive scientific and technical documentation, which is based on many cost-intensive studies and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide the Commission with legal and technical support.
The Commission has so far negotiated five applications from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the last three countries have had success," Mikulka adds.
The success of Australia, which as the first country was able to significantly expand its maritime areas, was recently seen on an international echo.
However, New Zealand is also a winner - the extension of the seabed granted to the country last week by the Commission is about 1.6 million square kilometres, i.e. about six times the size of the country.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in research.
The profit that comes to them in the future from using the seabed will, as they promise, have priceless value.
Other countries will also gradually submit their applications.
You can do this ten years from the moment they ratify the "Montego Bay Agreement".
Where the continental divide ends, the area of the ocean floor, which is referred to by the Convention as "the common heritage of mankind", begins.
Then no State has a special position here.
The right to promote in this area shall be granted by an international institution established by the Convention.
"But the ground of the sea is not a gold miner's country," says Director Mikulka with a little transgression and adds that "its individual areas are legally defined and the system is contractually anchored".
Czech in Pacific
Part of the seabed is also part of the Czech Republic today.
It shares it with other states of the former East Block within the framework of the Interocean Metal Joint Organisation.
In 1991, it was granted the status of a so-called 'road-breaking investor' by virtue of the Convention, as well as the investors of a few other states.
The organization has the right to promote in the ClarionClipperton zone in the Pacific between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The sea floor is divided there, it's a kind of tatra on the sea floor.
"A total area of 75,000 square kilometers can be claimed there.
The area is a rich site of polymetallic concretes containing nickel, copper, cobalt and mangan," another lawyer, Inder Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian employee of the Rober Sandev Division brings such a convergence as a pattern.
She remembers a little potato or, with some imagination, the so-called scheme that the legend after the Golem has brought to life.
German special forces were on site at hostage liberation
The Egyptian government had called for help to resolve the hostage crisis from Germany - the experts came.
When it became serious, the special units were ready, but they did not come into use.
The conditions of liberation of eleven European tourists from Egypt are becoming more and more detailed.
According to the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior, German special forces were also directly involved in the rescue action.
Thus, both specialists in the Federal Defence and GSG 9 officials were the Flying Staff of the Federal Police, the Federal Crimean Office as well as logistics experts from the Technical Relief Office at the place of release.
However, as ministers continued to announce on Monday, the German forces were not needed because the hostages left their prisoners and fled when they had recognized signs of a violent liberation.
The Egyptian Government has adopted the aid offered by Germany to involve them as local support forces.
"It was fortunately not," said one speaker of the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
The attackers had kidnapped the group of five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian and eight Egyptian supporters in southern Egypt on September 19.
After being taken into exile in a desert area in southern Egypt, the hostages in the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad were dragged back and forth.
The identity of the hostages remained unclear to the last time as well as the details of the liberation or possible ransom payments.
The rescuers have now arrived in Cairo.
Steinmeier said that the free hostages were in the obituary of the German message.
He did not speak for details of the release.
In Berlin there were no information at first when they returned to Germany.
According to the "Image" section, the five vacationers and the special forces are to be evacuated with an airbus of the air weapon and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
U.S. House of Representatives Rejects Rescue Package
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress has nearly failed the 700 billion dollar heavy rescue package for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones burst into the depths.
With 206 to 227 votes, the US House of Representatives rejected the government's rescue package for the financial markets.
Despite all the appeals made by US President George W. Bush and leading politicians of both parties, there was no majority for the program that should bring chaos to the financial markets.
In a dramatic action, the advocates had no doubt tried to convince the critics of the 700 billion-dollar heavy package.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic negotiators, had called for a vote, even though the plan was unpopular.
"It's hard to get political recognition for avoiding something that has not yet occurred," he admitted.
Even during the vote, the Dow Jones broke in by more than six percent or by 600 points.
The investors were concerned that the state rescue package could fail.
He recovered shortly before the end of the vote, in order to break down again after the failure.
Experts are now counting on other major turbulences in the international financial markets.
The agreement of both the House and the Senate is needed for the programme to enter into force.
Organisations list increasing booking numbers
It seems to be a good winter for the German tour operators:
In the case of travel bookings for the coming months, sales have increased significantly over the previous year according to a study - even by more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite weak economic outlooks, the rest of the Germans remain unscrupulous according to a study.
In the winter season bookings, the travel agencies recorded a 31% turnover increase compared to the previous year, as reported by the German Travel Association (DRV) on Monday in Berlin.
According to the market research institute GfK, there are already increased booking numbers for the autumn months.
Thus, the sales surplus of travel offices for October amounted to about eleven percent compared to 2007, the DRV reported.
The basis for these results is GfK figures, which evaluate monthly booking data from 1200 German travel offices and account for the total market.
This includes the travel bookings that took place by the end of August 2008.
Because of the weak dollar rate, in particular travel to the United States was requested, the DRV reported.
Here the booking growth is about a third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as the domestic fields of the Germans, were particularly requested destinations.
In particular, holiday trips are high in the course, DrV President Klaus Laepple said.
In view of the rising costs of energy and food, the costs are "better calculated for customers than for individually organised holidays".
For example, consumers could save money through early booking discounts or all-inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
The summer months have also been very well booked, so that there will be a sales surplus again compared to the previous year - although according to another study, the number of Germans who took a trip decreased compared to the previous year.
My First Occasional Feast
Ballermann-Apres-Ski hits in the endless loop, beer made of litres and promises in designer-dirndln.
A Wiesn-debt.
Susanne Kronsucker and I don't really have much in common.
She's a blonde, TV moderator and wears a tailor-made Dirndl.
I have dark hair, I'm a student and my dress is second hand.
One thing, however, connects us: Almost three minutes on the map, the photographers are already crashing on us and cutting the memory cards full - very funny and that on my first visit to the map.
That's how you make friends.
The cheap dirndl seems to fulfill its purpose.
As a Wiesn-Touri and actually located north of the White Warehouse Square, the feeling of well-being remained in touch to date.
But only once did it come on the Theresiensee, everything is half as bad.
Nearly everyone wears a bowel or a leather hat; no one looks inclined or painfully touched - everything is completely normal.
The strange look at the chocolate stand only creates my scratches.
A monk reminds me that I would have wrongly bound the shorts: "Links hoast free, middle young woman, forgive right, wet back."
I'm going to take the left back and the left.
"That's right," she said and laughed.
Others make less effort to subtle flirting techniques and wear simple file clips on which "To drink to get dressed!" stands and stretches an uninvited opposite the naked back.
The young man with the exhibitionist Attitudes is called Bob, comes from England and also visits the October party for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous", with a long dragged "ooooo".
That's what he tells me after he's released his previously drunk measure.
Right next to one of these hydrants, everyone thinks he's a garbage dumper.
So Bob's one of those notorious wild boars.
Others do not have the luck of getting rid of alcohol in this way.
At eight o'clock in the evening sanitizers run over the fortress that have to take care of the poor sluts.
The nurses always appear in the rudder - every four times they drag a covered coat from tent to tent.
This works like with most Wiesn visitors: empty, completely back.
Who's in the Promille Sarg under the plan, you don't see.
"These are the things that goarnimmer packs," one of the sanitaries called me on request and disappeared into the mud.
Name of the accident victim reported by the police
The name of a 63-year-old female pedestrian who died in the hospital after being driven to Essex by a vehicle was announced.
Carole Paulson, who lives in the Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the accident on Friday afternoon at the Shenfield Road in the middle of town.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
A 51-year-old man was arrested after the accident because of the suspicion of easy driving.
In the meantime, he was released from bail.
Turkey expands the diplomatic horizon
Long before Turkey tried to join the European Union, the European authorities were interested in entering Turkey's background.
On the eastern side of the Bosporus, perhaps just 20 steps within Asia, one of the finest relics of this failed, imperial pursuit.
The Hydarpasha Railway Station was designed by the two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in the Neo-Renaissance style.
That's at least what the tour guide tells you.
The building sits at the end of the train path with a tower on each corner of the front and looks like some provincial German Town Hall.
The stone is shit.
The whole building is falling apart.
But once you are inside the entrailed driver's card switch, there is no doubt about the design of the project, whose most Western access was this.
The train station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolian-Bagdad Society.
Germany, which was a late playr in the imperialist game, had to implement its ambitions to dominate the Middle East, through a train connection to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond what is today Saudi Arabia.
But Germany's imperialist projects won during the first world war.
His railways were attacked by Lawrence by Arabs and his Arabs.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, created by the unsurpassed limits of the cold war, has disappeared.
British forces emerged from Egypt and forced the Turks and their German allies from Palestine and Syria
And there were also bad news for the Hyderpasha Railway Station.
In 1917, a ammunition elevator flew into the air, destroying the artificial roof.
Turkish sources say it was Saturday.
Since then, it has fallen slowly, far from history.
Today, however, this railway serves, at least symbolically, as a gateway to Anatolia and everything east of it, to highlight the expansion of the diplomatic horizon of Tükei.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, the ACP, has introduced a very new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the neighbouring regions, created by the borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
A policy of approximation now prevails.
Significantly, the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian groups Hamas and Fatah, with Iran and Iraq and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
In order to be able to evaluate the eects of this new foreign policy, I have spent the night in the Turkish capital of Ankara to visit one of the leading foreign policy experts of the ACP, Turkish Member Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning, about ten and a half hours later, after a humid ride on tracks that produced the same step of the old world in the well-known "The Night Mail" documentation, I arrived in the Turkish capital, which is seen as a new city, for the new world state project, the Ottoman past, turning back.
However, the AKP, known for its Islamic roots, represents a paradigm change in Turkish unity
This has triggered some suspicions in the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi took me to the main shop of the AKP, a specially made, ultra-modern stone and steel construction, in a developing suburb, surrounded by half-completed shopping centers and cages in which middle managers, both men and women, met to close the first shops of the day.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a middle-right politician from almost any other political party in Europe.
Pull on, Krawatte, I'm sure he even packed a Blackberry.
"The aim of the party's foreign policy is now to reintegrate Turkey with its immediate neighbouring countries.
The Cold War was an exception," he tells me.
Turkey was cut off from its back country.
Today she has to look east and west at the same time.
There is neither one nor the other.
She had to do both.
"But certainly Turkey could ever," I asked, "is it forced to decide?"
"Turkey," he said, "doesn't want to make this decision."
He then raised a point that almost everyone I spoke to here said almost routinely: Turkey's relations, not only to the Middle East, but also to the Caucasus and around the Black Sea, are just as beneficial to Europe and the United States as they are to Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be, in the transferred sense, Europe as a whole on level railways east towards Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpashas Railway Station, after another night largely sleepless, I thought of these two German masters Mr Ritter and Mr Conu, who had seen this construction 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to learn that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East could now, to a large extent, be in the hands of Turkey.
And when I was waiting at the dock on the ferry that was supposed to bring me back over the Bosporus, I remembered that in those days Turkey was always called "the sick man of Europe".
At least at that time there seemed to be little doubt about which continent should have a claim on this fascinating country.
In memory of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical director since 1962 Vernon "Death" Handley was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic and Chor.
As part of his music program for the city, he founded his great youth choir, Proteus the following year.
He was meant for young people up to 21 years of age, but when the choir was last sang in 1979, some of us were already at the end of 20 years - we just refused to leave the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological form changer) stood for the readiness and ability of the choir to attack any piece of music that was presented to him, whether it was a Madrigal or from the Messiah, whether a capella or with full orchestra.
The musical diversity of such a young choir was often amazing, always exciting and stood alone and alone thanks to the inspiration of that man and his enthusiasm for the music that never passed.
How often death kept us talking about "the music for ourselves".
He kept saying, "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all in music.
That's how it sings!"
His kind of leadership was absolutely clear and precise, but never overbearing either.
No matter how high the musical level was, he always demanded an even higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any leader was to be beaten to the knight, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the last two decades, from 1962 to 1982, in which he led the Guildford Philharmonic.
Over the past 40 years, I have written criticisms for over a hundred of his concerts and I can honestly say that I have never been disappointed by a single one - often I was inspired by them.
Death Handley was that rare combination of size and personal modesty.
He dismissed the leaders who, according to his words, simply went "homed with one or two known sheep in the world."
So many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In your call for William Woodruff (September 25, 1946), you write that "in 1946 he took over the teaching of economic history in Oxford and in 1950 received a Houblon-Norman Research Fellowship ... while at the same time he studied for a BSc, MA and a doctoral degree.
This is a conclusion from an author's comments in Woodruff's book "Aside from Nab End", however it is not true.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a lecturer in economic history at Nottingham University and during this time he wrote a doctoral work on the British rubber industry under the care of Professor J.D. Chambers, who was later published in 1958 as the "British rubber industry".
He was in the United States from 1950 to 1951 at a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and spent the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham and went to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff wanted to hide this part of his track.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philology.
I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino `Flamenco and Life' because his photographs in black and white, in documentary style, are fantastic.
They made me pay attention to them because of their simplicity and because of the power they emit, as they always treat the protagonists with respect.
An exhibition that shows a lot of feelings.
Resino knows to find the magical moments.'
Second round of excellent sales at Honda.
In November Honda began marketing the second generation of Honda Jazz.
While his predecessor model had a large interior space, these large space limousines offer an even greater size.
In addition, the technical fineties that allow even more comfortable driving and petrol to be saved are also available.
Changes before the forthcoming revolution.
So is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although, aesthetically speaking, the new jazz has a similar line to its predecessor, the changes that have been made to these large limousines are numerous.
Among other things, the innovative design, the new space flexibility, the larger dimensions of the car and the new mechanics should be emphasized.
However, before you begin to analyze the new model, you have to say that this new jazz will appear six years later, after the first generation had appeared on the market.
According to the first observations, Honda managed to renew this model for a shorter time compared to the other manufacturers.
Although Honda Jazz is less known in Europe, this model is a phenomenon with regard to its sale on the other markets.
This is a case in Japan, in the country where Jazz is the most sold car in 2002 and also in 2008.
After Jazz appeared on the market, around a million models were sold in Japan alone.
The second paragraph market was the Old Continent, with about half a million cars sold in six years.
Nevertheless, Honda is trying to increase the sale of the new jazz model within the segment.
In this way, while the Japanese company sold a total of 83 000 Jazz models in 2007, the expected estimates amount to 10,000 cars. This is 17% of the expected growth on the European market.
With regard to the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 Jazz models since 2002. These are 6.7% of the total sales to Honda in Spain.
As for the new generation of the model, the managers of the branches in Spain expect to be able to sell 2,000 Jazz models per year.
More specifically, it allows the appearance of the new Honda Jazz model to conceal the sale in Spain.
In fact, the brand leaders hope to complete the year with total sales of 22,000 models. These are 4 000 cars less than in 2007, a 16% reduction.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda has increased its market share in Spain compared to the previous year (1.6%) to 1.8%.
At the same time, the Japanese company hopes to reach 2% in 2010.
To achieve this share, Honda puts on the appearance of a new model.
This is Insight, a hybrid car with 5 doors and a compact size of 4.7 meters long, the Japanese company hopes to sell around 200 000 models per year around the world.
According to the market estimates of the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of Insight models are sold in the United States, while the rest is distributed on the Old Continent and Japan.
The publication of the Insight on the Market is scheduled for the first month of the year, for the first time its public presentation will take place in Valencia in January.
With regard to the first generation, the new jazz grows in all its sizes.
Its length is 3.90 meters (plus 5 centimeters), its width is 1.69 meters (plus 2 centimeters) and the distance between the axles is 2.50 meters, which leads to the assumption that it has become 5 centimeters larger.
The height, on the other hand, does not change and remains 1.52 meters.
Along with the increase in dimensions, the interior is also enlarged.
This success is due, on the one hand, to the new space flexibility programme and on the other, to the central position of the fuel tank, a solution that was also used in the previous jazz model.
The capacity of the suitcase, which has a double load system, also reaches up to 339 litres, i.e. 19 litres greater than the capacity of the first generation.
It must be stressed that these measures are available in the version with a 1.4 litre petrol engine because the capacity of the Honda Jazz case room with a 1.2 litre petrol engine is 379 litres.
Among other improvements, apart from the additional equipment elements such as leather seats or the possibility of setting up a panoramic window, improved access to seats will be offered.
The opening angle of the rear doors is 80 degrees, with the first jazz having only 67 degrees.
The engines of the second generation of Jazz are also new.
At the beginning of its marketing this small model has 2 gas engines running: 1,2 and 1.4 liters.
Both variants have i-VTEC system, which allows low fuel consumption and smaller CO2 emissions, excellent technical performance and at the same time provides high torque performance for the entire engine run.
The first variant with 1.2 litres achieves 90 PS performance in 6 000 rotations with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4 900 min?1 .
This petrol engine - the predecessor model of Jazz reaches 78 PS - has 5.3 litres of petrol consumption and CO2 emissions of 125 grams.
With regard to the previous engine, which reached 83 PS in the previous generation, it is now able to reach 100 PS.
The jazz 100 PS model 1.4 has 5.4 liters of petrol consumption and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
'Auto-biene', which avoids collisions
In order to advance the development of technologies for accident prevention, Nissan was inspired by nature this time, more precisely, by the bees.
The Japanese company has developed a robot whose flight goes back to the coarse behavior of bees and avoids accidents.
This robot is a Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C and represents the first step in the technologies for accident prevention.
The engineers from the technical development centre of Nissan Motor Co. have developed these small robots in cooperation with the Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology of the renowned University of Tokyo (Japan).
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Director of Technology-PR and R&D Brand Management, the BR23C is an extension of the four-fold Nissan safety signal.
This robot is supposed to ensure that the cars of this brand are able to avoid collisions.
During the flight, each bee builds up its own oval-shaped flight which is very similar to the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important are the facial eyes of the bees, which can see over an angle of 300 degrees in all directions, which allows them to fly uninterruptedly in their personal airspace without interruption.
To reflect the circular perspective, the technicians developed the so-called Laser Range Finder (LRF).
It notices obstacles that are located in front of the BR23C at a distance of up to two meters and are located in the radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to the object and sends a signal to a custom microprocessor, which is translated directly into signal for the avoidance of collision
At the moment when obstacles are observed, the small robot will imitate the bee flight and immediately change direction by turning its wheels around 90o or even larger angle to avoid collision.
The greatest difference to any other system is that this derogation is absolutely instinctive.
If not, then the robot could not be able to react with sufficient speed to avoid obstacles,' explains Toshiyuki Andoh, Director of the Mobility Laboratory and the leading engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot can not vary upwards or downwards, but also cannot overlap; it can only move in two dimensions and in the direction that allows it to rotate its wheels and not in the infinite directions and in an infinite way as the bees do.
For this reason, Nissan has used the rotation function in addition to acceleration and braking functions to avoid collisions by the small robot.
This device requires only a few seconds to process the information and to act according to these details.
It does not need to store the information or intuitive logic of the maneuvers performed, so it can work continuously with only a few dozen KB of the storage space.
This sounds surprising, but it's not about the GBs and not even the MBs of the memory space.
This is the first step in the development of technologies for the immediate prevention of collisions, a technology to introduce Nissan to the serial cars in the next ten years.
The robot works with lithium polymer batteries that are easier and longer than the diversity of lithium ion batteries.
Another possible application of this technology in the future could be the integration of the unit with a GPS navigation system through satellite to avoid obstacles along the way when driving.
She's in the middle before she's charged with a mortgage.
It must be noted that the US Ministry of Finance, except that it has sufficient liquidity to provide support, but is not without power.
Before the crisis and in order to avoid the development of U.S. citizens in mortgage stories of allegedly affordable banks, a entertaining and informative game for Internet surfers has been developed: ‘Bad Credit Hotel’, it says.
Or maybe the 'Hotel of Bad Credit' or the other.
The third aspect of this accommodation and especially its receptionist is to consider one, two, and up to three times whether it is time to ask for no credit.
And especially where you can do it, which is probably the goal of the game.
She certainly has useful information, but without details.
This is rather a page for the teenagers than a place for all spectators.
What happens when the game is expanded?
Well, if a dreamy room appears in the hotel.
At least something, because it's not about buying a better house
Morgan Stanley provides her capital for MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) into its company, which would be the first bank in Japan to spend nine billion dollars and thus take over 21% of its capital, an innovation that is due to a strong fall in its stock exchange rate.
A week after a preliminary agreement was made public, the two banks explained that MUFG 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's stock will be purchased at a uniform cost of $25.25, which amounts to a total of $3 billion.
The accepted price is below 19% of the share price of 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional six billion dollars in the acquisition of convertible shares that will secure them a 10% gain and can be resold at a price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley explained that the global business is being done on the basis of a uniform average price of 29 dollars, i.e. 28% above the current price.
However, Morgan Stanley's share fell to 17.00 GMT by 6.79% to 23.07 dollars.
This strategic link is an important opportunity to accelerate the transition of Morgan Stanley to the status of a holding bank," explained John Mack, Director General of the American Group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this status last week, which would allow him to expand his business to new areas, but under the supervision of the Federal Reserve.
Its connection to MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces Wall Street to adopt a much more cautious attitude than before.
The modalities presented on Monday also show that the agreement has been changed over the last few days: Last Monday Morgan had just stated that it would sell up to 20% of its shares for around 8.5 billion dollars to Japan.
'A week ago', in Tokyo Toshihide Mizuno, managing director of the MUFG, 'we thought that the participation would be entirely derived from tribal property.
But in view of the current economic and market situation, we wanted to reduce the risks and assure ourselves.
Based on a balanced average price, MUFG will pay 7% below its price for its Morgan Stanley shares.
And the business will be reimbursed by about 20% per share with a reduction in profit.
The agreement provides that in one year, MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential shares into shares if the latter are exchanged within a given time limit of more than 50% over the sales value, i.e. about $47.
Morgan Stanley ensures that the funds provided by MUFG will enable him to use investment opportunities, strengthen his balance sheet and increase his sales.
However, a press speaker in the group refused to provide more precise information on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
Following the investment of MUFG, Morgan Stanley should be able to book a payment rate of approximately 15%, one of the best in this sector.
Morgan explained that his balance had been down since the end of August ‘clearly’.
The last few weeks were hard for the group, who had to see how their stock exchange rate declined by half, while the price for insurance against incapacity for payment was rising.
This price went back on Monday, but remained at a high level, at about 12%.
Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivor" of the large investment banks on Wall Street after the competition of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the purchase of Merrill Lynch, announced last week that 15 billion dollars, partly at Berkshire Hathaway, the group of Warren Buffett, had been cancelled.
Rafael Correa this Montag in Quito.
The Republic around the 21st century re-establishs socialism.
This is what is called the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
Gener third was that this Sunday, following the example of his peers and friends, put the plan of a new constitution for the election.
The mission is met because, according to the public results promised by 80% of voters, 64% were in the vote with 'Yes'.
According to these results, 28% agreed with 'No', 7% of the polls were invalid and 0.7% were void.
In order to adopt the draft Constitution, more than half of all the votes cast must be cast.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the end of the poll and a census of a non-governmental organization had announced a clear victory for `Yes' and had predicted 63% to 70%.
On the night of Sunday on Monday, Rafael Correa had demanded the victory of his constitutional project.
The 'constitution has triumphed in overwhelming ways', he had in Guayaquil, the seat of the government 280 kilometers southwest of Quito, assured and congratulated the Ecuadorians.
Of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales, but also by his Chilean equivalent Michelle Bachelet.
The election held in silence by the Organization of the American States (OAS) under observation referred to a text consisting of 444 points to ensure 'new socialism' for which the President is employed.
The constitutional project transfers State violence to the economy by leaving it alone the right to 'development planning' in a country that lives largely from oil production by foreign firms and from the foreign currency that sends immigrants to the country.
The project, which will be carried out in advance of the 2006 Correa elected, also gives the Head of State more comprehensive power, which will be able to carry out up to two consecutive mandates every four years and will have the opportunity to dissolve the National Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he will make use of this power and that a new mandate will be pursued in February 2009.
The Constitution also ensures the principle of free medical care and education, which the President has already begun to introduce in that country with 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population live below the poverty line.
At the last end, it also foresees banning the presence of foreign troops, which will provide an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington on the use of an equatorian support point as the starting station for American anti-drug use.
The 19 hostages were released in Chad
An Egyptian command launched the attack on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions who were arrested ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions who were held trapped in the desert for eleven days were brought back to the Egyptian capital on Monday afternoon.
In the morning they were freed from an Egyptian command in Chad.
Apparently in good condition, the hostages reached the military base al-Maza on board a special aircraft at 3.30 p.m. right next to Cairo International Airport.
They were brought directly, without being able to speak to the press, on board a helicopter to the Maadi hospital, a foreign district of Cairo, to be investigated there.
They enjoyed all the 'best health' and the kidnappers 'was not paid any ransom', said Egyptian Minister Zoheir Garanna on the roll field.
After being arrested on September 19 at a field car safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat in the border area of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, the group of hostages was repeatedly brought back from 35 unknown kidnappers from a hiding place.
These are eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and also eight Egyptians: two drivers, four drivers, a border guard and director of the agency of Egypt, organizer of the Safari.
An Egyptian security officer explained that 30 members of the special units, from the board of two helicopters, launched the attack at night, just before dawn.
'On both sides fell shots and half the kidnappers were killed, the rest fled,' said this responsible man, who wants to remain anonymous.
He explained that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special units were sent to Sudan, where they were supported by German and Italian orders.
The head of the Italian diplomat Franco Frattini reported from Belgrade where he is, about the role of the secret agents and elements of the Italian special units.
"We must acknowledge that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and performance of our men from the secret service and from the special units," he explained without further details.
He also argues that a ransom has been paid.
In the morning the Sudanese army had claimed to have stopped a field vehicle on a patrol in which the kidnappers, six of whom, including the leader from Chad, were killed and two prisoners.
The army explained that they were linked to a rebel group from Darfur, the Liberation du Sudan-Unité movement (SLA-U), but that this movement was immediately opposed.
Letters - The silent majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture makes headlines and is the central theme of the current election.
I'm getting better.
But one area of our cultural life remains forgotten.
Who will rise and launch the pitiful sums that are given to the small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical sites that are being falsely hungry?
What politicians will dare to remind the federal government that it neglects its monuments and its culturally important buildings?
That there are no laws in Quebec, as in Canada, that effectively protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government provides 3.5 million euros alone for the restoration of the Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley?
With our American neighbours, it is written in the Constitution of her country that the protection of the cultural heritage belongs to the culture of the American and that this cultural heritage must be protected by all citizens, all deputies and all government districts, in mutual agreement.
In Quebec, in the Association of Historic Societies Quebec, at least 40,000 dignitaries gathered in 211 Historic Societies are working hard to deal with history, to save the numerous private archives with a few larges, and to preserve the archaeological remains.
They are also often the watchdogs of our cultural heritage, who protest with the power of despair, when supporters and decision makers release their bulldozers on our old stones and forgotten peace shelters.
When will there be a stage for history and cultural heritage?
Benelux governments State parts of Fortis Bank
With a partial nationalisation, the Benelux States of the Belgian-Holland Fortis Bank, which has been affected by the US financial crisis in Turbulence, want to take up arms: the three States provide the Banking and Insurance Institute, which also has branches in Hungary, with a total of EUR 11.2 billion.
The Governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands have consulted at the highest level on the weekend, together with the President of the European Central Bank and the Commissioner of the Competition Authority of the European Commission.
In the euro area, Fortis is the first victim of the international financial market crisis that has been continuing for a year, so decisions that are now taken in connection with the bank could have a pre-emptive effect.
In the sense of the decision taken on Sunday, all three states purchase the respective shares of the bank by about 49 percent.
The Bank will probably sell part of its shares, in advance of all the insurance activities purchased by the Dutch ABN Amro last year.
Last week the shares of Fortis began a steep trip, and in the second half of the week there were already serious crisis scenarios.
However, analysts agree that the bank with its 85,000 employees is too large for a plea.
The Institute's securities fell by 12% on a 14-year-old depth on Friday.
Since January, the value of the shares has fallen by more than two thirds.
In view of the current stock price, the market value of the group is EUR 14 billion, which is unrealistic according to management.
According to management, the USD 700 billion expensive American rescue package and the resulting uncertainty on the markets are due to the downturn of Fortis shares.
On Monday, however, the rates rose slightly.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed the new Director General of the Bank.
The money institution was also looking for a private buyer, but there was no interest in a business offer.
The Belgian government was trying to calm down - no investor should spend his money, it said.
There has been no panic among the customers so far, the branches of the bank have not been stormed.
In Hungary the Fortis has its own branches, but it also calls its own leasing companies.
Fuchs in the chicken stable
Because of human drug consumption, in America life and health insurance often refuse to conclude a contract with a customer.
Data protection experts fear that the data market may become uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programs that link the use of drug data in any case to the consent of the person concerned.
These should be in independent hands, otherwise we trust the Fuchs the chicken" - says Washington Post Richard Dick, developer of the program for tracking prescription data.
Insurance determines the fees and payments in case of damage depending on the health condition of the customer, and should be considered too high the risk, the insurance will not be completed at all.
Previously, the customer was sent to a medical examination and the contract was concluded only in the light of the results of the investigation.
Ten years ago, Dick invented a much cheaper method: based on the customer's identification number, he refers to the data of the last one and a half years of the pharmacies, talk about which medicines were bought, and the program calculates what the customer suffers from and how his health condition is.
For example, if he regularly buys large amounts of cholesterol lowering medicines, it was suggested that his blood fat level is untreated, which would automatically select him into a higher risk group.
There are several versions of the program in circulation - some even define a risk multiplier, so that the insurance needs to do more just the paper scrap, however there are smaller difficulties.
One of the disadvantages is that many medicines can be taken for various purposes, such as migration and heat fluctuations, but also for depression.
The latter is a high risk factor from the perspective of the insurers, while the latter are not mentioned.
For the purpose of querying and processing the data, companies have formed their own companies which, before they relate to the data, ask patients for their consent.
In the meantime, they must do so by law, even though there have not been concessions so far.
Some companies even process the results of laboratory tests and link them with the data on drug consumption. This allows them to provide an even more accurate picture of the health condition of patients.
More and more companies have access to the data, and control of their use is becoming more difficult at the same time.
While there is a private data protection law for health data, its effect extends only to healthcare providers and insurance.
The draft law has already been submitted to the Congress, which would allow the authorities to control data processing companies.
Dick Richard sees that this is too little, so he wants to develop his program so that the data can only be passed on with the consent of the person concerned.
Another question is, of course, that the person concerned can hardly prevent access to his data, since the insurance does not otherwise conclude a contract with him.
And that's how the chickens leave the mercy of the fox.
Global food plan from Marseille
European Union and India to double trade
Since the European Union and India are both the leading trading partners of each other, this was the main issue in addition to other global problems at the ninth summit.
Today, too, the French-Indian summit is taking place, where mainly the cooperation in the nuclear energy sector is discussed.
While the European Union recognises that India is an ambitious, democratic power that should be given more votes and co-operation in international affairs, Member States have not yet been able to agree whether or not to support the permanent membership of New Delhi in the UN Security Council.
This question was not discussed at the ninth summit in Marseille yesterday.
The French President and current EU Council President Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as Commission President José Manuel Barroso and Chief Diplomat Javier Solana, received the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. An agreement was reached to double trade over the next five years, i.e. to increase to EUR 100 billion.
In view of the fact that trade between 2000 and 2007 has increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this objective is not even so ambitious.
In this sense, the 26 existing civil aviation agreements with India have also been legally incorporated into an agreement, so that air transport will be flying in the future.
By 2009, India would like to sign the Free Trade Agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the pact.
The aim is to strike a balance between the EU and India in an unbalanced way: while the EU is the number one India partner, New Delhi is only in the ranking nine among EU partners.
The summit was devoted to global concerns.
Among these were the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, namely terrorism, which both sides condemned to the most severe. The convening of a UN conference was also urged.
The Doha Rounds should also be completed, both sides being guilty of failure.
The EU stressed that it is holding on to its energy and climate programme, which means that emissions of pollutants should be reduced by at least 20% by 2020.
In this way India agreed, as well as with the proposal to conclude a kind of global compromise at the forthcoming climate summit and to reduce greenhouse gas production by 50 percent by 2050.
The price rise in food should also be combated, so both support the convening of an international conference on the subject of the financial crisis.
The Indian Chief of Government today visits the French capital, where he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at a bilateral meeting.
In Paris we are looking forward to orders from French companies worth EUR 20 billion for the construction of nuclear reactors in India.
According to the Agency's reports, the agreement is to be decided on at 15 years' duration.
Over 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Strong presence of Italian publisher at the International Frankfurt Book Fair.
More than 300 Italian publishers will be present at the 60th fair, the most important international event for law enforcement.
The international Frankfurter Buchmesse is expected for the current event over 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries. They will be distributed over the 171,790 square meters of the fair and over 403,000 titles. Turkey will be the host of the event.
The Undersecretary of the Ministry of Cultural Property and Cultural Activities Maria Giro will represent the Italian government during the opening ceremony in the exhibition hall: Italy will represent the 264 sqm exhibition room "Punto Italia".
This will be followed by a press conference near the room structure in the exhibition hall 5.0 of the fair: on this occasion figures, trends and perspectives will be discussed about publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of the books of foreign writers throughout the world, but especially in the adult and youth sectors, is declining.
Found the billionaire Steve Fossett's little aircraft that disappeared a year ago
The small plane of Steve Fossett, which was discovered on 3 September 2007 on a flight over the desert of Nevada, was discovered.
The individual parts were found on a 3,000 m high plateau, in the area of Sierra Nevada Mammoth Lakes between the states of California and Nevada.
However, there were no human remains inside the aircraft.
The Sheriff of Madeira County, John Anderson, fully resolved the latest doubts during a press conference: "The aircraft has been located, and a troops have been sent to it. Now we have the assurance that it is the aircraft with which Steve Fossett flew on the day of his disappearance."
Mr. Anderson also confirmed that no human remains were found on or near the plane.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Office (Ntsb) informed that a team had been deployed just a few hours after the aircraft was spotted, which identified the machine: it was the Bellanca 8kcab that was lost on September 3, 2007, after the rocket in Yerington in Nevada was launched for a 3-hour flight.
Finally, in California, near the border to Nevada, some of the personal objects of Fossette were found by a couple near their home at the Mammoth Lakes.
This is about two statements with the name Fossetts, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of linois, cash and a jacket.
The search for Fossett was abandoned one month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had captured a place in history through a long sequence of records.
In 2002, he was able to cross the world ball in a lift balloon: a two-week, single flight.
Three years later he flew the world into a single flight without an intermediate landing with an airplane.
Among its several records is also a flight of 15445 m above the Andes, this one with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect
A suv that falls through its original design and the special line management, the outgoing surface and its clear angle from the traditional schemata.
Mercedes-Benz has tried to raise the sector's new breath with this offroader.
Just because of its extraordinary properties, the idea of Suv Glk will also fall unconventionally, which will be seen in the Mercedes-Benz showroom from October 17.
Thus the advertising drum that will accompany the appearance of the new model will also appear in a new dress, that is, in the form of a 3D campaign – this is a novelty in the car sector in Italy lagging behind.
A project with a peak effort to be carried out in different phases, taking the central shopping miles of Milan, to Corso Como by 15 November.
The first phase will consist of the presentation of the car in form, with 3D glasses distributed near the Corso Como to give the whole a special optic: the new suv will appear in its almost real dimensions as a three-dimensional model.
In fact, the car appears to stand out from the poster on which it is painted.
This is done by means of the Enlightenment8 technology of the new glk in different moments in all its details to recompile on it as a whole.
Without a doubt, the concern of Mercedes with this advertisement is to introduce a new type of authorship in this rather stereotype field.
But will it be possible to travel the interest of future buyers? We will see.
Now it's clear who the Italian Hooligans are.
They come from the Triveneto – now they risk stadium ban
Who are only these 150-200 boys and girls for which all Italy is ashamed now? They are part of the "Ultras Italia" group, which has been travelling behind the Italian national team for years and which, frankly, has not caused any serious problems until recently.
Never before did it come to clash with rival fans.
The origin of the group is in the right environment.
The sponsors come from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
Other smaller groups from Campania and Apulia were formed in Sofia.
They wear the tricolori on which the cities of the militants appear: however, they were away on Saturday to avoid identification.
Their examples are the English fans.
In Bulgaria, it now coincided with a truly radical fan scene, that of Levski.
From the Figc, the Italian fans had 144 cards available for the game: all were displayed on names and thus easily checked.
In fact, they were all controlled by the Viminal: among those who traveled to Sofia, no one was with an ongoing stadium ban procedure.
Four fans of the Italian team, who had already been booked in this regard, were also denied the ticket and the trip to Bulgaria.
Now the Viminal is waiting for the reports of the Bulgarian police to take further steps: in this case, the arrested or extremised tyfosi may count with a stadium ban for at least five years.
This is an international ban which prevents access to the stadiums throughout Europe.
So our hooligans will no longer put one foot in a stadium.
Good luck.
But now, of course, there is fear of copyists, who could follow these little more than 150.
"This fire must be issued immediately, and that does not give such behaviour the opportunity to justify it at all," says the Viminal.
Therefore, "Look at especially also with a view to the national team's game on Wednesday in Lecce."
In fact, there is a small core of Italian Ultras in Apulia.
Tomorrow, the Osservatorio (Sportsurvey), on Tuesday, gathers the Casms, which can count on a part of the aise, that is, the secret services that deal with the problem of stadium violence.
"Duce-Duce-Rufe and the raised right arm during Mameli's Hymne? In Bulgaria this is not a punishment..."
This is the thought of Domenico Mazzilli (expressed clearly without joy), who has been the director of the Observatory on the Viminal for a few weeks (he took over the posts of Francis Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
In the past, Mazzilli was the President of the Police of Trieste, where a core of the supporters of Ultras Italia was founded in 2002.
It is true that Mazzilli says that in Bulgaria it is not against the law to praise the Duke, but it was undoubtedly the behaviour of these 150-200 people.
"I am not a sociologist – adds the observatory No. 1 – crimes are committed in the country of their actions.
So far, this group has been on the move, but now we need to consider what has happened and what will happen.
But we also talk about the peppers during the Hymne Mamelis: even though this is not a punishment, but allow me to miss the education ...".
