Inflation in Europe jumped due to food
The acceleration of inflation in the euro area is due, in particular, to a steady rise in food prices.
The November price growth in the 13 euro area countries was higher than expected, after 2,6 per cent in October, annual inflation of 3,1 per cent was reported by the Luxembourg Statistical Office of the Union.
The official forecast was only 3 percent, the agency Bloomberg reported.
Unlike the US, British and Canadian emission banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not reduced its basic interest rate by reducing its share of raw materials and reducing unemployment by creating inflationary spirals.
The ECB would like to maintain the inflation rate below two per cent, but close to them.
According to one of the analysts, the ECB is in an absurd situation: inflation must be "recast" so that it does not have to do anything later in this matter.
In Germany, November inflation represents 3.3 per cent of the 15-year record; then in Spain it fell from 3.6 per cent to 4.1 per cent.
Inflation in the euro area has deteriorated rapidly due to rapidly rising food and energy prices.
The term wheat prices rose by 88%, and soybeans also reached the highest values since 1973.
Similarly, in 2007 it was necessary to pay substantially more for edible oil and dairy products.
The oil price on world markets this year rose by 52 per cent and last month it was already one barrel of black gold worth nearly $100.
According to the ECB, inflation will jump from 2.1 per cent this year to 2.5, but in 2009 it will fall to 1.9.
According to the analysis, 12-month inflation levels will remain at approximately 3 per cent over the next 3-4 months, but its average annual rate will be 2.1 per cent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to reduce interest rates immediately twice during 2008.
Gallup sees the government crisis
The circle of supporters of Fidesz moves after the prolonged stagnation at the beginning of December has grown significantly and is now the largest camp since 2002, while in the case of the Gallup Institute's Socialists, 13% of the support has never been planned.
In the case of certain parties' wishes, the difference - due to the greater determination of the opposition's voters - would represent more than two-thirds (71%) of support against the 5th support of the MSZP.
The MDFs and SZDS are under the threshold for Parliament's accession: their support for the entire population is double.
Among certain party voters are the supporters of both camps by one percent more.
The public's view on the economy has also deteriorated, given the previous minimum - there has never been a ratio of those who consider the economic situation of the country to be very bad, so high - 41 per cent, while according to the following 46 per cent, the situation is quite bad.
The family's assessment of the change in its material situation after the spring and summer hopeful prospects is now more pessimistic.
As for next year, it counts most of the population with further deterioration and only tens with improvement.
In December, 71 per cent of the respondents were judged, which is most of all Gallup's current research at the Institute that the prime minister is doing his job worse than it is.
Ferenci Gyurcsána believes or very believes 13 percent of the respondents, while Victor Orbán shares 38 percent of the beneficiaries.
The Prime Minister doesn't believe 54 percent, the President's move is 27 percent.
One indicator of the development of the political situation is how much of the public believes that dissatisfaction with the prime minister can be resolved without a change of government.
While the government and the prime minister were considered to be 35 per cent in the wake of last October's disturbances, the rate is now only 20 per cent, while the relative majority (33 per cent) are looking at the solution only in writing new elections.
In the interest of the referendum, it is noteworthy that 60 per cent of the respondents replied to the question of their possible participation that the referendum would certainly come and another 20 per cent reported that it would probably come.
For comparison, "the parliamentary elections scheduled this week" would certainly be attended by only 55 per cent and 15 per cent considered their participation as likely. The success of the referendum would be beyond doubt on the basis of the current intentions.
The school would say no to 74, medical fees 79, and hospital stays 84 percent.
If we look at the same shares only in the circle of people who certainly promise to participate, then the introduction of school fees, doctor fees and hospital stay fees would be 81, 84 and 89 percent.
The most expensive is Auchan, almost five times the Tesco
The hypermarkets in the Budaurs triangular trade had been maintained last year, on average 16% of the price increase, with the difference that this year there was no increase in VAT.
Article in the Journal Do Not Know
The usual Christmas consumable basket of the Napi Masterság magazine in the Budaurs shopping triangle this year grew by an average of 16 per cent, but in all hypermarkets there was an increase of over a thousand forints in the price.
Since the prices in the supermarkets of the food "flights" already fell in December, as a percentage of the previous high base did not show up until such drastic betrayal.
For consumers, however, what they could easily buy at a price of under nine thousand forints is certainly not going to be even ten thousand now.
The consumer basket of the daily economy in tested hypermarkets exceeded the psychological limit of ten thousand forints by at least 91 forints.
The highest price of trash was 10,573 forints.
(In 2003 a consumer basket of 6,800 forints was made.)
The price of Unica and the living fish remained at the last level, but they were very upset by the rough breasts, nuts and also worms.
The prices of bread and flour corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office, although in Auchan we found a kilogram of bread even for 139 forints.
Competition did not price the product under 200 forints.
It was equally surprising in this shop that the price of two litres of Coca Coly in the bottle was below 200 forints, so even the stock became only 257 forints.
However, this year he appeared according to the consumer's journal Napi Masterság Auchan as the most expensive, while Cora as the cheapest.
According to our proposals, prices in the consumer's diary Napi Masterság were raised due to the prices of Christmas Cora at 15, while Tesco i Auchan was about 18 per cent.
When compared to last year's highest and this year's lowest consumer basket values, the difference was 12 per cent, while the increase between last year's lowest and this year's highest is 21 per cent.
There was an increase of 1,480 in the furnaces.
The average increase in the prices of wool was 1,206 forints, with the price of wool on Christmas being influenced by VAT growth.
It was this process that turned the trade upside down, and the business houses obviously could not decide how large price ranges should be determined for individual products as they could not predict the impact of the change in prices on consumption.
(If the trader plans the speed of the turnover of the product concerned incorrectly, the price range of the adjusted intensity of the turnover may result in significant profits.)
Due to VAT, the rise in the price of the consumer basket Napi Masterság showed so extreme that the price of the most expensive basket was 1,720 forints higher than in 2006, while the cheapest made the price difference of 844 forints everywhere.
This year the extreme difference did not appear, the most expensive basket now stood at 1,630 forints more than wool and also the cheapest one at 1,284 forints.
In comparison with both Christmas season, there has been a dramatic price increase in prices, and in less than 20 months the daily consumption in hypermarkets has dropped by more than 30 per cent.
(This, among other things, does not fully confirm the Central Statistical Office's data: in the case of a few basic foods, the price increase of more than 30 per cent over 12 months.
In addition to flour, for example in the case of eggs.)
However, in the latter case, according to the consumption basket of the day-to-day economy, it seems impossible because the price level of the product, quite expensive already last year, has proved to be the basis even in the worst case of price growth hardly above 10 %.
Moisture suppliers are taking an increasingly strong position than egg suppliers, and they have also been able to make drastic increases in prices in international chains.
Hypermarkets in the gold triangle do not complain, they still refer to a good year.
According to our experience, most customers in the three visited stores are no longer interested in the price.
They're buying everything in cash, they're taking sustainable food for wages.
On Wednesday morning all three supermarkets formed long fronts at the warehouse, as the number of visitors grew rapidly.
However, as we know, in the countryside there is a lower turn, more international chains are complaining to research firms that markets remain behind their plans, not only in the case of food, but also in the case of sustainable consumer goods.
In many places it is stored on disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand cases of infection have been reported in hospitals mainly due to inappropriate use of antibiotics.
The health conditions of the hospitals, the filling of beds, the overload of the staff do not help to stop the disease, says the Prime Minister of the National Epidemiological Centre.
In many places, they also use disinfectants.
Recently, MRSA infection was diagnosed at the traumatological department of St. John's Hospital.
Bacteria resistant to antibiotics were detected in a man who went to the hospital after a serious traffic accident.
The patient was isolated.
A similar infection occurred at the same location at the beginning of the year.
A patient injured in a serious car accident was released at home, but not long after having to return with MRSA infection and due to the bacteria present in his body, a major operation could not have been performed.
By 10 December this year, the National System of Nesocomialis Surveillance reported 1,094 hospital infections caused by multi-resistant disease origins, said Karolina Böröczová, mayor of the National Epidemiological Centre.
This means that so many infections caused by multi-resistant disease origins have been safely registered in hospitals, and others are unknown.
Nearly two thirds (683) of the infections were caused by MRSA, or methicillin-oxacilin with staphylococcal resistant gold.
Bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (SA) carries one third of the people in the nose without causing disease.
Infections caused by SA (e.g. foot inflammation, inflammation of the jaws, skin infection, wounded infection) respond well to antibiotics and are treated well.
However, if antibiotics are administered to an excessive or inappropriate extent, they develop from bacteria that react well to bacteria which are very resistant to antibiotics and which spread rapidly under inadequate medical conditions.
In particular, in the case of transient or persistent malfunctions of the immune system in patients with weakened body, low body weight or in patients over the years, severe hospital infections, such as wound infection or blood poisoning - sepsis may occur.
According to the top physician, St. John's hospital is nothing special about MRSA infection, similar infections are among the daily practices in hospitals.
"The infection must not be replaced by an epidemic, MRSA is not only there," said Tibor Nyulas, "where the presence of the origin of the disease has not been investigated."
Adopts Antibiotics
"We isolate these patients, the treating staff is treating them in rubber gloves and masks and we need antibiotics to treat them," said Tibor Nyulasi.
Patients receiving into the hospital are pre-tested whether they are present in their MRSA system, but infection cannot always be avoided.
The sample selection is not in fashion
The major majority of MRSA-induced hospital infections could be prevented, however, current conditions and conditions in domestic hospitals are not favourable for the prevention and spread of multi-resistant causes of disease, says Karolina Böröczová.
As this infection occurs in hospitals and nursing homes, patients should be monitored and the MRSA carriers isolated immediately.
However, the selection of microbiological samples in Hungarian hospitals is not fashionable.
It also plays a role in the failure of the National Health Insurance Fund to finance this investigation.
Most cases have been detected if the patient is suffering from detectable MRSA infection, the epidemiological center principal said.
The European Union has strict recommendations for the appropriate treatment of antibiotics in the field of human medicine and there are also home guidelines for the treatment of individual infections, diseases.
Efforts should be made to ensure that antibiotics are targeted, or a microbiological examination should be carried out to prevent the development of resistance to drugs, but neither should the patient in all cases be observed.
The sampling of microbiological samples is even more rare in the basic, and ambulatory treatment of patients, according to Karolina Böröczová.
Saves on disinfectants
According to scientific evidence, MRSA is most common among patients through medical personnel.
Therefore, it plays a very important role in washing hands and using gloves and masks, but there are serious deficiencies in hospitals.
MRSA is also transmitted with capillary infection and touch, but it is not always possible to isolate infected patients under home conditions.
On the contrary, rooms are often filled, beds are often very close to themselves, although from an epidemiological point of view patients should be at least 1.5 metres away.
As Karolina Böröczová noted, unfortunately we can also meet with the fact that in hospitals where they are in an unfavourable material situation, they are looking at disinfectants, there are few nurses and many patients, which is still increasing the chance of infection.
According to Karolina Böröczová, there is where the necessary protective measures are observed, similar infections are manifestly less or further spreads of the disease origin may be stopped.
Government anti-MRSA programme
Treatment of MRSA infection is a huge expense for health insurance and therefore is fought against everywhere.
For example, in England, the government has written down a MRSA prevention programme and reduced its appearance.
The programme appears to be successful, according to the published data, the trend of MRSA infection in England is decreasing.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) lists the prevention of the emergence of multi-resistant disease origins (including MRSA), respectively, of the hospital infections caused by these disease origins, among their priorities.
The police captain who caused the fatal accident was not drunk
The official knowledge assessment in the case of the 21st District Chief of Police who caused a fatal accident is complete.
It can be ruled out that the commander of the 21st District, who died on Tuesday and who, in the meantime, resigned from his duties, was under the influence of alcohol or fake substances, informed the speaker of Attila Morvai's Chief State Office on Friday after a knowledgeable judgment of this case was completed.
The investigation confirmed the result of the initial investigation, which has already found that the former police captain had no alcohol before he was seated as a wheelman.
The then director of the 21nd District Police Directorate hit Lajose Kossuth on Tuesday in the 21st District by his own personal car, turning away from the 50-year-old man who entered before him when crossing the vehicle outside the designated crossing.
(The last known fact that the walker has crossed beyond the zebra, the rest according to road traffic rules, is not an easy circumstance, the turnaround car has to give priority.)
After moving to the hospital, the walker died.
Because of this incident, the district police director withdrew and requested a transfer to the office, according to the police report, because he was so upset.
In this case, the investigation of the State Investigation Office of Budapest is carried out.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former police captain had been working with state investigators from the beginning.
Another EUR 400 million for infrastructure
The agreement on the three credit frameworks totaled EUR 400 million in support of education, transport and environmental infrastructure and energy was signed by the Minister of Finance, Mr. János Veres and Mr. Marta Gajeck, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) on Friday.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved the Hungarian budget financing of transport and environmental projects under the Cohesion Fund, within a value of EUR 300 million, where the parties had previously concluded a 100 million loan agreement, the signed contract now concerns the remaining EUR 200 million.
The loan agreement of EUR 150 million is also used to finance the budget of projects linked to education.
For Hungary, the EIB approved a total of EUR 300 million for these purposes, which could be used for the remaining EUR 150 million later, with the extension of the credit agreement.
In the area of innovation, the parties signed a 50m-euro contract, which will mainly use the budget for the Debrecen University research and development project.
The meeting was also about the 4th subway route.
The parties agreed that after Hungary has agreed with the EU the details of the financing of the metro will return to whether and how the original contract should be amended.
According to Jánose Verese, this may occur in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects in Hungary by EUR 8.4 billion.
The amount of the loans provided by the EIB with an eight-year waiting period and without a binding commission is linked to the EURIBOR rate.
Bulgaria is the real paradise of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is amazing - the attention of the whole of Europe is turning to the former somewhat neglected Balkan country.
What, where and who buys the cheapest ever, but fast with the EU's cheating market?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
Bulgaria is now the most sought after Eastern European property purchase goal with its cheap ski apartments and houses on the seashore.
From the mountain are most in the course of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitoša, then on the sea coast of Albena, Gold Sands, the Sun Coast, the ancient cities of Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people are also searching for properties around Kavarna and Balčik.
According to the analysts from Re/Max Bulgaria, the interest of investors and the central part of the country - for example, Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - will be aroused sooner or later and more interested people will also be buying in the surrounding exhibition of the cheap city of Russia.
The capital of Sofia is also a promise of soft options, commercial and office spaces promise the highest return.
Bulgaria is on the best path to change into one of Europe's most attractive golf paradises, and thus to stay alongside the summer and winter season sought out for the journey even in the next two years.
Predictive investors are already buying in a large, for example, in the area of Banska.
According to analysts, real estate buyers in Bulgaria are also trying to change their life and lifestyle.
Most customers come from England, but buyers from France, Belgium, Spain and more often from Romania.
There are also Maltese and Cypriot investors here, at the Black Sea and then in the ski gardens there are traditionally many Russian customers.
Foreign buyers can be divided into three groups, says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Seizing people buy either renovated properties of 50 to 100 thousand euros, or destroyed old houses for 5 to 15 thousand euros, which are then renovated.
They require good accessibility and communication opportunities, which are important for them close to the big city, shops and the local doctor’s routine.
The second category is the buyers of the chat (Bulgaria ranked among the first 10 German recreational goals in December).
The third group is made up of commercial investors who buy in the hope of a rise in value in the medium- or long-term horizon.
The city's real estate is uninterrupted, because demand is even stronger.
In Bulgaria, however, the lowest prices of reality in the European Union have grown by 21 per cent per year in the last five years.
The increase in real estate prices significantly exceeds the increase in wages.
Fodor and six percent Hungarian
According to information provided by the Minister of the Environment and the Aquaculture of Gábor Fodor, the meeting of experts will be concluded on Tuesday and the international conference on the climate regime will continue to hold a ministerial meeting after 2012.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world are discussing the Travel Map from Bala, which addresses the following efforts after the emission reduction period defined in the Kyoto Protocol by 2012.
At this point, there is a stormy debate between developed and developed countries.
The United States has also announced that they do not want to deal with exact numbers now, although they agree to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25 to 40 per cent by 2020 due to the state in 1990.
The next major issue of the conference is whether the developed countries will join in addition to reducing emissions to supply both material and technological assistance to countries that are rejected.
The agreement was also born on subsidies for developing countries.
The Fund, set out in the Kyoto Protocol, will be led by the 16-member board of directors, probably within the framework of the World Environment Programme (GEF) at the UN - we can read in the magazine Piac es Profit.
Six percent Hungarian
The Minister for the Environment and the Aquaculture Gábor Fodor, on behalf of Hungary, supports the EU's efforts to maintain its leading role in the global climate protection effort and to support the creation of a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister stated that the EU is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent against 1990 levels by 2020, irrespective of the success of the adoption of the 'agreements after 2012', and is prepared to commit to a 30% reduction in the case of other mature regions of the world, and the developed countries will be willing to accept responsibilities and commitments that meet their potential.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that the countries that joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 had reached the target of a 5.2 per cent reduction, with the EU 15 Member States having committed 8 per cent.
Hungary's commitment is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6% against the years 1985-87, which our authorities will. - It is recalled in the press report of the Ministry of the Environment.
Bali is a lot because within two years it is necessary to adopt an international agreement on long-term climate change policy, otherwise its entry into force with certainty would have moved to 2012. In this case, the reduction commitments set out in the Kyoto Protocol would not immediately reinstate the new emission reduction system, whose need in its latest report has also been highlighted by the UN's international scientific body dealing with climate change - IPCC, which is the holder of the Nobel Peace Prize.
This would lead to a delay in emissions reductions and an inevitable increase in Earth's average temperature of more than 2 degrees Celsius, which scientists believe would have extremely serious and irreversible consequences.
British Army is running a set on YouTube
British military units publish on the server to share video recordings from actions in Iraq and Afghanistan, which they promote themselves.
First of all, YouTube has liked British Air Force (RAF): special units operating in Afghanistan have been recording videos from actions against the Taliban since March 2006, the BBC announced.
Recordings, equipped with a miniature camera attached to the trailer, are controlled by the Air Force Command in the Kandahar area and then sent further to London, where they are transferred to the Internet.
Political message is inevitable
This form has already received 139 recordings of British Air Force soldiers on the Internet and their "channel" has already seen more than 75 thousand people.
The British Ministry of Defence registered in spring 2007 as "defenceheadquarters" and publishes recordings of events in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Commonwealth Office) and international peace units in Iraq (MNFI) have their own channels on YouTube.
Inception in Afghanistan
Air forces have published videos according to their original purpose for the recruitment and according to the Ministry of Defence are also good for public awareness of the actual purpose of the presence of the army abroad.
"Propaganda published in this form against traditional television sets advertising is almost nothing," said BBC expert on defence issues Gordon Mackenzie, "but there is also a certain political message in it, because the special form confirms the legitimacy of the military actions the government has decided to take."
The Americans have made a game
The army is concerned that in addition to carefully adjusted, censored recordings, amateur videos are also available on the server, including the death of soldiers: in a few covert, "official" promotional films, the officials are talking about losses, but there is no blood form of battle.
The Internet has already received many videos from fighters in Iraq and Afghanistan, which occurred during a severe attack, but the British army has come upon them so far.
Americans perform a set a little different - using a shooting game called America's Army, which is free to download and in which the player can get directly into the skin of soldiers through more faithful simulations.
There will be Christmas in the ministry with a ball and a pajamas
The Minister of Labour Monika Lamperth is apparently not sentimental: instead of a Christmas party, he arranges a final working meeting for his employees, which will be held with the 2007 Easter party.
In some ministries there will be a celebration with live music, and elsewhere it will delight officials with the Christmas atmosphere with a symbol and drink.
Dinner, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and Swedish table - so enjoys powerful.
The government is also preparing for Christmas.
This year the Ministry of Defence organizes the most expensive Christmas celebration of the Ministry of Defence, but does not expect its employees.
About Christmas orphans will receive gifts from the children of fallen soldiers, at the Mission's holidays will host family members of soldiers who are currently serving in foreign missions, but also arrange receptions for journalists.
The resort is dedicated to the atmosphere at the end of the year 25 million.
The National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economics and Transport (GKM) will dispose of the mine against the other resorts.
The GKM dinner is held in the centre of Jövˈ Háza, with a total of 4,320,000 forints and of the six hundred ministry employees about three hundred and fifty guests are expected.
The resort will be held at its celebration of Christmas traditions, but it will also come at different performances and will also draw the symbol.
The NFÜ Christmas was 4,700,000 forints and took place on Wednesday in the State Judicial Council (OIT) building - concerts and dinners were on the program.
The rental of the hall was made up of millions of forints, the rest was made up of more than four hundred invited.
It seems that one NFÜ department is invited to another Christmas celebration: this is where the company is organised to ensure the course of tenders, the Hungarian Centre for Economic Development (MAG) from the Union money.
To this end, they rented the building of the Vígsinhaz theatre.
The MAG a. s. did not confirm this information because we were unable to reach the person concerned.
Do not wear clothes
The ILO building not only hosted the NFÜ, but also the Ministry of Justice and Security, which held St. Lucie's dance on 7 December instead.
However, the ILO did not want money from him for using its halls.
Five hundred people attended the dance.
The dinner began with the Minister of Health, and after dinner it was possible to dance for live music.
According to the answer to the portal question [origo] to the dance, there were no mandatory evening dress or dress at all.
The Puritan party is going to be a resort of health, work and local self-government.
The Ministry of Health organizes a programme and a celebration for employees for 400,000 forints in its own building.
Minister of Labour Monika Lamperth's collaborators don't even officially call for a Christmas party, but at the final working meeting.
There are hundreds of 80 guests who, according to the press department, will only get coffee and pies, so only 350 000 forints will be available for the parties.
The Minister for Local Self-Government Gordon Bajnai will again join his collaborators in auule of the Ministry of Local Self-Government and Regional Development.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) organises a Christmas lunch, which is expected to accommodate 436 employees, in its own large hall.
At the Christmas party he spends 2,500 forints on guests - the total amount includes a reception with Swedish tables and snacks.
Since being Minister János Veres, the PM Christmas workers have celebrated in a similar way every year.
However, the atmosphere of the party will be lacking, the officiality will enhance not only ministerial discourse, but also afternoon time.
The Agriculture Resort is hosting a New Year's Eve reception on January 20th, and the Ministry's Christmas is out of the question.
The reception will take place in the city of Vajdahunyadvár in the City Gardens and, according to the Ministry, there are 1,000 forints per person for hundreds of guests.
According to the Press Department, this will be a very simple reception which is only called for by the relevant foreign diplomat accreditation in Hungary.
These annual receptions begin with a brief meeting of the Minister of Health and end with a small visit.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture don't even arrange a Christmas party, the [origo] portal told the relevant press department.
The price of the Christmas celebration of the environment resort in the press department failed to communicate.
In any case, four hundred people were invited to a party at the Museum of Arts.
He's climbing to the big stand.
The Association of Trade Unions of the League, and the General Association of Labour Councils (MOSZ), respectively, shall establish their post commission on Friday to coordinate the monthly time-free post.
On Saturday, a protest public meeting will be held on Monday - on the day of the final vote on the Health Insurance Act - will be held.
The action will certainly cause a serious disruption of transport, as railway transport will almost be halted and workers of the Budapest Transport Company (BKV) will also be employed within 13 hours.
On Friday afternoon, the Association of Leagues will meet with the Full State Association of Trade Councils with details of the jointly organised Monday session.
The LIGA-MOSZ Standing Committee will also be set up to coordinate Monday's action.
On Saturday, a protest public meeting will take place, and since Monday, the committee joining the post will stop the work for an indefinite period if no agreement is reached with the government.
This means that there was no time limit for the termination of the post which will begin on the day of the parliamentary vote on the Health Insurance Act.
If Parliament does not finally adopt the Health Insurance Act, the committees will immediately withdraw the call.
However, if the legislation is withdrawn, the positioning committee shall meet and decide on another procedure.
According to the Monday session of Parliament, it is also possible that the Health Insurance Act will be voted on until late evenings, if necessary at night.
As a result of Monday's starting stop, it is possible to count with serious interruptions in transport: work on the railway will be stopped for an indefinite period, the part of the Buddhist collective transport can be stopped in the morning and more than half of the company Volán.
At the same time, there are many locations in the country to close half the road.
A number of committees and civil organisations, whose list is kept up-to-date on the League’s website, have joined the call.
Some organizations have announced a temporary suspension of work for an indefinite period, others have announced a temporary suspension.
By Thursday afternoon, the Hungarian State Road (MÁV) and the independent union of railway employees (VDSZZZZ) were unable to agree on sufficient services, while at the beginning of the Christmas holidays, more and more people travel on the railway.
According to today's reports, from the beginning of the operation up to 13 hours at BKV, from 7 to 9 hours in the morning at Budapest Airport, four-hour posts are organised by the LIGA Energy Associations, to the 2-, 2- and 8-hour stop of the work by the Committee on Pediagics and the Democratic Committee on Pediagics.
The Association of Hungarian Doctors will be held on a regular basis throughout the country, the Democratic Committee of the Workers' Union in Health and Social Affairs (EDSZ), which is part of the Cooperation Forum of the Trade Unions (SZEF), will hold a two-hour watch post.
The most important of the four requirements formulated by the League is that the government withdraws the proposal for health insurance reform and submits a new concept for public discussion.
The second requirement is that a new way of calculating the income is gradually introduced from next year.
Third, to ensure that early retirement for the relevant labour sectors is included in the system already before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is that the independent union of railway workers (VDSZZZ) belonging to the association of the League, does not accept the offer of the Ministry of Economics and Transport relating to rail freight, and expects another offer.
Political Capital: The Hungarian Guard has increased the risk of the country
The activities of the Hungarian Guard, based on the support of the movements of Jobbik Magyarországért in August of this year, according to the Risk Analysis Division of the Political Capital Institute, immediately increased the political risk of Hungary and the whole area.
The "risk warning" developed by the company says: in relation to the activities of the Hungarian Guard, it is the greatest political risk that "the sharpening of the existing ethnic tensions between the Roma and the non-Roma population of Hungary may, in a short time, also come to violent ethnic clashes".
The main reason is that the Hungarian Guard's political strategy is likely to address the challenge of such an action - the research institute provides.
As it says, all of this can be explained by one of the biggest concerns of Hungarian political representatives: "The public debate on the Roma issue has left public life representatives of radical and extremist political groups who have been able to build a political strategy against the Roma-Madrid opposition."
This problem deepens, makes normal dialogue impossible, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of violent conflicts - the judiciary.
In addition, the activities of the Hungarian Guard, according to the research institute, have had a significant impact on the attention of domestic and foreign media "has shown significantly the image of Hungary abroad, especially with regard to the faith in the stability of the country and its democratic progress".
The Institute recalls: part of the reorganisation of Hungarian radical and ultra-legal groups, which has been gaining ever greater publicity and weight since the fall of 2006, is that since 2007 several organisations have been created in Hungary, which themselves are called "national defence companies".
"The common concept of these groupings is that they themselves define themselves as a civil society while openly reporting - and armed - the readiness of their members to carry out defence tasks (in the case of life disasters, attacks by the authorities, violations of order), in addition with an indication of the inability of the police, the army, or the state," he adds.
It further notes: this is all done in a way that seeks to package the most diverse political efforts made to resist society's political and civil violence.
The emphasis on civil society and the form of society in the case of these groupings is therefore not only to avoid legal steps towards judicial registration, but also to be a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are also an increasing risk from the point of view of neighboring relations.
"In recent months, they have pointed to the Hungarian Guard immediately in several neighbouring states as a potential source of danger, ultranationalist political representatives of some neighbouring countries seeking to excuse their own anti-Madian policy by appealing to the establishment of the Hungarian Guard.
All of this may have an impact on the political stability of the area," he adds.
According to the research institute, the emergence of the Hungarian Guard in Central and Eastern Europe is not a single phenomenon, so the political risk for the area as a whole has increased.
As it says, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are similar, for example, to the activities of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose creation was announced by the Bulgarian National Union (BNU) in August 2007.
In the background of the Bulgarian Guard, there are mass Roman riots that broke out in one of the Sofian districts (Krasna Poljana).
The UN used this to set up a guard with the aim of the organization being "national home defence".
In the past 17 years, according to it, there has been "cykanic terror" in Bulgaria, but the state has remained ineffective and corrupt, recalls the Institute of Political Capital.
It adds that the initiative triggered a heated debate by the Bulgarian public.
As it goes on to say, the increase in the risk of ethnic clashes signals the announcement of some Bulgarian Roma organisations that they create their own guard for the sign of resistance.
Since the current activities of the Hungarian Guard show similarities with the activities of the Bulgarian National Guard, it is not excluded that even the Hungarian Roma respond to the threat in a similar way, by establishing their own home defences, we can be able to draw attention to the risks created by the Political Capital Institute.
Attila Juhász, research director of the Institute of Political Capital, referred to the press office: risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, risk analysis is published every year and if he finds out something that might have an impact on the change in risk, he shall inform the public opinion, such as in this case by issuing a risk notice.
Celebrations aren't all over the place.
In Hungary, the days of freedom are precisely laid down by the law and it has already become common practice that the working days are moving around the holidays, which awaits us less than once in a year.
In the European Union and in America, holidays are not uniform.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes national and state holidays and working days.
The days of working peace are mostly due to church holidays or to a significant historical event.
We also celebrate the New Year: the last day of the old and the first day of the new year is free work - for the New Year already so that people can rest after Silvestr.
We have a total of eleven free holidays during the year.
The National Festival is March 15th celebrating the 1848 and October 23rd revolution, the commemorative day of the 1956 revolution.
On August 20th, we celebrate the establishment of the state, May 1st, November 1st and November 2nd, we remember our dead relatives and friends.
Besides, we have two-day Christmas, Easter, and Christmas.
Since our national, national or religious holidays, according to the calendar, rarely seem to be a weekend, it has become a practice to move the working day in cases where we would work only one day before or after the holiday.
The price for extended weekends, however, is that we stay at work and at school last Saturdays.
When we work out the day that is immediately before or after the holiday, we have been managing the special announcement of the Minister of Labour for many years.
The law applies equally to all employees and their employees, to public employees and to persons in the public service.
However, it does not apply to companies and institutions which are in operation without interruption or having regard to their destinations even in working days.
This year's work will change only around the holidays at the end of the year: as of 24 December life in the country will be halted, because according to current experience, most people between Christmas and Silvester will "work" or use the saved leave.
The next year, our holidays fall right into the middle of the week, respectively at the end of the week, so the shifts of the working day will be less than this year.
For the first time, the calendar will be changed around the holiday of work so that the workers can stay at home for four days.
Saturday, April 26, will be a working day so that it can be on the contrary on Friday, May 2nd, a rest day.
The next move relates to the weekend of October 23rd: Saturday 18th October will work instead of Friday 24.
At the end of the year, however, the next year will be able to take place entirely in the sign of the holidays, since they will have almost no holiday anywhere since 24 December, even though Silvestr is on Wednesday.
Six scary little things you can do to upset your colleagues
The e-mails that we forget to send, the voice messages that we never get, innocent lies that we don't even notice: it's all "paste" every day at work.
The question is whether you will get used to these minor inconveniences or put on gloves and unclear situations that others may be angry with, you will deliberately avoid.
Guys.
"I'm sorry, I forgot to tell you they were looking for you from the marketing department," your colleague will tell you.
That's why you've missed your mother?
In a better case, he regrets and tries to correct it, perhaps calls the marketing department and says he forgot to deliver it (this is a less common solution).
Most often the thing is solved once apologise.
Before it comes to embarrassing excuses, it is good to think about what you can do to prepare your colleagues for unpleasant moments, and try wisely to avoid it.
Do you borrow something that's not yours?
There's nothing more unpleasant than hanging out for some writing, office needs or your phone, and they're not there.
Do you remember sitting on the sink table last night, but he's gone by morning?
Or have you discovered your pens on the table of any of your colleagues you thought were lost?
Don't take anything from your colleagues without your permission, or they'll be right angry with you for burying them in things.
Don't get rid of the envelope or glue paper office, because it may be unpleasant when you arrive early, and you will need it immediately.
The jokes about the private life of colleagues?
There's no good solution to stop the spreading valves.
Who, who, what did he do with?
Where and why?
Woe to each person for his own news about the private life of his peers!
If any of them share their deepest secrets with you, do not abuse his trust!
Lock up what you have heard, and do not choose it with your colleagues in his absence, even when others know about it.
You're not declaring your absence for no reason?
If you call the office and with a call for severe headache you report your absence because it is not good for you, or you say that you would prefer to rest today, think that your work, urgent tasks and work that have a certain deadline will have to be done for you by someone else.
Take care of your colleagues!
If you know in advance that the next day you will not go to work or that something can happen that will make you stay home, announce that your colleagues and leaders will not be confronted with your absence until the second day.
Consumption, Hygiene, Telephone
Did you dive into a job that will remove your thumbs from your colleagues?
You didn't want to be a witness to a phone conversation that would be better not to hear at all?
Do not disturb your employees with consumption, singing, loud calls (over their heads), or assging, constant kneeling, loud dissatisfaction.
All of this can be disruptive even if they are not banned from any project (writing, planning, organization).
Are you accusing others of being wrong?
If there is no time or you have forgotten to send an important letter or message, do not blame for your forgetfulness of another!
Don't get in touch with any chaos in the office and playing colleagues!
Admit it if you've been wrong and someone's paid for it, and fix the damage!
Ask how you can make things right, fix the trouble!
Do you feel like you're at home in the office?
Warms and shoes: comfortable clothes at home, but not suitable for the office!
Don't take clothes for free time, even if it allows your profession!
Don't worry, honor your colleagues and yourself by coming to the office in regular dress - and if your profession requires it, nice and elegant!
When a person wants to succeed, he ceases to be interesting
It's a normal early-earning ride.
A special melody will be heard from the radio: the sound of noises to which electronic effects are attached.
I'm adding the volume.
Music changes pace and adds bass to previous tone coloring, then the female congregation joins as a real jewel.
At station mr2 the composition of the group of Zagar with the name Wings of Love.
Our home music life did not destroy us with a high-quality electronic tail.
Suddenly, though, the accent looks quite different because you're just listening to the new Zagara album.
The discovery of Yonderboy, a few new and interesting productions from the home digital underground, the overall picture is slowly changing, and although it is again in the garage rock fashion with its shutter in the guitar, even the domestic electropop proves that it is something new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer started at Pentecost and he also played in Yonderboy's chapel, until finally - perhaps because two dudes don't go into one yard - he gave up his own way.
With his project (Zagar) and music that connects the elements of jazz, electronic dance styles and pops, he began to lose track until he was invited to compose film soundtracks (e.g.
film Ference Törekka "Szezon").
His formation, at the beginnings of smaller clubs, became known to the wider audience after the magazine wan2 organized their first album in 2002 among the 50 most important home boards and announced Zagar in Yonderboie as the only home subject for development that could also be sold in the West.
Zagar and his hats are undoubtedly "in the course", although of course no one asked them if they were satisfied with this label.
The chapel responded as it belonged to: it made a new, better album.
The currently released album entitled Cannot Walk Fly Instead can open new paths for them, although the same name is trying to create a link with the initial flights in Petikosteli.
This is a single verse from the composition of the darker old band Balázs Zságer.
The reference to essential, flying would be in place, but next to the essential inspiration of this music now appeared - in accordance with the spirit, the trend of time - more vocal guitar, the influence of rock and roll.
In these songs the singer György Ligeti, who currently works in England with The Puzzle group, was presented at the premiere of the album in the Millenáris Park.
The album also produced one real radio hit, thanks to the station mr2 Pet Anything, which has been playing for the last time from morning to evening popular music, we started to sing the various music of Wings of Love, recorded with six domestic singers ("Underground Divas").
So everything's all right (?).
The portal hvg.hu told Balázz Zságer.
hvg.hu: In relation to this new hit, the question is offered, how much is left of what you play, district music?
Balázs Zságer: Definition of border music doesn't mean much to me.
I think there are two different bands of light music; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even so-called alternative, underground music can be flat, they don't say anything, and it can happen just because of sales, which makes it commercial.
However, even good pop music can come from a genuine inner need.
This spirit also operates in the way it is received, regardless of language and state boundaries.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audience to your music?
B. Ps.: In a foreign country, especially from us to the west, its light music has a larger tradition.
There's not only teenagers and people going to the concerts for 20 years, but also older ones.
Much more is being followed by the changes in light music that are taking place around them, because they also consider it part of a contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the public in your work?
Do you care who, where and how much your music listens to?
B. Zs.: Of course, it feels good to see more people at our concerts.
But we never did music for the market.
We don't have music for a purpose, but for some reason.
The role of the audience can be seen more at concerts where mutual influence is already in place, but it is only hidden in unfavourable changes at the moment.
I've noticed, though, that if a person wants to meet the audience, he's stopped being interesting ever since.
hvg.hu: How are you going to follow the example of Yonderboy?
He's working alone, and he's built his career more west than us.
B. Zs.: We are not actually going his way, regardless of how our music sometimes tries to explain.
We are more team players who rely on the musical presence of the other and let it develop.
At first, of course, it was not possible to avoid our work being compared to the Yonderboy compositions, but several of us separated from his band and gave up another way.
hvg.hu: In the heat station mr2 Five-fi the composition of Wings of Love was first obtained.
Many heard the name Zagar for the first time in connection with this song.
In a more popular style, did you knowingly open up to wider layers?
B.Zs.: We shouldn't have written a hit to sell the board.
It's more about that song.
We thought of it as the final album we tried to unwind the previous sound orgy and more complex themes.
Hvg.hu: How did you choose those six singers?
Why is it - what was the main principle?
B.Zs.: The idea was to create such a gospel congregation.
Then came the idea to make up this assembly of soloists from the home music scene with a good voice.
So this six - member congregation - that is, Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Peterfy, Enik-Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - was formed together, which we then crossed into the Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: That's exactly what you meant by the song, or did the girls make something about it?
B.Zs.: The building had been in the instrumental version for a long time, when the material was on the board, we thought that there was something else needed for this construction.
After the accords, he tried to join a singing party.
That night, I sang to him a melody that the girls later learned.
The whole thing came out almost in the first place and very spontaneously.
I remember how it came back, but of course, there was a need for Diva.
With my voice, it wouldn't work so energetically.
hvg.hu: As on the board, the concert seemed to be girls in the background.
They don't have solos (except Judy Jay), they don't have their own role, they sing totally together and they're not louder than music, so music doesn't just accompany their songs.
They also stood in the back of the stage.
Is that intentional?
B.Zs.: The fact that they stood behind was only because of technical problems.
The fact that we didn't want to share the solo role is the opposite of the intention.
And this song is about us forgetting our ego a little bit, where is it, where it belongs, and just letting those wings, the wings of love rise.
I wanted this euphoric state that we felt when the song was born, to feel the others.
hvg.hu: with which was the most work?
B.Zs.: During the composition of music, not even with one, harder pieces appeared when mixing.
For example, Dorian Gray's Dilemma, in which I play on the concert wing, or Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where for a long time he didn't want to work the groove, then everything nice slowly found his place like in some storage room.
hvg.hu: Which album from the new board is your favorite?
B.Zs.: It's still changing with the concert, and I've already released the board.
Now it's Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
The treacherous realtor risked billions of minorities
It's a fake fraud.
This is how the French bank giant Société Générale, the owner of the foreign commercial bank, designates his professional employee Jeroma Kerviela.
She came for him for five billion euros.
But it seems that Kerviel was just a big player who wanted to make up for his colleagues, and he certainly wasn't incapacitated.
Unlike all large banking houses, he has found the crisis on the American mortgage market at a time.
"He's mentally weak," sounded out of the mouth of his superiors, who sent him to the police.
As it comes from Kerviel's statement by the French media, such as Le Monde's journal, it was the man who had profited from his sales of 1.6 billion euros at the end of last year.
Crisis Not Just in America
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he says in the statement.
In the summer, he managed to make half a billion euros in the US crisis.
That's because he felt it at the beginning of the year.
In February, reports began to show that so-called sub-prime mortgages provided to low-cost customers or those who had problems with payment in the past will have problems.
The whole economy had an impact on this crisis, but it didn't.
Kerviel didn't believe it and put it right.
At the end of the year, his profits amounted to $1.6 billion.
"By the time I made the first half billion, I didn't know how to announce it," Kerviel admits, adding that he certainly left nothing for himself.
Throughout the interrogation, he confesses he's faked records so they don't show up on him.
He even managed to fool the boss, even though he was interested in his business with the Euroex stock exchange.
Risk was loss
He was afraid he'd find out?
Not anymore.
"I thought only the simple fact that I made 1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them."
Where did he take so much risk?
He had to work on his position.
He joined the General Society in 2000 just after he graduated from the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was about $51,000.
Two years later he was an assistant broker and in 2005 he became a solo broker with an annual salary of $90,000.
Still knew he'd never make as much money as the others.
"I already knew in my first interview in 2005 that they were paying for me.
For my education and also for professional and personal development," Kerviel described to investigators.
But soon after the show, the first great success came.
Thanks to the Allianz action, he won, during the bombings on London, that's why he spent half a billion euros on this title.
And it was a firing mechanism - he wanted more.
As long as you make it, we'll let you.
"It's like snowballs," he told the police.
But the bosses probably knew all about it, or they'd think more.
"As long as I made the money, they put their eyes on it."
But then the morning came at the beginning of this year.
In one day, he lost a billion euros.
After the weekend in mid-January, he wanted to cool it down.
When he came to work on Monday, he didn't work at the bank anymore.
And the bank reported a few days later that he had five billion euros.
And how did they get to him?
He became a suspect for his leave.
"I only picked four days last year.
A broker who does not have permission is a broker who does not want anyone to look into his records," Kerviel closed.
Czech Republic has a chance to get 365 billion
Yesterday's Czech Government ministers with representatives of the European Commission signed a total of nine operational programmes from which the Czech Republic can receive EUR 14 billion in the years ahead (approximately SEK 365 billion).
It is about half of the total amount that can be obtained by the Czech Republic from Brussels in 2007 to 2013.
Approximately 125 billion crowns will come from seven operational programmes in the regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain around 100 billion crowns from the Business and Innovation programme.
The most money, up to 150 billion, will be directed towards transport.
The Transport Programme is the largest operational programme and represents up to 22 per cent of the resources the Czech Republic can receive from the funds.
This money will increase the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund to be managed by 90.8 billion crowns next year.
The Business and Innovation Programme is intended to serve entrepreneurs and companies to obtain funding for innovation businesses.
Firms should receive funding for the introduction of new technologies, for industrial research, but also for the introduction of more efficient organisational methods.
In the current drawdown of EU funds, the Czech Republic has been among the least successful in the newly adopted countries.
Twenty years of punishment for the representative of Nicaragua confirmed the court
The Court of Appeal in Nicaragua confirmed on Thursday a 20-year sentence for the former President of the country of Arnold Alemán, who was sentenced in 2003 for a financial fraud of $100 million (less than 1.8 billion crowns).
Later, however, he was released from prison and lived in a home prison on his trailer near the Nicaraguan metropolis.
If any head of this Central American state from 1997 to 2002 returns back to the network, the AP is not clear at this time.
According to the President of the Appeals Court, Ileana Pérez will now be concerned about the prison factors, whether they let Germany serve his sentence at home, or whether he travels to prison.
Four years ago, the court proved to Germany that he regularly transferred government money to a foreign company account in Panama.
These companies were fictitious, and the account actually belonged to his relatives and closest associates.
Some of this money then ended up in the fund that Germany founded on financing its election campaign in 2001.
So they approved our budget.
That's right.
The State budget was adopted.
Why is this budget exceptional?
It is the first budget made up of this government and the accepted coalition majority without support for the opposition.
This year, he was still supported by the ČSSD, because he was prepared by the Minister of Sobotka and ČSSD could not afford to accept it.
Unlike the heated debate before the government's vote on mistrust, nothing has been dramatic this time.
This traditionally reviewed photograph, although most influential, passed the law in peace.
It's a certain paradox.
Each government starts and ends with individual chapters and budget items, whether someone likes it or not.
The budget is an essential part of the policy, but it is hidden from the strong opposition of the government.
This is more mediaally grateful and is why he pays much more attention to the media.
The impact of politics is much more interesting to the public than the strict numbers.
The state budgets in the past social democratic governments have suffered three disasters, which for 2008 are unable to resolve all of a sudden:
The first is a high proportion of compulsory, i.e. parliamentary expenditures, which are not only income, but also social contributions, which were approved by the silent "coalice" ČSSD and KSCHM last year.
The second is the deficit management as a result of the first debt.
The third limit is the deficit of public finances, i.e. the deficit of city and municipality budgets.
However, the greatest risk is not the government budget deficit.
He's public and relatively under control.
However, a time bomb is a budget deficit for cities and municipalities.
In addition to the money from taxes, fees and loans from banks, many seniors have been able to obtain additional investment resources, often without having to issue bonds that have been unduly indebted to their advisers.
In recent years they have been able to pay for these debts by mass sales of energy and other divorce networks received from the state of privatisation.
They don't have this resource anymore.
If we just stick to official and verifiable facts, we'll find out that:
Our economy has been going on for several years, just like the rest of the world, a growing phase, which is constantly glorifying the ČSSD.
It was a unique opportunity for her governments to put public finances in order.
Instead, however, the state still owes them more and more.
Other countries, except for a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have enjoyed much more than our republic.
It's a huge shame that falls above all on the previous governments.
We are among the countries that are at least at least at risk of poverty, on a global scale.
That is why there is no need for massive social programmes, which have unfortunately, in recent years, been completely out of reach in enormous dimensions.
Although it has succeeded in canceling some of the thoughtless populist expenditures approved this year before the elections, so that in the near future there will not be a move towards retirement and pension reform, then in fact any policy in this country will end and anyone will rule in that way only.
With little effort it can be said that government policies will become officials, mechanically dividing the majority of the taxed money into pensions and social contributions.
Therefore, this year's budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only stop the printing of normal expenditure by mandates.
The planned deficit of 70 billion per year for 2008 would be absolutely unnecessary if the previous governments did not produce as much as they could for the last ten years.
If we do not really want the government to become only officials, then we must be patient and welcome to this too strong coalition government, which realizes that the state can only spend as much as it can on taxes and fees, peace to prepare for other reform laws.
Only those will allow for the gradual achievement of a balanced state budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The US Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the Central Bank of Britain, Switzerland and Canada decided to fight together against the crisis in financial markets.
That's how the monetary market gets more than a hundred billion dollars through auctions.
In these auction banks they prefer interest rates that are willing to borrow money.
For example, the U.S. Fed will send $40 billion to auction, and the next $40 billion will then be made available to the European and Swiss central banks.
It is the first time since the 11th September attacks that the central banks of individual states agreed on this coordinated approach to preventing or reducing the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This step should address the biggest economic difficulties, i.e. the growing lack of free capital that banks could borrow," he wrote in his report to the customers of Bernard Baumohl from the consulting company Economic Outlook Group.
"The coordinated action of central banks reduced the likelihood of recession in the United States from 65 per cent to 50 per cent," Baumohl added in his report.
The banks have already lost $60 billion for unpaid loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect another billion losses.
"Central banks must be really afraid of what else can follow when they decide on this process," said ABN Chief Economist Amro Kieran Davies.
"It seems that the situation is really bad," he added.
Central banks are afraid that if banks themselves have difficult access to loans, they would rather borrow their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send the American economy to recession with possible impacts on the economic growth of the world.
The central banks thus decided after they failed to reduce the so-called LIBOR rate, the London interbank rate used to borrow money on the interbank market.
This meant that banks were still concerned about mutual lending of money, even though the central banks of the United States, Canada and Britain decreased several times during the fall of their interest rate.
"It will have the same effect as another decline in interest rates," said Reuters agent Greg Salvaggio from Tempus Consulting.
Some analysts do not think that the central banks' move will contribute to the success of the crisis because it does not solve the basic problem, which is a fall in the property market in the USA.
Klaus: Eco-debate is incredible
Global climate change is expected to damage the developing countries most.
President Václav Klaus again spoke about global warming.
Criticism has now taken place at the UN's final international climate change conference in Bala.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Blue, not a green planet, he said that environmental debates are incredible.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of a conference that creates a strange mix of representatives of governments and non-governmental organizations, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric that carries it out and the reality.
"The debate there is completely unstructured, it is just a word-fire that is a substitute for solving current problems," Klaus said.
In presenting his book, the Czech President stressed that her theme is very important to him and is therefore committed to them.
He also expressed satisfaction with the fact that the book also appeared in the German translation because, as he said, "I often meet only with the cartoons of my opinions".
So now the interested ones can read his undeclared position.
Klaus recalled that he is not a climatologist, but he believes he has enough assumptions to write such a book.
He is therefore an academic able to monitor and assess professional relations, has experience with statistics and is also a national economic operator.
In the main conclusions of the book, he noted that the climate is constantly changing and its changes are therefore normal, that there is no consistent opinion of all scientists on the warming of the planet, that the consequences of the current changes are not too large and serious and therefore are not a threat and that efforts to influence climate development are unnecessary, ineffective and unacceptable.
Moreover, as a person with experience with totality, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproved opinions on others, feeling that freedom is dangerous.
He repeatedly explained that it is not against "reasonable protection of the environment, but against militant environmentalism, which does not take into account the relationship between costs and their use".
Klaus spoke on the same subject in Vienna two months ago at Hayek Institute.
Driver couldn't replace 600 thousand people
Six hundred thousand drivers have lost their deadline and failed to exchange an old driving licence whose validity expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when people can ask for exchange to be given a new licence by the authorities by the end of the year.
However, the Ministry is afraid that after New Year's time they would be issued on the driver's statistic road without a valid permit.
According to the authorities, the certificate was not exchanged mainly by those who don't want to drive anymore.
While the municipality is reporting a sharp decline in driver exchange interest, the authorities in the metropolis are being filled with requests and interest in the exchange of certificates this week has grown.
The Magistrate provides about 2,000 customers a day.
There's about half an hour waiting in the front.
In Prague, the driver's license has not yet been exchanged by about 140,000 drivers.
The presentation of the new certificate shall take twenty days.
However, it may be requested to issue within a shorter period of five days.
In that case, the driver will pay five hundred crowns.
Motorists who do not reach the end of the year and leave on the road without a valid driver will be threatened with torture from January.
The offender shall pay up to two thousand crowns.
But a cop can make a deal with the crime.
In the event of an administrative infringement, the fine shall be paid to 2500 kroner.
According to previous information, he could have been punished by the councillor and the man who was not going anywhere.
He was supposed to pay 30,000 crowns.
The ministry had previously called on the authorities to be mild and to store the highest thousands of pieces of paper.
According to the spokesperson of the Ministry of Transport, Karl Hanzelka, but tens of thousands of sufferings do not threaten anyone.
The driver’s license is based on the document in which people can decide whether they want it or not.
It's not a civil certificate that every person has to have.
People who don't want to drive anymore should give up the driver's license.
It shall be carried out or sent by mail to the competent general authority.
At the end of the year, the certificates issued between 1964 and 1993 will cease to be valid.
But motorists have to gradually exchange other types of driving licenses.
People with documents from 1994 to 2000 have three more years to exchange.
The certificates issued between 2001 and 2004 shall expire in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, there are about 2.6 million other documents.
The court reduced the penalties for detectives with Berdych
Former policemen Josef Opava and Petr Konyarík, who are accused of criminal collusion with David Berdych's gang, will go to 13 years in prison.
With definitive validity, the Prague Supreme Court, which thus reduced the penalties, decided on one year and on the other two years.
Initially, he threatened the detectives of the Prague Committee to fight organised crime for 14 and 12 years.
Today's decision cannot be appealed, only appeal to the Supreme Court is possible.
Berdych is also accused in this case, but he is only waiting for the first instance verdict.
In other processes, however, he has already been punished for a total of more than 16 years.
He can't get any more.
In January, in particular, the Court of First Instance acknowledged the involvement of 19 people in the theft of criminals, the Supreme Court today decided to appeal 16 of them.
Most of the defendants have refused from the beginning of the investigation to the fact that it is an established cause.
According to the Central Senate, after agreement with Berdych, police officers transmitted information from police sources to criminals, covered individual burglary and helped members of the gang to avoid criminal liability.
Gang gave up 30 percent for Opava and Konyarík.
The complaint concerns the criminal activity of the gang from 1999 to 2001.
In particular, the thefts that victims have often suffered from serious health damage, but also the abuse of the power of the public agent and the illegal weapons.
At home visits, the police discovered illegally held guns, fired with steel cores, laser detectors, or self-supply.
Gang was accused of stealing tens of millions of crowns.
In addition to the silent 20 men in this process, the courts have been declared guilty of other Berdych thieves and a number of other people.
Other men around Berdych still speak before the court in another trial, some cases have not yet been brought before the court.
The main assumption has so far been avoided by Tomáši Votov and Maroši Šulej, who live in an Irish prison where they await a final decision on their issue to appeal to the Czech Republic.
Child replacement account: 12 million
For the replacement of children in childbirth, Igor Veleba's family lawyer wants 12 million crowns, plus judicial expenses, after the Trebian hospital.
For each of the mothers by three million, for the father by two million, and for the children by a million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
The legal representative of the Ondřij Hospital was therefore not in agreement with the Veleby proposal.
"We reject such a requirement, he is very high," he said after today's meeting.
"But in order to be able to make an opinion on the counter-proposal, we need a knowledgeable judgment that the counter-party has been able to draw up.
We'll find out if he's got any value at all.
But we maintain the view that this will be in the statistics for all," he stressed.
According to him, the portion should move between 100,000 and 200,000 Kč for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, a family from Jablonov wanted a million crowns each month when she did not raise her biological daughter.
Veleb served as the basis for the negotiation of a well-known assessment prepared by the Faculty Hospital in Prague-Motole for him.
Children’s parents, according to psychologists in the field of psychology and psychiatry, suffered from mental injury and stress in different degrees and depths.
The stress situation was better endured by men, even when they were faced with complications that did not prevent the replacement of newborns.
The women are again at the same height with the current trauma and with what is happening right now, the content of Veleb has been summarized.
Veronica and Nicole exchanged nurses in the Tribal Infantry last December 9th.
Last week the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to Kermákový to Pribyslavic and Veronica to Libor Brož and Jaroslave Trojanov to Jablonov.
Heitman Vysočiny Miloš Ruščíl handed each of the families 100,000 crowns in late October in return for the expenses they incurred by the failure of the Tribal Hospital that the country is setting up.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are covered by the law on liability for damages.
In the event of a doubt, they must reach the reserve fund, they may exceptionally request the aid of the founder.
So far, the courts have granted people relatively low compensation, sums have been calculated according to the tables in statistic order, with the exception of millions of crowns.
The Relic of the Valash Kingdom
Bolek Polivka has lost the mark of the Valash Kingdom.
According to an island court judge, for the first time, he used the designation of the Welsh King, but the project built a long-term team around Tomáš Harabiš, who worked with the artist.
The meal didn't take part today.
According to his lawyer, the case probably doesn't end and the client is calling.
"The dispute is that Mr. Harabiš and his team are parasitic to Bolka Polivky's popularity," said Polivkov's lawyer after the trial.
According to him, everyone in the words of the Valash Kingdom will be equipped with actors and comics.
The same opinion is in Harabish.
"There's almost a decade of work behind us.
The pursuit of money and the idea of actions," he said.
He thinks they're the cause of a lot of money.
"After years they realized that the project was successful and could have something to do with it.
They want to parasiticize our work," he added.
Lukratative business
According to the Court of First Instance, the Welsh King used Polivka in his television series for the first time.
In 1993 she was crowned by the actor Radoslav Quickorichty.
But then it did not relate to the intention of building a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabish came with the idea of issuing walash belts.
From the original resurgence action, trade and the lucrative business activity on which Harabish then imposed the establishment of the Valash Kingdom.
In 1997 Polivka agreed with the introduction of his name and signature in passports and even offered their holders discounts when visiting his farm and theatre performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
Today, the judge also stated that Harabish only used the whole idea that Polivka published in the manager for his business purpose.
"The popularity of Boleslav The Valash Kingdom's Polytechnic project has certainly helped," the judge said.
But she added that the soul of the project was Harabish and his team who was actively dedicated to him.
The cooperation of the dissident parties continued until 2000, when Harabiš for Polivka organized official coronation in the Site.
Since then, however, disputes have begun between Polivka and Harabiš, which have led to the meeting of "King of Boleslav I. elected to the fort".
The leading role in the kingdom was then captured by the singer Jarmila Šuláková as the queen's mother.
In 2002, Polivka filed a complaint against Harabis and his company, which the court has rejected today.
Clearly, it could lead to Harabishi's intentional conspiracy against the throne and half of the princess.
A new king should come out of him.
He didn't want to disclose details and deadlines yet.
"We don't want to make it.
It should be something like a ride of kings to Slovakia.
The king should be released for a certain time.
Even Mr. Polivka can log in quietly," Harabiš added.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VT: mixed predictions
Actually, I've never fantasize about Peugeot 206.
Its driving properties were nothing too much, the quality of handling, handling and also production could be marked as sub-average.
But there's now a successor to Peugeot 207 on the market, and he's a lot better.
And the van called SW is still a bit further and I'm not left to think better.
When I tested the classic hatchback Peugeot 207, I complained, for example, about the space on my head in the back seats.
This is the end of the complaint, because the van body means they won't suffer in this direction, not two meters long.
The world's summer
I'm going through the interior very quickly so I don't get too repeated.
It's a complete design where I have the only lift to the poor middle tunnel.
Here I'd appreciate something more of a designer invention when the car looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and there are times when we could complain about short seats or swear.
The lateral leadership also significantly improved against model 206.
As far as space is concerned, there's an increase in body size.
Then in the van, the already mentioned lack of room over the head.
Bags of copper
So the main one on this car is his trunk.
I have to assess it as very well accessible (and also thanks to the back window) and as properly consistent.
The deaf places are equipped with retaining tires that are an ideal compromise.
He doesn't mind, he'll be able to stretch out, but he'll keep heavy objects.
But let's stop together over the volume.
This is according to the tables in the basic arrangement 428 l, which is more than an average against competition.
However, not against the most sold vehicle of this class in the Czech Republic - Bad Fabia Combi.
If we compare 207 SW to a new generation of young painkillers, then we will find that Peugeot stands for a lot of 52 litres.
This value shall be considered to be a critical value on leave to the outside or when loading the carriage.
But if I should raise the positive, then I still have to mention the very flat floor after the second row or very low dust.
120 horses in four rows
Our tested car was equipped with a fire extinguisher with a capacity of 1.6 l with a power of 88 kW.
And to tell the truth, this is how you should look like a 16-year-old who's driving a family hatchback.
She's quiet, she's got a little consumption, and she's mostly pulling.
If I compare it to a period of damage that lynching works as if it had a hardened teddy bear in the exhaust, I can only be excited about it.
The price will be charged
The price of the car is not human.
However, we must remember that we tested properly equipped cars with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of a car with a fireman's fourteen for 329 900 Kč will still go away.
Our aggregate is 410,900 Kč, which is quite enough.
Tested Premium equipment will then come with equipment for another 80,000 Kč.
But we still had head airbags, automatic air-conditioning, automatic driver launch, electrical back window control...
It's just the car all around 531 900 CZK.
That's a lot, but count the extra equipment at Fabie and get to a lot of similar numbers.
So there's nothing left but to decide for the mark.
The integration of Slovenian pupils into British schools is not possible
In British schools, children from Eastern Europe are born, which is causing concerns about the further development of local education among local residents.
The integration of Eastern Europeans has so far affected a number of obstacles.
British schools even register cases where disputes between immigrants and children of the indigenous population are becoming more violent.
The problem of integration of children from Eastern Europe in British schools well illustrates the case in northern Kent, where disputes between local residents and Slovenian immigrants are beginning to escalate.
The quarrels, jokes and fights between the disciples were also transferred to the relationship between parents.
The situation went so far that in Chatham police detained a Slovenian woman who had been beaten by a ten-year-old trainee by an iron doll.
He's guilty of insulting her with racist targets.
The police must have been involved even after the attack on a Slovenian immigrant two-year-old girl.
The girls of the men allegedly honored him with racist remarks and threw stones at him.
"When we went home, a boy jumped on a bus stop and started swimming on us.
When I told him to let it go, he rolled on to us apples and strawberries and then discovered his ass," described another unpleasant adventure for The Times mother of Slovenian students.
The complaints are on both sides.
One of the local residents even marked disputes with immigrants from Eastern Europe for the fight against survival.
The above cases suggest that the atmosphere in British schools between locals and immigrants is beginning to be tense.
There are 70,000 Slovaks registered in Britain who have moved here for work.
A crowd of 30,000 Slovene disciples then attends British schools.
Cuba the most beautiful island of the Caribbean
For visitors, it's really an island of freedom.
Anything you expect from your vacation can happen to you if you choose correctly.
Golden and white beaches, high waves, or sea, calm as a fisherman.
Palms and all including pancakes offering pizza, ice cream and cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean Sea, you will find it in full and even richer numbers.
Only on one island but you will find much more and that island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Great Antilles.
For the Spaniards, Cuba was the garden of their conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place human eyes ever saw.
Havana became a warehouse and a repository of treasures that the Spanish people in America had dug and moved to Europe.
And then the American era came.
The National Hotel grew at the very end of the 20th year.
He let one of the heads of the American Mafia Lucky Luciano, because everything that was a crime in the United States (particularly a ban), was welcomed and supported in Cuba by drugs, gambling, prostitution.
His guests were mine.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high - school homes grew, followed by large balloons driving a car that belonged to the cult symbols of the 50th century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a house in San Francisco de Paula, a piece of Havana, and in Cojímara he had his yacht.
On the walls of Bodeguity del Medio left their signatures to show business stars and politicians from all over America.
What about today?
On the walls of Havana Bodeguita you can leave your autograph as well.
At the bar of the expensive Hotel Nacional you are mixed with cocktails according to your wishes.
And that 50-year-old cult car is driving down Havana so far, because once imported mushrooms and fiats in that salty and wet air have long since melted.
Even though Havana, especially her oldest part, is a great waste, yet nowhere in the area is there as many beautiful colonial monuments as there.
Other places also turn into beauty, like Trinidad.
Because the travel movement brings so much money, its development is green.
In the last 15 years, new hotels have grown not only in Havana, but especially in Varadera, on the coast of the province of Holguín and on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers another libertine, which is unique in the world and is especially appreciated by its train drivers.
A third of the extensive plantations were held in sugarcane after close pairs and motor trains.
Their car park hasn't been renovated for many decades, and so there are machines that are already in the museums.
Where to go?
The most famous places most visitors to Cuba don't mine.
And so on Varadera, or on Havana, there's no need to write down too much.
I just wish to remind you that in Hemingway's already mentioned residence is a museum, and whoever likes this writer should not be allowed to miss a visit.
Vináles Valley One of the most picturesque corners of Cuba is Vináles Valley in the west of the island.
The plant grows out of the armored floor.
Mogots, gunmen, and rocks rise from the bottom of the valley, and in their dunes the native soil has been removed, which also makes the star scales covered with dense growth.
The valley is where perhaps the best quality Cuban tobacco grows.
In its final form, you can meet if you visit any of Havana’s doll production factories.
Maybe someone's gonna be interested in the fact that Major Zeman was there.
Trinidad
An ancient city that was founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
He brought glory and wealth to his business with slaves and sugar.
Wealth became the beauty and appearance of a small town.
The colonial Spanish architecture, particularly influenced by later French settlers, has not changed much in four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the mountains of Escambray, is so distant that in the 50th century there was no road that that country would connect with the rest of the country.
That isolation helped him stay away.
Nothing happened there, and that's why nothing happened, everyone was happy to have a roof over his head.
If a person has more time on Trinidad than one afternoon, then it is worth looking at interesting places in the vicinity, such as Playa Ancón Beach, or the Sugar Valley.
The evening is then to go to Casa de la Música, which lives after seven months and music in it is quiet over the morning.
Baracoa
A town in the eastern part of Cuba, some mark it as the most beautiful on the island.
Such a view of the Dozasurist affects the road itself.
Both roads leading there with Guantanama have to cross the high and member mountains and pass through a nature almost unknown to human activity.
The eastern island of Cuba has been written by UNESCO thanks to its unbreakable nature on the list of world heritage.
They make the best chocolate there, in the church they have the Columbus Cross (actually created about a hundred years after Columbus Navigation) and from the hill where there are some castles and today's El Castillo Hotel, there are several tabletops, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
About coffee, rum, taps, mountains Sierra Maestro, the Gulf of Pigs and the island of Isla de Pinos, about the Cabaret Tropican, about the shrine of Cuban patron Caridad del Cobre, about the santeria, African religions that recognize descendants of some slaves, it would be possible to describe a lot of sites.
But, as it says correctly, it's better to see once.
The allies in Afghanistan are passive, hard American
Few soldiers and lack of equipment are affected by the United States during the mission in Afghanistan.
According to the Minister of Defence Robert Gates, NATO should plan a specific plan for next year.
The mission in Afghanistan does not go unnoticed by the representatives of the countries with units in the southern part of the country in Scotland.
In addition to increasing resistance from the Taliban movement, eight participating States are also discussing further plans and coordination of allies.
While the United States, through the Minister of Defence Robert Gates, called NATO units for greater activity this week, Britain sees a priority in strengthening the Afghan government's authority and strengthening development aid.
"Development in Afghanistan is despicable, but military forces can only be one part of the solution.
This further is to enable the inhabitants to start further development of the economy and security themselves," British Defence Minister Des Browne told BBC.
Ninety percent
The activities of the Afghan rebels are reported to be the highest in the last five years.
The number of violent acts rose by 27 per cent last year, even by 60 per cent in the southern province of Helmand.
NATO countries have about 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in the South.
According to the United States, however, the allies reached the same limit in the organisation and equipment of the units.
They specifically ask for other helicopters, soldiers and experts for the training of Afghan units.
"We will have to seriously think about specific objectives for the next time and how to achieve them," Gates said.
In a similar way, NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop spoke today.
"I am not happy with what we have in Afghanistan on earth and in the air.
We have about 90 percent of the soldiers and equipment we would need, and that's not enough," Reuters De Hoop said to conclude class talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who's passive?
Among the participating countries in recent months, disputes also arise as to whether all the allies are performing the maximum in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany was criticised for its liability.
"The Germans have relatively large representations in Afghanistan.
But they are located in areas where the minimum violence and war demands on them are not as high as on us in the southern and eastern parts of the country," Gates said.
The British Sun's bullfight this week marked the German soldiers for Lenochs.
"Afghan fighters discovered: Germans play while our boys fight," wrote Sun in material, supplemented by images of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German image went into the counterattack and printed a picture of the British unit in a football match in southern Afghanistan.
State debt will rise to a billion in 2009
Every Czech country has over 84,000 crowns.
The total debt went to the end of September at 842.7 billion crowns.
The government was planning to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion crowns due to better development of the state budget.
State debt of the Czech Republic rose by the end of September to 842.7 billion crowns.
In nine months this year, it increased by 40.2 billion crowns.
Since June, however, it has been reduced by 13.4 billion crowns.
The Ministry of Finance has thus today confirmed its data on State debt from the beginning of October.
Every Czech has a debt of more than 84,000 crowns.
Last year, the state owed more than 111 billion crowns.
"For the time being, because of the lower deficit for next year, we seem to be able to overcome the billion kroner border by 2009.
Next year the debt should move between 900 billion and a billion crown," said IHNed.cz analyst Patria Finance David Marek.
Similarly, an analyst next Finance Vladimir Pikora says: "To exceed one billion we could get in the course of 2009.
When exactly will it depend on the next budget we don't know yet.
If it turns out that the situation on the political stage would change, politicians would be willing to save more, it could move to 2010.
But I do not anticipate this change," he said.
Revolving debt
State debt is the debt of the central government and is mainly the result of the accumulation of state budget deficits.
State debt shall be financed by treasury notes, state bonds, direct loans or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
The state's internal debt has so far risen by 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion crowns.
The foreign debt of the state has so far risen by 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion crowns.
The so-called state negotiable debt at the end of September reached 803.3 billion crowns and fell by 13.7 billion crowns since June.
The average government debt rate increased to 6.5 years.
"The total debt increased by 13 per cent between the first and the third quarter, which is really much about how the economy is doing.
Interestingly, growth is generated mainly in debt securities, where it is 20 percent increase.
It is wrong that debt is growing, but on the other hand it shows what it will do when the pension reform is here," Pikora said.
Better Than Expected
The strategy for financing and managing public debt for 2007 shows that the government planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion crowns due to better development of the state budget.
The share is mainly a government budget deficit, which is likely to reach 76 billion crowns this year instead of 91.3 billion crowns.
It is also the planned maximum resources for the Czech Consolidation Agency of 13.3 billion crowns, the ten-billion-dollar reserve for retirement, the financing of state bonds of 43 billion crowns and the European Investment Bank's loan of 1.8 billion crowns.
A woman is to be brought to court in the Charter today for giving the name of a bear
The British teacher, who was sentenced in Sudan for insulting Islam, was sentenced to 15 days in prison by one of the Court of Charter on Thursday night, and was acquitted, as her lawyer put it.
The British was accused of letting six to seven-year-olds give the fox bear the name Mohamed despite the fact that any depiction of the Prophet to Islam is prohibited.
She's been framed by a stab wound.
This British forty-two-year-old teacher, acting at the United High School in the Sudan Charter, was arrested at home on Sunday and accused of insulting Islam and rebellion, in accordance with Article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code, after the parents of several pupils complained to the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
In fact, our story begins in September already, when the student in question asks his six to seven-year-old pupils to choose a name for a classed bear.
"In children's mouth eight names, including Hasan, Abduláh and Mohamed," says the school director Robert Boulos.
After the class vote, 20 of the 23 children finally choose the most popular name, Mohamed.
Of course, Mohammed is the name of a Muslim prophet, but it is, above all, a very widely used Christian name in Sudan.
The children then created a book for their class with a picture of a bear accompanied by a description: "My name is Mohamed."
The bear himself had no label with that name, but in his own depiction of the prophet considered to be an insult to Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues Gillian Gibbons, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, explained that she knew her well and that she would never do anything that could be offensive to any religious faith: "I only pray that she asked the children to vote for some name," he said, "is only "innocent doubt".
Such an opinion is shared by many of the teachers who describe it as "very attentive to their disciples" and deliver that "never speaks in class about religion".
Note that the Christian name Mohamed is also the second most frequently given Christian name in the United Kingdom, which is written in fourteen different ways.
This Christian name often chosen by Muslim families represents a way of worshiping the prophet (often given to the firstborn).
What, though, are the rules regarding the use of this Christian name?
Is it possible, for example, to give it to the player?
Of course, it's a question of interpretation.
At the last round of this Wednesday's negotiations in Vienna, they did not reach agreement on the future status of the province.
In the end, it's not a success.
The Serbs and Kosovo Albanians finished their sixth round of talks on Wednesday morning in the Austrian Baden at the same time, without being able to overcome the different views of the future status of this separatist province.
"It is polite that both parties were not able to reach an agreement on status," European negotiator Wolfgang Ischinger said during a press conference in Vienna.
His American counterpart, Frank Wisner, stressed that peace in the area is "at stake" and appealed to Belgrade and Pristina to ensure that their commitments are respected and were prepared to dialogue even after the end of the negotiations.
"We don't expect violence in the near future, but we enter a stressful period," he added, "it's obvious that the situation is tense."
The negotiations are closed on 10 December.
The troika negotiators, composed of representatives of the European Union, the United States and Russia, will last visit to Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the province, where 90% of the Albanian speaking population is made up, could be shown in a clearer light by 10 December, when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian negotiator Alexander Bocan-Charchenko are expected to submit their report to the UN Security Council.
The talks in Baden, near Vienna, represent the sixth and at the same time the last round of negotiations since the UN, in July this year, entrusted Troika with the new negotiations.
Americans and Europeans are counting on the end of the talks on 10 December.
The Russians, who had already blocked the independence of Kosovo in the UN Security Council, are insisting that the negotiations continue after this very deadline.
"Russia has been and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," Bocan-Charchenko said.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
After eight years of international administration, the West considers Kosovo's independence under EU supervision to be the only viable solution.
Pristina declares that, in the event that the Security Council does not decide for its benefit, it is prepared to declare independence unilaterally.
Belgrade is continuing to extend its autonomy.
"Unfortunately, we have not reached any agreement," said the president of the Kosovo government Fatmir Sejdiu at the research hotel, where she has been holding this "meeting last chance" since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former Kosovo Albanian rebel commander and future prime minister of the province, expressed pity.
However, he added that the plan of autonomy presented by the Belgrade Council "is of the past that led to murders and deportations".
"Dominic effect"
On the other hand, Serbian President Boris Tadic believes that the compromise is still being considered and warned the Albanian majority in Kosovo of the consequences of the unilaterally declared independence of the province.
Belgrade is particularly concerned about the "dominant effect" in the area that is still unstable as a result of the wars of independence in the 1990s.
"But it doesn't mean for Serbia," he said, "that compromise is impossible."
In Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that all decisions be exclusively to the Security Council, in which its Russian association has the right to veto.
"The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word"
"For Serbia, only solutions taken from the Security Council are acceptable," Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
"This conversation lasted two years.
It must end as it began: on the ground of the Security Council."
Fatmir Sedjiu told reporters that "the last word of status will have Kosovo's parliament" and added that if a unilateral declaration of independence from Albanian-speaking residents were created, it would be "after agreement" with the West.
Bush made a deal with the Israelis and the Palestinians
At the beginning of the international peace conference in Annapolis in Maryland, welcomed by his blow, US President George Bush announced that the Israelis and the Palestinians finally agreed to a joint declaration.
He pointed out that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas agreed on the immediate commencement of negotiations with the intention of always settling a 60-year-old dispute between the two nations.
In the presence of both Bush men, he promised to do everything he could to help them conclude a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians must destroy "terrorist infrastructures" and Israel must end up with colonial activities, Bush declared and recalled the obligations that both sides have to discharge from the "travel map" to the peace that they adopted in 2003.
The Chief of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority led by Abbas aim "to conclude a peace treaty that would resolve all outstanding issues without exception, including central issues".
This declaration covers three issues that are at the heart of the dispute between Israel and the Palestinians: the future Palestinian border, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees expelled from their homes in the land of today’s state of Israel in 1948.
Abbas took note of the words of the U.S. President and stressed that the next meeting should be "total and thorough" and that it should touch on all aspects of the solution, by mentioning "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among others".
Then Olmert appeared at the forum, who expressed the view that the next negotiations should be "direct and continuous" and that it should be "founded to be closed in 2008".
Bush set the end of 2008 as a date for the implementation of its "two-state visa", Palestinian and Israeli visas that exist next to it.
Saudi Arabia declared that it had taken a commitment from Bushem in this regard even before it decided to participate in the conference.
Saudi Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, initiated a proposal adopted by all Arab countries offering Israel peace in exchange for the abandonment of all Arab territories banned in 1967, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis means "a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it fights against the roots of the conflict and its central aspects", says Prince Saúd in an interview, which provided an Arabic-speaking journal protected by Saudi capital.
According to the prosecutor's office, the police aren't responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As is always the case with such small news from the black chronicle, the official version does not agree with what is being said among people.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the French State Police Inspectorate General (Inspection General de la police nationale, IGPN), the police car traveled on Sunday shortly after 17 o'clock on Louise-Michel Street in Villiers-le-Bel.
"The vehicle was not in an intervention mode, but was on the watch and traveled at speeds of 40 to 50 km/h, but there were no side lights on," explains the police source.
A green bike of the Kawasaki brand, "unregistered, and therefore without the permission to drive in public communications" (read below), driven by two young people with no trailer, passed "very high speed".
"The motorcycle drove from the left to the police car after not giving priority to the report," said one police officer.
The blood alcohol test carried out on the vehicle crew proved negative.
The condition of the car (the damaged front, the broken front glass, the broken attackers) testifies to the speed of the attack.
The prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise (Republique de Pontoise) Marie-Thérèse de Givry responded very quickly and announced yesterday that IGPN had commissioned the investigation "of acts of unintentional killing and of non-assistance to persons in danger", which is also headed by the departmental de la súrété public du Val-d'Oise (Directive of the Regional Police Department of Val d'Oise).
On the occasion of the afternoon press conference, the prosecutor stated that the investigation conducted by the IGPN excludes, at this stage, the responsibility of police officers for the accident.
Three witnesses who were interrogated on Sunday evening confirmed, according to the office, "a version of the policemen, because the mini-tourist approached them relatively quickly on the left".
What a rush, no doubt caused by a three-clip on the ground, showed yesterday that both vehicles were locked up until the police car was able to freeze.
The vehicles have been secured and will pass through technical expertise.
There was a drink last night on the bodies of both victims.
What happened next?
Yesterday at Villiers-le-Bel, people were quickly spreading talks about the fact that policemen were supposed to leave the scene quickly without giving the two young people first aid.
IGPN, in all its care, was also to exclude "any serious offense" from this point.
"It's a more demanding aspect of the investigation that requires more investigation and which needs to be very careful," the police source said.
The book "Liberation" met with the obvious witness of those moments that followed the accident.
One of his windows then leads right where the accident happened.
"We immediately went down with the nurse, who is a nurse in the hospital, to try to resurrect them," this witness tells.
I couldn't do anything."
Then he watched the "screaming, fully frightened cop.
Two others tried to raise one of the young and the fourth spoke on the phone."
Faced with the rapidly increasing tension and the fact that the situation of young people is hopeless, police officers were driven by car colleagues who had arrived at the scene in the meantime.
According to the same witness, the rescue arrived "about twenty minutes after the cops left."
They also carried out a massage of the heart, but empty.
"Let no one claim that the police authorities didn't help young people.
These young people were given first aid.
The Hazics have arrived immediately.
Everything was done for their salvation," the prosecutor stressed.
The tensions in Pakistan are growing
On Monday, the Pakistani police suppressed the first demonstration since the announcement of an exceptional state by General Musharaf, two days earlier.
In Lahor, east of the country, about 2000 lawyers protesting the measures taken under exceptional conditions were injured by grenades with tear gas which, according to the witnesses, used orderly forces.
The last appointments were answered by a stone that injured several police officers.
At least 350 lawyers were summoned.
Similar scenarios as in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where policemen attacked and injured lawyers.
Several of them should have been called.
In Islamabad, lawyers of the Supreme Court called for a general stand and announced demonstrations, resulting in about five hundred arrests of opponents, human rights fighters and lawyers during the weekend.
The streets of access to the Supreme Court were replaced on Monday morning with a view to preventing the assembly.
Other demonstrations were to take place in Multan (centre) and Peshawar (northwest).
On Monday, lawmakers were moved to support religious parties gathered in a politically strong alliance with Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, whose president was "buying the population to send the flowers to the judges who stood up against the exceptional state and the wastes to those who made an oath before Musharaf".
"Musharaf's promise doesn't pay."
Pakistan's Supreme Court is the direct target of the extraordinary measure announced on Saturday evening.
The next few days were scheduled to express the legal re-election of President Musjaraf in an indirect presidential election that took place on 6 October.
Judge Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry was removed and replaced.
"All we witness is illegal, anti-constitutional and against the Supreme Court's judgments," said the official in The News.
Mr. Parvíze Musjaraf's promise that he will turn himself over to the army and become a "no payment" civilian president after the establishment of an exceptional state, the deputy minister of information Tariq Azem declared Monday.
It was expected that military uniforms would be given up until 15 November, when his first presidential mandate was completed.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that the ice elections could be postponed.
In other words, the Pakistani government has also lost ongoing speculation in the country, according to which the Chief of Staff was to order President Musharaf to be jailed.
More than a third of pregnancy is still an unexpected pregnancy
This budget includes unwanted pregnancy (24 %), as well as poorly planned or created in an unexpected way.
More than one pregnancy out of three (36%) is yet to be expected, a study conducted by the French National d'études démographiques (Ined)- State Institute of Demographic Studies, forty years after the so-called Neuwirth Act, which has been law-enforced in France.
This budget includes unwanted pregnancy (24 %), as well as poorly planned or created in an unexpected way.
Different methods of contraception, such as hormonal contraceptives or sterilization, still show 5% to 6% of the rate of failure, Ined estimates.
However, anti-conception legislation has only made it possible to improve "fertilisation control", says the Constitution and notes that the rate of use of hormonal anti-conception in women between 20 and 44 years of age from 5 % in 1970 has now reached 60 %.
Finally, eight births from ten today are well planned.
A couple of five have even a month of birth and, if possible, a spring that is considered the most pleasant annual period for the birth of a child.
Observational repair of space station
Over seven hours of space work needed astronaut Scott Parazynski and members of his crew from the International Space Station (ISS) to make a remarkable repair of the distributed solar panel needed for further scientific activity of the station.
It was a risky way out into space that collected records about the length of duration, distance from residential modules, the speed with which it was planned and the dimensions of "stolenity", which were invented by astronauts for repair.
The problems arose on Tuesday, while astronauts from Discovery submitted the harmony module, a large military service designed to install a European and Japanese scientific laboratory (see box).
This module is some kind of landing mole for modules-laborators.
But you have to be able to supply electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore to move the seventeenth century module producing electricity using solar panels that was already on the ISS so that the boiler in its final position.
After moving it, the crew started disbanding the 70-metre solar panels of the module.
And in it was one of the panels, which were set up as a pull-out harmonica, as a result of the attachment of the cable, damaged on the surface of a single meter.
The settlement was suspended to prevent further damage to the panel.
Astronauts who were originally supposed to carry out a control exit on Discovery and then go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system had a malfunction were forced to commit to the damaged panel.
And it was just Scott Parazynski who was chosen to fly to the end of the robotic shoulder of the ship, attached to the shoulder of the station, and made repairs.
It is one of the best "spacewalkers" (space walker) of the American Aviation and Space Agency (NASA).
High, static, very vice versa, has a very elaborate chest and long pajamas.
In his 46 years, this initial call was commissioned by a doctor to "oppose" a "damaged" solar panel.
After carefully investigating the damage, he cut off the wrong cable and fixed the damaged places like "dlaha".
He helped him with the second spacewalker, who stayed close to the balancing chamber, and also inside, the other astronauts, among them Peggy Witson, the crew commander.
The tools that he used, because the minihoc with a glued insulating device to prevent electroshocks on solar panels producing several hundred volts, were invented and "after cutting" produced astronauts on board the station.
After the operation ended, Scott Parazynski waited until the panel was completely disbanded and then enlisted his tools and returned to the inside of the station.
Yesterday afternoon the astronauts used their afternoon rest before today when seven astronauts return to the Discovery ship to return to Earth on Wednesday, as planned.
The EADS shares are weakening
The EADS shares are slightly lost in the Paris Stock Exchange after this company in the aviation and defence industry has announced that it will have to spend between EUR 1.2 billion and 1.4 billion in order to face the A400M delay.
EADS lost 4% and is now at the Paris Stock Exchange at 21,96 euros.
The financial group was obliged to reassess its expected production results for 2007 as a result of the delay due to the slow progress of the A400M aircraft engine, which is the condition of the start-up flight.
The price for the reduction of the delay in the delivery of military cargo aircraft, announced in October, was "to EUR 1.2 billion to 1.4 billion, of which more than one billion for Airbus", the parent company of the European EADS designer announced.
In view of these costs, the EADS will be required to announce a new profit and loss view before deduction of interest and tax (EBIT) on the next Thursday.
The Panel also found that the new cost estimate corresponds to a six-month delay.
Note that the production results of EADS in 2006 fell by 86%, in particular due to the costs associated with the delay of another programme, namely the large A380 aircraft.
The group initially assumed that the first delivery of A400M to the French army would be in October 2009.
Decision on the status quo
Sunday's elections will take place without a lot of expectations: Russians will mostly elect President Putin, United Russia.
Confirming this, only after the completion of a very little free pre-election campaign, its tendency to stability, to authoritarianism.
Today, three days before the elections to the Parliamentary Chamber, Russian President Vladimir Putin will inform the voters at the public law stations of the broadcasted television message, the content of which is kept secret.
It does so from the position of the leader of the United Russia, the pro-Cremal Party, which, according to all, celebrates the sober victory.
Yesterday, when he accepted the ambassadors of foreign states, the president did not let anything out of him and was satisfied with another attack on the West accused of interference - his favorite theme during the campaign.
"We know the price of true democracy and wish ourselves to be honest, as much as possible the most transparent and inconclusive choice, the choice without the slightest defect in beauty," he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, it's not so far.
They condemn the campaign marked by various pressures.
The leader of the Communists Gennadi Zjuganov says that "they have never passed such a dirty choice, not even for Jelcina".
After the repression of last weekend's demonstrations, the former world champion at Garry Kasparov's chess, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstrations, continues to ban visits, according to his lawyer.
"The Russians remained the mentality of the Soviet homo"
In the background of these parliamentary elections, two far more open questions are presented:
- "Who will become Putin's successor at the president's office?
The Official Journal of the European Union published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential elections, 2 March 2008; public candidates can be represented by 23 December.
Vladimir Putin, elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, cannot try for a third mandate in a row.
However, no follower appears.
- "What role will Putin play after March?"
Will he be the prime minister?
Or the chief parliamentary majority and all-powerful party of the United Russia, who elects the government and the president?
Whether this is the case or not, the ruling power will win the whole line in parliamentary elections, as well as in presidential elections.
It's tradition.
"The Russians have remained the mentality of the Soviet homo, not feeling the masters of their destiny," says sociologist Lev Gudkov, director of the independent centre of Levada.
The history of Nikolay Kokossov, from the state university in St. Petersburg, notices some of the far-reaching relationships: civil society has taken a five-century delay in the creation of individualism in this country.
After the liberal reforms of the '90s, Putin was committed to the state's paternist model, which was accepted by the population, rather than being terrorized by this new paternism, but some economic prosperity', Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation is said to be.
The Russians today "will voluntarily give up their personal responsibilities", which they briefly demonstrated after the collapse of the USSR.
"Why think?"
This phenomenon concerns all types of society, including the business world.
The official elite also intends to maintain the status quo: 65 governors (of the total number of 85 heads of Russian regions) run local candidates of the United Russia.
New freedoms taken from the West are often, as in the 1990s, a synonym for chaos.
Public opinion gives priority to stability.
Also, on behalf of stability, the Russians will not choose extremists.
Tamary's conclusion, 40-year-old professors: "What do you think?
Those who are in power aren't so bad, so why change them?"
Weighted Memory
After more than sixty years in a confidential regime, Nazi archives from Bad Arolsen, which account for 17.5 million victims of Hitler's regime, open up to the public.
47 million archived documents stored 27 km long in Bad Arolsen (Hesse) were available to this time only for "humanitarian" purposes, i.e. individually and specifically, at the request of the former victim or its eligible persons.
Eleven States entrusted with archives - including Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed to open them to scientists and historians in May.
In view of the fact that the ratification process for all States is at the end of this agreement, the opening yesterday was effective.
Other information
The free access of historians to Bad Arolsen will be able to examine "particularly the movement of prisoners, the population of camps and the state of health forced labour", explains Reto Meistern, director of these archives, led by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several states, including Germany, have opposed access to these nominal public documents because of the sensitive nature of certain information.
What are the supposed homosexuality or mental disability of some victims of deportation.
The registers of concentration camps or hostages assembled by the Gestape were gathered after the war for a practical purpose to find deported or forced labour for detailed civilian citizens, to give them proof of their admission to open the way for their compensation.
More than 300 permanent staff in Bad Arolsen are still doing tens of individual requests.
However, for part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is only a limited benefit.
"There is nothing new about these documents," said Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Centre for the Study of Antisemitism at the Berlin Technical University in 2006.
EU and India want to reach free trade agreements in 2008
Bilateral trade between Europe and India is currently nearly 60 billion euros a year.
The EU is India's first trading partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India expect the signing of the Free Trade Agreement in 2008, announced by European Commissioner for Trade Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart Kamal Nath.
In April last year, EU foreign ministers gave a green European Commission to begin negotiations with a view to signing free trade agreements (ALE) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian States (Asean). Bilateral trade between Europe and India is now nearly EUR 60 billion annually.
The EU is India's first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India is, according to the European Commission, the ninth EU trading partner.
"The Free Trade Agreement is vastly superior to both economies" and "India is gaining better market access for 450 million prosperous Europeans," Peter Mandelson said.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the first ten products exported to India, the European Commissioner explained. The Asian and European giant together annually exchanged "47 billion euros in goods" and "ten billion euros in services", said this week Daniele Smadja, head of the European Commission delegation in New Delhi, regretting that bilateral trade "has not yet reached its full potential". The EU and India meet at the eighth joint diplomatic summit in New Delhi on Friday, with Prime Minister Manmohan Singha and European Commission President José Manuel Durao Barroso.

The English bank raised concerns and offered 10 billion pounds in a five-week auction
On Thursday, the English bank announced that it was going to alleviate the current concerns that the conditions on the credit market were again worse and announced the offer of 10 billion pounds in a five-week auction at a basic interest rate of 5,75 %, which is not usually valid for long.
"In an attempt to ease the fears that the conditions on financial markets will be very adverse at the end of the year and give banks greater certainty in the way that they can secure their cash position for this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant part of its planned reserve during the maintenance period, which will start on 6 December in the form of a five-week open market operation", the Communication announced.
The Bank states that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will thus be placed on the financial market on 6 December at 12.15 GMT until 10 January, at a basic interest rate.
It appears that it is the first thing that BOE is pumping cash on the financial market in a five-week open market operation.
They usually last a week.
The BOE submits in its Communication that "it remains prepared to take further measures to maintain interest rates inter alia" interbank loans at the same level as its basic rate.
The average interbank interest rate was 5,829 % on average.
The three-month interest rate was set at 6,6 %, which is the highest since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the annual financial crisis, the amounts have been placed on the financial market by the English bank linked to the fees charged by the banks against the use of this offer.
According to certain speculations strengthened by the evolution of the euro book price, many prefer to decide on the amounts placed on the financial market by the European Central Bank with lower rates and more assured discretion.
UMP (Union for Un Movement Populare, Union for People's Movement) and NC (Nouveau Centre, New Centre) refuse to address the proposals of the Socialists (PS) on purchasing power
The UMP and New Centre clubs refused to discuss on Thursday the individual paragraphs of the socialist proposal for a law on purchasing power, which is equal to the rejection of the text.
On the agenda, the text of the bill was received within the framework of the so-called "socialist nest" (a meeting initiated by the individual parliamentary club) and contained a dozen measures taken by the PS Presidency on Tuesday, including an increase in the employment premium of 50 %, the restoration of rolling TIPP, traffic checks or rental regulations.
In view of the fact that the UMP and the NC voted against the discussion of the individual paragraphs (180 votes to 115), the meeting was concluded after a general debate which took place on the occasion of an exchange of views, sometimes more lively, between the majority and the opposition, several hours before Nicolas Sarkozy's television performance on purchasing power.
The Chief of Members of the PS Jean-Marc Airault announced that his club would re-present these proposals in their entirety in the form of addendums to the amending proposal for a Finance Act to be discussed next week.
There's a new festival.
As a result of many speculations that C3 Presents in Philadelphia is establishing a new festival, this promoter/producer Vineland Festival in New Jersey announced this in collaboration with the Festival of the Republic of Great Britain's Editor Melvin Benn.
"For our company, it is an honor to work with a man who, without hesitation, inspired the contemporary festival movement in America," said Charlie Jones from the C3 Billboard.com server.
C3 produces the Chicago Lollapalooza Festival and Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland in New Jersey is the summer campers' target station.
The festival should take place from 8 to 10 August on a private farm with a distance of 500 acres, about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The director of the Republic Festival, previously known as Mean Fiddler, one of the world's most famous festival organizers.
In 1989 he attended the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts 80,000 people each year.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added to his portfolio Leeds Festival, and in 2006 the Festival Republic founded the Latitude Festival in Henham Park in Suffolk.
Starting in 2002, Melvin Benn, as a co-owner, also has production, license and organisational tasks at the Glastonbury Festival, which currently has up to 177 500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3 calls Glasstonbury "the most inspiring event", which he has ever experienced and says his company and Melvin Benna are working together to give the region a European-style festival event.
"At first we chose Philadelphia as a market and together with Fairmount Parks Commission we worked hard to set up a festival in central Philadelphia," says Charlie Jones.
"I spoke with the city and the Commission was motivated and excited about the project.
Unfortunately, however, because of the city's current leadership, we've become involved in politics, says Charlie Jones.
"We were fortunately given the opportunity to discuss with Melvin Ben and we are going to set up a great festival in an exceptional place that will eventually serve the people of Philadelphia."
C3 Presents in 2005 founded the Lollapalooza Festival in the Chicago Grant Park, after having appeared on the festival stage in 2002 by organizing the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
The hard market for both events for 2007 was $9.8M and $11.3M.
Both of these festivals are held in the city environment.
"The European model of the Melvin Benna festival is playing in the countryside, while our festivals are running more on green spaces in the cities," says Charlie Jones.
Our goal is to define in a certain way both concepts in such a way that we create both the concept of a rural festival after Europe and the city after America."
Vineland is located about half the way between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"Obec Vineland, including the mayors, is excited to support the implementation of this event," says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to disclose the terms of the agreement, however, says that "they are useful enough to allow them to invest in such an event and welcome the festival that will have, hopefully, a long duration".
Charlie Jones says the capacity of this festival is "very high", similar to the capacity of Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee, which will include 80,000 people.
He says the groups have already received invitations, but nothing can yet be confirmed when the program is just being printed.
"Wineland will have rock inspired, music will be there, but there will be a festival to attract as far as possible a wide range of spectators," says Carlie Jones.
The partners of C3, who received the price Top Independent Promoter in the last year of Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal faces Terminator
It's not easy to attract Hollywood film studios to Montreal when the Terminator...
This convincing mission is one of the tasks of the delegate.
His mandate, however, is "politically demanding" because the governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger condemns "runaway productions".
Is it hard to get the Governor into the traps?
"It's important to be careful, it's the industry that decides where it goes.
If he finds the conditions in Montreal are favourable, he'll go there.
Our role is to offer such ones as they will consider best," he said.
Honba for festivals
At this point, however, Denise Turcottte's promotion of local film is a priority.
The hunt for Oscars has already begun.
At all the festivals of the West Coast, whether it be the festivals in Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it will be about presenting Quebec films, highlighting them and ensuring that the directors provide interviews.
The age of darkness had good publicity a few weeks ago at the 30th anniversary of the Mill Valley Film Festival.
He will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on offer in Santa Monica and will be presented on November 30th at the Starz Denver Film Festival.
This month, Quebec also presented four short films and four entire evenings at the American Film Institute Fest.
Is it coming at the end of the year at the marathon stock market? Experts divided the 'subprime' crisis
Less than five weeks remain until the end of the administrative year, and the investors are already waiting for me to come to the traditional marathon at the end of the year.
This year, however, experts aren't so sure he's coming.
Banka Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, the month of December on the stock exchange is a positive one".
However, it is not appropriate to create predictions solely on the basis of statistics, especially because, at least in the short term, certain doubts exist in the current market context."
These experts do not assume that the stock exchange has changed over the last few weeks and states that "the stock market is maintained by the existence of liquidity that is willing to invest in the absence of collateral alternatives, especially a firm income-affected return on quality securities as well as in short-term cuts".
Therefore, it is believed that the stock exchange will have a more peaceful course, not without volatility, "especially because it is not aware of the impact of the likely fall in FED (Federal Reserve System), given the high level of oil prices and the risk of inflationary pressures".
Javier Barrio, head of BPI bank sales in Spain, agrees that this is not the right time for a bold statement that comes to the marathon.
"There are not too many reasons for joy," this expert assures.
Ibex lost almost 4% of the maximum values recorded on 8 November when the index closed at 15 945.7 points.
However, all experts do not have such a negative view.
Juan Solana, an analyst for Intermoney, is of the opinion that Ibex 35 could end up a year with something close to 16,000 points due to the recosting of portfolios and traditional contributions to pension insurance, which occurs every year at this time.
However, this expert suggests that everything will be slightly different this year because it is believed that the marathon will come early, in the second week of December after the extended weekend on the occasion of the Constitution Day.
This analyst does not consider that the volatility would affect the direction of the market.
Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banco, also estimates that we are approaching a technical level and "that is why we could observe the reflection of the index generated by US reports of the consequences of the credit market crisis".
The analyst believes that these results will be positive.
Analysts agree on the selection of titles that they make sure to produce Ibex to new maximum cats.
Solana from Intermoney confirms that "this year is a row on strong titles".
This expert would include both large banks and some construction companies in the portfolio, "because when this period comes, the energy sector will be very expensive".
Federico Olucha from Inversis Banco, on the other hand, ensures that growth will go hand in hand with banking and the industrial sector.
Construction companies will also be able to build on this marathon if it comes to it.
"ACS has been in position again for several months and we hope that other construction companies, such as Ferrovial and FCC, will go the same way," explains the expert.
cyclical consumption will be in advance in the last part of the year due to an increase in sales during the Christmas season.
This expert, on the other hand, believes that technology will also behave very well, even though they are not represented on this field in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December was only in two cases a month of failure.
A real marathon at the end of the year took place in 2003, in the administrative year when stock markets ended the crisis caused by the collapse of the technology bubble.
This year, when Ibex 35 regained 28.17%, December saw an increase of 6.68%.
We will still see whether 2007 will be in the fifth profit year (so far Ibex has risen by 8.36% since January) and whether it will succeed in having its marathon at the end of the year.
Two hundred Bank Popular will have opened 12 hours from Friday to Saturday
The Popular Bank has decided to modernise most of its branches.
A total of two hundred, located in the most commercial parts of Spain.
These branches operated under the Popular Max brand are a big change for the bank.
Also for other Spanish entities, because it is the first group that decided to make such a jump and to place on the uninterrupted opening time of its branches up to 20.30 hours and to open on Saturday from 10 to 20.30 hours.
BBVA, another group that has also several times ensured that it wants to extend the opening time of its branches, has not yet decided to take this step.
In the meantime, it intends to conclude an agreement with the opening committee of 75 % of its members on Saturday in exchange for the extension of the opening period by one afternoon, even if not for the public.
The results of this experience of the Bank of Popular will determine whether or not other entities support the opening-up period of trade will be connected to this initiative.
That's exactly the purpose of the project that the Popular Bank took out.
Get individual customers who spend their time in these places after their purchases, small and medium-sized companies, livers and shops from selected streets, where they can open their handcuffs.
The Bank wants to open 200 of these branches throughout Spain for about 18 months, because it is not about opening new branches, but only about the modification of existing ones.
For this reason, the bank modernises the branches already in its business areas by adapting them to the customer profile in individual streets.
This complements the extension of the opening time with another motion of the side and a new, more up-to-date design in brighter colors.
The bank’s business manager, Ángel Rivera, ensures that this restructuring will not mean a large investment, but a larger set of staff, since it is going from six employees to eight to nine.
The sides will even be equipped for meetings of small and medium-sized enterprises and will also sell non-financial products.
Positive experience for the group.
The Popular Bank has already tested this initiative in three Madrid branches.
And it was a positive experience, as Angel River explains.
The sidewalks were chosen in the Madrid streets of Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía, and according to Rivera it seems that it was a happy choice.
Banka Popular currently has 2,500 branches.
And another 60 immigrants specializing in Mundocredit also have a very long opening time and open even on Sundays and holidays.
PopularMax will not follow the BBVA model when a number of its brands offer a large range of non-financial products for sale.
"We don't want to compete with our clients," says Rivera.
They just agreed with Telefónico on the sale of mobile phones through external personnel.
Telecinco first on the stock exchange doubled the value of his rival Antena 3
We did it.
Yesterday, Paolo Vasile, Executive President Telecinco, expressed his satisfaction at the conclusion of the trade when he found that the television he was driving doubled the value of his rival Antenna 3.
Only one thing he said was his joy: 'What I'm sorry about is that it didn't happen that way because we'd grow up more, but because we've fallen less', he said.
And yet he stressed that because of the weak market, 'we have fallen less'.
Telecinco ended yesterday's trade by 2,54 %.
This profit increased their loss by 15,66 % over the past half of the year.
The stock exchange value of this company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% capital) for Vocent's participation (other 13%) is estimated to be EUR 4 488.88 million, according to Bloomberg.
Her competitor Antena 3, who dropped by 1.52% yesterday and dropped by 40.5% from January, has a half-value of 2 193.46 million.
The value of other telecommunications companies that have been assessed is 3,571 billion in Sogecable, 2,518.53 million Prisa (publisher Cinco Días) and 1.779 billion Vocento.
According to Vasile, compared to Antenna 3 offers, because 'we're talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do this on the same market, at what cost and how we assess it in monitoring.'
Telecinco announced last week that this year he is counting on over a billion gross advertising revenues to become the first television channel, as Giuseppe Tringali, Executive President Telecinco and Publiespaña, who provides advertising for the group.
If the above data were indeed to be achieved, this television channel would this year account for an increase of 3,6 % compared to 965,4 million in 2006.
At the same time, in the first nine months of the year, the net turnover of Antenna 3 increased by 1,6 % (and reached 734,4 million), while the net revenues of this television increased by 0,7 % (630,4 million).
One of the factors to which analysts focus on is the increase in payout for the best relative development of Telecinco on the stock exchange, which has so far been maintained: in 2006 this company, chaired by Alejandro Echevarría, divided among its shareholders 100% of its profits.
Vasile ensures that, even if it is to be decided soon, this coefficient could change after the purchase of 33 % of Endemol together with its parent company Mediaset.
'We have an official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always announced a lot more.
This year I hope that we will be able to satisfy our shareholders, which we have already raised the value of 33% of Endemol'.
According to market analysts, there is a certain degree of excitement at these times.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its estimate of Telecinco’s profits by 4% in 2008 and 7% in 2009.
This is due to the fact that the projected growth of revenue from 0,5 % to 8,4 % in 2008 and from 5,5 % to 5,1 % in 2009.
The same company reduced Antenna’s expected profit by 4,5 % in 2008 and 7,5 % in 2009.
3 opinions
1.
Ibersecurities: it recommends that both titles be purchased mainly on the basis of an increased dividend and long-term sustainable potential.
2.
Caja Madrid: a better value Telecinco (collect) than Antenna 3 (keep) because of its 'read preference' and growth of trade.
3.
JPMorgan: in both cases, it recommends not to recognise them because they face 'like threats' (intermediate market and degraded economic environment).
Congress approved the transposition of MiFID as from 1 November
In parallel with the parliamentary proceedings that have been concluded today by the vote of the Congress on the new members of the Senate in the draft law, the government has undermined the public hearing of a regulation that develops a new law, with a view to both entering into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the individual parties agreed to step up the efforts of the Members and Senators to negotiate and agree on the best standard to ensure the protection of investors and the detailed regulation of the activities of the entities necessary for the efficient functioning of the markets.
The MiFID Directive, which governs the Securities Trading Act, provides for the modernisation of financial markets and at the same time strengthens investor protection, enhances the supervisory powers of the State Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promotes cooperation between the individual supervisory authorities of the European Union.
This new regulation will allow financial advice services to be provided to both specialised firms, natural or legal persons and will create a new type of financial services provider (ESIS), financial consulting companies (AFI) that connect to a company with securities, brokerage offices with securities and a portfolio management company.
In addition, the number of financial instruments operating systems is widened so that multilateral trading systems and internalisation systems are joined to regulated secondary markets that will compete with current stockbrokers.
The Act further obliges investment services undertakings to disseminate on the market information on the key aspects of their business profile, exposure to risks and ways of dealing with risks, and requires an indication of all operations carried out to simplify supervision by CNMV.
During the negotiations with the Congress Trade Commission, several adjustments were made to ensure that the securitised claims were considered a "complicated" financial instrument in view of the high risk to the investor, which was demonstrated by what occurred in the US with high risk mortgage debts (subprime).
In addition, the transposition of the Directive was used to legalise the functions which can be held by bakers in the field of economics and management for 30 years after the Royal Decree was passed in 1977, which covers the professional functions reserved for economics.
At the same time, the Senate has organised the creation of new professions in the financial sector, such as an external broker, will not require permission from CNMV and will be able to provide product trading and customer acquisition services for different investment firms at the same time.
The harmonised ISC increased by five decades in November to 4,1 %
This indicator, which later serves Eurostat to calculate the European Union's inflation index, provides preliminary information on how prices developed in Spain during November.
Its publication corresponds to the policies of Eurostat and the Central European Bank (ECB) to provide data in time and quality comparable to those achieved in the United States.
This preliminary indicator shall be calculated by using the same process as is used for the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, but by using different statistical modelling methods for the estimation of information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The Spanish INE (State Institute for Statistics) pointed out that the information provided by this preliminary indicator is only indicative and therefore does not necessarily correspond to the final data that comes to light on 14 December of this year.
"ISC will continue to maintain at a relatively high level"
The second Vice-President of the Government and Minister of Economic Affairs Pedro Solbes said that the November increase in ISC to 4.1% was "a temporary number", however he predicted that the price index would continue to be relatively high in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes, in Congress circles, stated that "even if it is not a positive number", the inflation differential between Spain and the monetary union is still "more or less" in the last two years.
He also explained that November "was less surprising" than the previous month when the government didn't count with such a high increase.
"We expected about 4%," said the Minister of Economy to present the data.
Virgin is going to make a plan with Northern Rock 42 billion euros over three years
Since Northern Rock got into the crisis in mid-September and had to withdraw to an emergency loan from the Bank of England, its deposits have dropped by more than 50% to 12 billion pounds (16.8 billion euros).
At that time, the Bank repaired record deposits worth more than 25 billion pounds, which gradually decreased customers over two and a half months, even though the government offered a percentage guarantee for this money and extended it until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, who replaces the entity's commercial financial brand with Virgin Money, needs to get around a quarter of the revenues invested in British banks over the next three years, so that they get the remaining 18 billion pounds and thus achieve a target of 30 billion.
Richard Branson's magnet group, known in the United Kingdom as its imaginary advertising campaigns, is planning to lose 50 million pounds (approximately 70 million euros) annually for advertising and marketing to achieve its presidency.
The Northern Rock Bank this week marked the offer of the Virgin Consortium, which consists of three other companies, such as those that give the advantage of saving them from bankruptcy.
Mayor Totany arrested for alleged corruption practices in construction
Today, the civil guard detained the current mayor of the city of Totan (the People's Party) in the early hours of the morning because of his alleged involvement in the corruption practices of the building that were discovered this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the counsellor and the chief of the local police were arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced Juan Morales, the current human MP, in May of this year and until that time the mayor of the village, who could have been the 'head' of the company.
Politicians continue to monitor the construction of councils and construction commissions and do not exclude further arrests in the next few hours.
In addition, a lawyer named Juan Morales, the chief suspect of corruption in construction, was accused of having been discovered at the beginning of this week.
As Cadena SER informed yesterday, a 'human-time' MP Juan Morales, who was checked, was arrested on departure from Morales' residence with important documents related to corruption.
According to the investigation sources, it is also the subject of an investigation into Morales' alleged selection of commissions for his signature of an agreement on construction with a Galician construction company which has been requalified 200 hectares of land.
Eight people are currently detained.
Bono accepted the offer to stand in front of the Toledo candidates PSOE and, if they win, to president Congress
Former Minister of Defence José Bono accepted the offer of the president of the government and the Secretary-General of Socialists José Luis Rodríguez Zapater to stand in the next general election in front of the PSOE (Spanish Socialist Workers' Party) in Toledo and in case the Socialists win the general election, he became President of Congress.
At the press conference, the PSOE secretary announced this to José Blanco himself, following a meeting with Zapater, which took place this afternoon at the federal headquarters of the party.
The chief executive of the offer to the former minister argued that in political life "it is important to count with the best" and Bono "is among the best".
He further noted that "yes, it seems", that this policy from La Manchy will be the candidate of the Socialist Party to the President of Congress if the Socialists win in the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as President of Congress, who published his decision on 15 November to ignore the forthcoming general elections and leave his active political career in order to engage in combating climate change in university education.
The former minister admitted that the president of the government constantly insisted on him to return to the ultimate policy he had abandoned two years ago.
He further stated that, as well as the public, who would be Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs if PSOE won the election, his party wanted to declare who would be president of Congress by "transparent form".
If Bono gets this function, he hopes that the House will turn into a "house of respect and not a supply or a scream" and that "will become more and more like citizens".
"Sometimes unfortunately it seems that the only place in Madrid where one can't speak peacefully and peacefully is Congress, the President of the Senate on one occasion interrupted 26 times."
Similarly, he spoke commendable words at the address of current President Manuel Marín and his "good work" and he did not wish to imagine himself in his place so as not to diminish himself to what his opponents might think of as "magnificence".
Climate propaganda
In view of the fact that the movement against climate change is undermining the unmerciful persecution of both those who are skeptical of its predictions and those who prefer other political and social struggles must demonstrate a strong cohesion.
Moreover, having the leader of the movement, who is the president of the government like Zapatero, believes that this fight is more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even intends to sign "a new treaty with the planet".
This proposal must explain why the activity or inaction of its government has significantly contributed to Spain’s failure to comply with the Kyoto Protocol in the European Union.
Who is responsible for this failure, in which sectors this is happening, and why his government, the government of the treaty, did not prevent it.
It also forces him to explain to the Spaniards what measures he intends to take to mitigate climate change.
Which companies will be damaged by this, which habits of the population will have to be changed, which energy savings, individual and collective, will have to be accepted and which will have economic consequences.
In other words, who sacrifices and who pays for saving the planet.
But we didn't welcome such explanations, nor do we.
Just because you have to sacrifice and pay.
Measures against climate change, real measures, are not popular.
Dear, uncomfortable and dangerous business and private accounts.
Even one cent of the price of gasoline, proposed by PSOE (Spain's Socialist Workers' Party), seemed to Zapater so risky from the point of view of the elections that he quickly rejected it.
In other words, it is to save the planet in such a way that it is nothing, pure propaganda, passwords that lose any real meaning.
Effective phrases, commissions, committees, protocols and new posts.
And by covenant with the planet: this lord is so good for an election campaign that he doesn't speak, he doesn't accuse, he doesn't demand, he doesn't demand, but he is admiring and inspiring him.
If it's limited to being just a virtual Contracting Party and doesn't want us to ride on wheels and cool with the wind.
Mayor and local police chief Totana detained for suspected corruption practices in construction
As investigators reported, the Civil Guard arrested the mayor of the city of Totana, "people" of José Martínez Andreo, chief of the local police, counsellor and one businessman in custody, for suspecting committing crimes during construction.
The mayor was arrested in his residence and transferred to a councillor, where he is now located together with a number of policemen who have also arrived at the construction Commission and the City Enterprise for the management of industrial land and housing.
These three arrests came to the sixth, which occurred last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, during an operation linked to the reclassification of more than 2 million hectares of agricultural land suitable for the building so that the Galician company Nuaria could build 4,000 houses after payment of illegal commissions during the last election period.
In addition, two other persons have not been arrested, but are accused of a short trial by the court of the first instance of the city of Totan.
Six of the first prisoners were brought before the court today.
According to the information sources, the former mayor of Totana and today a member of the Autonomous Parliament for the People's Party (PP), Juan Morales, are being investigated.
In addition, his former wife, the owner of the real estate office, was accused of being registered today in Totana and his current girlfriend who lives in Murcia, the capital of the autonomous area.
Manuel N. A., director and owner of the group Nuaria, lawyer and businessman from Viga, was arrested in Nigran (Pontevedra province), as well as Pablo José M. G., director of the company Suelo de Imonaur, which belongs to that group and has been transferred.
The investigation shall be carried out by a group for criminal offences in the construction of the Operational Central Unit of the Civil Guard, whose members have also carried out eleven visits, mostly in companies related to the arrested, with a residence in Madrid, Vigu, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rosas (Medora province) and Totana.
At that time, only one person was arrested in Totana, a very well-known owner of poultry meat products that could serve as a broker.
The Nuaria group was entrusted with the construction of the largest residential complex in the city of Totana, representing the construction of more than 5,000 houses, golf courses and two hotels with "sleep".
The company received 2.2 million square metres of land in Totana, which was reclassified and its project was to double the settlement of a village with 25 000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria group consists of companies such as Autesa and Inomonar, which are committed to supporting the real estate market, Conycase, which runs parking in Coruňa streets, Venezuela and Fernando el Católica in Vigo, Hogartel, which is dedicated to direct marketing and Preconiza, which focuses on the promotion, sale and assembly of building elements.
That's what happens.

Our Finnish correspondent sends us this comment from yesterday's release of the most important Finnish news of Helsingin Sanomat (by the way at the beginning of the PISA report on the level of education in the world), which refers to what the newspaper published on 18 November, on the same day that the circumstances occurred there and the criticism of Blackburn's book:
"The content of the subject of philosophy went into public discussions in connection with the tragedy at school in Jokela.
The murder of the victim, the high school student, quoted in his messages by Plato and Nietzsche.
Pekka Elo, a school counselor responsible for the subject of philosophy, demanded on the pages of the journal Helsingin Sanomat that the professors take a critical view of Plato and argue that it is not necessary to speak of Nietzsche in the full basic course of philosophy in secondary schools."

One colleague shall inform of the introduction of a criminal offence of downloading from the Internet into the criminal code:
A. Downloading one song would be a criminal act with a rate from six months to one year.
On the other hand, when you cut the price of a disc in the store below 400 euros, it is considered to be only a breach (§ 623.1).
B. If you cut to 1000 euros in the store, theft is already a criminal offence, but the penalty rate is lower than download (§ 234 of the criminal law).
C. If you steal a car and return it after 40 hours, the penalty rate is still lower than the download rate (§ 244.1)
D. It's less important to take part in fights than changing compacts.
Participating in the outbreak has a rate from three months to one year (§ 154 criminal code) and for the exchange of compacts, the rate from six months to two years would be
(Section 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment in employment is considered to be less serious under § 184.2 of the penal code than downloading the film on DVD.
F. Unauthorised distribution of copyright-protected films is a vice-sanction rather than the provision of pornography to young people (§ 186).
So if my colleague isn't wrong, she caught someone's hand, and that's right.

My curative doctor tells me one of his articles about strange research called "Money causes brain activation, especially if others get less."
Feelings that cause monthly pay for employees depend on how many colleagues they make.
The research was carried out at the University of Bonn using magnetic resonance on a tomography and the results are published in the latest issue of Science magazine.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and leader of the group Viewing the neurologic of Life&Brain in Germany: "The biggest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his colleague was wrong."
Research workers observed that if both were successful, they received the same salary, the activation was mild, but if one was given a double, the activation was higher.
I really don't know if this conclusion required so much science.
The complainants of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte, for eight years, has been relentlessly persecuted by the State Prosecutor's Office of the Hague Court of Justice, a Balkan war criminal.
Her mandate will expire at the end of the year, and Carla will leave with mixed feelings because the main perpetrators of the massacre in Srebrenica, where 8,000 Bosnian Muslims were killed, former General Ratko Mladic and former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, are still at large.
Their names are on the list, from which he took the title of the documentary film by Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach "Karlin List" (2006, uninhabited in Spain), which follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York in the pursuit of fugitive criminals and pressure on the states concerned to pull the network.
What kind of insurance is appropriate for me?
Insurance of a car which protects the driver in the event of an accident. represents a significant cost that depends on various factors such as age, status, sex, length of driving licence, type of vehicle to be insured or its use, etc.
Having a car is just the beginning.
Choosing appropriate vehicle insurance is even more difficult than choosing a car model.
First of all, we need to clarify what we're talking about.
Vehicle insurance is an agreement between the insurance and the insurer.
This commitment takes the form of an insurance contract, which provides that the insurance undertaking will receive an agreed amount of insurance at a certain amount for taking into account the payment of damages in the event of an insurance event.
Insurance is the price of insurance which is determined with regard to the various factors such as age, status, sex, length of driving licence, type of vehicle which is insured or its use, etc.
Insurance companies set their prices on the basis of statistics, so the higher the probability that an accident occurs, the higher the insurance rate.
For this reason, both persons aged 25 and women have to pay lower insurance because statistics show that they have a lower risk index due to their care.
Similarly, on the basis of controls, insurance companies concluded that marriage mates have fewer accidents than free drivers.
The way the vehicle is used will have an impact on the frequency of the rides and therefore the likelihood of an accident.
The increase in the frequency of the rides increases the likelihood.
There are many variables that the insurance companies consider when determining the price of the insurance.
Therefore, the driver must carefully study the situation in order to choose the type of insurance that best fits his insurance profile.
We will show ourselves here the most important variables for the choice of the type of insurance that will be at a reasonable price.
People under the age of 50 are faced with various disadvantages, such as little experience in driving and short driving when they want to sit at an affordable price.
Although the ideal for good coverage is insurance against all risks, there are also cheaper options.
The more careful drivers can choose insurance against all risks by lowering the insurance so as to obtain insurance coverage of all risks but at a more affordable price.
This type of contract would assume the participation of a client in the event of an insurance event.
"Part of the insurance benefit provided by the client will be determined in advance when determining the price of the insurance, which will be higher than the share would be lower," explains Luis Noguera, chief head of First Europe in Spain, Internet insurance intermediary.
Another option is to extend insurance to other operators so that the customer will ensure against damage caused to other persons, but not against damage to his own car.
In addition, he would be insured against theft, fire and loss of vehicles.
It's a recommendation.
If you are under the age of twenty-five, try to be careful and avoid accidents, as it is only possible, because it will affect your bonus and allow you to reduce insurance in the future.
The bonus is a reduction in the basic rate that the insurance company has.
On the contrary, the small is an increase in the said basic rate.
"Bonus and kid will depend on insurance and its profits.
If she's got a good year's insurance, she'll be able to afford to raise the bonus," Noguera explains.
After crossing the limit of twenty-five years, drivers have easier when they are going to sit down insurance because their client's risk index is decreasing because of experience gained.
For this reason, it is recommended that insurance against all risks be reduced.
"Young people usually cannot take advantage of the experience gained in advance at the time of the accident, and not in the case of the case," the European company director in Spain assures and adds that most accidents occur in the second year of the case when the "fear of new ones" has already been overcome.
However, if the client is married but has not yet had children, it is better to take insurance against all risks if his economic situation permits.
Families with children are considered to be a client with the lowest risk index and therefore their proportions will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be insurance against all risks by lowering the insured (which could amount to EUR 300) or by a high bonus, extended to other operators, starting with the third year after the purchase of the vehicle.
"Their management is calmer and their purchasing power is higher, so they can afford to get the highest discount," says Luis Noguera.
Pensioners are recommended to cover all risks by lowering the insurance (which amounts to EUR 150) or insurance extended to other operating participants if a high bonus has been achieved.
It is important to say that car insurance is something important not only because it protects drivers in the event of an accident, but also because it represents a significant expense, which is a good reason for the proper education of insurance options that would most suit us in view of our personal situation.
Celtic is trying to get to AC Milan point, which means osmiffinal
AC Milan and Celtic will measure its forces this Tuesday at the San Siro Stadium in an effort to get a point they lack to achieve their respective goals in the final "Champions" league, because for Italy it would be the first and in Scotland it would decide to place.
The Italians have ten points and have already secured the procedure in the fifth remise match in Portugal, while Celtic has nine points, but needs another one to make sure he doesn't get Shachtór with six points that he will play with Benfik who has four.
These two Group D matches will be played a week before the end of the sixth round, because AC Milan must play in the Intercontinental Cup in Japan, where the first stage of the thirteenth in the semifinal, in an attempt to get to the final of the sixteenth.
So this group will be closed before the other and indecisive result at the Giuseppe Meazzy stadium seems to be the most likely, even though both teams will try to win because the Italians won't want to bet on the home ground and Celtic knows that after the win it would be the first and provide a better place in the osmiffinal.
Gordon's crew would be able to get even lost if Shachtór didn't win, but he couldn't rely on it because at the same number of nine points, the Ukrainians who lost in Glasgow last week (2:1), but won in the first direct match (2:0).
And so the AC Milan players will try to destroy the night of the Scotts who believe they will get to the semifinals in the reorganized Champions League just as they beat them in the same match in the last match of the Nooks in the length (1:0) after the level 0:0 in the basic playing time.
Hope that they win the "Rossoni" will be the Shachtór for which the prize of victory is only if Celtic loses, both for the course of the eight-final and for the maintenance of UEFA.
Benfica, although she is the last and has no chance to continue in the highest European competition, could achieve a third place by one victory, so she would play in UEFA.
The first concert during the Spice Girls tour took place in Vancouver 20 000 people
The Spice Girls group started in Vancouver, Canada, in front of 20,000 spectators their first tour since it broke up in 2000.
"Posh Spice" (Victoria Beckham), "Scary Spice" (Melanie Brown), "Baby Spice" (Emma Bunton), "Sporty Spice" (Melanie Chisholm) and "Ginger Spice" (Geri Halliwell) shortly before they started their concert at the GM Place Stadium in Vancouver declared that the re-uniting of their group was "great".
About 20,000 people bought tickets so that they could be present at a concert, which also included videos that resemble the story of this group that sparked sensation at the end of the 1990s.
Returns and World Tours are played at the same time as new albums that are released in Spain by the EMI, which bring the choice of their main successful compositions, as well as two new songs, "Headlines" and "Woodoo".
Five Spice Girls appeared on the scene decorated bracelets given by their husband "Posh Spice", British footballer David Beckham.
This sportsman was in the audience who drowned GM Place, although nervous Victoria banned him a few days ago.
Before the beginning of the show Victoria Beckham said about the British star that "he didn't see our costumes at all, so I'm nervous about what he's thinking about the show".
"Sporty Spice", whose departure from the group in 1998 "on account of differences between us" caused two years later the resolution of the five-member group, also revealed its nervousness in meeting with journalists two hours before the beginning of the presentation.
"I was afraid.
I was nervous, but I saw that the world's public opinion changed, the opinion on Spice Girls changed.
And I thought, why not, so I'm glad that I decided," Chisholm said about the reuniting of a group she had dissolved herself nine years ago.
The singer also noted that in time, "the things have been settled and we all love each other very much".
However, many things have changed since Spice Girls last appeared together in 1998.
So at the beginning, according to CTV, the group flew to Vancouver by Virgin Airlines.
At the airport, an army of children was expecting them.
Five has a total of 7 children.
After a concert in Vancouver, the group will take part in California (USA), San José (December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5-7th).
He will be in Madrid on 23 December.
Concerns about the new gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine
Russia and Ukraine are currently in dispute about the prices of natural gas, thus increasing the risk that Russian shipments of this fuel may be affected in Western Europe.
Most Russian fuel exported to the European Union (EU) is run through a pipeline across Ukraine and any dispute between these two countries is closely monitored.
Kyev warned that if Moscow raises the prices of gas, Russia will charge higher transit charges.
The previous dispute between these two last year has reduced deliveries to EU countries.
The latest dispute between Kyiv and Moscow comes when the Ukrainian government and the Russian state owned a gas monopoly, Gazprom, are trying to figure out how much Ukraine will have to pay for the Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom says he will have to charge Ukraine more because he has agreed to pay up to 50% more for gas from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say it might mean that Ukraine will have to pay 40% more for its Gazprom deliveries.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states in the course of the negotiations," said Ukrainian Minister of Economy Anatoli China, Reuters.
"The changes in gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the amount of transit charges (to Western Europe) across Ukraine."
The last major dispute between Moscow and Kyiv led to a reduction in deliveries from Gazprom to Ukraine in January 2006.
This led to a sharp drop in exports to Western Europe, which quickly increased prices.
Russian gas represents one quarter of deliveries to the European Union.
Russia has the largest gas stocks in the world, but most of them remain underutilized.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own gas supplies from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet Central Asian republics.
NHS "must control foreign staff"
The Controller said that the Scottish Chambers of NHS must improve the control of criminal records among non-European employees.
The recommendation from the president of Robert Black's highest control office came after a foreign doctor acting in Scotland was linked to the June attacks at Glasgow Airport.
Mr Black is also concerned that the Scottish NHS does not have an accurate understanding of the amount of foreign staff he employs.
But his report stressed that other key controls were carried out in accordance with the pattern of five health authorities.
The President of the Supreme Control Authority was concerned immediately after June attacks on staff from outside the European Economic Area at Glasgow Airport.
Eighteen-year-old Bilal Abdullah, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was detained at the airport after someone hired Jeep in the main terminal building.
He was one of three doctors who appeared at the Central Criminal Court using a video bridge accused of attempting to bomb in Britain.
The NHS Chamber is expected to monitor foreign personnel in terms of qualification, experience and authorisation for work in the United Kingdom before their employment.
Although the Scottish Health Commissions use Discovery Scotland for the control of criminal records, this agency has no power to obtain such information outside Britain.
The report by the President of the Supreme Control Authority says, in addition to the recommendations, that the Commission should be allowed to follow the guidelines of the Criminal Records Bureau, which helps employers with controls in several countries.
"Although we found that part of the staff records contained evidence of these checks, they were not carried out regularly," the report reported.
Mr Black said that the Scottish NHS in many respects agrees with its own pre-employment policy, but also added: "Our report points to areas where the system could be improved in order to ensure the availability of accurate information on the quantity of foreign personnel."
President of BMA Scotland Dr. Peter Terry said that it is "very unlikely" that pre-employment checks would identify potential employees of NHS who might commit terrorist acts in the future.
"The report suggests that the current pre-employment controls in the Scottish NHS are working well and it is not clear what further value those comments bring," he said.
The Scottish health authorities have announced that they currently have 1,161 foreign workers, most of whom are doctors and sisters.
However, the President of the highest supervisory authority pointed out that these numbers would probably also be higher because the Commission had a problem identifying staff with residence permits.
The study also found that the controls implemented by NHS authorities in the areas of Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian are largely carried out.
They included passport checks, work permits and qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently reworking its policies and pre-employment control directives for NHS foreign workers.
Minister of Health Nicola Sturgeon said: "I wanted to do this work immediately after the terrorist attack on Glasgow Airport."
It also added that the Scottish Government, in agreement with the health commissions, takes into account the recommendation of this report and ensures that best practices are reflected in the updated pre-employment directives of all staff - including those of the foreign authorities - who are planning to issue the following month.
Joy Division owns movie prices
Control, a biographical film about the retired singer Joy Division Ian Curtis, collected five awards at the British Independent Film Awards, including prizes for the best film.
The awards were also awarded by the star Sam Riley, who worked to the role of Curtis in the warehouse, director Anton Corbín and in the later role of Toby Kebell.
Lady Judi Dench was named the best actress for the thriller scandal records.
And the Star of Bond Daniel Craig won the Variety Award for getting a British movie on the world stage.
The prices were celebrated at the London Roundhouse.
Control describes Curtis's journey to glory with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at the age of 23.
This black and white film - whose soundtrack contains The Killers, David Bowieho and New Order - stood only 3 million pounds.
But he won the Dutch photographer Corbinov, formerly known thanks to the iconic album U2 Joshua Tree, two prizes - for the best director and for the best leading director.
Rock music was the focus of another award - because Julien Temple film about singer Clash Joe Strummer won the prize for the best document.
A poster for the best player, Viggo Mortensen, won the role of the Russian Mafia Boss driver in the London-based thriller David Cronenberg Eastern Promise.
Ray Winston, who has a reputation based on the role of hard guys, won Richard Harris' prize for the extraordinary benefit of the British film.
This 50th-century filmer, including Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is now filming the next part of Indiana Jones - the Kingdom of Christian Lebour.
Winston said he was proud of this price, which is named after the star of the films Camelot and Harry Potter Harris, who died in 2002.
"People like Richard Harris and Albert Finney opened the door for people like me," he added.
"I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris several times.
He's my man, a great actor of his time, I'm very honored."
Independent film prices, known as Biffs, are awarded by the jury where filmmakers, actors and festival organizers meet.
Between the stand and the Bif patrons are Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia arrested 208 people for terrorist conspiracy
Saudi Arabia reported yesterday that it arrested 208 militants for membership in cells preparing an immediate attack on oil installations and also on spiritual and security components.
State television of the largest oil exporter reported that one of the cells wanted to penetrate the country.
The al-Qaeda supporters have been campaigning against the monarchy, the United States, since 2003, i.e. from the invasion into Iraq.
The TV reported that a cell of eight militants led by a foreigner planned an attack on an oil facility in the province of Ash-Sharqiyah.
Saudi Arabia builds a rapid response unit to the strength of 35,000 members to defend equipment from the failed attack of al-Qaida on the largest oil processing plant in Abqaiqu in 2006.
The report quoted the Ministry's internal declaration: 18 arrested belonged to a cell led by "expert on firing missiles", which went through the country.
She further stated that the militants were planning to take eight shots into the kingdom.
22 detainees were to prepare for the murder of spiritual and security workers.
The government urged the clergy to further prevent Saudis from leaving Iraq to join al-Qaeda militants fighting the united army and the Shishak government supported by the United States, which the Saudi Conservative Sunniists consider to be the emperor.
Al-Qaeda militants believe that the authorities have bribed many priests in Saudi Arabia to support the royal family that rules the government.
Militants - supported by the challenges of the leader of al-Qaeda Saúda Usámy bin Ládina to focus on the Western Saudi government - focused on foreign residential complexes, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This war has been a huge effort by the security forces in the past... five months," the Ministry of Interior spokesperson said on state television.
A 16-member "media cell" was also arrested in Medina, which was intended to promote "takfirian thinking" - the ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals, which promotes violence against Muslims marked as unbelievers and apostates.
Among those arrested there were also 32 people accused of providing financial support to militants.
The climate on Venus is perhaps a view of the future of the Earth
Scientists yesterday announced that Venus could ever be a pleasant place for life.
Data from the current European station show that the planet is even more like the Earth's own twin than it used to be.
Venus is the nearest planetary neighbour of the Earth.
These two worlds are almost as big as they are and they run around like preciouss, but Venus is a little closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago, conditions on Venus were similar to those on Earth and could have been habitable.
But the apparent glass effect caused by carbon dioxide, atmospheric erosion of solar radiation and lower rotation speed sent Venus on a completely different path of development.
Today the planet is waterless, the temperature on the surface is hot enough on the roof of the lead, and it is released by storms and winds of hurricane power.
The findings of the European Space Agency Venus Express, which studied the planet for one year, offer a direct view of how the Earth could develop in the event of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of Oxford University physics and one of the leading Venus Express missions said: "It's further clearer why the climate on Venus is so different than on Earth, even though the planets themselves are quite similar.
"Our new data enables us to compile a script in which Venus began as well as the Earth, perhaps even with the habitable environment, billions of years ago."
Police have held "adorable uranium"
A kilo of radioactive material, allegedly enriched by uranium, was detained yesterday by the Slovenian and Hungarian police.
The police spokesperson said three people were detained and the material was examined.
He did not say that it was enriched uranium, but he said that the substance could be sold for $1 million (480,000 pounds).
Still accumulated
Mitt Romney said that it is not appropriate for presidential candidates to answer questions from the snowman.
Despite this, the Republican presidential candidates subsequently agreed with the debate on YouTube, in which ordinary voters recorded their questions on video and passed them on to the broadcasters.
None of the issues raised on Wednesday, 28 November, were as comical as the snowman who asked the Democrats for global warming in the second-party debate on YouTube.
But the questions and answers this time reflected a lot about the situation of the Republican Party leading to the elections next year.
It is not clear how exactly CNN producers, one of the sponsors of the debate, picked clips that were then shown to the aspiring candidates.
But the first half of the debate, the longest time devoted to the single theme, was focused on immigration.
This issue is one of the most powerful issues in the Republic.
CNN asked the panel of undecided volunteers to turn around when they heard something comforting: the speaker noted the summits of agreement when the candidates spoke of a strong approach to borders.
The strongest and longest exchange of views took place between Rudy Giuliani, the main national candidate, and Mr Romney, who stepped forward in key rapid votes in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to get the reputation of a man who was as the Prime Minister of New York soft to illegal immigrants.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants for work at his home.
These two were particularly concerned when the tax collectors asked whether any of the candidates would support "amnesty" (to give illegal immigrants the normal status and opportunity of citizens).
Later candidates, such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Congressman from Colorado, were able to get their share in the mill on this topic.
Neither one of them has a chance to nominate, but they both remain in the game, perhaps because they started to fight because of immigration earlier and stronger than the others.
At least in immigration, candidates have a similar view: greater tension on borders, no tolerance for illegal migrants.
This theme, together with concerns about the food toys from China and other concerns about the world, helps Republicans to forget or minimize the difference between freedom and Christian conservatives.
But the debate began to be very unpleasant when it came to other issues.
Mr. Giuliani was asked why he supported holding firearms in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney were discussing whether the simulated heating technique should be considered torture.
One taxi driver asked if the candidates believed every word from the Bible.
Mr. Giuliani thus concluded that even though the Bible is his favorite book, he probably does not believe in the words of the story of Jonah and the glory.
Another hostage asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - who is now against all the assumptions in the first place in a recent survey in Iowa due to his long-term Christian conservativeism - said that the death penalty is unpleasant but necessary.
Under pressure to decide whether Jesus would agree, Jesus said that he was too smart to run for what he used to laugh.
The fight remains unusually open.
The growth of Mr. Huckabee in Iowa is covered with recent success in obtaining money and the loud joy of Ron Paul during the middle debate.
These two are from the bottom because both sides are still unable to agree on more familiar and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, one of the candidates joined the party very soon and convincingly with a winning report on American oral size, marking both sides.
This time, the party is disbanded and the result is far from clear.
Labourers' Diseases
Gordon Brown again found a trap he could fall into; his journey remains the same.
Although I'm used to British political scandals, this is not particularly pictorial.
It doesn't seem like any rules were sold, no accounts in the Paris hotel were secretly paid, no extra-marriage rings were charged.
But the barricaded Gordon Brown would hang himself without revealing that after four years some rich businessman was masking contributions by the ruling Labour Party of $650,000 pounds (1.3 million) under the names of other people, and that the party did not report it.
Two months ago, when the prime minister avoided the election and insulted the British intelligence by claiming that this decision was not influenced by the investigations, there was hope that it would ensure a sustainable and effective government.
Instead of formulating it as much as possible, the President of the Liberal Democrats, Mr Brown, once feared, changed from Stalin to Mr Bean.
The unscrupulous rescue of the Northern Rock problem bank showed weaknesses in the management and sound judgment under fire.
The misconceptions of the amendments to the tax code have brought companies together against the government.
The loss of personal data in 25 million people revealed an unpredictable administrative bias.
The three generals in retirement began rebellion in the Chamber of Lords; they protested against the cuts in military expenditures, for they claimed that being a commander of the armed forces was part-time work.
Now there are many gifts from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Secretary General of Labour (and their former observer for internal discipline), has already resigned.
None of this means that Mr. Brown would be heading in the opposite direction to his end.
Despite this, governments can reach the point of overcrowding, which they look at as hard as government.
People don't believe in politicians and they don't like them, but most of them will take away their disbelief when we take over a new party.
When it seems clear that a prime minister is probably not doing anything better, and doesn't have to be in the office for long, this is a rejection away: state administration becomes a mess, ministers start making briefings, the press is looking for bad news, and the government is becoming unconcentrated and defensive.
In one way, Mr Brown's position is particularly difficult, because it is not possible for other political leaders to take the position of a new cost.
Whatever he wanted to distance himself from Tony Blair, he was his first officer.
For example, problems with Northern Rock and the financial office records are linked to the decisions Mr Brown made as Minister of Finance.
And even though he was not directly involved in blairov's paintings, such as a long investigation into the financing of political parties caused by "values for money", voters can calmly judge that he was.
However, Mr. Brown's inconveniences are not as bad as they seem.
Those seizures aren't as horrible as the conservators do.
As for Mr. Bean, no one died or was exposed to fraud.
And treatment, however painful it may be, is to provide what Mr. Brown's Stalinist tendency has always promised: a reliable, firm and easy brutal government.
The latest confusion about political gifts is a good example.
Mr. Garboid Abrahams, who compares his gifts to Charity, says that he did not want any publicity for his charity.
That may be true, but the decision wasn't on him.
The laws against anonymously large political donors are clear and exist for a simple reason: the public has the right to know who can buy access to those who rule the country.
Mr. Watt, who said he knew about the procedure of Mr. Abrahams, but didn't know it was illegal, would certainly be thoroughly questioned; likewise, Jon Mendlesohn, the main laborer of money who learned about eight-year-old gifts in October.
But so far Mr. Brown is not at all complicated; there is nothing to suggest that he knew about these birds, even though the main part of the payments went on until after his arrival in June.
The prime minister has done half the work.
He quickly condemned this violation of the laws by his own party, but he made his decision by agreeing to a certified instrument, a committee to investigate this matter - also led by the bishop in retirement and by the judge.
In this case, training is not complicated.
If the law's been violated, it's about the police.
In addition, there are other things that Mr Brown must do, such as find a permanent independent chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, which has been missing for six months, and deal with the real reform of the financing of political parties.
This would require laborers who are close to cooperate with the Conservative and perhaps even give up their special financial relationship with the committees - bitter pills for a dedicated party, such as Mr Brown.
But he should face a few simple facts.
The Conservatives now have a decent leap in the research; he has two years to get the voters back; and the only way to achieve victory is unmistakable integrity and high competence.
Carat sharks
Does the crisis affect the US credit card market?
When the blood is in the water, naturally they start to stir the back of their lungs.
Now that the U.S. property market is growing, the predators have focused on the darker market for credit cards.
Analysts from Goldman Sachs say that losses on credit cards could have reached $99 billion if other consumer loans had been contaminated from underlying mortgages.
The voltage signals are visible.
Increased number of non-payments cases (for more than 30 days late payment) and write-off accounts (accounts considered by the supplier to be ineligible).
Last month, HSBC announced that it had lost $1.4 billion on the US consumer credit market - also due to non-solvent loans on credit cards.
But he's panicked so far.
There are still few written accounts and inability to pay.
According to Moody's assessment agency, the rate of payment incapacity was 3.89% in the third quarter of almost all percentage points on average.
The deterioration rates may be partially explained for technical reasons.
The 2005 American Personal Bankruptcy Act has led to a sharp decline in the number of reported bankruptcys that make a large part of the losses on credit cards; the number of reporting (including the number of copies) would therefore fall regardless of whether the general conditions for the lenders have deteriorated.
The sector also shows a good level of eligibility that shows how much consumers pay out of their debts each month.
And the trust in the securities of secured credit cards is strong, even through paralysis in other points of structured finance.
Mr. Dennis Moroney, from the TowerGroup research firm, predicts that the volume of their emissions in 2007 will be 25% higher than volleyball.
Direct paths for spreading infection between underlying mortgages crises and credit card markets definitely exist: when loans are dried up in real estate, consumers are more likely to owe themselves to credit cards.
Credit card issuers, however, are more concerned with the cash flow than with the value of handhold items, so falling home prices do not necessarily mean a change in the credibility of lenders.
They can even be useful for loan providers.
The motivation of consumers to pay off mortgages is reduced when their assets fall below the value of the loan; as a result, the debt on the cards is moved up to the priority list to pay.
The card issuers can also respond more quickly and more flexibly to stormy conditions than mortgage providers by changing interest rates or debt limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of rapid price changes in hand-held items.
"It doesn't happen that we'll just re-evaluate all the loans one morning," says Gary Perlin, financial manager of Capital One.
Although the risk of explosions in the style of underlying mortgages is low, the risk of gradual weakening is far more real.
If lower home prices and debt reduction push America into recession, the credit card sector will face a darker future.
Watch out for those backseats.
British bankers admitted guilt in the Enron case
Three British bankers, who were to be convicted of their role in the fraud associated with the former financial leader Enron Andrew Fastowe, changed their statement on Wednesday and confessed their guilt.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew initially blamed in seven fraud charges when they had to participate with Fast in the financial fraud in 2000 -- to rely on their employers -- they argued.
They were supposed to be in January before the court.
However, during the trial before U.S. interim judge Ewing Werley Jr., everyone admitted to one deception.
In the case of these three former employees of Greenwich NatWest, the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, was on the front pages for the entire two years of the publishing process.
In the United States, their case is one of the unclosed parts of the investigation initiated after Enron’s collapse in 2001.
The charges brought against them in 2002 were pointed out by Mr Fastow that he was the aim of the government investigation into Enron's crime.
The charge against bankers -- who earned the last name "NatWest's Three" -- claims that in 2000 they came to Houston to forge a fraud together with Fast and his former chief cousin Michael Kopper.
Greenwich NatWest invested in Enron's partnership side controlled by Fast, an architect of a lot of Enron's deceptions that sought Enron's spiral towards bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank assessed its share of this branch to be zero, but our three British people knew that it actually had significant value.
The company under Kopper's control bought the bank's share in this branch for $1 million.
Incrimination bankers paid Kopper a share of $250,000 in this company.
According to Fastow's indictment, Enron wrongly informed that the energy company would pay $20 million for its share in this branch of Greenwich NatWest.
However, those 20 million actually went to those British bankers, Fastov and others.
Bankers were charged with 7.3 million and Fastow, Kopper, and others were fined about 12.3 million dollars.
In January 2004, Fastow admitted his guilt in two cases for his role in overthrowing Enron.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is currently serving a six-year sentence in the federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is serving three years and one month in a facility in Texarkana.
All three British have been released for $1 million in bail, which has ordered them to remain in the United States for the upcoming court.
Enron, once the seventh largest company in the country, fell into bankruptcy in December 2001, after years of accounting tricks could no longer hide billions of debts or prove a failed speculation as profit.
The collapse has abolished thousands of jobs, more than $60 billion of market value and more than $2 billion in pension insurance.
The founder of Enron Kenneth Lay and former chief executive Jeffrey Schilling were sentenced last year for their role in the collapse of the company.
Schilling is in execution for more than 40 years.
Judgments over Lay for conspiracy, fraud and other charges were reduced after he died of heart disease last year.
Moscow's Incapacity
The price of the Golfstream G550, equipped with Rolls-Royce engine and sufficient fuel volume for nonstop flights from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
For some of the Russian rich, however, it is small to return.
"He can carry up to 18 passengers," says Dan Firer, a representative of the Gulfstream.
"But none of them have so much interest in places because it's for a close family or corporate president."
Mr. Firer was sitting in the Gulfstream stand last Friday at the Millionary Exhibition, which is a four-day orgy of demonstrated consumption in the mother exhibition centre on the periphery of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, over 200 other luxury suppliers who hoped that freshly rich Russians would catch up on everything from the mahogany jackets made by diamonds decorated with car slippers that wouldn't even be ashamed of.
Mr. Firer looked carefully at the clear orange Porsche in the side stand.
"It's a nice car, but it's against us five and ten," he said.
"Russia is the second largest private aircraft market in the United States."
On the waves of oil, money is taken into the Russian capital, just as Dallas had its days.
"We went through the same stage in the 1980s when some Americans were very wealthy and moved to Europe, where they were looking at them as materialists," said Marshall Goldman, a fourth-year listener at Davis Center for Russian and Euro-Asian Studies at Harvard.
Like the 70s and 1990s, the Japanese are becoming the most prominent losers in the world.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their work on this Klondike.
Another place in Moscow this week was the conference of the luxury industry Donatell Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, president of the LVMH Group, to exchange ideas about how to sell expensive goods on markets such as Russian.
(The International Herald Tribune, owned by The New York Times Company.)
According to a list of the richest people in Forbes magazine, Russia has 53 billion dollars in total worth of $282 billion.
The local main institute in the field of Center for Economic and Financial Research has also issued a report on the development of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, according to which in Russia there are 103 000 "secondary" millionaires, whose property totals $670 billion.
(The World Bank states that 15.8% of Russians lived below the existing minimum in 2005.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow -- and that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative of the London Prince David Morris.
She was at the fair for the first time, together with the Russian distributor of this brand, Soho Jewelry Group.
"All women are unusually well-adjusted and men are all for all their property."
When they walked in the evening dress on Sunday night halams, the twenty-one-year-old Evgenia Yumatov and five years older Svetlana Turovcov themselves and their clients labeled themselves as millionaires.
"I was looking at the cars and I can't decide between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said Miss Yumatov, who was sitting in the brand clothes as a veteran of red blankets, by which Joan Rivers looks like a housewife.
The fair seemed to be focused mainly on fresh rich, highly managed Russian buyers who are willing to sit down for a few hours in road traffic so that they can pass through the warehouses that gently move Cadillacy Escalade, platinum fish, frozen Mövenpick, quiet circulatory tables, apartments in Dubai, gowns and frogs.
Members of the public could buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
"The Russians are interested in what brand is the most expensive and best," said Mr. Gijarat, who patriotically occupied the stand of the Dutch porcelain producer Royal Delft before the reproduction of Rembrandt's image from hand-painted blue tiles in the living size.
"Of course the Russians are interested in more gold."
And indeed, the present sellers say that the Russians with the old money (according to Russian measurements 10 to 15 years old) have already moved from the blizzard logs to little known limited editions that would never appear on the shopping fair.
Even a few thousand people, whether they're millionaires, millionaires or free tourists, every day the fair halls were flooded.
And some of them bought.
On the first day of the exhibition, last Thursday, Roman Ersov, the local general manager of King Koil's bed, said that he sold two mattresses of silk, cashmere and cotton, covered with gold yarns, for $70,000.
Also on the first day said Mikhail Lyubimov, a sales manager of A1 Moto, who features high-end cars with high-end alarms that his company sold clearly orange Porsche for $170 000 to the Russian millionaire.
On Sunday afternoon, Andrej Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, who manages luxury cars on request, said that he sold three chains to cars in the style of tied chain bracelets for Rolls-Royce Phantomy for $55,000.
He showed the reporter a car bike designed for the Russian casino owner who had a leak from Swarovsk crystal so it looked like a roulette.
Price: $22,000 for four.
"That Russian millionaire who wants a wheel from a scrap metal or a portrait of his wife from a circular zirconia, doesn't have to ride on those wheels yet," said Mr. Karapetian.
"He'll put them in his garage by thirty to forty cars."
Although many of his Russian clients are rich, Mr. Karapetian said that the phrase "Russian millionaire" at the moment does not mean anything very exclusive, given the great increase in the prices of the real estate.
"If you bought yourself three or four years ago in Moscow's apartment, you're probably already millions, at least on paper, when it's not cash," he said.
"There are more than you think."
Those who are not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich at the stand of the Russian company Alliance Continental, which deals with asset management.
The company has identified four red British-style telephone booths that are locked down by false bankers worth millions of dollars.
Aszad Karryev, the marketing manager of the company, said that his team had printed 500,000 false bankers for the Millionaires.
They stopped to spend around a bunch of money or let their friends take a picture of their mobile phone, rest in the middle of their spare wealth, or just cut out a few million pockets.
"You know, in Moscow everyone can feel like a millionaire," said Mr. Karryev.
Death in New Jersey may be caused by an infected operation
It was a day before Thanksgiving when Roland Livingston looked out of the big windows at the restaurant here about something healthier and watched a sanitizer that came to the white New England house with two houses down the West Scott Avenue.
The car was soon connected to the police station.
And then another one.
"Then I saw the delivery of the doctor," said Mr. Livingston, a restaurant controller.
"At that moment, I knew someone was dead."
The authorities found out that a dead woman was Olga Arroya, 41 years old, an executive assistant director of the Nigerian Police Department.
The investigators are now trying to determine whether she died because of a procedure performed by an unlicensed plastic surgeon whose identity was denied by the police to provide the house number 212 at West Scott Avenue.
The authorities have not yet found out what caused Ms. Arroy's death, and they hope that toxicological tests, whose results do not have to be known for weeks, will help resolve the mysterious death that the Nigerian police have sent out with a wave of sadness.
Ms. Arroy was the assistant of the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was known to many in the department.
"She was loyal, polite and hard-working," said Mr. McCarthy about Miss Arroy in a phone interview on Wednesday.
"She was my shield.
She'd protect me."
Mr. McCarthy said that Miss Arroy was Jimmy Arroyo's wife, a former Nigerian police officer who works for the Commission to control alcoholic beverages, and that she left two sons behind at 14 and 11 years of age and her own daughter.
Eileen Walsh, spokesperson for the Union, Theodore J. Romankow, said that the detectives were trying to find out if Ms. Arroy died of the consequences of an unlicensed surgery.
"It's one of the ways," said Miss Walsh.
"The investigation is still ongoing."
The authorities indicated that they had arrived at the house about three o'clock on the afternoon of 21.
November and found Miss Arroy on the couch.
She was declared dead at the scene.
More than a week later, the authorities still said little about their investigation or the owner of the house, which is allegedly Flor Margarita Castro.
Ms. Walsh didn't tell me if the authorities heard from Miss Castro.
Investigators are trying to determine whether part of the house has been used as an office.
No one answered in the middle of Miss Castro's house, with a broken pink candle in the front yard and a Dalmatian jumping behind,
Next to the door that led to the shop, the blue barrel with the inscription "Ethyl Vanillin" was held in the open garage, which is a substance used as a substitute for vanilla in food and cosmetics.
There were two mountain wheels hanging on one side.
Mr. McCarthy recalled that when he first arrived 25 years later in the New York Police Department in New York, Ms. Arroy provided him with invaluable help in testing his new city's unbearable and bold political culture.
"She said, 'You should take care of this or this,' he said.
"She was always here when I came, and she was always here when I left.
It was embarrassing."
Hope that the Fed reduces interest rates leads to the strengthening of world stock exchanges
Stock prices on both sides of the Atlantic jumped yesterday after the hope of the market that the Federal Bank would try to calm the loan conditions by further lowering interest rates, were strengthened by the relaxing statements of the Vice-Chairman of the US Central Bank.
The stock exchange jumped in London, New York, and across Europe after Donald Kohn, second in line with Ben Bernanke, President of Fed, said that in response to continued pressure on financial markets, the drivers must be "flexible and pragmatic".
As part of a clear effort to calm down the distorted markets in the midst of the signs of credit fluctuations, Mr. Kohn said that recent riots "has partially reversed some improvements in the functioning of markets at the end of September and October".
He further stated that if the increased instability persists, the possibility that the financial conditions of the household and the company will continue to deteriorate.
The investors consider these projections to be a signal that the Fed is ready to add additional fresh capital prices to the US market, and perhaps further reduction in interest rates to stabilise credit conditions.
These comments also helped to calm Wall Street down among other bad news about the American economy when the sale of apartments in October showed record low numbers.
The results of the financial trust were supported by the announcement by the Investment Bank of Bear Stearns that it will abolish 650 jobs, which are 4% of its world labour force, in the context of reducing costs for compensating heavy losses caused by an unauthorized commitment to providing sub-loans for housing in America.
It is expected that only 20 of these places will be abolished in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial index grew by 331 points, or 2.55%, and it closed to 13 289.40, while the more used S&P 500 index increased by 2.65 percent.
The London FTSE 100 index increased by 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent, and closed to 6,306.2, with the value of British blue chips increased by more than 39 billion pounds.
The German Dax index grew by 2.6 per cent and the French CAC40 increased by 2.3 per cent.
Some time ago, credit tensions on the markets were shown to be in full force after the European Central Bank’s three-month cash package auctions were lent to European commercial banks at a rate of 4,7 %, which is the most since April 2001.
The pressure on the British bank to follow up the Fed and the ECB and release the London cash market for higher standard money has increased by increasing the rates of three-month UK interbank loans "Libor" after uninterrupted growth from 12 November to a maximum of 6.59 per cent since the end of September.
England must decide: Owais Shah, or Ravi Bopara?
We have two dilemmas, one almost as hard as the other.
Who's gonna be number six for England this weekend in Candy, Owais Shah, or Ravi Bopara?
And in a broader context of nothing less relevant than the first Test against Sri Lance, who is going to make this decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the chairman of the election committee, who is holding the best in this position at the time of loan, has Peter Moore, the chief coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, with the aid decision and because the Hugh Morris table, the chief manager of the English team, is starting to fill out applications for the national election post, not necessarily for full involvement.
Anyone who doesn't stand in the sixth place on his thumb will be unhappy, but life is often not fair and sport is no longer at all.
It is not easy to find what one gets at the top of his profession, while another will never get over the lower level, sometimes because of a lack of happiness rather than ability.
Not only in the cricket is the choice difficult and requires a judgment that must ultimately always be subjective.
Is it a good time for Bopara to move up?
Is it fair to Shah, if it is?
In the same way, we could ask ourselves in other areas, say here: John Edwards or Tubby Banerjee, both smart young leading workers with good education and a review in the field, should be promoted to the Commission - instead of just one.
Who's supposed to say what level is right for a cricketer if he can't afford to fall or swim on the next?
Of course, numbers have a major influence on decision-making, but they also have opportunities.
In the team, a cricketer must at the right time catch up with the captain's view of whether to take a wicket, and the sticker needs a regular chance at starting positions, whether to ever make an impression as a one-day cricketer.
Catching the sample view is more complicated.
For example, in the last season there were many better ones James Anderson, whose place in the first test seemed certain, even if Stephen Harmison had claimed to be healthy and performed as a fireman.
Anderson took 32 Wickets in the first grade at 33 crossings on everyone.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 at the same cut average, but they both had their moments at the highest level and were hoping for another.
If he plays at the Asgirya Shah Stadium, or Bopara can only be a matter of opinion.
The choice can divide or influence both careers, or it must also have no major impact.
Four years ago at Sri Lance, Gareth Batty played in each Test and in the first class gave good performances, five tickets, and 40 vacation trips, but it was Paul Collingwood who at the same time fought for his place, who finally became a stable Test Cricketer, who was also, although in Australia against Australia, scored two hundred points, perhaps still underrated.
It is more likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moore, after another discussion on today's training purely at the Asirgiya Stadium, will follow their conservative instincts and prefer Shah's greater experience in front of Bopar's youthful maturity.
There are arguments for both.
For Shah, his bickering and valuable debut test shifts at 88 points in Bombay and 32 hundred in the first class versus the 6th Boparov, who, in his 20s, is seven years younger and has excellent statistics against spin surpluses.
However, Shah made in two shifts in May against the Caribbean in the Lord's Test, his home playground in Middlesex, only ten passes, and this, along with the immediate refusal of the electors, when Vaughan wanted to reunite him on another match, seemed to be wearing something out of the elah that was so obvious in Bombay.
On the contrary, the Essex University has a joie de vivere in its bones.
At the cricket playground nothing removes him and his behavior outside the playground symbolizes a recently converted car with a four-wheel drive on the exhibition day of the English car sponsor Volkswagen.
He got away with slight injuries and apparently shock, but as the first thing he pulled out his Vodafone (of course also sponsored) and called Alastair Cook, his partner, who was watching it from a distance, to ask him excitedly, "Did you see it?"
Bopara is definitely better in the field, its moderately fast swinging upheavals on the left-hand sides that seem to him to be satisfying, delivering effectively and firing independently and manually.
Choosing the right person is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Maybe it's the real art of choice.
Personally, I'm trying to get Bopar to get his chance now, which is why I don't want to say that Shah won't excel if, as the ceylon tea cards indicate, he'll be who'll play next weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and fight against al-Qaeda
The first buses filled with Iraqi refugees from Syria began arriving in Baghdad yesterday and pouring out the refugees who came in or exhausted the visa period, and others who hoped that the city would return to normal life.
Some even returned to fight the armed men who had driven them out of their homes.
The Mansour bus station was before 800 people arrived from Damascus in the official government convoy about a dozen buses, full of refugees from Syria and Jordan who returned to private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad," said Sabah al-Kubaisi, Sunnitian doctor.
"I came back today for what I saw on television and what I read in the newspapers, for what was done in Baghdad and how it is safe now.
"They say that the Mahdi army has stopped killing people," he said, meant a Shissite militia of militant Muktadad al-Sadra, who temporarily ordered his people to stop fighting.
Kasim al-Atwani, an 18-year-old Shiite teacher from the predominantly Sunni region of Amaría, returned with his two children because he could no longer renew the Syrian visa and because the Darker regime did not allow the Iraqis to work.
His dirty neighbors in the Amaria called him by the fact that the local Home Defense with the support of the U.S. Army helped to push Al-Qaeda out of her positions in the west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan is the leader of the Sunni and Shiite tribe, which he avoided a grenade attack from his home in Sleikh in northern Baghdad after he urged his fellow citizens to rise against al-Qaeda.
He came back to fight.
"A couple of my friends called me and told me that they were going to Sleikh militia against al-Qaeda and that they needed me and my boyfriends' support.
That's why I came back today," said 20-year-old Sabaah Alu Obeidi.
Many spoke of the attractiveness of reconciliation in the main city after the strengthening of the American military presence and the growth of local "group of interested citizens", which arms on the side of the American army defend their quarter.
But more has been said that they have been obstructed by visas and money losses in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarraj, a father of one-forty-three children, voiced a suspicion shared among refugees that Núri al-Maliki, a Shiite Prime Minister, had asked the Syrian government to impose restrictions on refugee visas and had them returned.
According to available data, more than two and a half million people have fled from Iraqi sectarian killings.
"It was all right before al-Maliki visited Syria and pressured the government to stop giving the Iraqis visas to have to return to Iraq," the Sunnitian pensioner said.
"I can't believe the government that's supporting the criminals who burned me on my way home."
Part of the reason for the weakening of violence is the fact that the Sunni were pushed out of Shiite areas and on the contrary, which in many places reduces tension.
Concerns arise that the sudden influx of refugees will rekindle sectarian tensions and lead to another fight.
Small sarcasm, good education
The smallest community country in Germany plays a leading role in professional education, even excels with the international focus of its higher schools.
Only in one educational area does Sarsko worry about the same deficit as the rest of Germany.
"A man who does not come from Sarca, I explained yesterday after 50 years that we are no French" - this self-inflicted password appears on posters in Sarca on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the birth of this smallest community country.
France and Luxembourg, however, play a key role in the SAR education system, which is in monitoring the education of the Institute of Economic Research (IW) in the fifth place.
High schools have traditionally cooperated closely with the surrounding countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To this day, students can complete their studies with a double or even three-thirds degree.
This corresponds to a relatively high proportion of foreign students, which represents 15,6 %.
In fact, the average number of Saracian children is to be admitted to high school - many of them even without a high school degree.
"A specialized education system is being used in Sardinia," says Axel Plünnecke, an IW educational expert.
The fact that more than every fifth young person is entitled to study at the university level is more than 7% higher than the German average.
Compared with the rest of Germany, there are rich opportunities for combining practical and academic education in Sarajevo.
The possibilities to study two sectors are given the number of the second best inhabitants throughout Germany.
In recent years, the number of engineering graduates has fallen by one third through practically oriented education and rising demand.
Therefore, the Serbian Ministry of Education has now ordered higher schools to set up a promotional campaign in the engineering sector.
"After the first study of the Scriptures, we carried out several reforms in general education schools," says the Ministry of Education spokesperson.
The government has therefore conducted comparative tests throughout Germany.
For children to start learning as soon as possible, the last year of the mother's school is free - a model that takes over other school countries.
If the results of the students are significantly improved, they will show up to the next comparative study.
In 2003, the proportion of students at risk decreased from 29% to 20%.
In general, however, the country has not improved as much as the other member countries.
The Bavarians can count better.
And for the disappointment of the Sarca study of Pisa, they do not compare the knowledge of foreign languages - otherwise, Sarsko could point in this area.
The language of the neighbours is mandatory in high schools - although the people of Sarca are not French.
Chavez moves hours
What they won't see will be hours in Venezuela other than the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chávez let the hours in this South American country come back by half an hour.
In Spain, in the meantime, Chávez has become a funny figure.
Venezuela's official newspaper reported that the hours under the new law against world time will be shifted by minus four and a half hours.
The South American state will take this step in a time zone that does not exist in any other country of the world.
Chavez, the enemy of the United States, justified his decisions, inter alia, by the fact that the United States has entered the world's time zones throughout the hours.
In the middle of local time, Chávez also announced that due to the case with the hostages, relations with neighboring Colombia were interrupted.
This leftist nationalist said that while conservative Alvaro Uribe is President of Colombia, he will not have any relations with him or with the Colombian government.
"For my own self-esteem, I cannot," said Chávez, who advocates the reform of the constitution, about which citizens of this oil country must vote in Sunday's referendum.
This reform would greatly strengthen Chávez's power in the country.
The conflict led to Uribe's decision to withdraw Chávez's mandate to negotiate in Colombia with Marxist rebels about the release of hostages.
Uribe, by his decision, Venezuela "swift into the face", criticised Uribe Chavez on Sunday.
Everyone in Spain is talking about Chavez.
The new mobile call here has caused confusion: "Why don't you call them?" (Why don't you shut up?) - that's how a sentence that has already been downloaded from the Internet by more than half a million people.
It was spoken by Spanish King Juan Carlos, who, at the recent Ibero-American summit, was so disillusioned with the voice of this left populist that he was silenced in this way.
Germans are threatened with lower payments in 2007
According to the forecast, this year German employees are threatened with a reduction in real wages even in the face of a strong crisis.
Experts have justified their pessimistic prediction for a number of reasons.
According to the estimates of Hans Böckler's Foundation in 2007, employees can actually count by getting lower wages than last year.
"Wine is a small increase in wages, an increase in the value added tax and an increase in food and energy prices," said the newspaper Bild Gustav Horn from the Institute of Macroeconomy und Konjunkturforschung.
New burdens on employees may also be expected in the area of unemployment insurance.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told Neue Osnabrück Zeitung that by the new year the planned reduction of unemployment insurance contributions to 3.3% is correct and reasonable in this situation.
However, the Social Labour Agency should not again fall into such disagreements as to require loans or contributions from young people, quoted the paper of this socially democratic policy.
On Tuesday, it was announced that the price explosion of food and oil products has prevented inflation at its highest rate in the last thirteen years.
In the annual price comparison, the total price rose by three percent.
Venus is the Hellenistic twin of the Earth
Throughout his life, the enemy atmosphere of Venus Earth is more similar to what it was supposed to have been. The European space probe Venus Express on Venus recorded phenomena that occur in winter as well on Earth: lightnings in the atmosphere and wind belief in fields.
For almost three decades, scientists have known that Venus is shining.
Now the Venus Express European probe has produced evidence - captured electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere. On Venus, the lightnings fly from the dark to the darkness, about 56 kilometers high, written in the scientific magazine Nature Christopher Russell from the University of California in Los Angeles.
According to known theory, the origin of the original matter could have arisen on Earth thanks to the lightnings of life. The storms reportedly caused in the oceans reactions that led to the creation of amino acids, the basic stones of life.
This was not so on Venus: "If life ever existed there, it must have been a long time ago," explains Sean Solomon of Carnegie Institute in Washington.
Today, the atmosphere is about a hundred times thicker than on Earth, and sometimes temperatures are about 500 °C.
"Venus may be the Hell twins of the Earth, but it's the twins," said Russell.
Why Venus, which is so much like Earth and size, began to develop completely differently, is a fundamental issue for the mission of Esa.
In view of the fact that no probe has been sent since the beginning of the 1990s exclusively for the purpose of studying Venus, the launch of Venus Express probe in November 2005 was in the research of this planet as a milestone.
According to scientists, the latest results of research, which approached several articles in the journal Nature, were not just the uniqueness of Venus in the solar system.
"They have also shown that our neighboring planet is more like Earth than it was supposed to have been," Esa said.
In addition to the already known winds of belief in the north, scientists have found a dark belief in the south, which is much faster.
This phenomenon recalls air currents on the northern hemisphere, writes a research team led by Guiseppe Piccioni from the Italian Institute of Astrophysica Spaciale e Physics Cosmica.
The second most internal planet of our solar system forms almost the same mass as Earth and, on average, 12 100 km is almost the same size.
This planet named Jitřenka or Dinner will run the Sun in 225 days.
However, around its own axis it turns a lot slower. One day on Venus lasts 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus does not remember the surface temperature of 460 °C and the pressure of 92 bars on Earth, scientists believe that both planets have come under very similar conditions.
The water was gathered on both sides, but on the earth it remained in the oceans, while from Venus it grew into the universe.
While carbon dioxide on Earth is bound in carbonates, on Venus it forms most of the atmosphere.
Köhler defends the Merkel meeting with the Dalai Lama
Colk President Köhler calls for the end of the party disputes for the adoption of the Dalai Lama in the Office.
Indirectly criticised the SPD for its attacks on the Chancellor after a meeting in September.
Colk President Horst Köhler is concerned about the history of Germany and calls on a great coalition to put an end to the struggle around the adoption of the Dalai Lama.
"We should also not present ourselves as a nation that is not united on this issue," Köhler told the commercial newspaper Handelsblatt.
At the same time, he expressed his understanding of the decision of the German Chancellor Angely Merkel (CDU) to take a stand in September.
"Although I respect cultural differences, human rights have universal validity for me," Köhler said.
The President-in-Office stressed that everyone knows that Germany must maintain a reasonable balance in foreign policy, but that did not prevent Merkel from stopping when it was calculated that he was creating a new policy towards China.
"The union officer did not leave China's traditional policy.
China knows that too," Köhler said.
Minister of Foreign Affairs Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) has indirectly revealed his disagreement with the adoption of the Dalai Lama, and has been attacked by a number of coalitions.
Steinmeier complained about, among other things, the "pre-emptive" foreign policy of the coalition.
After the adoption, German-Chinese relations have deteriorated in the office.
Not only did the Chinese government cancel the invitation of German Finance Minister Peera Steinbrück (SPD), but according to the SPIEGEL magazine also frozen the so-called strategic dialogue of ministries abroad.
The Chinese President of the Wen Jiabao Government invited Chancellor Angel Merkel to admit that the adoption of the Dalai Lama was a mistake.
China does not approve when European politicians officially accept Tibetan spiritual leader, Wen Jiabao stressed China’s position.
The words and actions of the Dalai Lama showed that Tibet, along with other Tibetan areas, also located in China, is trying to separate from China.
Schäuble warns of similar unrest that broke out in France
Street battles with police, gunshots, arson cars. Wolfgang Schäuble warns against similar riots that broke out in France.
We have to do everything we can to ensure that social unhappiness in Germany does not increase in street violence, the social minister calls on us inside.
The barricades were burning, the blasters were shooting at the police. After serious youth unrest in France, German Social Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) is afraid of similar developments.
"We must pay attention to the fact that we do not have any social tensions that will burst into violence.
We have to take this seriously," Neue Press said in the Helmver newspaper.
Not every young person can cope with a rapid change in the reality of society.
The community government, countries and villages are already working hard to eliminate problems, Schäuble said.
Which means not just integration of migrants.
"From the integration summit after the conference on Islam, we record our first successes."
However, caution is still in place.
At the same time, Schäuble pointed out that the planning and sociological problems of German suburbs are not comparable to those of French.
Last night, youth with the police in the northern suburbs of Paris were being lured into hard street fights.
Even in Toulouse, cars and public buildings were burning.
More integration efforts by the German government required the Turkish mayor in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In view of the unrest in France, Kolat warned against the "imitation effect".
The situation in Germany should not be as explosive as in France.
However, it should be done.
Kolat pointed out that among people under 25 who come from migrant families, the unemployment rate is "averagely high".
Above all, it is necessary to ensure a greater number of study opportunities.
Kolat stressed, "We have to give the youth hope."
But the Turkish president added that in Germany, unlike France, there is greater social control of families.
In addition, many young people from migrant families do not want to destroy what their parents have built.
Kolat was like, "But we still have to be careful."
We've got to "make it easy for young people to get to work and get to know."
Meanwhile, the night in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel remained mostly quiet.
There were hundreds of policemen in the ambush, and over the area, a helicopter flew over with lightning.
The authorities have reported three arrests and several burned trash and cars.
Since yesterday, about 1,000 orderly forces have been working on peace.
The police will be involved as long as it is necessary, after a visit by the Prime Minister of the Interior, Michelle Alliot-Marie.
In the suburbs of Villiers-le-Bel, about 80 policemen were injured on Tuesday night.
The following night, Toulouse's troubles took over.
An accident caused by a Sunday traffic accident that killed two young people.
According to the initial findings of state representation, the police are not responsible for the death of young people.
In the realm of the Angely Clouds
The chancellor's really remote exit shows that the coalitions are programmable at the end and that we can't expect anything more from it.
What country does this office actually live in?
After her unrest, inconspicuous and inconspicuous speech on the general debate of the Colloquium, we must note: not here - not in this country, which she should finally manage.
As a result of her overfocusing on foreign policy, Angela Merkel answered once with a very arrogant sentence.
She said she didn't want to understand what the critics were talking about.
In Spolkov's winter, she showed everyone how much she deserved this performance.
Merkel had no real interest, so she felt for the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela "Oblaková" was presented: a politician who stands out above others who goes into foreign politics and even utters only lies.
For example, climate protection: Heiligendam is constantly praised for its conclusions, but it does not say how these climate goals should be achieved in Germany.
And anyway, such self-glorification - so much modesty would have forgiven the President of the CDU two years ago.
It is now limited to the planned phrases that could increase its shape among people.
This approach damages its image of pragmatics, which does not need to be abused because problems are solved.
But in the realm of Angela's "Millions" there are internal political problems of the border.
Children's poverty and care for people with low wages?
She had a few extra points on these subjects.
It is worth noting how often the Merkels, when it comes to children's supplements, cross-referencing.
Three times Merkel has to start from the beginning to succeed in expressing at least a partially correct sentence.
As soon as things start to be too concrete, it's going to be like in a completely foreign field.
Department of Attack
The debate of the Republican presidential candidates on Youtube in the case of Rudy Giulianicho and Mitt Romney's favorites has spread in the debate - and both must now be afraid of the external candidate.
The tension of both candidates is already on the first topic.
Mitt Romney is anticipating his rival Rudy Guilianim that he has made New York a "place of refuge for illegal immigrants".
Giuliani quickly reacts with harsh remarks: "I believe that his own house was just one such shelter," responds and predicts to former governor Massachusetts that he has employed immigrants in private without documents.
Since the Republican base has no clear preference so far, eight presidential candidates are using these debates on CNN mainly to discredit their opponents.
The half-minute, internet-based videos posted through Youtube serve only as such key theme tips.
"That's exactly the policy of isolationism we have allowed Hitler to take power," John McCain warns his opponent Ron Paul, who is the only one who is prosecuting the immediate withdrawal of troops from Iraq.
Vietnamese veteran McCain doesn't look at either Romney or Romney because he refuses to condemn the torture method of the hearing called "Waterboarding", where heat is simulated.
The public's reaction in St. Petersburg shows that among the important themes of the campaign are neither war in Iraq nor methods of torture.
The commitment shall be put into disrepute whenever conservative values are raised and future tax increases are refused.
Then it shows where the weaknesses of both favorites lie.
"I was wrong once," Romney explains in a way and asks the site and the television audience to forgive that he was still responsible for the execution of the losses in 1994.
Giuliani is upset when she is asked to make a literal Bible translation.
The First Civilian Ruler of the Musharaf
On the day following his resignation from the position of chief commander of the army, the Pakistani Prime Minister Mujaraf made a presidential oath.
That's the end of eight years of the military government in Pakistan.
The President of Pakistan, Parviz Musharaf, made a presidential oath on Thursday, and is thus held in the presidential office for another five years.
Pakistan television broadcast a live ceremony that took place in the presidential palace in the capital of Islamabad.
The Musharaf swore he would respect the constitution and strive for the good nation.
At the center of his office, the chief commander of the army handed over to his secretary, Ashfang Kiyanim, who was subjected to international pressure, especially by the United States.
Eight years after the unblooded military coup took power, the former general will rule for the first time as a civilian head of state.
With the resignation of the chief commander of the armed forces, Musharaf met one of the main requirements of the opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is the abolition of the exceptional state that Musharaf declared on 3 November.
According to senior state representative Malik Muhammad Qayyum, Musharaf will cancel the exceptional status soon after his oath, and thus meet other Western requirements.
The Supreme Court of the country, which, following the declaration of exceptional status at the beginning of November, had imposed on it due diligence, rejected all objections last week on the contested re-election of the head of state on 6 October.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed in an attack on a military convoy in the northern region of the tribe and four others were injured.
The speakers said the bomb exploded on the road near the border with Afghanistan.
Father's Crutch is coming back
The famous German group of seventy years is playing again. Three harmonia group members were once again able to understand their electronic synthesizers at the Berlin concert.
The Revival will also include Live 1974, the cover of the most successful band.
They were already much better known abroad.
The announced sensation then lies in the performance of three sitting gentlemen who at first look like they're just enjoying dinner.
Everyone has a box, cables, and especially buttons.
Thirty years old Dieter Moebius in a snow-white shirt sits in the middle.
After his left is seventy-seven years old Michael Rother who has a laptop and a guitar in front of him.
Thirty-seven-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius, who focuses on the synthesizers, is from the right side of the viewers.
Everyone contributes sounds, sometimes even beats.
Sometimes, I'm sure, I don't know, there's a traditional song.
It seems that the gentlemen of the musicians don't mind too much.
Amongst the lovers of the crutch, the Revival of the Chapels of Harmony brought a great deal of dissatisfaction.
One thing here is worth noting. Repeated questions have shown that this name is part of a collective awareness of the pope, but it is certainly not so running as to cause the loss of this chapel for twenty-three years.
But why couldn't even Germany celebrate its still living legends from the 1970s?
And especially when you're a musical style, a misnouncing cryotruck, in England and America, you appreciate more than in your own country.
When in 2003 the music business gave the remaining members of the Can Colin Group the price of Echo for life's work, it was a room full of curious views of German pop fans.
In addition, when Red Hot Chile Peppers thanked the groups La Düsseldorf and Neu!, the savages no longer knew the border.
Michael Rother later at the Red Hot Chili Peppers concerts sat with them on stage as their old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and worshiping abroad is one thing.
With the memory of the Harmonia chapel we overload the memory, this trio existed for only two years, and even at the time far away there was no such influence as others later attributed to them.
Moebius and Roedelius were already playing with artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promised name Cluster.
At first, they played at the Berlin Schaubühne theatre.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons at the Gramophone company led by the church.
Rother briefly helped with the Kraftwerk group, however, he won the title as a guitarist at the Neu band!, which at the time was perhaps the most radical German group.
In 1973, Peter followed the band musicians of Cluster to exile in Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in Old Weserhof, 16th-century ruins, they lived as members of municipalities who fled the city.
They didn't live here as ideologically as in Communion I, where Roedelius could still be robbed as a child.
It was more of a life in such a spitzweg art creature.
The name of the art concerned is allegedly taken from the name of the concert hall of Harmonia Ottenstein, whose mark is allegedly found in the cemetery.
Many of this harmony has been maintained.
The first album was called "Music From Harmony" and the next "De Luxe".
Although their music sounded so calm and modest, the band suffered financial difficulties.
Harvesting was not just self-recognition.
Now the "Live 1974" CD was cut off at a concert in Griessem in front of a record-playing little, barely fifty-six.
Rothera once wished that the members of the Harmony Party would perform and occasionally exercise.
For Roedlia and Moebia it was a completely wrong requirement.
In 1975 the band announced its breakup.
Roger ended up in an esoteric sphere and secured his future with an album "Burning Heart."
The Cluster Chapel has lived again in the 1980s and since then is more successful than when Harmony was.
For the live album from Griessemer, we can be grateful to Herbert Grönemeyer.
His recording company Grönland took the goal of Krautrock to watch as the original German contribution to live music.
The Neu Chapel was then considered Roedeli's solo work.
The physical resurrection of Harmony takes place in the Berlin House of World Cultures.
The performance at the Woldtronics Festival will be publicly sponsored.
There will be Brit, Julian Cope, an old punk and author of the "Krautrock Sampler" manual.
The founder of Love Parade, Dr. Motte, is also involved.
That's what we planned to do with the overall spread of the Krautrock impact on the future pop music.
The empty place of the famous group will be filled with harmony.
Brian Ena, accompanied by the most beautiful sounds, is said in the hall: "The only right music, it belongs to the future."
There are images on which the producer with Harmony is in the agricultural session.
It also contributes to the creation of a legend by featuring other black and white photographs on which are now the devices of the wildebeest connected cables.
Previously, these three veterans were again engaged in improvisation.
I don't stick the microphones on the wires and the drums anymore, so they can get those unheard of self-made tones out of the tools.
Today electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three-in-the-art punctures.
It doesn't change anything. It doesn't change the House of World Culture.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, under the sound of the clouds, he whispers and in one beautiful place he emphatically sings "Aaaaaaaaaa!"
Krautrock was always a very English concept.
It's never been rock.
We would find the roots more than in blues at music schools (Can), in technology (Kraftwerk) or in flight from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
The one who calls this place ''68!' is not so far away from the truth, but harmony is not even allowed to come out of peace now.
Even the most obvious thing on the stage is to think carefully.
Where does music begin and when does it end?
This question is whether a person is prepared for nerves or prefers to experience the moments of unhappiness.
Richard Gere is just not cynical enough
With the introduction of the films The Hunting Party and the Mörderscher Frieden, two films about the war in the Balkans appeared immediately.
But not one of them is convincing.
The motion pictures either put too much emphasis on action and shooting, or are too sensitive.
He won't even stop an actor like Richard Gere.
Good news as first: War criminals Karadz and Mladic are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but right there, in the cloudy background of the Bosnian War, the actor Richard Gere October.
In recent times we have lost sight of this most beautiful man of the 1980s, not only because he played many popular, minor roles in weather women's films, but in conjunction with his press conferences forever on the subject of Buddhism, people will take a taste for another movie with this actor.
And yet Richard Gere is suddenly the most powerful argument for watching The Hunting Party - Where does the hunter become useful (Why must the names of the films be so long and wrapped up today?).
Gere gives a magical performance. His war reporter Simon Hunt is basically the one who could happen to Gere if fate and the film industries weren't so merciful: a man who has his best years long ago, but as anxiously like a memorial, he still retains a certain remarkable character.
But despite this drum, The Hunting Party is together with the German film Mörderischer Frieden, who also enters the cinema this week, just by continuing an endless series of unsuccessful films about the war in the Balkans.
With the film Mörderscher Frieden we can do a short process: This film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save the Serbian girl from a Kosovo shooter, one of them falling in love with her.
Although it is commendable that the Serbs are not represented here as the cause of all evil, this television film changes too soon in shooting and action.
There'll be something much like the Kobru 11 series without the highway, but for that with the war.
In the film The Hunting Party, you can see clearly why the Balkan War has not yet been able to film a really good movie.
The story of the three American war reporters who are dedicated to the "man", the Serbian top war criminal, could become a new "Apocalypse" at another time and under the direction of another director and screenwriter (here both Richard Shepard).
And the two stories are like a wonder; few groups go into the woods to do what the army is not able to do; but their journey will be in the midst of madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of the film The Hunting Party is that Simon Hunt is not the humorous and sentimental cynic represented at the beginning.
On the contrary, the proposal also presupposes a romantic affair with a later Bosnian Muslim murdered.
The Hunting Party's film can be written with final validity after reporters in the last five quick minutes of the film have failed what NATO, the CIA and all the world's criminals have failed in the last five years: catching criminals and leaving him righteous revenge of Bosnian Muslims.
This is so against the logic of filmmaking that it would be worth turning to the International Court of Justice in The Hague.
Then this film has a deep human message.
It considers that Karadz and Mladic are still at large, and suspects Americans and French (there they are exceptionally united) that under secret political agreements they are not being prosecuted quite intensively.
But good and evil are sometimes like that, a woman will attack us with Brecht's famous poem.
It is about the wooden mask of an Asian demon on the work table of the writer: "With compassion I look at the dead living on the forehead, note: how eager it is to be evil."
In films such as The Hunting Party, these are exactly the kind of busy heads that indicate how hard it is to be good.
This problem is not limited to the issue of war in the Balkans.
Recently it was reported in these newspapers that all Hollywood films about Iraq were major failures.
In addition, the only thing that can be added is that no good movie about South Africa has ever been filmed.
It's almost always true: If the star falls through the crisis area or passes through the mine fields, it's a film like the Rangoon with Patricia Arquette, the Angelin Jolie Or the Blutdiamanten with Leonard DiCapire.
Maybe all those conflicts are just too close to time.
Finally, they had to run away for decades before Hollywood could film a good movie about the Holocaust - Schindler's list.
Many films must evidently grow up - films that are considered to be classic Vietnamese works - "Lovers of deer", "Apocalyps" or "Head Vest" - were then not celebrated in any case as master works.
But maybe today, when every mass murder at home appears on two screens right now, we know too much about the conflicts of this world.
The scriptists then do not have the skills needed to make sure that good stories are told.
"To be or not to be" or "Great dictator" became so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how in a terrible way the Nazi regime really ruled.
Maybe a man shouldn't want to be good when he wants to make good movies.
Maybe he has to create a sarcasticly measured artistic view as the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When he was placed on a parallel between his historical novel "Lemprier's Dictionary" and "The Balkan War", he said, "The only thing he likes is that some things never change.
The capitals will always be very dangerous, people will always be killed in a terrible way, and there will always be war in Yugoslavia."
Van Beust is criticizing the rejection of the Olympics
The departure of the mayor from the Summer Olympics in Hamburg has hit a sharp criticism of politics and the economy.
Many still want to fight for the water game.
Von Beust, however, seeks realism in the estimation of chance.
The head of the Chamber of Commerce in Hamburg, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, marked this decision on Wednesday as an "from the point of view of business as unhappy".
No other project has recently aroused as much motivation as the Olympic thought in the city.
"Without this objective, it would not be possible to maintain this sporting political enthusiasm to such a high degree."
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury this project, but to create for it a new long-term concept, "which is based on a changed time plan."
Mayor Ole von Beust stayed in the middle of his earlier statements, according to which the Olympic ambitions of Hamburg were not realistic until at least 2028.
"Not Hamburg, but the German Olympic Sports Union will decide on the Olympic candidacy," Von Beust told the newspaper WELT ONLINE.
He pointed out that at the beginning of December, the Sports Union will decide on the application of Munich to winter games in 2018.
"This preference for us means that we have no realistic chance with a time plan dating back to 2028."
Yet this dream hasn't ended yet, said von Beust.
The Hamburg Sports Union (HSB) marked von Beust's sentences as policing worthy.
He'll realize that Hamburg doesn't want to be held for the next twenty-five years.
"It is too soon to destroy the chance that plans are already being identified as funerals at this early stage," President HSB Günter Ploss said on Wednesday.
The statement of contempt would be contrary to the statement made by the senate chief of the General German High School Sports Association.
Von Beust here did not announce the candidate of Hamburg at the University in 2015 as a reward for organizing the Olympic Games.
The Hamburg High School Sports Association only nominated for the candidate city last week.
The SPD Group in the Hamburg Parliament of the Senate said it was wasting valuable time that could be used to build apartments in Hamburg.
"The development of the Klein Grasbrook area was suspended by the Senate for years because he had set up the Olympics and excluded the building of apartments," said SPD MPs Carol Veit and Jan Quast.
While SPD for the Klein Grassbrook area was still planning the Olympics with the fact that the entire area would later be used for apartment purposes, the CDU unanimously placed itself on the "Olympics Factor".
The launch of the 2012 Summer Olympics sparked great excitement in Hamburg.
But Hamburg's been wasted in Lipsk.
They're not Warhol's boxes.
The person who connects the expressions of Sweden and the wooden beads doesn't mean Andy Warhol, but Ike.
Or is it?
Wooden beads produced at present in Sweden throw on the Warhol’s list of dark shadows.
Most of his list of the 'Brillo Boxes' of Stockholm are falsified.
After several months ago the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" expressed doubts about the authenticity of the Warhols "Brillo Boxes" in 1968, the internal research of the Moderna Museum in Stockholm comes with a result that brought disappointment; six "Brillo Boxes", which in 1995 the Moderna Museum devoted to the gift of its former director Pontus Hultén, are copies - like most of the other "Brillo Boxes" of the Stockholm type, which are on the international art market in circulation.
The previous events are wrapped up, maturing a chain of artistic and curatorial actions.
Warhol produced his first Brillo box in New York in 1964, painted wooden beads that were based on red-blue paper box design of the Brillo powder powder.
His exhibition at Moderna Musseet in 1968 - with Warhol's consent - was conducted by hundreds of Brill's beads from the cardboard. They did not come (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but were delivered directly from the Brill's factory.
It wasn't artistic works, it was their props. It was just exhibition pieces.
Warhol apparently also granted permission in 1968 to produce several wooden Brillo bedens in Sweden, but you are not exposed in Moderna Museum.
Then the witnesses are talking about fifteen poor people who have been legally admitted to art and auction history as authorized origins - "Andy Warhol's Brillo Boxy" with the label Type Stockholm.
Some of them were auctioned for more than $100,000.
The problem now lies in the fact that the legendary director of the Pontus Hultén Museum later falsely claimed that in 1968 it was produced in Sweden and exposed about a hundred poor people who then left Warhol to him.
In fact, 105 Hultens were produced in Malmö for the Petrograd exhibition only in 1990.
At that time Warhol was three years after he died.
Lars Byström, the top conservator of Moderna Musseet, studied in addition to six Brillo boxes that are owned by the museum, also three Brillo boxes from the Swedish private collection, two of which were made in Sweden in 1968 and after their cross-sectional boards were painted in basic color and covered with oil white.
On the other hand, the structure of the 1990 copies revealed that the color was applied to the paint directly on the surface of the paper - it was also acrylic and not oil.
"These poor people have not been authorized by the artist and should be removed from Warhol's official Brillo Boxes," said the director of Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve: "If Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board in New York doesn't come to any other conclusion, Moderna Museet will have to be classified as "exhibital material - copy."
Already in July, the Authentication Board announced that it would deal with these "complaint charges" raised in the case of soap powder boxes.
The organization, however, is still in constant silence.
Rebel soldiers in Manila give up
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers who settled in a hotel in Manila demanded the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroy.
The rebel leader Antonio Trillanes, who was the president of manipulation and corruption in the elections, told the hotel reporters that he refused responsibility for the bloodshed.
The government's surrender soldiers had previously attacked with the imposition of a tear gas on the hotel.
A few hours ago, about two dozen soldiers were trapped in the building.
On Thursday, about half of them stood before the court because of the moderated attempt to overthrow in 2003, including Trillanes.
The union used to run away with about 30 of its fellows.
Soldiers who were supposed to watch him obviously crossed his side and joined in the rebellion.
They entered the Hotel Peninsula and demanded the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroy.
The government of the loyal units closed the area around the selected hotel.
The President approved an urgent meeting of the Security Office.
The National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the actions of the soldiers.
"People have enough," said Triallnes.
"We invite people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, the commander of the former Scout Rangers elite unit, said that other military units will soon join.
Critics of the government called for a major demonstration against the President on Friday.
For months her government has been charged with corruption.
The Manila financial area had already become the main cause of the rebellion against Arroy in 2003.
Because the rebels refused to join the army, the rebellion lasted for a few 24 hours.
Since 1986, at least seven attempts have been made to overthrow the democratically elected government in the Philippines.
United Internet company becomes the majority shareholder of Versatel
United Internet in the telecommunications company Versatel secured more than 20% of its share.
The company announced on Wednesday that the average price for the share is EUR 14.46.
The company now owns 20,05 % of the basic share capital.
It's been speculated about taking over before.
The company is still counting with the possibility of further increasing its share in Versatale.
The United Internet has announced that this step is seeking to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL market.
After the Bank of Berenberg increased its share in this Düsseldorf network operator by another 5 % to 15,1 %, the entry agreement appeared on Wednesday.
On the financial market, it is said that this financial institution holds shares only for the third party.
Yesterday, the United Internet had a 10% share in Drillisch, which is the provider of mobile telecommunications networks.
As part of the capital increase, Drillisch sold another 17.4 million new shares worth EUR 106.4 million.
Of these, 5.15 million shares were purchased by the United Internet for EUR 31.4 million.
The companies discussed marketing cooperation in the area of DSL products and mobile networks.
"We are strengthening our partnership," explained the United Internet speaker.
For the purpose of taking over the Freenet, the companies together set up a joint SME.
On Thursday, the United Internet announced that both companies in Freenet would for the time being be satisfied with a share of more than 10% and would not exercise their right to take over another 18,49% of this company.
It is considered that companies are still keeping all options open, especially the possibility to further increase their share in Freenet AG.
The discussions between the United Internet and the Freenet on the strategic partnership were concluded in mid-November.
This long-standing and difficult-to-transparent Freenet game has been part of the consolidation of the German telecommunications market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million mobile customers and 1.27 million customers with a complete or DSL connection.
Holding United Internet and Drillische so far held 6.01% share in Freenet.
It has now been agreed that Drillisch will receive about 4 % more.
The right to buy 18,49 % of the investment company Vatas was already agreed in August.
