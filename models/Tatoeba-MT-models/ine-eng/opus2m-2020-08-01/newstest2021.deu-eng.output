Mammary: Corona-mass infection: 174 harvesters
After a Corona mass infection on a large vegetable garden in the Lower Bavarian Mamming, almost 500 people are under quarantine and must no longer leave the farm.
A security service oversees the exit ban.
A total of 174 harvesters were tested positively during the series investigation on the Corona Erreger Sars-CoV-2, as reported by the Dingolfing-Landau Landau County Council on Saturday evening.
"In order to avoid further proliferation, we have to take this step to protect the population unfortunately," said Landrat Werner Bumeder (CSU).
Previously, seven workers had already been infected in the holding - this was the cause of the series test.
The farm is a large vegetable garden, the strawberries, cucumbers, coal and red beet grown - but the barley only for depositary glasses.
Mamming is a rural municipality with a population of 3300 near Dingolfing with its large BMW work.
Bumeder urged the citizens to keep quiet: "It is, according to our information, a closed circle of persons".
Infected by uninfected personnel were separated on the court, the site is now surrounded by a barrier.
Greens and SPDs were co-responsive to the government.
The two opposition groups, President Markus Söder (CSU) and his cabinet, proposed to neglect the control of seasonal workers' accommodation.
"This can be true if such local infections occur and regional lockdowns have to be arranged," said Jürgen Mistol, the parliamentary manager of the Greens.
This is similar to the SPD: "After the Corona outbreak in the Wiesenhof-Schlachthof in mid-May we have already requested a special control programme for farms with harvesters," said environmental expert Florian von Brunn.
"The health conditions at the workplace and living conditions must be strictly controlled in our view.
This has obviously not happened."
The explosion came "with ansage".
Aidenbachstraße Metro Station: Dangerous dispute: 19-year-old falls into the Gleisbed after Schubser
In a dispute between two youth groups at the Aidenbachstraße Metro Station, a 19-year-old fell by a shoemaker and was taken to bed.
Overersendling - On Friday it came to a dispute between two youth groups at the Aidenbachstraße Metro Station at 4.15 p.m.
A passerby alerted the police who pulled several strips.
According to the first findings, a Municher (17) pushed a 19-year-old to the ground.
The young man ran across the railway station and fell into the bed.
People from the 17-year-old group helped the disabled climb out of the brick.
There was no danger through an invading train.
As the police reported, there was further disagreements between the two parties.
The 17-year-old fled from the Tabor first, but his staff were able to be identified later.
With his father, he joined the police inspectorate 29.
The 17-year-olds are identified for body injury.
Report: Seehofer insists on longer storage data
The storage data is currently suspended.
However, after a media report, Federal Minister Horst Seehofer calls for an extension of the time limit.
He wants to strengthen the fight against child abuse.
Federal Interior Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU) asks for an extended storage of stock data after a media report - instead of the 10 weeks scheduled for a half year.
As the "Image on Sunday" reports, Seehofer asked Minister of Justice Christine Lambrecht (SPD) in a letter for a quick amendment.
Seahofer therefore wants to strengthen measures against child abuse.
He thinks it makes sense to "make the necessary adjustments in the law now", the newspaper quoted from the letter.
The storage data is currently suspended.
A decision by the EuGH is expected.
Seehofer, however, wants the amendments to be applied immediately after a possible positive judgment, the report continues.
A spokesperson for the Ministry of Justice said that it was only reasonable to examine whether legal adjustments were necessary if the courts had decided.
In the fight against child abuse and child pornography, Seehofer, together with the domestic ministers of the countries, had already spoken for a stockpiling of data in June.
NBA: Strip club Erger for Clippers-Star Lou Williams
A riot in the NBA!
Lou Williams (33), basketball pro of the Los Angeles Clippers, is supposed to leave the tournament neighborhood in Disney World in Orlando/Florida with permission for a graduation.
According to U.S. media reports, he visited the Magic City strip club in Atlanta at night.
Williams, who should have given the visit according to ESPN data, is again in isolation, is tested daily on Covid-19.
His reason for the visit: Chicken Wings.
In February last year "Sweet Lou", as he is called in the NBA, has already expressed his love for these waves.
The American wrote: "Magic City and Blue Flame (another strip club in Atlanta, Anm. d. R.) have the best waves in the city".
NBA-Insider Shams Charania announced on Sunday at Twitter that NBA Williams had arranged a ten-day quarantine.
This way the Clippers star misses the first two official parties after the test game phase.
In Disney World, the NBA wants to play the Crown season.
At present, the best 22 teams with training games are preparing for the season finals starting on Friday night.
Söder expresses himself after mass infection to the coronation position
Munich - Minister of Health Melanie Huml (CSU) has already announced a substance substance for large farms on Sunday.
The press conference will be seen live on our homepage.
The case in Mamming in Dingolfing-Landau County has frightened authorities and politicians.
Almost 500 harvest workers from several countries are currently working on the large vegetable farm, over a third of which has been infected with the Corona breeder.
The court is currently under quarantine and is locked up with a building.
No one can leave the land, food is delivered.
The good 3300 inhabitants of the municipality now offer free corona tests.
Since the harvesters had little contact with the local population, the Land Council has so far assumed that the infections have not spread beyond the court.
"Wisdom bisse": the confession of the false founder of Nantes
"My mandate has been cooperative," said counsel Quentin Chabert of the newspaper.
The defender added: "He is very sorry for the deeds, the confession was a liberation for him".
His mandate has been "prescribed by the bees of conscience and taken very seriously by the extent of destruction".
In the event of a conviction, the man is threatened by ten years of imprisonment and a fine of 150,000 euros.
The Gothic St. Peter and Paul Cathedral in Nantes was badly damaged last Saturday night by a fire.
The fire broke out in three distant places in the church.
Laboratory investigations have intensified the suspicion of firefighting.
The suspect now arrested had already been arrested a few hours after the fire.
But after a day he was released.
The man worked as a volunteer for the Diocese of Nantes and was responsible for the closure of the cathedral on the eve of the fire.
Since there was no sign of a violent entry into the church, he rushed quickly to the field of view of the investigator.
Discussion on the abolition of the 50+1 rule
Former DFB President Reinhard Grindel has recommended that we consider the abolition of the 50+1 rule.
"The German football should at least discuss setting conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission can come up with full facts," said the "Image on Sunday".
He stressed: "For the associations that can be most dangerous to the first Bayern and Dortmund, the 50+1 rules certainly do not work: see Leipzig or Leverkusen.
In this respect, the debate cannot be examined as to whether it is not recommended that associations which want to break into this phalanx should facilitate the inclusion of investors."
However, he has doubts whether there is a willingness in the German Football League to allow majority participations prohibited in the Federal League by the 50+1 rule.
"There is still a legal risk of attracting the Bundesliga business location in a European internal market," Grindel said.
The former DFB leader sees the danger that "the attempts to ensure more competitive balance in the federal league will, in the end, only weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs at European level, but not lead to more tension in the championship".
Even a flat-rate distribution of TV money will not have a decisive effect.
"The FC Bayern makes sales of 750 million euros, Borussia Dortmund of 500 million and RB Leipzig of 300 million.
So the differences are already huge among the first three associations.
The other 15 associations have an average budget of 130 million," said the 58-year-old.
Looking at the past, Grindel feels betrayed.
"Unfortunately, there were people who noticed this error and went through the press instead of addressing me," Grindel said about the adoption of a expensive watch that had led to his resignation in April 2019.
"That's what I've been busy with."
The gift worth about 11,000 euros was received by a Ukrainian official.
"I have committed a violation of compliance, and it was right to draw the consequences from it," Grindel said.
"With the ominous watch gift, I am completely transparent and Argloss.
Many in the DFB knew about it."
He never "made a cure from the gift," assured the 58-year-old.
"This may be called naïve, however this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption."
"Black Lives Matter": injured and a dead
The protests against police violence in the United States have again seen the use of federal police by Donald Trump in several cities.

There was also a window in the courthouse and a fire was placed, as the police reported.
Investigations have been undertaken.
Rakoczy in Bad Kissingen: Historic costumes meet Corona
Although the great saw in Kurstadt was missing, visitors and performers enjoyed the Rakoczy flair of the alternative program.
It was unusual for visitors, performers and organizers: the Rakoczy weekend without Rakoczy festival.
But: Even if the large parties in the city were missing, the masses of people and program heights such as Saale, Rakoczy ball or fortress, many came at their expense in the Corona-conformed alternative program.
"I think we have managed to spread Rakoczy-Flair," says Kurd Director Sylvie Thormann.
The guests would have taken it well.
In principle, you go back to the beginnings of the Rakoczy festival, and only the historians stood in the focus of the festival.
A pleasant atmosphere
Vesna Konhäuser has been visiting the Rakoczy-Fest Bad Kissingen with her husband for more than 25 years.
So is this time in the Corona year.
The couple has been accommodated at the Luitpold Casino, observing the historians when flaning and listening to Cuban live music at the gaming bank restaurant.

They miss the masses of people who otherwise don't belong to Rakoczy.
However, you miss the usual program highlights, all ahead of the hall is burning on Friday evening as well as the historic fortress and the final fireworks on Sunday evening.
"That's too bad.
The weather would have been great this year," she says.
Rakoczy Reitturner to take place again
In part, the alternative programme meant more work for the representatives of the historical curators.
For example, Christina Gold, who participates in a normal year at the fortress and is seen there on the corner of the Kurgartencafe.
This year she was on her way to the town on Saturday and Sunday in costume.
"That's already more intense, or we'll have it easier," she says.
The club had less to do, even though individual riders were on their way to the park.
"We very much hope that the riding quadrille can take place again next year," says Ulrike Waldhofen.
She announced that after a few years' break 2021 there would be a Rakoczy riding tournament again.

Cycling professor Tony Martin: Career continuation possible
Time travel specialist Tony Martin is thinking about a continuation of his career.
Frankfurt/Main - The seven-time timer Tony Martin can imagine continuing his cycling career.
"I'm just going through the framework with the team, how and in what form it could go on," said the 35-year-old of the "Frankfurt General Sunday News".
Martin was currently employed by the Dutch team Jumbo-Visma and had considered ending his career after this year before the Corona break.
In the negotiations with his team, it was also about the number of pension days, he said.
Or about other problems that would hurt him as a family father, Martin said.

Argentina rejects the offer of creditors
The new demands could not be met, the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Buenos Aires announced on Saturday.
"This would not only be irresponsible, but also unfair," said one opinion.
"While 50 percent of children live in poverty in Argentina, we cannot increase the short-term profits of our creditors".
The debt of the second largest economy in South America is no longer bearable under the current conditions.
Therefore, Argentina calls on its private creditors to give up some of its claims of about US$66 billion (about EUR 59 billion).
If there is no agreement, the country is again threatened by the State.
It would be the ninth payout in the Argentine history.
Finally, the creditors had demanded higher interest on State bonds and changes to some contractual clauses.
However, the Argentine Government remains firm on its last offer and is ready to no further concessions.
Argentina faces a serious financial and economic crisis.
The last inflation rate was more than 50 percent.
For the current year, experts estimate a fall in economic power by about 10 percent.
At the end of May, Argentina had not made interest payments of $503 million and was therefore in a limited amount of payment.
Professional arrival - not yet private
"It's going great" - this is what Dr. Stefanie Kramer pulls after her first days in the Notariat in Eggenfelden.
At the end, everything went very quickly: in mid-May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer learned that she would be the successor of Lutz Fielder in the Egg Field.
Six weeks later, at the beginning of July, the promoted lawyers took up the work, which is the normal daily business long on full tours.
"However, I still have to get to the private place," she explains in conversation with the Rotteller Adverter and laughs.
Of course, the short run has not been able to move Regensburg's food point completely to egg fields, reports the native Dingolingerin.
Currently, she and her husband, who is in Regensburg as a judge at the Land Court, are looking for a suitable apartment or house in the city.
At least her husband has been able to apply for a short period of parental leave in order to ensure the care of both daughters (31⁄2 and 111⁄2 years old).
In order not to have to spend every day from Regensburg, they sometimes also have a stay with their parents in Dingolfing, the 39-year-old explains.
Grown up in the neighbourhood, you are of course a long way from the town of Eggenfelden.
When visiting the site with her family in the past months, she recently discovered: "Eggenfelden is a pretty little town".
More and more she was pleased that she had made the race in the selection process around the free place.
Also in Dr. Stefanie Kramer's professional career, her home in Niederbayern plays a central role: after the Jura study in Passau she gave up her reference period and the second state exam in Regensburg.
After several stations as notarassessorin, including in Rehau and Hof in Oberfranken, Babenhausen im Unterallgäu and Regensburg - at that time she was also "in addition" to the promotion in labour law - in 2012 she took her first place as notarin in Rotthalmünster in the district of Passau.
In 2016 she left in parental time, and eventually moved to Regensburg.
Since then, she has taken over representation services at various notaries.
When the place in Eggenfields was written out because of Lutz Feller's imminent rest, she saw the right time for the full professional reentry, explains 39-year-olds.
The team of her predecessor, who will take over the vacation representation in the notary station, has taken over Dr. Stefanie Kramer completely - and at the same time has a praise for the staff of the office ready: "It's going great!"
The fact that she can rely on recorded runs here makes it easier for her to take care of the upcoming movement of the private food point.
In the case of children's garden- and crippling sites, she has already contacted a local facility.
And if everything fits as much as she wants, she hopes to be able to get to know her hobby as soon as possible - and get to know the most beautiful jogging tracks in the red valley.
BVB plans to start a league with a maximum of 15,000 spectators
Dortmund The largest German football stadium in Dortmund will not even be filled to 20 percent for the start of the season in the case of a fan return.
"Because of the distance regulation that is mandatory to observe, we plan to have 12,000 to 15,000 viewers at present," said Borussia Dortmund's Managing Director Carsten Cramer to the "day mirror".
Usually, the Arena in the Riviera City holds over 81,000 spectators at Bundesliga games.
In the last season's spirit games caused by the Corona pandemic, the BVB lost about four million euros per party.
The Cramer, responsible for marketing, digitisation and internationalisation, hopes that in addition to the normal sightseeing sites, some of the approximately 4,000 places in the hospitality area can be reopened: "Of course, it is a blow to the office if these revenues are completely removed".
In view of the ongoing Corona crisis, all are now "well advised to take a stable side length for the first time".
"If many companies are not good and 6.8 million people are alone in short work in Germany, then the need for entertainment is limited," Cramer said.
The Dortmunder Marketing-Chief praised the BVB-Professors for their pay-share waiver, which is intended to contribute to the overhaul of the crisis: "Of course, the players know that their pay-out has a different effect than when we put 100 people working in merchandise."
Changing Wonders: Early life start with a few hundred grams
Hardly more difficult than a packerl butter, just three essloffel blood in his entire body: it was Gabriel when he was born - he weighed exactly 273 grams.
The bubble is one of about 400 mornings that are provided at the Grazer Children's Clinic annually.
A quarter of them weigh less than 1,500 grams, a few – like Gabriel and his brothers Raphael and Michael – are extreme lightweight weights with not even a kilogram of birth weight.
They are born so small and so early that neither lung nor intestine nor muscles are fully trained.
Her skin is sometimes so thin that they could damage the electrodes of an ECG.
And they are so small that they wear occasionally doll clothes and especially mini-tapes made for them.
But not so small that they wouldn't be with a voice - "and like," smackled Berndt Urlesberger.
"Even if of course they don't scream as loud as big babies."
When the Whiteboard becomes the stage
Despite Corona Theater in the classroom: The Whiteboard as a stage experienced the 9th class of the St James Gymnasium in Abtsgmünd shortly before the start of the holiday.
Artist Julia Sylvester from the theatre of the city of Aalen presented the students with the production "The Home Dress" – and by video.
Afterwards, students and students could exchange with the actress and director Winfried Tobias on the play and performance.
The idea for the performance format from the current corona situation was born.
Teacher Teresa Nar was pleased with the expansion of the teaching.
Even though all the participants agreed that the direct meeting in the theatre and stage room would offer additional travel, the theatre also shows the potential for contact in schools.
"If we continue to improve the technical framework, this could be an interesting addition to the gaming industry," stressed director Winfried Tobias.
First round released: The TSV 1860 would meet at the DFB Pokal at the event in Frankfurt
Should the TSV 1860 qualify for the DFB Pokal, the lions meet in the first round at Frankfurt.
This resulted in the release on Sunday.
Munich - Sixty possible opponents are stuck in the first round of the DFB Pokal.
The lions would meet at Frankfurt's entrance with a successful qualification.

Because because of the Corona pandemic the field of participation is not yet complete, space holders came into use when disengaged.
The TSV 1860 is already at the end of the Bavarian Toto Pokal (September 4th or 5th) due to the voluntary refusal of half-final opponent FC Memmingen.
There the lions meet either at the Würzburger Kickers or Victoria Aschapenburg.
If Würzburg's secondary climber reached the finish, sixty would already be qualified for the first round in the DFB Pokal.
Otherwise, the Giesinger had to carry out in the final game against Regional Ligist Ascharchenburg.
The first round of the DFB podium will take place between 11 and 14 September and a week before the start of the Trittliga.
"From the wind": film legend Olivia de Havilland is dead
The film legend and Oscar winner Olivia de Havilland is dead.
She died on Sunday in Paris with 104 years of natural death, confirmed her spokesman for the German Press Agency.
The Havilland was known for its role as Melanie Hamilton in the southern state of "From Wind" (1939).

The film was under the title "Motherherz" in Germany.
Three years later, the award came as the best actress in William Wyler's "The Heirness" (The Heritage).
A lot of recognition was also given to her as a neurotic eccentrician in "The Dark Mirror" and "The Snake Cave".
Daphne du Maurier proposed her role in filming her novel "My Princess Rachel" in 1952.
The piece was a global success.
With her long-term girlfriend, Bette Davis, she played in "Wivegenlied for a Body".
From marriage to writer Marcus Goodrich (1946 to 1953), the son of Benjamin emerged.

Kalbitz draft confirmed from AfD - FDP speaks of "Feigenblatt"
The exclusion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is in the view of the FDP only a "fiegenblat" and does not change the character of the party.
"The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the legal extremities in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the peak of the iceberg of radicals in the AfD," said FDP internal politician Benjamin Strasser of the news agency dpa in Berlin.
The Federal Court of Justice of the AfD had confirmed on Saturday in Stuttgart after several hours of negotiations the exclusion of Kalbitz, which the Federal Court had decided by majority in May.
Kalbitz is chairman of the AfD Group in Brandenburg Landtag.
"If the AfD really were going to remove right-wing extremists consistently from their party, officials like Björn Höcke and his followers would have been excluded for a long time," Strasser said.
"There is, however, no political will in the AfD because law extremism is currently part of the party".
Similarly, CSU Secretary General Markus Blume said: "That Andreas Kalbitz is now excluded, says nothing and changes nothing," he said to the "World on Sunday".
"It speaks mostly of bands, as many French supporters still have a right-wing extremist in the middle of the AfD."
Flower assumes that the AfD will land again under five percent in elections in the future.
"The days of the AfD in Parliament are counted".
Kalbitz was one of the words of the now officially dissolved "flights" around the Thuringia President Björn Höcke of the AfD and the Group; the protection of the Constitution marks the process as "a secure right-wing extremist effort".
In May, the AfD Federal Chief of Staff threw Kalbitz out of the party.
As a reason he claimed that Kalbitz had not indicated an earlier membership in the currently prohibited legal extreme "Heimattreuen Deutschen Jugend" (HDJ) and the Republicans at his party's entry.
Kalbitz disputes membership in the HDJ.
Also, the president of the Left Group in Brandenburg Landtag, Sebastian Walter, stressed that the Federal Court's decision does not change the nature of the AfD: "The Wolf has only fried Creed.
The AfD remains a right-wing party, whether with or without calbitz".
Neither will this decision weaken the Federal Party nor the right wing.
"The manoeuvre of the Meuthen-Truppe is transparent.
You want to get further observation through constitutional protection and try to get through the radar," Walter said.
"The AfD will not run away the spirits that called her.
A draft does not change yet," said SPD Secretary-General Erik Stohn in the Kalbitz case.
"This is where the AfD and the Group held their right leader."
The legal dispute over Kalbitz's membership in the AfD will continue.
He announced on Saturday that he will now act in civil law against the decision of the Federal Court of Justice.
North Sea Windparks deliver good 21 percent more electricity
In the first six months of the year 11,51 terawatthours of electricity entered the network.
These are good 21 percent more than in the same period of the previous year, the network operator Tennet shared in Bayreuth.
Tennet is responsible for the transmission of the North Sea current to mainland and the transmission through the German electricity network.
The windlass on the Baltic Sea, which are not part of the Tennet network area, have consumed another 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity.
Overall, the wind current from the North and the Baltic Sea comes to 13.73 TWh, compared to good 11.64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
The winds on the lake thus account for almost 19 percent of the total wind current in Germany; these are about four percentage points more than a year ago.
New wind parks provide higher production capacity
The increased contribution of offshore wind energy is seen in addition to wind conditions from higher production capacities, as new wind parks have been online in the last 12 months.
If the 1270 windworks in the North Sea were all running at the same time with full power, they could generate a 6.7 gigawatt power.
The transmission capacity is sufficient; it is based on tennet at 7.1 gigawatt.
By 2030 it will rise to 17 gigawatts in the German North Sea.
"In Germany and the Netherlands we are investing up to 20 billion euros in the expansion of offshore network connections," said Tennet businessman Tim Meyerjürgens.
In reality, wind parks can't even use their capacity at sea, but reach about 40 percent.
The record day this year is January 2nd, when the North Sea Windparks generated more than six gigawatt power.
On average, the North Sea Windwheels produce about 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatt power, corresponding to three to four nuclear power plants.
This could provide nearly seven million households with electricity.
Art "Skirmish" - an exhibition by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold in the Gallery of the Kunstvereins.
It was almost a little anniversary celebration at 130.
Birthday of the Gmünder Kunstverein: The exhibition opening "Skirmish" with works by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold jumped the usual frame after the Corona break.
Much more art friends than usual followed the dialogue between the artist and the president of the art association, Professor Dr. Klaus Ripper.

In the north of the gallery, the club "Sandtogether" was involved.
Free: Windbergfest for crown cancelled
The Windberg festival is not taking place this year.
The city of Freital canceled the three-day festival planned in September.
In other years more than 30,000 people had visited this city party.
"We have certainly not made this decision easy, and - in consciousness, how difficult it is for the participants - to hope for the last minute," said Mayor Uwe Rumberg (partileos).
"But finally, we are responsible for the health of many thousands of people here."
Because if tens of thousands of people were forced into the fortress and the fortress, minimum conditions, hygiene rules and a follow-up of contact could not have been complied with in accordance with the current Corona Protection Regulation.
Or the restrictions would have been so strong that not much would have been left of a folk festival.
In addition, organizational and monitoring efforts would increase disproportionately by a multiple.
Rumberg voted in favour next year.
The city of Freital celebrates its 100-year-old existence, among other things, with the winter festival from 7 to 9 May 2021 and the day of the Sachsen from 10 to 12 September 2021.

Future more airplanes in Worms
The Wormser University goes on to the air: The "DFS German Aviation Safety" is founded by a professor for "Air Traffic Management".
A corresponding contract between the university and the DFS has now been signed in Worms.
The contract was first concluded for three years and started in 2021.
With the professor, there is the opportunity to start the study not only in the summer but also in the winter semester.
This allows students to be trained twice as many as they have ever been.
At the same time, the capacity of both the university and the Air Safety Academy of the DFS are equally charged.
The DFS will advise the university on the establishment and occupation of the professor.
represented at the university since 2019
Since the summer of 2019, the first students have been trained to fly at the Worms University in the Air Traffic Management course.
This year, nine students started.
So far, the experience of the DFS is very positive, the performance of the students is excellent.
The combination of study and Lotsen training contributes significantly to further increasing the attractiveness of the Lotsen profession.
"In these times, the promotion is not easy for us economically.
However, we firmly expect that air transport will recover and grow again in the long term.
In order to fulfill our statutory mandate in the future, we need highly qualified staff," says Professor Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, CEO of the DFS when signing the contract.
"For the DFS, the Foundation's professorship is a future-proof investment, which will provide aircraft long-term a broad, technically transcendent knowledge base.
We therefore continue to cooperate well with the university and at the same time undermine our attractiveness as an employer".
Professor Jens Hermsdorf, President of the University of Worms, also stresses this: "The foundation professorship is an important bridge between science and the economy.
With it we would like to connect the existing cooperation with the DFS German Aviation Safety as a practical partner for the dual bachelor study Air Traffic Management".
The trust of the German Aviation Insurance is also an obligation for the University of Worms to further develop their teaching and research skills in the future fields of air transport.
In the use of tomorrow's airships, the university with its first foundation professor for a dual course of study could place very special highlights and innovative focus on its students.
Dr. Denis Alt, State Secretary of the Ministry of Science, Further Education and Culture, emphasizes: "The University of Worms has a single setting feature in the field of air transport in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Today's signing of the cooperation agreement strengthens the profile of the university."
Rescue helicopter landing on A 45
About 30 minutes the A 45 motorway was completely blocked on Saturday afternoon towards Aschapenburg, as after a traffic accident the rescue screwdriver was in use.
A 76-year-old drove with a Ford at 12.40 p.m. in the Alzenau-Mitte exit in the curve and landed at the guideboard.
As a result, the front airbags broke out, the driver suffered slight injuries in the face and had to be brought to a hospital for treatment.
The injuries of the 72-year-old driver were provided by the doctor and the patient was rushed to a hospital with the rescue screwdriver.
At present, however, the police assume that there is no risk of life.
The damaged vehicle, which caused damage of around 2000 euros, had to be removed.
Heil wants to examine other sectors according to the meat industry
The Corona crisis brought the conditions to light again in parts of the meat industry.
Law intensifications are just ahead.
But they are righteous - and will they abide therein?
Federal Labour Minister Hubertus Heil (SPD) wants to review other sectors in accordance with the strict rules currently planned against meat industry irregularities.
"We will look at industry for industry and then take appropriate measures for each industry if necessary," said Heil of the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Germany's employer already warns against limiting general labour contracts.
After the massive Corona outbreak at the Flesh Rise Tonnies in Nordrhein-Westfalen, the Federal Cabinet wants to pass a Heil Act this Wednesday.
Major slaughterhouses should no longer be allowed to employ foreign personnel in the case of slaughter, slaughter and meat processing.
In this respect, the use of workers and loan workers should be prohibited there.
Employers' President Ingo Kramer said: "Finger away from a general restriction on labour contracts and employee redundancy if you do not want to completely overthrow the economy".
For example, works contracts are the basis for the wide range of craft, construction and plant construction.
"The shortcomings of individuals cannot destroy such an important instrument".
Heil said: "My aim is not to prohibit work contracts anywhere in the German economy".
Work contracts are meaningful.
"If an industrial company orders a craftsman to build a safety system, this is a very normal work contract".
The German meat industry considers a ban on works contracts and loan work to be contrary to the Constitution in its industry.
It is not possible to explain why cheese is to be used in the future as a legal basis other than for Wurst, as the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Saturday) reports.
In the event of a ban, the consumer price would increase by 10 to 20 percent per kilo and product.
Many Eastern European workers from the labour market worked in the industry for 16 hours a day following the results of an examination of the NRW Employment Protection Administration.
Often they didn't have a break.
Wages were reserved for protective equipment or rent.
It was also found that the situation in the accommodation of workers was often miserable.
Heil said that a relatively strict law had already entered into force for the meat industry in 2017.
But through "trike constructions" these have been handled.
"Now it's essential to clean up."
The politician announced: "In the Labour Protection Act, which we want to decide at the end of July in the cabinet, there are also measures which not only concern the meat industry - for example, higher rates of checks on labour protection or clear criteria for Community housing".
The present draft includes amendments to the Law on the Protection of the Rights of Workers in the Meat Economy and the Labour Protection Act.
Brandenburg's Minister of Consumer Protection Ursula Nonnemacher (Grüne) has increased controls necessary.
"I would like us to be able to carry out even more controls in many areas of supervision: food controls, animal protection, everything possible, such as animal transport," Nonnemacher said on Sunday in the RBB broadcast "Brandenburg now".
However, more staffing are also needed for more controls.
Three deaths in the crash of ultralight aircraft in Germany
When an ultralight aircraft crashed into a multi-family house in Wesel in the German federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia, three people died, according to the police.
A child was easily injured.
Two more people have been injured in the accident, said one speaker at the Wesel circuit management.

Juventus Turin Master in Italy
Turin - After a liberating door by Cristiano Ronaldo, the record champion Juventus Turin won the Italian championship for the ninth time in the series.
The team around the five-time world footballer made the total 36. Scudto of association history perfect with a 2:0 (1:0) on Sunday night at home against Sampdoria Genoa.
Ronaldo met at 1:0 before noon.
With 83 points, Turin, without the last long injured former national player Sami Khedira, is no longer able to push out of space two days before the season end of the series A.
The table range Inter Milan is back to seven points.
In spite of optical superiority in the first half of the time, Ronaldo met after a release with the last action.
One example of Miralem Pjanic was the 35-year-old who earned a flat shot from the fine line (45.+7).
Against the now offensive guests Ronaldo was also involved at 2:0, after his shot Federico Bernardeschi (67th) dusted off.
This ensured the smooth, but decisive success.
In the 89th minute, only Ronaldo should have been right to take a look at the Torjäger rating.
"It is complicated to stay mentally and physically at ball height for 90 minutes.
The games are rare, and the moment changes very easily," said Coach Maurizio Sarri after 1:2 at Udinese Calcio on Thursday.
Above all, the spiritual recovery of his players is great, said the Juve coach.
Because of the defeat, the Turiners had not yet been able to make the championship perfect.
Finally, Juve had to give thanks to the weakness of the competitors in the table at the end of the table.
Because in the eleven parties before the game on Sunday, the Sarri team only won five victories.
If Ronaldo's still gonna be a tortoise king, he's curious.
During the Portuguese Superstar reached 31 gates, the former Dortmund Ciro Immobile has already met 34 hits on his account at 5:1 (1:1) of Lazio Rome's fourth table at Hellas Verona - as many as Robert Lewandowski contributed to the FC Bayern's title win.
The record in Italy is held by the current Juve-Profi Gonzalo Higuaín.
In the 2015/2016 season, the Argentinean reached 36 gates for the SSC Naples.
In August, the next title opportunity awaits the "Old Lady" of the Italian football.
Juventus is in the eighth final of the Champions League, but on August 7th against the Olympic Lyons, he has to compete with a 0:1-in-play to reach the final tournament in Lisbon.
In the next K.o.-round, Real Madrid or Manchester City would wait as an opponent.
Baden-Württemberg: Over 250 illegal authors recorded
Stuttgart - All of the penalties and court decisions are still being imposed on drivers in countless illegal races on the Baden-Württemberg streets, Gas: Last year and the first four months of this year, the police have already registered more than 250 illegal authors in the southwest.
There are no comparisons for the previous years, but the racers are making the judicial authorities more and more work: in 2018, a total of 155 investigation procedures were conducted for illegal races, a year later there were 252 and in the current year until the beginning of June 151.
In the race, there were fewer organized events, as the Ministry of the Interior replied to a request from the Landtag SPD.
In most cases, the drivers were spontaneous or had taken the escape from the police - this is also seen as an illegal race.
In particular, German men between the ages of 18 and 60 sat at the tax.
113 Penalties - 15 times imprisonment
Only in a few cases will the racers be recovered and also asked for cash: According to the Ministry of the Interior, a total of 113 fines have been suspended since 2018 and 15 sentences have been pronounced.
However, there is no indication that the number of illegal authors actually increases.
Rather, other drivers reacted more sensitively than before because of the many tragic accidents and processes of past years and showed more frequent signs, said one minister.
Especially popular in Rasern is the highway 8. Car drivers always brake out there again to provide space and use the free course for a race.
Last August, a dozen drivers were acquired near Kirchheim under Teck, three months before there were even 18 drivers at the A8 in Merkellingen.
A81 is the most popular racetrack
On the A81, the police even register more races than on any other federal highway.
With a Tempolimite there is an attempt to break the breeder on the particularly affected section between the branches and the stalks.
Most of the high-priced and high-quality sports and luxury cars often have Swiss features because the drivers deviate from the race to Germany due to the high penalties for too fast driving and authors in the neighbouring country.
For the SPD, the Tempolimit cannot be reduced to a few lines: "With a general Tempolimit of 130 hours we would create this problem on motorways from the body," says Martin River, transport expert of the SPD Landtags fraction.
"The obstacle wave for racers would be significantly higher if you weren't allowed to be legal here and there with 200 kilometers of time and more on the way."
From education or image campaigns, River is less: "He who puts himself in such a way over all the rules and not only his own life, but also the life of other transporters, is hardly yet in reach with reason".
ADAC calls for stronger police intervention
On the other hand, the ADAC is not enough: "We assume that breeders are not afraid of the Tempomites," says Holger Bach, Head of Transport and Environment at ADAC Württemberg.
It calls for additional and also more stringent controls on the routes concerned.
It is not uncommon to experience the most painful and serious consequences of the high-speed force: from January 2019 to April 2020, three people died in the races, two of which were not involved in a nightly crash in Stuttgart's city centre and one in Gerlingen.
In November, two young men were to deliver an author.
One of the vehicles came from the street, rolled up against a garden wall and stayed on the side, the 18-year-old driver died.
21 other people have been injured in the race of the past two years.
However, in the opinion of Interior Minister Thomas Strobl, more severe penalties are not necessary: "The legal need to punish illegal motor vehicles is not seen," says the Ministry of Interior paper.

Ackermann sprints for victory at the final stage at Sibiu Tour
Radprofi Pascal Ackermann won his second day victory at the final stage of the 10th Sibiu Tour.
The 26-year-old Pälzer from the Bora-hansgrohe team spent the 109 kilometers long section with start and goal in Hermannstadt in mass print after winning a stage on Saturday.
It was the season victory three and four for Ackermann.
In the overall evaluation, his Austrian teammate Gregor Mühlberger went through.
The 26-year-old had decided, on the morning of the day, to take over the mountain time for himself and thus to take over the top of the class.
Only 104 drivers attended the final stage at night.
No less than 18 launchers had fallen victim to the time limit during the mountain season.
"I'm really happy to start the season restart with a victory," said Ackermann after his success on Saturday.
"The Sprint was really hectic," said the 26-year-old.
300 meters ahead of the target he just drew his sprint, "and it also fits perfectly".
According to the rules of the World Association UCI, a corona test was carried out with all participants and their associates six days before the start of the race.
During the complete tour, drivers and attendants were separated from the organization team and from the media in isolated hygiene bubbles.
Observers at start and target were not allowed.

Nuremberg: Unapproved Tuning Meeting - Police take over 700 vehicles and around 1100 people
Hundreds of cars and temporarily over 1,000 people participated on Saturday at a "tuning meeting" on the parking lot of a furniture house.
The police set up their announcement to strengthen the control of such events.
A large Tuning meeting took place in Nuremberg South City on Saturday (July 25, 2020).
Several hundred vehicles were involved.
According to the police, at 22.30 p.m., an increase in the number of vehicles in the area of a large parking lot in the city of Ingolstadter road was detected by the Nuremberg Transport Police.
After that, the police took over a number of vehicle checks.
Only recently had the police announced that they wanted to step up against so-called autopossers.
Illegal Tuning Meetings in Nuremberg: Only a small part of the "Scene"
The officials included well 700 vehicles and about 1100 people, the police are in charge.
However, only a small part of the "Autoposer" and Tuning Zones are to be assigned.
Apparently, most of the relevant scene came to the police's appeal.
On the basis of the vehicles and persons on-site, it is necessary to assume that this was mainly a joke.
In addition, the majority of those present adhered to the current provisions on protection of infection, in particular the compliance with the minimum level and the wearing of a mouth-neck protection.
The on-site controls were completed at 1:00 p.m.
In total, the officials of 10 vehicles have made such structural changes that the operating permit has been revoked.
Four of these vehicles had to be secured.
No autoruns
There were no illegal authors.
"The Central French Police Presidency will continue to keep the event in perspective and will continue to carry out enhanced control measures, including in the context of the appearance of the spectacles," it said.
The Agency News5 spoke to Jürgen Schrödinger from the involved extraction point: "They have all the beautiful fields that we must not shorten," says Schrödinger.
Special bands would be used for this.
Also because the cars are wider, the company should be careful not to cause any damage.
"The young people should finally keep their cars safe."
Labour Agency figures: 900 suspected cases of abuse in short work
Berlin - The Federal Agency for Labour (BA) goes after its own statement about 900 suspected cases of abuse at short-term employment.
"This is very little for more than 880,000 companies that have shown the short work," said the board responsible for the operational business Daniel Terzenbach of the "Frankfurter General newspaper".
When at the beginning of the Corona crisis many companies had suddenly applied for short work, the BA had to react quickly.
Usually the test will last up to three weeks.
"We have not been available for so long in this hot phase.
The more we look at the conclusions.
I'm sure there'll be some more.
We are not naive and have a long breath."
Indications of abuse often come from the employees or trade unions concerned.
In addition, the BA is using analysis software to identify patterns of abuse.
According to Terzenbach, the BA is preparing for a possible insolvency wave in the fall.
"Is there going to be much more insolvency than in the previous year?
The estimates go away, but we are fighting for the case and we are already teaching our employees in the labour agencies to process applications for insolvency".
The numbers are still infallible, Terzenbach said.
World Heritage in Potsdam: Party in the New Garden dissolved
Potsdam - On Friday, about 40 young people celebrated a party in the New Garden.
At 8:48 p.m., the collection was dissolved by the revolutionists of the Prussian Castles and Gardens Foundation (PSSG), the Foundation informed on a PNN request.
The young people would have left the park after that.
On Saturday evening, some young people in the New Garden would have played Rugby.
The Wiese has been cleared by a river driver, SPSG-Speaker Frank Kallensee said on Sunday.
There are always illegal holidays in the parks
In the parks of the Foundation there are always collections where the distance and hygiene rules of the Covid-19 start-up regulation are not complied with.
At the end of June it was a celebration with about 300 people in the Park Babelsberg, a week later about 150 people in the New Garden celebrated.
Even without a corona regulation, the parks are closed when the darkness breaks down.
The warehouse on the meadows is prohibited according to parking order, there are only a few exceptions.
The Foundation has long complained that visitors would leave more and more garbage and destroy protected biotopes.
In Berlin, illegal park parties reached another dimension.

The event was dissolved by the police.
Austria: Mass tests by Corona outbreak in tourist destination
With hundreds of tests, authorities have responded to a Corona outbreak in the popular Upper Austria tourist town of St. Wolfgang.
The number of confirmed cases rose to 48, as reported by the national authorities in Linz.
More than 100 results were still in the evening.
Thus, many of the infected young practitioners are in tourism businesses, but at least one holiday guest has been tested positively.
Residents, guests and tourism workers were asked to stay in their accommodations on Saturday night.
The lock was set at 2 p.m.
"There are cancellations and cancellations there" of bookings, said the head of the Tourism Association Wolfgangsee, Hans Wieser, dpa.
Even single guests have been away early.
St. Wolfgang is the most important tourist resort in Upper Austria, with more than 400,000 overnight stays last year.
In a normal season there are about a third of the German guests.
On Friday, the first infections became public.
On Saturday, the head of the district authority, Alois Lanz, defended the behaviour of practitioners who had celebrated in several venues and could have settled there.
"We all liked doing this in our youth," he told the radio broadcaster Ö1.
However, two bars were closed on Friday to prevent further infections.
The Tourism Association launched an information campaign to raise awareness of the dangers of Covid-19.
Since Saturday, hundreds of employees, vacationers and locals have been tested.
In addition, all guests who were in St. Wolfgang from 15 July were contacted.
The outbreak awakens memories of the Austrian ski and party resort Ischgl in Tirol, which in the early phase of the pandemic was the center of the Corona spread throughout Europe.

Premier League: Man United and Chelsea qualified for Champions League
London (dpa) - The English football recordmaster Manchester United returns after a year of absence to the Champions League.
On the last day of the Premier League, the Red Devils made sure of the third table place by a 2:0 (0:0) - Success against the direct competitors of Leicester City.
The Foxes must now be satisfied with the Europe League because the FC Chelsea was still passing away and also qualified as a fourth for the King's class.
In the struggle against the descent, Aston Villa was allowed to rejoice.
Manchester United went through a coup by Bruno Fernandes (71th minute) in leadership.
After a red card for Leicester City in the play time Jesse Lingard (90.+8) came to an end.
Chelsea, in the Champions-League Eighth Final opponent of the FC Bayern, won Mason Mount (45.+1) and Olivier Giroud (45.+4) in parallel with 2:0 (2:0) against the Wolverhampton Wanderers.
"That means a lot to me," said Coach Frank Lampard, who is standing at the end of the FA Cup against Arsenal in his first season as Chelsea coach.
From Chelsea's victory against Wolverhampton, Tottenham Hotspur also benefited from a lean 1:1 (1:0) at Crystal Palace and started as a sixth in Europe League.
Aston Villa chose the remote with the FC Watford and the AFC Bournemouth for itself, but had to spend a long time at West Ham United.
The late leadership of Jack Grealish (84.) immediately disappeared Andrej Jarmolenko (85.).
But the 1:1 (0:0) was enough because Watford lost with 2:3 (1:3) at Arsenal.
The club that hit three coaches in the season is rising after five years of first-year training.
Just like Bournemouth, who could not save himself by a 3:1 (2:1) at FC Everton.
At the end, a point was missing.
The FC Liverpool, which has been established as an English master since the end of June, secured itself with a 3:1 (1:1) victory at Newcastle United.
99 counters are the highest value the Reds have ever achieved in a football season.
Coach Jürgen Klop missed the scorecard in English football with his team just barely.
The best brand holds Manchester City with 100 points in the 2017/18 season.
After the Newcastle leadership in the first minute Virgil van Dijk (38th), Divock Origi (59th) and Sadio Mané (89th) turned the party on Sunday for Liverpool.
"For this wonderful club it was an extraordinary season," Torschütze van Dijk said after the game, "that should encourage us to defend the title.
It's gonna be hard."
At the end of the day, the Premier League bosses should also be satisfied.
Because of the Corona virus crisis, football was interrupted in England from 13 March to 17 June.
In the meantime, even an early interruption or withdrawal of the remaining games on neutral ground was discussed.
Finally, however, the season could be ended without special events - however, as in Germany without spectators in the stadiums.
Arrests and violence in demonstrations against Netanyahu
The protests in Israel against the leader of Netanyahus are becoming more and more intense.
In the night there were violent clashes.
The Israeli police took action on Sunday night in Jerusalem violently against participants in a demonstration against the law-conservative government chief Benjamin Netanyahu.
Twelve people were arrested for involvement in riots, police spokesperson Mickey Rosenfeld told them.
Among other things, the police set up water pumps to solve the announcement.
A total of about 6000 people had gathered on Saturday evening, according to media reports near Netanyahus office.
They protested against unemployment, corruption and Netanyahu's dealings with the Corona crisis.
The protestors beat drums, went into horns and called Netanyahu to retreat.
There were also participants in an event demonstration that supported Netanyahu, reported the "ynet" news page.
Also in many other places in Israel, people demonstrated, including in front of the private villa of the chief government in the coastal town of Caesarea and in a park in Tel Aviv.
A man was arrested after police reports near Tel Aviv, because he is suspected of having jumped from a running car pepper spray on demonstrators on the roadside.
Another man was arrested after a knife attack on a demonstrator in the south of the country.
The demonstrator was slightly injured on the neck.
In Jerusalem and Tel Aviv there have been several demonstrations against Netanyahu.
The announcements accompany the corruption process against the head of government.
Finally, Netanyahu was also criticised for its management of the Corona crisis.
Among other things, he is being given quick openings and a lack of preparation for a second corona wave.
The Corona crisis has made the economy of the country difficult.
The unemployment rate was last seen at more than 20 percent.
The number of new infections with the Corona virus in Israel has recently risen to ever-new record values.
Accidents at Ahlen (NRW) - Transporter forces on car - nine injured - Ruhrgeitet - Bild.de
Ahlen - An accident on Saturday afternoon called for nine minors on the B58 at Ahlen.
A driver was on his way with her two children (3,5) towards Beckum.
The police said, "Supposedly she had stopped because she wanted to bend."
The driver of a Mercedes transporter who drove behind her must have seen it too late.
He hit the back of the car.
In the case of the accident, three seats in the car and six in the carrier were easily injured.
Several rescue cars took them to a nearby hospital.
North Korea rules out the border city according to the Corona case
North Korea has so far seen a "lighting success" in its own actions to defend the Corona virus.
Now for the first time, the country reports a suspect.
Because of a first official case of coronation in the country, North Korea has completely eliminated a major city from fear of a catastrophe.
Despite the most severe epidemiological resistance in the past six months, "the evil virus could have been dragged into the country," the state media reported.
For the region around the border city of Kaesong the emergency has been suspended.
The Communist leadership called out the highest alarm level.
Should the suspected case be confirmed, it would be the first official case of Sars-CoV-2 infection in the affected country.
North Korea had not registered a single infection, according to its own data, and described its defence measures as "lighting success".
The data were dubious abroad.
The symptoms of the disease were identified according to a "outbreaker" who illegally crossed the military demarcation line between South and North Korea on 19 July.
The person moved to South Korea three years ago and is now back across the border.
For the crossing of the border within the four kilometres wide and most likely military buffer zone, there was no confirmation from South Korea at first.
However, according to reports by the National News Agency Yonhap, South Korea's military approach to the possibility of an illegal border crossing North Korea was highly respected.
Some people were being investigated.
North Korea called for its own information on Saturday because of the suspect's emergency meeting of the Labour Party Police Office under the chairmanship of powermaker Kim Jong Un.
The "dangerous situation in Kaesong could trigger a deadly and destructive catastrophe".
Kim had already arranged as a preliminary measure on Friday to "block Kaesong completely and isolate every area and region from others," it continued.
The person concerned and all the people in Kaesong who had been in contact with them were placed under quarantine.
The central military commission of the party is therefore to investigate the "outbreak" and the conduct of the responsible military unit and, where appropriate, to impose severe penalties.
In Kaesong, about 300,000 people live according to estimates.
Stress before the Council: City-East and noise protection are still facing a big summer break for discussion
"In addition to environmental issues, the board members will also vote in favour of the construction plan on the large project of urban development-east", it is said at 4.30 p.m. in the middle of the municipal press release at the next municipal meeting on Tuesday, 28 July, at 4.30 p.m. in the Grand Hall of CongressCenter Pforzheim.
In particular, the evaluation of the eastern city is discussed in particular until the end of the controversy.
The majority are barely, lastly in individual committees, even denying it by presence.
An appeal from the economy (construction, real estate, trade and IT), which is now out of citizenship and then the project developed by administration and municipality, is now not to be failed after almost ten years of preparation, criticised the project opponent Reinhard Klein as "extra-parliamentary opposition", "free," "speculation", "refoulement" and "conscious false statements".
"All I think it's better to know," said Klein, who has been one of the community's only representatives of the list of citizens Pforzheim for a year.
In fact, after reading the contracts in this position, he said, "I know what I'm talking about."
The exit will bring the city cheaper than the Technical Council to repair for 8.5 million euros instead of the city administration's statements after grants, from which the existence of which is believed to be small.
The city will develop quite differently as one predicts in the home and since the supporters of the economy.
The city was built by its own power and not by an investor: this was its plan B. One day after a small one, the FDP/FW/UB/LED Group, which also rejected the project, presented an alternative concept.
It also provides essentially the renovation of the Technical Council, the opening of the Schloßberg, the rental of the ex-Thale for administrative areas and a smaller urban transformation in the ideal case with local carriers.
Environmental themes play a central role
Above all, environmental issues will play a central role.
The municipality will therefore vote in favour of, inter alia, the noise reduction plan.
This includes a number of measures to protect the Pforzheim population from noise pollution caused by road traffic, including numerous temporary reductions.
In a press release, the German transport club welcomes the widespread introduction of Tempo 30. However, the political leaders in the city are not innocent of this because they have only contributed to the massive increase in car traffic and thus the noise, says the VCD.
The municipality also agrees on the participation of the city of the energy and climate protection agency Pforzheim/Enzkreis.
In addition, the agenda for the accession of the Land of Baden-Württemberg to the Climate Protection Pact, the re-establishment of parents' contributions to the city's children's facilities and the application for admission to the Smart City Foundation of the Federal Republic of Germany is on the agenda.
Citizens are welcome, but corona protection measures must be enforced.
With much delay Tim Zimmermann starts in the new season
With almost half a year of delay, Tim Zimmermann starts his first season in ADAC GT Masters on July 31.
Before the league of the supersport cars can take up the regular operation, the first test runs were now on.
For Zimmermann it was especially important to get to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3.
The Corona crisis has for a long time prevented Tim Zimmermann from taking his first service in the new Lamborghini Huracan by Grasser Racing.
Under special hygiene conditions, this was now possible.
The 23-year-old Langeargen turned his first rounds on the lausitzring ring and was able to get used to his premiere in the GT3 car.
"There are already a few things that are different from the Porsche from the previous season," Zimmermann says.
"With the ABS you have to go to the curves, for example.
But it really made a lot of fun."
Zimmermann also had fun with Steijn Schothorst, with which he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.
Despite his first 25 years of experience in GT sports, the Netherlands has been able to help his new teammate in many things.
"I am not a beginner in motor sports, but every new series also brings new challenges with it," Zimmermann says.
"Steijn and I understand us confused and we have also made enormous progress from session to session at Lauitzring".
Right there - on the Lauitzring - the GT Masters will also draw his first race.
As of July 31, the 33 supersport cars will be raced by the Lausitz.
Zimmermann, one of the 15 seriesnews, knows the route.
In 2015 he was the last guest in the Motodrom.
"It worked fast and I had little to get used to," says Zimmermann, who starts for the Friedrichshafen racing community Count Zeppelin.
"The lausitzring has many fast passages that you have to make optimal use of to be fast."
As quickly as possible, the room man will be out in two weeks.
"The teams are, of course, poker a little with the tests," he says.
"In conclusion, however, we are very pleased and look forward to the first weekend at Lauitzring".
The race in Brandenburg will be the scene of a closed calendar.
By the beginning of November, there are seven races.
The current position is that no spectators will be allowed - but there is a prominent guest.
In mid-August at the Nürburgring Ex-Formel-1 pilot Niko Hülkenberg will be caught in the GT steering wheel.
British Minister of Transport of quarantine
According to press reports, the British government's decision to put Spanish holidayers under quarantine after their return has been cold to the Minister of Transport of the country.
Therefore, Grant Shapps is currently on holiday in Spain, while his colleagues decided on the measure at home on Saturday.
Due to the increasing Corona figures in Spain, the London Cabinet has removed the country from the list of countries from which entry is possible without quarantine.
The new arrangement applies today, Sunday, so that even Shapps will have to return to quarantine after his return.
In Austria, the government has also imposed quarantine measures for returnees.
But the scheme applies only to those who are only on the day of departure, only from Saturday, August 1, and was not introduced overnight.
Spain is still considered to be one of the "safer countries" in Austria, for which no quarantine is required in Austria.
"Many ministers should have known in advance that there is the possibility of a quarantine for vacationers in Spain," commented Labour Deputy Diane Abbott.
"But obviously no one has made the effort to say Grant Shapp's message."
Almost a month after the end of the Corona emergency in Spain and the end of the severe exit barrier, the number of infections in the country is increasing again.
Virologists are primarily responsible for the nightlife for the recent expansion.
Spain is one of the most popular holiday countries in Britain.
From non-necessary trips to the Spanish mainland, the British government currently advises that canaries and Balearicians who are particularly popular with British holidayers are excluded.
So far, more than 272,000 infections with the new coronary virus and more than 28,000 deaths have been reported in Spain.
Russia: Marine Day: Putin announces hypersignal weapons for warships

Russia has such a large coastal area as no other country in the world.
For 300 years, the Marine protected Russia reliably, Putin said on the day celebrated by Matrosen throughout the country.
Also in many other Russian coastal areas, the sea forces begin the day of the Navy with parades.
In Syria, where Russia fights on the side of powermaker Baschar al-Assad, the military demonstrated at a gun show in the Mediterranean port of Tartus Stärke.

A video published by the Ministry of Defence included not only warships, including a submarine, but also combat screwdrivers and jets.
Hurricane "Hanna" reaches Texas: help due to the difficult crown
Washington - The first Hurricane this year over the Atlantic hit land in Texas.
Life-threatening floods, strong winds and severe rains now threatened parts of the U.S. state, the National Hurricane Centre of the U.S. climate agency NOAA shared on Sunday night (location time).
Governor Greg Abbott called for numerous areas of emergency.
The corona pandemic in Texas makes the work of the helpers difficult, Abbott continued, according to US media.
Evacuated to take care
"Every Hurricane is a huge challenge," said Abbott, according to Houston Chronicle.
Looking at the storm in Texas, he added: "This challenge is complicated and is even harder when it comes to thinking that it is dense by an area that is the strongest area in the state of Covid-19".
According to Johns-Hopkins University, about 5,000 people have died alone in Texas as a result of the Corona pandemic.
Abbott called on people who had to leave their homes to be careful.
They should not forget the practices "to which we have been accustomed", such as wearing masks, the governor said according to the CBS messenger.
It's important that everyone kept a distance.
Therefore, hotel rooms have also been provided in some places.
It is also intended to be tested on Corona in emergency situations.
The damage was initially only reported from the coastal town of Port Mansfield.
Storm warning reappeared
At wind speeds of up to 150 kilometres per hour, "Hanna" was hit directly on the island of Padre Island, according to authorities.
The rainstorm was previously classified as the Hurricane of the lowest level.
For the coastal section from Port Mansfield to Sargent, a storm-flut warning was first issued and was later withdrawn.
The authorities expected a decline, while "Hanna" continued to drag into the interior of the country and to the northeast of Mexico.
"Douglas" moves to Hawaii
In the Pacific Hurricane "Douglas" was on the night of Sunday with wind speeds of about 150 kilometers per hour in the direction of Hawaii.
The Hurricane Centre, however, expected him to lose his temper.
According to the forecast, it is supposed to be on Sunday (location time) near the largest islands of Hawaii - then as a storm just below the Hurricane.
Over the Atlantic, NOAA expected an over-average active Hurricane season this year, after a forecast of May.
From June to the end of November, it would be with up to ten hurricanes, which could become very strong hurricanes, the Authority had explained.
On average, there are six Hurricanes per year over the Atlantic, three of which develop into storms of great strength.
In view of the available climate data and the higher water temperature in the Atlantic and the Caribbean, the probability of a normal season is only 30 percent, which is an average of only ten percent, it was then called.
US President Donald Trump wrote on Twitter that his government was closely monitoring the storms and was in contact with the affected states.

Formula 1 needs a special rule to choose its world champion
Since the required number of continents cannot be driven, the FIA must improvise to forgive the WM title.
All American races have been cancelled.
The race calendar is becoming more and more concrete
The race calendar of the current Formula 1 season takes on further shape.
At the 10 confirmed Grand Prix, three further races were added during the week.
In October, the Nürburgring will be held in Germany and in the Portuguese Portimão.
On November 1st, Lewis Hamilton and Co. fought on the Italian tradition race in Imola around the World Cup points.

The number of infections in the area of São Paulo is significantly lower than in other regions of Brazil.
The concerns of some teams not wanting to drive in Brazil would also justify no rejection.

Greta Thunberg: Bad view of Donald Trump went around the world
Greta Thunberg talked about her meeting with US President Donald Trump.
Greta Thunberg was a guest at Stephen Colbert's famous latenight show on video screens and was a fan of what she had in mind when she met Donald Trump.
Air conditioner Greta Thunberg was a guest in a popular US-Latenight show by video switch.
She told, among other things, of her struggle against the world's mighty.
The teenager also spoke about her famous "bad look" when she met Donald Trump.
New York City - In the past two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg has been paying attention to her tireless use of the "Fridays For Future" movement.
Now she spoke in a famous latenight show about her plans in the future and her meeting with US President Donald Trump at the UN Climate Summit last year.
Lateight moderator Stephen Colbert welcomed 17-year-old Thunberg on Tuesday in your mission and conducted a longer interview with Sweden.
She spoke not only about her fight against climate change but also about her conflict with the world's powers.
"There are some things that have surprised me," she said.
"How far people go to get the focus away from the climate crisis," she was shocked.
"All from organized hate campaigns to threats, just because a group of children are going on the street," she experienced.
Heads of State and leading politicians who ridicule them in social media or even try to silence them, they find it "weird" because they show the reactions that "they have no other answer to it".
It was particularly interesting at the end of the interview when Greta Thunberg was addressed to a well-known scene in which she threw a bitter look behind President Trump.
At the 2019 UN Climate Summit in New York, for which the Aktvistin was sailing across the Atlantic, its expressive look was captured by the cameras and has since been seen by countless people on the Internet.
From the short clip, a GIF was created, i.e. an animated image that eventually became one of the most frequently used images for Trump opponents.
But what did 17-year-olds think about the U.S. president at the time?
To the relatively open question by Stephen Colbert, she answered only briefly and dryly: "To be honest, I believe that no further explanation is needed."
With the ready answer, the experienced satiric Colbert had probably not calculated and disappeared in a short time smiling out of the picture.
With her "How are you there?" talk about the principles of climate protection, she left many in memory at the climate conference.
Ex-Dortmunder Real estate with three-pack for Lazio Rome
Ciro Immobile is now running around Europe's Golden Shoes with Bayern's Robert Lewandowski.
The former Dortmund Ciro Immobile has the best chance to become a Torschutz king in the Italian football championship.
At 5:1 (1:1), the single BVB-Profi controlled the victory of Lazio Rome at Hellas Verona three matches, including two converted elfmeters in the times of the two halfs.
Thus, the 30-year-old from the fourth table has two season games before closing 34 seasoners on his account - as many as Robert Lewandowski achieved by the FC Bayern München in the past federal league season.

Fleetwood Mac co-founder Peter Green died
His life was like a backtrack: After a rapid climb with Fleetwood Mac it went steeply uphill and then slowly uphill again.
Now the Bluesrock guitarist Peter Green died at the age of 73.
Genius guitarist, drug junkie, cult followers: The co-founder of the band Fleetwood Mac, Peter Green, is dead.
He died peacefully at the age of 73, family members shared on Saturday in an official opinion, another opinion would be announced for the next few days.
Top musicians like Peter Frampton praised Green as one of the best blues and rock guitarists.
Mick Fleetwood spoke in an emotional reaction of a "monumental loss" for all former and present members of the Fleetwood Mac band.
The drummer Fleetwood and the guitarist Green had founded the long-standing band in London in 1967, and to this day his dream instrumental hit "Albatross" is unforgettable.
The life of the musician ("The End Of The Game", "In The Skies") is like a backtrack.
With Fleetwood Mac, Green experienced a rapid rise - the band celebrated its greatest success but then without it.
There should have been a dispute, among other things, because Green wanted to contribute all the profits of the group for charity purposes.
He began to appear in large walls and with great crucifix.
Psychiatric problems should also have played a role.
Three years after the foundation, Green left the band in 1970.
There was a social decline.
The Bluesrock guitarist is under drug abuse and schizophrenia, as biographers reported.
Green has been treated in the psychiatry for a long time.
During a large part of the 1970s the musicians disappeared from the image area.
He is to live on the street occasionally, working as a peacekeeper and spending a long time in an Israeli Kibbuz.
Green was born in 1946 as the son of a Jewish working family in the London district of Bethnal Green.
As a young man, he was excited about American blue musicians such as B.B. King and Muddy Waters.
At age 11, he learned the first guitar grabs.
At the age of 15, the teenager started playing professional guitar and got five years later the chance to stand on stage as a lead guitarist for the instrument band Peter B's Louners.
Shortly thereafter he was hired as a replacement for his Idol Eric Clapton with the Bluesbreakers.
In the middle of the Blues boom, Green founded Fleetwood Mac in the summer of 1967 along with his Bluesbreakers' colleagues Mick Fleetwood and John McVie.
The song "Albatross" composed by Green protected the group in the winter of 1968/69 and catapulted it at the top of the British music scene.
But the quick rise soon showed his shadow pages: Green didn't strengthen the media room, his experiments with the drug LSD became ever more extreme.
The life between music and search he later commented in an interview: "The worst thing that happened to me in life is drugs - the best was to land a number one hit".
By the end of the decade, Green arrived in 1979 surprisingly a success of respect with an album inspired by religious themes.
Fleetwood Mac then swim without it in new formation on a successful wave.
Her 1977 album "Rumours" sold more than 40 million times worldwide.
Despite various small solo successes Green didn't get any bigger comeback until in 1996 he started again with a group of friends.
At that time the British "Daily Telegraph" spoke of a rock star that returned to the earth.
Free of drugs Green released some albums with the Peter Green Splinter Group until the band dissolved in 2004.
For music experts he was already a blue legend at lifetimes - and with his soft sound one of the most influential guitarists of the past decades.
