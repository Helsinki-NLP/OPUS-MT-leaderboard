I love wearing sports clothes.
Why were you so scared?
Tom and Mary ravaged each other.
I don't even have a job.
I like to imitate Queen Elizabeth.
We should have told him the truth.
I'm so proud of them.
Who is he?
Is the supermarket open tonight?
I told Tom exactly what I saw.
Mr. Suzuki teaches us English.
What is the best way to travel?
Tom lives here with you?
What's the matter, dear?
I don't want them angry.
Is Tom really sick?
You didn't wash your hair.
I read your letter yesterday.
Go to the supermarket once a week.
Can I marry my aunt's husband's grandson?
I believe them.
She was fun with her son's luggage.
I said it was okay.
I have no reason not to trust Tom.
He was the first to help her.
Are the kids already asleep?
We have to wait here.
I'm Chinese.
Tom wasn't very active.
We cleared the road from the snow yesterday.
I'm not busy at all right now.
Tom doesn't think he'll win.
Maybe he should listen.
He's a brilliant artist.
Give me a move, guys.
I like your painting.
I waited an hour and a half.
I'm not good at math.
Tom refused to say what he did.
I don't like his hat.
I can't be happy when Tom is so sad.
I want to share this with you.
Study at Hyogo University.
We'll take part in the marathon.
Maybe you should tell her.
I know what to study.
His life went on without problems.
No one wants to help us.
They talk very quickly.
Tom was lucky at first.
It's urgent to go to the bathroom.
Mary really looks like her mother.
He didn't have any money to buy the farm.
How often do you go to the movies?
Are you religious?
Did he talk to you?
Are there many quali from these places?
Tomorrow, if God wills, we'll be with your parents.
It comes from Sweden.
He didn't have any money to buy the farm.
Did you really believe that?
Tom decided to sell his car.
I don't like fish with lice.
I feel protected.
You're the tallest.
Isn't this funny, Tom?
Tom was born October 20th.
It's a nice picture.
I'll leave it alone.
Tom won't even look after me.
We humiliated them.
He's already here.
I know who my enemy is.
Tom needs to sleep now.
Tom's not honest.
Tom's father is a cop.
Tom works here?
That's what Tom was looking for.
What did you do to her?
Tom wanted to send a message.
I wasn't happy to see them.
Don't break my heart.
I don't have plans for tonight.
Stop being sarcastic all the time!
She was crying.
I wish I could be rich like you.
We're having fun.
It's dissatisfaction.
I read books a lot.
Tom and I want to talk to you about something.
I can meet you at 2:30.
Tom's pissed off.
I'm already old.
I have the dirty criminal fidin.
Good night, my friends.
I bought a book in English in a library.
Tomorrow I'm going to the bookstore to buy books.
What would the world be without women?
They tell us some funny stories.
Can you hear what Tom's saying?
What's your favorite historical movie?
We can't see her.
Tom and I still love each other.
Tom needs to eat.
Everybody go.
Giant pandas live only in China.
I'm coming next.
Don't say anything like that.
It's worse!
Jim's Canadian.
You did good here.
Where did everyone else go?
I'm relaxed.
The beast was walking in the field.
He entered his private life.
Can I borrow your knife?
I'm late for an appointment.
Tom's still gone.
I ate the whole apple.
Swallow the bakri while the pen is heated.
Is the park open today?
We're only preparing Uygur food.
We're leaving Boston tomorrow morning.
We can't leave you there.
Tom was playing soccer.
Stop bluffing her.
I know her.
The real heroes are us.
We're waiting for Tom.
Unfortunately, my birthday is only once a year.
Put your bike away.
I understood it as a compliment.
They called President Roosevelt a pirate.
I could go to the movies.
It's not an appointment.
It makes me nervous.
Who do you think he told them?
Why did Tom give it to Mary?
Listen to her!
It's good in this game, isn't it?
Take care of them.
I live in Fiji.
You want to eat with us?
Doesn't seem too surprised.
I'm not going to school on Saturday.
It's my job to protect you.
Tom's unfaithful, isn't he?
Is this cage designed to protect against sharks?
Tom wants to know Mary better.
I'm very disappointed.
Tom wants more coffee.
Who do you think is the author of this novel?
I wish you'd called me.
Don't you want a job?
I played the trombone when I was younger.
I'm faithful.
To write in Braille?
I don't know what happened to him.
I'm free today.
Why do you want to kill us?
He ate a apple.
I got him.
He's adopted the orphan.
I guess they speak French.
Take a step forward.
You need to get more active.
Tom and Mary are joking?
You broke the smoke.
I don't have an alternative.
I think Tom knows who lives in that house.
He's smarter than he is.
What are you gonna do this summer?
It's getting irritated.
Can you speak Shanghai?
He narrowed it down because I washed it.
Tom was wearing an old pair of shoes.
Tom wondered what happened to Mary.
Something bad happened to them.
How much was it paid?
They didn't touch anything.
Do you like horror movies?
I know a lot about animals.
Don't hold the fiat.
Am I in London?
She's still there with you, isn't she?
This will make a big difference.
Tom didn't have much money with himself.
Tom doesn't have a big appetite.
Were you with them that night?
I was running.
The village was dead after sunset.
What's your favorite rapper woman?
Say hello to Tom on my behalf.
It's nice to see her so happy.
I usually slept in summer.
Why is he leaving soon?
I'm quite proud of it.
I smell gas.
I'll tell them it's not true.
Here's your picture.
I can depend on my friends.
The experiment confirmed his theory.
Tom's lucky.
Pass me the ketchup, please.
I happened to sit next to her at a convention.
There are no furniture left in the room.
Tom presented himself soon for the lesson.
It's a little overcrowded, isn't it?
Who's the man playing the piano?
I decided not to.
No, I haven't written it yet.
You have to listen to Tom.
She slept in the car.
Tom and I are going to Boston with Mary.
He spends all his income drinking.
Search harder on Google!
It's not the only problem with your idea.
You talk like you're the boss.
You want me to go with you?
I came to see her.
Does it look familiar?
I'll check your game tomorrow.
So what should I tell him?
It's starting to rain.
Do you sound any instruments?
They're gonna die?
I really like it.
Are you guys coming in?
Tom beat her.
I don't have feelings.
She's incredibly stupid.
We're on a lonely island.
He wants us to be patient.
He convinced the teacher.
When's your new novel coming out?
I would never betray her.
Are you aware of any problems?
The mystery remains unsolved.
I will never forget Germany.
Why didn't you call a doctor?
You're good.
How would you like to change it?
It's snowing today.
She made a promise to write to me every week.
I wasn't born deaf.
We should leave you alone.
I can't raise our son alone.
Go get some milk.
Tom seemed surprised.
I love to be right.
Tom married a rich girl from Boston.
I forgot whether to drink wine or not.
Who warned them?
Have faith in God.
"I'll give 50 grand for this statue. "Who will offer more?"
Why would anyone want to kiss her?
He should have bought a used car.
I intend to stay in a hotel.
I didn't grow up like that.
He can park here.
Please tell him to get out of here.
Tom hated them.
I'm happy almost every day.
I won't apologize.
We really like picnics.
I haven't talked to him yet.
It was a hot summer evening.
I always walk.
It's decisive.
You're not very fun at parties, are you?
He's been looking for the car keys in his bag.
I don't really want to talk.
So he must be Argentine.
I really like my job.
I'd suggest you be more careful.
It's broken.
He should have done it yesterday.
I'm a big fan of American cuisine.
Tom's dancing with Mary.
Your destiny is in my hands.
No, you don't have to go now.
No one wants to help you.
She'll get divorced in the afternoon.
He's getting blind.
We subscribe to a newspaper.
I thought it was a combination.
What do you imagine when you look at that picture?
What are the continents of the world?
That's good to sing, isn't it?
Tom's mad at Mary, isn't he?
Your idea is superior to yours.
Tom never forgave me.
I'm the expert.
Tom has a secret.
We're losing blood.
Chaucer and Boccaccio are two writers. The first is English, the second is Italian.
Tom's getting emotional.
I was just scared.
Tomorrow's a party.
I drank too much beer yesterday.
I'd like to teach you Chinese instead of another language.
I'm still busy.
I appreciate your intuition.
I went to the park this morning.
Tom loves fly fishing.
We have no choice but to risk it.
I don't want to play chess.
Mary is jealous.
I should have changed the oil.
Do you have a calculator?
I asked him to stay.
If you really want to know, all you have to do is ask.
We need to inform Tom.
Tom's still asleep.
Tom's a little impulsive, isn't he?
You agree with Tom, right?
Tom didn't take much money.
Tom calculated his expenses.
It's not my idea of fun, but whatever you want.
Could you ask Tom to stop after work?
He's playing the drum.
It must be hot.
Which online dictionary do you use more?
Turn on the candles.
We lived in Osaka for ten years before we came to Tokyo.
No one can solve this problem.
German machines are among the best.
Call them.
What a pussy.
Tom does not respect Mary's opinions.
You'll see the field.
He came to listen to jazz.
Do you really think Tom's nice?
I can't give Mary everything she wants.
When does school end?
Tom and I are pretty busy.
He hired me.
I said I'd take it.
I knew they were watching me.
I have plans with them tonight.
I could get to know someone who can help you.
You're going on bikes?
These shoes are too small for me to wear.
I see a model.
She brought me a cup of sugarless tea.
It was published in 1969.
We need to relax and stop.
He speaks Chinese.
Tom told me he wanted to go to Boston.
London is smaller than Tokyo.
I'm three years older than you.
Look, I'll show you.
I'm saying he was innocent.
The fear of failure is one of the world's most common fears.
Why are you so jealous?
You think Tom killed Mary?
How come you never have anything to say?
Scandalous!
Come on, Tom, aren't you curious?
Keep your tongue in check.
I drank the wine.
He's more popular than I am.
When can I get out of here?
You're in advance again.
We left this.
All I want to do is go fishing.
You want to take this?
Tom didn't want to go back to the orphanage.
Gold is heavier than iron.
I'll find one later.
At least I'm older than you.
Tom didn't want to spend any more time with Mary.
Tom says he kissed Mary.
You can choose what you want.
I'm at the hospital.
Did you call them?
Spent the radio.
Why did you decide to become a teacher?
It was a really scary story.
It's in the van.
I don't introduce them.
Do you like golf?
Forgive me for interrupting the other day.
Can you believe us?
Wait for a bus to arrive.
He found the chemist.
You'll never guess where I am.
I wasn't okay.
You students are bound to be diligent.
I won't be able to help you.
It's a scandalous idea!
The sun disappeared behind a cloud.
You're interested in politics.
Many people go to church on Christmas Eve.
Thank you, my daughter.
I don't know how to drive very well.
I heard Tom's learning to drive.
You know I love her deeply.
He's trying to kill himself.
I don't need your help anymore.
The problem is we don't know where Tom is.
He's under the bed, isn't he?
I cut the branch with an ass.
The minigons are back in fashion.
There are some books on the table.
Come at least six.
I have a lot of work to finish by the weekend.
He forgot his name.
You're Mary?
After dinner walk on the beach.
Why didn't he go with him?
He's two years older than he is.
French is difficult.
I'm sure she's very busy.
My name is Ahmad.
You got the wrong number.
Age is not a result, and youth is not a sin.
I've known him for over ten years.
We are grateful for the music he left us.
It's not that the idea of putting an ammonia electric home at home attracts me a lot.
Judy is a very smart student.
We knew the dog would run behind the cat.
I'm a cop.
You kissed her, didn't you?
Why don't I buy them a hat and that's enough?
I thought Tom would have made himself alive.
She's stuck to the bad news.
This car doesn't belong to me.
Are you listening, Tom?
He often shows his anger.
Tom's my dad.
We don't have to leave yet.
Do you like the mountain?
My daughter likes to play with dolls.
Come aboard.
She's fascinating.
Do people drink tea in your country?
I don't want to waste any more time.
We've lost sight of it.
The hostages will be released before Christmas.
He's going to wake them up.
What tooth hurts?
You have to read between the lines.
Tom was proud.
Tom was a bit out of line with Mary's request.
I'm here to help him.
It's not easy to speak English well.
I don't believe in a word of what you say.
Get off the doll!
Only Naoko drinks coffee.
Sami needed to use the bathroom.
He changed his name.
You're vulgar.
Tom's getting better.
We can help them.
They called us.
I think Tom should be hungry.
The country is rich in natural resources.
It was a difficult start for Mary.
Tom won't be back today.
You again!
Why do these things always happen to me?
The birds are beating the ground.
The park is closed Monday.
Didn't you even update the firmware?
I have a job for you.
This is just a game.
Can we do that now?
I like all my friends.
I like my language.
Why don't you answer me?
We're Tom's classmates.
There's nothing better to do.
Tom started writing.
That's what I'm looking for.
He's doing practice.
Are you coming in?
Which way should I start?
Did you study Darwin's theory of evolution?
His horse had a heart attack.
It's worth visiting the ruins.
He should be ready for the worst.
Tom pulled the bags out of the trunk.
This reminds me of someone.
I'm so hungry.
Tom lost his new watch.
Tom sang with Mary.
Is that what you told Tom?
Do you remember his tag number?
He told us a lie.
She has seven children.
Let's listen to music.
I think it's dangerous for kids to play in the pond.
You bought me a nice hat.
The bell sounded.
Bring it to the men in room 318.
I'm in love with her.
We have to move on.
Tom doesn't even care.
We smoke separately.
It's very soon.
You saved Tom twice.
I don't like big cities.
This worked for me.
He doesn't have a few friends in America.
I didn't live in Boston last year.
Do you read this book tonight?
Tom's got a car?
I'll be fine, don't worry.
Tom laughs rarely.
I can't forget his smile.
I disobeyed him.
Do you know Canadians who live in Australia?
Tom's drunk, isn't he?
I'm perfectly happy here.
Do they like it?
What do you want me to do exactly, Tom?
Listen, we need to talk.
Tom didn't like it very much.
Could you wash the dishes, please?
The lunch was great.
She's shut down the computer.
Torture is against the law.
I remember.
It's not impossible.
What do you want me to do?
You should have shared a bedroom with your sister.
You heard the door close.
He made him drunk.
How do you feel today?
Would you be interested in working for me?
It reminds me of my childhood.
Mary and Alice were like sisters.
Tom came to Boston last night.
You're welcome.
I don't feel nervous.
She's got a good dog.
What do you really want to do?
Tom didn't even read Mary's letter.
They were perfect.
What are you going to do this summer?
You're going to my house.
But the wolf with his ball reached the quiet Fido.
Tom is engaged to my older sister.
My father always interferes with my private life.
Everybody wants something different.

Why don't you go back to Boston?
I don't want to be away from home.
What does it say to go out for a walk after dinner?
Fight like a man!
Tom and Mary sing?
Tom and Mary are all right?
Contracting is common in the markets.
They shot him.
We're sorry about the inconvenience.

A saved money is a earned money.
We're not cold.
We need to talk to him.
I know his name.
She's been through with red.
Don't bother them.
We were good.
She started acting strangely.
You should ask Tom to help.
Who sent the flowers?
Do I owe you money?
Would you like me to leave?
She left this, didn't she?
Say something.
You're random.
Please lower the music.
I'm training Tom for work.
He was trying to swim.
Who broke the bowl?
You'd better go with him.
The Queen visited the museum.
Tom didn't go, and neither did I.
Would you like to leave a message?
The kids are sleeping together.
Say it again, please.
You're bothering her.
Sami is not here to ruin your day.
Take my shoes off.
I'm learning the esperanto now.
He took mercenaries to kill Sami.
Is that yours?
The woman drinks water now.
Tom was a lawyer.
People who are demanding about what they eat, so even if a restaurant is inexpensive, it will soon close the beatters if the food does not taste good.
The man they're talking to Tom and Mary is a lawyer.
He changed his diet.
He's a man of speech.
I'm free tonight.
You think I'm too tall?
What should we do now?
Tom tried a new technique.
Were you binging?
Are you interested?
Tom cut his wrists off.
You look lifted.
You should have kissed Tom.
I know I'm wrong.
I'm looking for my keys.
Will you join our club?
Don't fire Tom.
He doesn't listen.
I bought it in a used store.
Why don't you do it yourself?
He's finally here!
Tom thinks everyone's gonna be here by noon.
Why don't you work with me anymore?
It doesn't matter.
You're lying.
She helped him.
Everyone was talking about it.
Are you telling me you're not busy?
He hated the balls.
Go home.
Tom told me Mary was engaged.
Where's my money?
No one's seen her do it.
Tom hasn't read any of these books.
You're still unconscious.
I have to go to work now.
You've come too soon.
He's able to speak ten languages.
Come home before dark.
I got off the train to the wrong station.
I hated French at the top.
Shouldn't you be home with your mother?
He has blue eyes and blonde hair.
I can't understand.
Tell him who you are.
My name looks weird.
I'll never forget that night.
Be happy! Add an exclamation point to all your phrases!
Can you see something in there?
You're ready.
Why should I talk to them?
I won't forget.
I don't want to forget her.
I can't open it!
Tell Tom I'm innocent.
I bought a couple of shoes.
I started working here in 2013.
They're traitors.
I'll stay.
I'm not always engaged.
I'll be there.
You woke me up before dawn.
I'll be right behind her.
How long did he live in Kobe?
We're getting closer.
Tom always says the same thing.
Did you talk to Tom?
Try to get some rest.
Do you have a Facebook account?
Church how to cook the fish.
No one will believe his story.
Tom's a gold boy.
It seems to be prevented from coming from foreign countries.
I bought that book for him.
I didn't mean to hit Tom so hard.
You're making me vomit.
I want a doctor.
What does the cat want?
You'll know her tomorrow.
You're three years younger than Tom.
Complete the sentence.
The watch's broken.
I won't wait forever.
Just give the order.
Do you know Canadians who live in Australia?
This book is much more interesting than that.
We were obliged to obey the rule.
I hope Tom's not angry.
The rock was moved with the dynamite.
Mary prepared the breakfast.
Where did you meet my father?
Who was Mona Lisa?
He said he had to go.
You can keep them.
This smell is unbearable.
She became famous.
What are you suggesting?
You became his friend while I was in Taiwan.
He was intimidated by his intelligence.
She's got the ball.
We have to go.
Staying at home isn't fun.
I'm sure Tom will be awake.
She can't find her hat.
Mr. Young would like his son to study more.
I opened an account in a bank nearby.
I didn't like that one.
Can you be sure?
Nice to see you.
You don't have to worry.
We'll be close.
I'm really worried about them.
He wants to go clearly.
I knew Tom would do something romantic.
How much card do you need?
Can you confirm that?
It was a waste of money.
Tom's talking to Mary on the phone.
Take the wine.
I was very proud.
You're too fast.
What about a beer?
I had no idea you were so stupid.
They're not alive.
I'm hiding in Japan.
You're a brave man.
Aren't you surprised?
It only costs one coin.
I hope Tom and Mary are wrong.
My cupcake is too big!
Give them a minute.
We're having dinner together tonight.
I don't expect you to remember.
Put the photo on.
You're my three best friends.
Have you tried talking to him?
Where did he eat?
He's the last person who can tell a lie.
June isn't that far, either.
Why does Tom hate you so much?
Do you know who said that?
I'm going to bed soon tonight.
He chased me out of the house.
My shoes were wet.
The key was left in the room.
Are you going to leave me?
You always liked Tom.
Why do you care?
Give him a hand, okay?
You wanted to ask me questions?
Don't play Tom.
You'll land on your feet.
I've been taking risks.
Two people were killed in a road accident.
You know Tom, right?
It wasn't my idea to take it.
Last night my grandmother was missing without suffering.

You know Tom likes cars.
She passed the exam.
Tom imitated Mary.
I can easily read Spanish.
Should I use the ink?
Don't fall off the chair.
Tom sent us Christmas presents.
Tom can't swim?
Children usually get up early in Christmas.
I'll be your guide.
How long do you study English every day?
Why does he seem controversial?
I can't do anything for her.
Dad's good.
I think they're ready.
Tom's gonna try it again.
What a wonderful woman!
They played a table game.
They all believed him.
It means a huge increase in the use of air conditioning, which uses energy, costs money and creates pollution.
I'm a drug addict.
Those are crocodile tears.
He might have said something before.
The work leaves traces on Tatoeba...
Do you like carrots?
I have fingers every 30 minutes.
Tom is much older now.
Tom's better.
I think Tom's pessimistic.
You have to help them.
Sometimes I write to my mother.
Don't trust anyone.
I'm sorry I've never been kind to him.
Make Tom call me.
He hasn't changed a thing.
She's not wearing her hat.
Tom actually apologized to Mary.
Why doesn't he sit with me anymore?
I want you to look for them.
I left the party too soon.
I should have eaten more.
Twenty students, only one read the book.
To love someone means to see him as God understood him.
Don't lie to them.
Do they live with her?
I don't know how he did this.
I'm not sure George will like this idea.
They're afraid to say it publicly.
Please identify yourself.
You're leaving.
It would be nice to spend the summer in the mountains.
I lost it.
I almost dropped the plates.
There's a phone in my room.
Is it serious?
Tom composed 911.
We're brothers and sisters.
Is she interested in Buddhism?
It's been nice this week.
You want a boat with that?
You don't know me.
No one wants to work.
Please drive slower.
How do we fix it?
This is the magazine last month.
They're not back yet.
He's about your age, isn't he?
He's in the back.
We can't let them die.
It's a little bit of a nerve.
Tom was late.
Tom stayed back.
This point will be discussed tomorrow.
How did he spend his holidays?
When he left the Army, Roger Miller moved into the country music house in Nashville, Tennessee.
Mary fixed it.
Have you ever spoken to him?
I don't think Tom will be able to do that.
When did you get back from London?
Tom's always a good man.
Can I get you some coffee?
He left the village to study.
I've never seen you dance.
Tom was worried about a closer look.
Can you save them?
So you and Hanna are thinking about getting married?
You can drive, can you?
They need us to finish the job.
I've been here twice now.
It looks so subtle.
They're all dead.
I don't want you in my car.
A cobra bites Tom.
I don't care about you.
Don't say anything!
I think you're right.
He likes football.

I have to go to Boston next week.
Show them how to do it.
What's your favorite fruit?
Do you like golf?
What is your favorite type of pizza?
He's not very good at his job.
Bob has a lot of books in his room.
Tom was followed.
The ship disappeared horizontally.
Of course you lied.
Something was happening.
Send it by mail.
It's interesting, isn't it?
Mary accidentally hit Tom.
I'm nobody's enemy.
I forgot his number.
The two teams fought very hard.
I think there's a mistake in my account.
Tom didn't convince me.
Sami had some painful secrets.
Do you want her to be honest?
What are you gonna do?
Tom seems tired.
They have all your wishes to come true!

I'm surprised Tom doesn't know how to speak French.
He was playing the piano.
I can take her home.
I'll call you tomorrow.
I think they were wrong.
The ultimate treasure is knowledge, the central treasure is children and the lowest treasure is material wealth.
It would be risky.
We got up at four in the morning.
I have one.
We're shy.
I know your mom doesn't want you talking to me.
He ruined my life.
It's not very likely that Tom wants to.
You're really good.
Tom kept trying to call Mary, but she never answered the phone.
Get ready.
Some people can live for up to ten years.
What kind of work are you doing?
I'll write it on the sink.
You're brave.
You're not sick.
We adopted it.
We'll play a game.
Say 'ahhh'.
Tom's dead, not Mary.
You'd better go.
Which club do you want to join?
Mary will protect you.
Did you buy something for Tom?
He said he didn't intend to go.
The city is two miles from the coast.
Let the tricks begin!
Go help them.
Shouldn't we help them?
Tom's been over 30 years.
You guys are sophisticated.
I think I've been in love with her.
Tom said his house wasn't locked up.
You're part of me.
She took her brother to the zoo.
You look perfect.
I'm actually a bastard.
I don't want to sit next to her.
Look at that!
They know who he is.
Let's talk about it.
It is sick to be obsessed with victory, it is sick to be obsessed with the use of martial arts, and it is sick to be obsessed with presenting all that you have learned. It is sick to be obsessed with the attack, and it is also sick to be obsessed with the defense. It is also sick to be obsessed with getting rid of the disease. Setting the mind ossively on anything is considered disease.
We've booked places for the recital.
These are Tom's books.
I'll learn the loto position during yoga.
Just follow them.
He introduced me to his roommate.
Sami called Layla six months later.
Mr. White went to India.
We're late for about half an hour.
Stay away from the clinic.
I'm gonna go.
He's bleeding.
Do you have a large family?
You have to create problems to make profit.
I'm going to Boston.
Tom decided to sell his house.
You got the rest?
Tom should let me help Mary.
I'm just listening.
We eat apples.
It's a cross with him, he always comes too soon.
That's why I didn't want to go out with Tom.
I hope Tom knows how to fix this.
Are you making friends here?
What would you like for dinner?
Tom didn't expect Mary to be so kind.
Tom left three days ago.
That's why we came here.
Do what you can for them.
Tom made a mistake.
I don't want to look stupid.
I met him at Tokyo Station.
There are a lot of Japanese restaurants in New York.
Tom's a good painter.
Tom seems confused.
I'm sorry.
After that he went home.
I don't care what you drink.
Tom's not fighting, is he?
I downloaded it.
You don't have to justify your decision.
Tom announced his decision Monday.
Dan and Linda spent the summer together.
He believes you.
Be patient with us.
The theory is too abstract for me.
Everybody have a good weekend.
Of course he accepted the invitation.
I want Tom to be put in jail.
I don't like swimming.
Vote my photo!
He said he'd talk to him.
Where did Tom learn to do this?
I'd be a good companion.
Tom didn't want to move to Boston.
The fruits march in the sun.
I gave Tom all the money I had with me.
Think positively.
It's probably Tom's obsessed.
I think it was very funny.
Tom doesn't seem particularly interested in Mary.
I hate the drama.
Last night I couldn't close my eyes.
I'm not worried about you.
I cook for him.
Come here quickly.
Come to me.
Journals and magazines usually have many opinions.
I understand Turkish.
Tom has to live here.
He's a docile.
Tom's attractive.
Shouldn't we try and help him?
Stay focused.
This is a green apple.
It is prohibited in most countries.
Tom helped Mary find John.
It's time to wake up now.
Well, it changes things, doesn't it?
The plane started landing.
I lost my motivation.
Tom wants to be first.
We adopted Tom when he was three years old.
Can you take them?
Tom's body has never been found.
I really liked the movie.
Tell them what you're thinking.
I came to Japan four years ago with the intention of staying for a year.
I was just being educated.
Tom disappeared between the crowd.
He left without a greeting.
He cut the apple in half.
This is Japan.
Tom runs fast like you.
That's not how we get to believe that story.
He doesn't play soccer.
We want to improve.
They drove home.
Is it okay to park here?
Thank you all for your wishes!
He used his bike without asking for permission.
It's very stylish today.
Please take me to the station.
Get Tom to finish what he started.
You'll meet him.
Tom wouldn't like this.
Tom's great.
Have you ever read poems in French?
Tom helped me get out of the pool.
She's mad at you, isn't she?
I have to do my homework instead of coming out.
I'm sorry, my mistake.
The shepherd tells the sheep: "One, two, three, four, five... one hundred."
In this country we condemn minor exploitation.
Tom's pissed off.
Don't leave the bike under the rain.
I spent the whole night talking to Tom.
I'd love to be his age.
I've never worked with her.
You have to sleep more.
He knows what to do.
Tom has something he doesn't see the time to show you.
I want to make sure Tom's guilty.
He died without children.
I wouldn't be surprised.
I'll never do anything like that to you.
The police never introduced themselves.
Speaking of Switzerland, have you ever been in the spring?
Tom didn't want to fix it.
Sami went to the bathroom.
I stayed with my uncle last week.

Did you meet them before?
We're not quite ready yet.
I have no intention of telling him.
I saw his friend the other day.
Give me that money.
Can anyone tell me what's going on here?
I'm tired of eating at school.
I have a lot more to learn.
I should have been with Tom.
You can use my help.
I'm on the roof.
Do you have Guinness?
We know you're not stupid.
Tom's not good at reading the maps.
Tell Tom I won't be there.
Tom's been avoiding me like the plague since he borrowed my car.
Do you think it's attractive?
You have to promise me something.
What would you like us to do?
Did you hear the door open?
Why is it so tricky?
I don't think I'm close.
All Japanese are Japanese.
I just sold the car.
Tom gave Mary a book about Australia.
Make a call to Emet and the others.
Tom should thank me.
I should cancel my trip to Los Angeles.
What would you say?
I have business with him.
She's very small.
Get those tents down and get them cleaned.
Why are they all staring at us?
I'm getting used.
They're not coming, are they?
They were accepted by the school.
Tom takes the bus for the city.
I often feel depressed.
I study sometimes!

I really remember.
You're all for me.
Could you give them a minute?
I thought about the problem.
I've never heard them complain.
I don't like the way Tom dances.
Tom and Mary sang three songs.
I'll pay anything.
Was it in America last month?
Your sister has children?
We can't afford to lose her.
Why did he come home so late?
She's a teacher.
The steak had a wonderful taste.
Tom takes a bath at least three times a week.
I don't have time to read this book.
I have to go find her.
When was the last time you had a shower?
That girl knows German and English.
I don't like anything here.
What do you want to be in the future?
You're right.
He ignored his father's advice.
I need a box of these sizes.
I didn't know you were cutting your hair!
Why do you like this school?
Go to bed at one.
If I tell you a story, will you go to sleep?
I just heard it.
You can choose one.
So what's it gonna be?
Tom loves dating his friends.
Have you ever worked with her?
I intend to see the queen.
Tom's horrible.
I don't want to play with her!
You don't recognize them?
I didn't try to kill them.
You just killed me.
Why won't Tom sing?
I must have made a mistake.

How cute!
Why did you come to Japan?
I hope Tom's joking himself.

Being a prince is not easy.
Don't kiss Tom.
Tom will buy gifts for his loved ones.
Everyone loves her.
No one wants to help her.
She won't survive.

I'm saving to buy a new car.
Tom will trust you.
Tom can't stay long.
The exit is on the left.
These are Tom's.
He went into the bakery.
Tom wasn't supposed to be involved.
I don't need to convince him.
You shouldn't lie to him.
Why did Tom come with Mary?
Your wife driving?
Don't lie to him.
You should discuss this with Tom.
I'd like to live in Iceland.
He chose me.
I have to show you something.
What's the problem?
He had to be told.
I have no idea what's going to happen tomorrow.
Tom and Mary said they didn't want to study French anymore.
It's the first time we've called Marika.
What brand of shampoo do you use?
She's my sister.
Come with me fishing.
Was she surprised to see her?
I already know your secret.
Tom found a job.
I don't want to be with her.
It happened that there was a hole in my pocket.
I shouldn't have.
You'd better not tell Tom.
Tom can't have it.
Let's see who wins!
I'll take him to the hospital.
Didn't he have enough?
I was just looking for her.
Thanks to the detailed explanation.
I gave it to her.
I don't like the theater, but I'm going anyway because I like you.
I need to know.
The police asked Tom.
I don't have time to help her with her work.
I have two brothers.

Come quickly.

You don't believe us, do you?
We're carding the wool.
I'm willing to go to school.
I really appreciate your offer.
You don't have to tell Tom everything.
He looked at us.
I just got here.
I'm sure I'll miss you.
Are you ready for Halloween?
Why would he want to help us?
Tom kept talking.
The bank keeps the money for people.
Tom, where's breakfast?
I'll make some calls.
What I meant was that you shouldn't.
I'll go for a walk if time gets better.
Tom doesn't seem assured.
I know he lives here.
They were very happy.
I should have paid more attention to the indications.
I'd like to go with the others to the party yesterday.
You can always rely on Tom.
Put three books down.
My worst vice is smoking.
She's so uncomfortable with me.
They were all kids' friends.
He knows Tom.
Tom says he didn't do anything wrong.

I found a good job.
He's always ready.
He's throwing the ball.
She always seemed happy, but she never did.

Can I go to school?
You'll see.
You're more proud of a pavlon.
I got up early.
The war is not over yet.
I should take them with me.
I'm beautiful.
You're late this morning.
She's a good mother.
Tom said he'd be right back.
Why should Tom help you?
Do you have a dog?
Do you think Tom's innocent?
Listen, that's enough.
We're selfish.
He'll be a father soon.
We'll never see it again.
It looked dirty.
He's hidden under the bed.

Was I really so busy?

He said he's not an expert.
You know what we did?
We bought the car for $12,000.

You gave up your hand.
Find out what Tom wants.
Next week, millions will watch the TV program.
Get off my car.

Tom remembers you.
We're looking for someone who can use a computer.

She's very sophisticated.
I wonder who bought the cake.
I heard the voices.
There's a question for the public.
It should be revoked immediately.
I had to write her name and her phone number.
I was really confused.
Leave the suitcase there!
I want to eat gimbap.
Can I sleep on the couch?
I'll leave if Tom comes.
I'm very proud of the girls.
I talked to them this morning.
Do you like running?
You're all I have.
Have you had fun at the game?
I wonder if Tom will be here in time.
Look, his daughter was crying.
We've done a lot of fun together.
I'm under cover.
I made him fix my watch.
He opened his window.
Tom and Mary didn't play tennis, did they?
My friend sent me a link to this video.
Tom's not interested.
I chewed the gum.
He never talked much about Tom.
He pushes me in the cracks.
Does she really love Tom?
I loved that dog.
Do you really think Tom and Mary are safe?
I gave him some books.
He listened to my opinion.
Only Tom can talk to Mary.
I don't want to be involved.
Tom won't wait for you.
It's a real challenge.
Are you going to America next month?
I wonder what Tom's doing.
I'm pretty smart.
My uncle lives in Boston.
Tom looked through the hole in the wall.
How long have you been at the zoo?
Please don't leave me with him.
He loves gardening.
Did you pick up your stuff?
Would you like to live with us?
Have you eaten rice yet?
Why aren't you looking for a job?
They all sang in choir.
I'll fix the clauses.
Go home and change my clothes.
I'll give you a hand.
Tom said Mary can do it.
I know everything about you.
I'm allowed to eat anything?
I wasn't allowed in.
I'll drink the tea.
Was my roommate decided?
I've made many mistakes.
I thought it was him.
Call the niney-one!
Tom took my money.
He's an intruder.
You lost the game.
Tom made a big mess.
You have two options: San Paolo and Rio de Janeiro.
Where's your brother?
What brings you back to town?
Don't treat me like a child.
It's okay.
Tom's still planning on going.
You can't buy a car.
The boy remained silent.
Why are you always so tired?
Would it be all right if I asked you something?
We didn't.
Are you taking the train?
Why didn't you come back for them?
Take her.
Would you like an orange?
This phrase is composed of seven words.
Tom will be here soon.
I don't like modern jazz.
Tom was pretty drunk.
We caught them.
I'm dressed in northern Sweden.
Give me that phone back.
She wanted a bigger discount.
I was really bored.
Don't buy those shoes.
Why do you think I'm lying?
I don't want to rent yet.
I have to explain this to you.
I missed you so much yesterday.
Tom is an exceptional person.
Don't threaten me.
I'm a pretty happy person.
Can I tell them why?
Layla called security.
The behavior did not do well to his reputation.
You're beautiful.
Why don't we ask her to help?
I'll give you a good price.
Tom doesn't like being alone.
Tom saw an incident while he was at school.
You think anybody's looking at us?
Give Tom my thanks.
I'm at school now.
Do you believe them?
Don't ask me.
Anyway, I have to finish my job tomorrow.
I was in you, I wouldn't do anything like that.
He's a DJ.
Is your house near here?
I haven't seen him all day.
I heard Tom.
Is there anyone here?
Tom resigned.
My daughter is only 15 years old.
Tell me the truth right away.
I'll give you some money.
Don't you trust me?
Why are you still smiling?
Is he still far from here?
Thank you for breaking my phone.
Are you sure about what you're doing?
Tom had a bad feeling about it.
How much did you invest?
I should do my own business.
Be very happy.
I told him it would work.
There's a sense of bitter irony.
Tom's pretty weak.
I decided to write 20 sentences a day on Tatoeba.
There's a loss in the roof.
Don't work for months.
Are you dating someone?
We're disorganized.
We've really had a lot of fun.
He's still up there, isn't he?
We hope he can go.
Now you have my full attention.
I see a white lion.
I'll dance with them.
I'm drinking tequila.
Tom and Mary were angry with each other.
This job is enough to break my back.
He'll never visit the city again.
Tom seems disoriented.
Tell them I'd help.
Why do you need this stimulant?
I'm working on my project.
Why did you attack me?
Why did he let them go?
Do you mind if I sit on the floor?
What happened to my bag?
Who hired you?
Someone was talking to them.
Tom is a nerd.
I want to find Tom.
Because I've been doing it a lot longer than you.
I support you.
We're students.
The teacher did many tasks for the students.
No one talks to Tom anymore.
Aren't you ashamed to talk like that?
I'm almost ready.
I love your clothes.
Layla heard a familiar sound.
I don't understand Dutch.
I'm sure you despise me.
This describes me so perfectly!
Do you already know the new song?
You're back at 5:00.
Let me be his alibi.
He was walking slowly along the road.
It only takes 15 minutes, doesn't it?
They know who you are.
Tom said Mary didn't seem different.
He writes to me every time.
You're too modest.
Do you want to do iron?
Which cup will he choose?
Avoid it at all costs.
How often do you play golf?
I knew them personally.
I went to college.
I don't have to sleep anymore.
I think Tom's insensitive.
Are you waiting for them?
Don't be mad, Tom.
I like the way Tom thinks.
Tom told me he was going to Boston.
I haven't done it in a while.
Let's start before the sun rises.
I'm not lucky like you.
I didn't do anything wrong.
There must be more than sixty.
I'm having a headache.
He's still his friend, isn't he?
Do you know anything else about Tom?
I paid not less than a hundred dollars for this office.
They smell like wolves from far away.
You're good at this, aren't you?
"What word?" I asked.
Please don't tell anyone.
I wasn't the only Canadian on the bus.
We'll climb the mountain if it makes good time tomorrow.
I'm filling out a lot of things.
Mr. Gorbachev, knock down this wall!
Tom is compiling a form of job request.
You talk too much about him.
Tom started climbing the stairs.
They're all so busy.
I thought Tom would let me go.
We are aware of the risks.
I was home.
You found him lying on the bed.
I'll buy some flowers.
We're just making peanut food.
Take care of them.
She doesn't respect him.
I just told her the truth.
I'm no longer a teacher.
Tom told us a sad story.
I read a magazine to kill time.
If it rains that day, the game will be postponed until the next day when it will be nice.
What time am I now?
Could you be my teacher?
You want a ride home?
I like my cousins very much.
I was in the bathroom.
I'll start working soon.
Layla's back now.
My father is Li Gang!
Thank you for believing in me.
Can I borrow 30 bucks?
My father and I go fishing once and for all.
I've never been in love with Tom.
I don't understand where I was wrong.
Tom was about to kill them.
I've fallen in love with her since I met her.
Would you like to live with us?
I went to the beach with him.
Who taught you German?
I also have the right to privacy.
We can make shoes.
Have you seen that show?
The witch cursed the poor little girl.
I like to do things with Tom.
Tom's rich, isn't he?
It's bad luck, isn't it?
It's probably Tom's got a seat.
Now I'm sorry.
How old was Queen Victoria when she got married?
You want kids?
The nurse measured its temperature with a thermometer.
She can't retire yet.
What's a flame?
He said I shouldn't even be here today.
Sami doesn't like dogs.
Did you close the window?
I was so inspired.
I'm bored, too.
You're 30 minutes away.
Take care of them.
Santa Claus brings presents to children for Christmas.
He's not listening to me.
I'm afraid I don't understand.
Don't eat anything.
I want to hear a story.
It's time to study seriously.
How brave you are!
I told them not to use those.
Tom hopes she's happy.
Be happy.
His clothes are consumed.
Why didn't you tell anyone?
Tom and I are almost equal.
I'll be here tonight.
Take it as it comes.
Tom's helping Mary prepare for the party.
I don't want to do anything today.
Now Tom's busy and he can't help you.
I have to take two pills every six hours.
Tigers can be a mortal threat.
I'm a mule.
How many sisters and brothers do you have?
You're fired.
I refused her invitation to dinner.
How much money do I owe you?
The woman is almost deaf.
Have you ever read the Bible?
I was surprised.
Do you know Tom Jackson?
Don't ask me now.
You got it.
Have they approved your project?
What you say is true in a sense.
Don't come back too soon.
Where did you buy your car?
I didn't agree with Tom.
Tom's gonna pick me up at 6:00.
Don't hurt anyone.
I'll introduce my father.
I'll give them the message.
The future has many names.
My mother can't drive a car.
That's what I told Tom.
This is illegal.
English is always considered an international language.
Something's obviously wrong.
I think this is important.
We meet once a month.
David has so many friends that he can't even remember all their names.
Didn't you know Tom was sleeping?
No one can guess his age.
We now have the biggest problems.
I was wondering what Tom was like.
Ken calls me every day.
I've always been proud of you.
Don't go to Tom.
This room was full of people.
Tom's at my house.
Tom was extremely nice.
I'd rather have a piece of cake.
Do you remember him?
Go help him.
Open the bottle.
He's capable of it.
He said he felt sorry for her.
I'd like to, but I'm not a strong actor.
Tom doesn't have to get up early tomorrow.
My main points of interest are: programming in Python, medicine, mathematics and computer games.
I was forced to leave school.
They're looking at each other.
It doesn't matter what you say, I won't change my mind.
Tom lives in a few blocks from Mary.
Who organized that meeting?
No one supported her.
The nice tail of the pavone helps him attract the women.
The general strike has paralyzed the whole country.
I can teach you how to sell.
Now cancel it.
You're watching movies?
I'll go ahead.
It's a light trip.
He'll follow my advice.
Can I come back now?
Will you vote for her?
Now I'm writing a letter to my Chinese teacher.
I wonder if Tom knows Mary.
Hate the yogurt.
You can't stop them.
You destroyed your enemies.
Oh, a falling star!
Ikea's instructions are not always perfect.
I'd like to go to sleep now.
Tom really likes Mary.
Have you ever heard him sing?
Won't it be there?
Progress has been made.
I know someone's here.
Tom's fine now, isn't he?
Don't practice what you preach.
Mary has big eyes.
To whom does this dictionary belong?
The house was sold for a million dollars.
Ignore them.
I really like my teammates.
Tom said it was fun.
Check it out.
Your method is different from mine.
I don't want to disappoint her.
Congratulations!
Is she going to the theater?
It's your terrible arrogance that makes you completely unbearable.
The first step is the hardest.
Where did Tom learn French?
Did you give it to him?
Let's exercise.
Please indicate my address.
I can't see her.
They feel hungry.
