Big members of the congregation are concerned about the similarity with "Maptovci"
Some members of the congregation are overwhelmed by the proposal to change their title in "Members of the Great Parliament" (MWP).
This was due to plans to change the congregation's name to the Velska Parliament.
Members of the congregation throughout the entire political spectrum are concerned that this could be the subject of ridicule.
A labyrinth member of the congregation said his group was concerned about "because it's rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
For van Vels readers: On a large twp means stupid, and pwp means rash.
A member of the party's political party, Plaid, said the group as a whole "not satisfied" and proposed alternative names.
A member of the big conservative party said his group was "open" on the matter of changing names, but he noted that there was a small difference between MWP's concepts and Mapetovac.
In this context, the word w is similar to the word w in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently working on the draft law on the introduction of changed names, said: "The final decision on the descriptions of the title of members of the assembly will, of course, be made by the members themselves."
The law of the government of Wales of 2017 gave the congregation authority to change names.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public debate on the proposals that resulted in a great support for the assembly's appointment by the Grand Parliament.
When it comes to the title of members of the assembly, the Commission has given priority to calling members of the Great Parliament or WMP, but MWP has received the most support in the public debate.
Members of the congregation allegedly make alternative proposals, but efforts to reach consensus could put the presidency of Elina Jones in a better position, from which it is expected to submit a bill of amendment within a few weeks.
The Reform Act will also include other changes to the way the congregation operates, including rules on the disqualification of members of the congregation and the Commission's system plan.
Members of the congregation will have the last opportunity to vote on their name when they discuss the law.
Macedonians go to a referendum on changing the name of the country
The voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change the name of their country to "The Republic of North Macedonia".
The national vote is organised in an effort to resolve a multi-decade dispute with neighboring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbour represents the occupation of its territory and is persistently opposed to its requirements for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President George Ivanov, an opponent of the plebiscite on the change of names, said he would not admit the vote.
However, referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaeva, believe that the change of names is simply a price they have to pay for EU and NATO membership.
The bells on St. Martin were silenced while the churches in Harlem fought for survival
"The older people I spoke to say that once on every corner there were bars and churches," said Mr. Adams.
"There's no one else today."
He said the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"People are different today," he said.
"Bars are no longer a quarter-day resident in which people go on a regular basis."
As for the church, he's worried that the money from the sale of property won't last as long as the managers expect, "and sooner or later, he'll go back to where they started."
The churches, he added, could be replaced by residential buildings with apartments full of people who won't help keep the remaining quarters.
"The vast majority of people who will buy apartments in these buildings will be white people," he said, "and that will speed up closing these churches because it is unlikely that people who will move into these buildings will become members of these churches."
Both churches built white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and the Church of St. Martin ten years later.
The original white Methodist community moved in the 1930s.
The black community that served nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's church was taken over by a black community under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led the boycott of traders on 125th Street, the main trade street in Harlem, who opposed the recruitment or promotion of blacks.
The 1939 fire was very damaging to the building, but as Father Johnson’s parishioners made a recovery plan, they ordered the authorities.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor in the Church of St. Martin, proudly called the "the bells of the poor."
The expert who played the organ in July called them "cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
Professor Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan also pointed out that these were the first organ in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to larger organ in the church of Riverside 18 years ago.
Mr. Merryweather said St. Martin's Church couldn't replace him.
What was played in St. Martin's Church over the past few months is a complicated story about architects and entrepreneurs, some of whom were brought by church leaders, and others by the Bishops.
The bishop's administration – the bishop's administrative body, composed of church leaders – wrote to the bishop in July expressing concern that the bishop would "try to bear the costs" to the bishop's administration, although the bishop's administration was not included in the rental of architects and entrepreneurs sent by the bishop.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency in the work of the bishop.
The shark injured a 13-year-old during hunting in the autumn in California
The shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy when he was hunting lobsters in California on the day he opened up hunting for lobsters, officials said.
The attack happened something seven hours ago next to the Beach Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel said about KSWB-TV in San Diego that on Saturday he ran around half an hour with friends when he heard the boy who called for help and then led him and the group and helped him get him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was an excitement to catch the lobster, but then he "understanded that he was shouting, 'She bit me!'
She bit me!'
His whole key bone was broken," Hammel said he noticed when he got to the boy.
"I called out to everyone to get out of the water: 'The shark is in the water!' he added.
The boy is transferred by helicopter to the Paediatric Hospital of Raad's where his condition is run as critical.
It's not known what kind of shark attacked him.
The rescuer Captain Larry Giles said in a press address that the shark was already noticed in that area a few weeks earlier, but that it was found not to belong to a dangerous species.
Giles also added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper part of the body.
Officials have closed access to the beach from the Ponto Beach beach in Casablanca to the Swami's beach in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security.
Giles pointed out that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but that most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the beauty market in Britain
Sainsbury's becomes a competition for chains Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams to separate cosmetic products in the style of factory houses where professional assistants work.
As part of a significant market penetration of beauty in Britain worth 2.8 billion pounds, which is growing as sales on fashion markets and household equipment fall, larger cosmetics units will be tested in 11 shops across the country and will be extended to more shops next year if they succeed.
The investment in cosmetic products is due to the fact that supermarkets come up with ways to use the police that have been used for televisions, microwaves and household equipment.
Sainsbury's said it would double its cosmetic assortment by offering more than 3,000 products, including brand products such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing range of brand products L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space in departments similar to those in shops such as Boots.
The supermarket will also relaunch its Boutique makeup line by making most of the products suitable for vegans – something that is increasingly looking for younger customers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop's perfume shop will test selling places in two Sainsbury's shops, one of which was first opened in Croydon, South London last week, and the other will open in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
The purchase on the network and moving to daily purchases of smaller quantities of food in local stores means that supermarkets need to make additional efforts to attract people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, executive director of the Sainsbury's chain, said shops would increasingly look like a business house in the supermarket's efforts to reverse the shock of the chains with the big Aldi and Lidl discounts, with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's opened Argos stores in hundreds of its shops, and he also introduced and divided Habitat since they bought both chains two years ago, which says it increased the sales of food products and the profitability of the purchase.
The previous attempt to modernise its departments of cosmetic and pharmaceutical products has ended unfavorably.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with the Boots launch in the early 2000s, but the partnership ended with a dispute about sharing the income from the pharmacy in their stores.
The new strategy came into force three years ago after Sainsbury's sold his 281 pharmaceutical to Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy for $125 million.
Lloyds was said to play a role in this plan by adding an additional line of luxury products for skin care in four stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, the commercial director of the Sainsbury's chain, said: "We have transformed the look and experience of our beauty departments to give our customers a more pleasant environment.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be at hand to provide advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet all needs, and the attractive environment and practical locations mean that we are now an indispensable destination of the beauty market that sets new standards in relation to the old way of buying."
Peter Jones "infuriated" after Holly Willoughby withdrew from a $11 million deal
The star of the Dragons Den show, Peter Jones, is "sudden" after TV leader Holly Willoughby withdrew from an agreement with his own brand worth 11 million pounds to focus on her contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for his brand home and additional equipment True.
The company of this money is compared to the Goop Gwyneth Paltrow brand.
This Morning (37) is the show's leader who announced her departure via Instagram.
Holly Willoughby pissed off the Dragons' Den Peter Jones show by withdrawing from their profitable brand at the last minute – to focus on their new entry contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources said Jones was "angrily" when a golden girl admitted to television, during a tense meeting on Tuesday in the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, in Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts, worth up to £1.5 million, meant that there was no longer time to devote to their brand of household and additional equipment True.
The company was compared to Gwynet Paltrow Goop and was expected to double Willoughby's wealth estimated at 11 million pounds.
When Willoughby (37) announced his departure on Instagram, Jones flew from Britain to one of his weekends.
The source said, "Holly True put herself at the top of her priorities.
It was supposed to be a long-term plan to secure her earnings over the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw has ruined everything involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday was so close to launch.
In the Marlow headquarters there is a lot of products ready for sale."
Experts believe that the departure of this morning's show's leader, one of the most profitable British stars, could cost the company millions for massive investments in a wide range of products, from pillows and candles to clothing and household equipment, and possible additional delays in the launch date.
And it could mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin were close to Jones and his wife Tari Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Cappov in 2016 and Jones (52) joined in March as company director.
Couples go on vacation together and Jones has 40 percent share in Baldwin's production house.
Willoughby will become an M&S brand ambassador and will replace Anta McPartlin as the leader in the ITV show I'm A Celebrity.
The source close to Jones last night said, "We wouldn't comment on his business."
Hard words, 'and then we fell in love.'
He joked at the expense of criticism that could be received by the media because of comments that could be characterized as "unpresiding" and because of a positive attitude on the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said with his ridiculous voice "the newsreader".
"I didn't give up at all."
He pointed out that Kim was interested in the second meeting after Trump announced their first meeting in June in Singapore as a major step forward to the denuclearisation of North Korea.
But negotiations on denuclearization have stopped.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders and the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see the "adequate response" by the US at the initial steps of North Korea to disarmament.
Instead, he stressed, the United States continues with sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump gave a much more positive opinion during his speech at the gathering.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
"We've been on the move since the war with North Korea.
Millions of people would lose their lives.
Now we have a great relationship."
He said his efforts to repair the relationship with Kim resulted in positive results - the cessation of rocket testing, the release of hostages and the return of the dead remains of American soldiers.
And he stood in defense of his unusual approach to negotiations with Kim.
"It's easy to act presidentially, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this full arena, we'd have about 200 people here," Trump said, pointing to the world in front of him.
Cunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroyed the island by killing hundreds
After an earthquake on the island of Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10% of the population of the island of Lombok is located, the state of the national disaster has not been declared, which is a prerequisite for obtaining international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they are not seeking international assistance, so it will be quite difficult," Mrs. Sumbun said.
While the Save the Children organization is setting up a team to travel to Pala, they are still not sure if foreign personnel can work on the ground.
Mr. Sotopo, spokesman for the National Disasters Agency, said Indonesian officials are assessing the situation on the island of Pala in order to see if international agencies should be allowed to participate in the relief.
In view of the constant earthquake in Indonesia, it is sad how much this country is ready for the wrath of nature.
Although shelters behind the tsunamis are built in Aceh, they are not often seen on other parts of the coast.
Apparently there was no siren in the tsunamis on the island of Pala, although the warning was in force, so it also contributed to the loss of life.
And in ideal conditions, travel between many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
The hospital ship anchored in Lombok to help the earthquake victims is on their way to Pala, but it will take him at least three days to get to the scene of a new accident.
President Joko Widodo focused his election campaign on improving Indonesia's long-term infrastructure and did not save money on roads and railways.
However, the lack of funds has hit Mr. Yoko's administration while the next year he expects new elections.
Mr. Yoko is also under pressure from long-term sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have embraced a more conservative form of religion.
More than 1,000 people have lost their lives and tens of thousands have been displaced because of the street fighting of Christian and Muslim groups, who used swords, bows and arrows, and other primitive weapons.
See: Footballer Liverpool Daniel Sturridge has entered a deep balancing blow against Chelsea football club
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing in the Premier League by meeting in the 89th minute of Saturday at the Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Sturridge received a ball from Xherdan Shaqiri on some 30 yards from Chelsea's naked club while his team lost 1:0.
He moved the ball to his left side and then he jumped to the outside station.
The ball flew high above the penal space, turning to the top right corner of the net.
In the end, she fell over Kep Arizabalg, who was in the jump and got into the net.
"It was just to position, to take the ball, and players like Shaq always go ahead as much as possible, so I just tried to give myself as much time," Sturrudge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming, I touched her once and I didn't think much, I just hit the ball."
Chelsea was leading 1-0 in the half-time after the Belgian star Eden Hazard got a shot in the 25th minute.
In the fifth attack, the blue attacker added the ball to Mate Kovacic before running from the middle of the field to Liverpool half.
The coffin touched quickly and returned the ball to the center of the field.
Then he made a beautiful cross, pointing Hazard into the penal space.
Hazard was faster than defense and ended up near the station by putting his left leg into a net outside Liverpool's Alison Becker.
Liverpool fights against Naples in the group phase of the League of Champions in three hours on Wednesday at the stadium Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea plays against Videoton in the League of Europe in three hours on Thursday in London.
The number of Indonesian tsunami victims reached 832
The number of victims of the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami rose to 832, the state disaster agency said early Sunday.
A lot of people were reported in the ruins of a building that destroyed the 7.5 earthquake that occurred on Friday and raised waves high and up to 20 feet, the spokesman of the Sotopo Purwo Nugroho said at the press conference.
The city of Pala, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is covered by the remains of damaged buildings.
Police arrested a man (32) after a woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation was initiated after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead this morning in the Merseyside area.
Forty-four-year-old girl was found stabbed at 7:55 in the morning at Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 30-year-old man was arrested suspected of murder.
The police have called people who have seen or heard anything to answer.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said, "The investigation is at an early stage, but I invite everyone who was near John Street Street in Birkenhead who saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also invite anyone, especially the taximen, who might have recorded something on the car control panels, to contact us because they may have information that is important to the investigation."
The police spokesperson confirmed that the woman whose body was found in Birkenhead and was found in the house.
This afternoon's friends who think they know a woman came to the front of the room to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation continues, and the police said they were in the process of informing the victim's family.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police informed him that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was left without a text when he found out what happened.
The tenants are now told that they will have to wait hours before they are allowed to come back in.
They heard a cop tell a man that the whole area is considered a crime scene.
One woman came to a crime scene in tears.
She said, "This is so terrible."
At 2:00 a.m., two police vans were inside the police cordon, and another van was next door.
A large number of police officers were inside the police cordon monitoring the residential building.
All who have any information are invited to directly contact @MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact the Crimestoppers line on 0800 555 111, indicating the case 247 of September 30.
Statue Cromwell in parliament became the newest monument in the middle of a "revision of history" dispute
Its removal would represent poetic justice due to the destruction of numerous cultural and religious artifacts in England that have been carried out by its Puritan followers in the manner of the Taliban.
But Cromwell Society's proposal to Mr. Crick described it as "crazy" and "an attempt to review history."
John Goldsmith, president of Cromwell Society, said: "As part of the current debate on the removal of statues, it was inevitable that the character of Oliver Cromwell in front of the palace in Westminster also became a target.
Cromwell didn't order, nor did he commit an iconography during the English civil war.
The wrong Cromwell could be sacrificed for the work of his ancestor Thomas of the past century.
The magnificent depiction of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is evidence of an opinion from the nineteenth century and part of the story of the character that many still believe should be celebrated.
Mr. Goldsmith said about The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps by the end of the nineteenth century more than today, to be the protector of parliament from outside pressure, in his case the monarchy.
Whether this is entirely the subject of a permanent historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-19th century formed further development of our nation and that Cromwell is a recognizable character that represents one side of that division.
His achievements in the Lord's protection are also worthy of glory and remembrance."
The killer's pig caused fatal injuries to the Chinese farmer
Pigs attacked and killed farmers at a market in southwestern China, local media reported.
A man, known only to be Yuan, was found dead with a broken artery and covered with blood in a pig market in the city of Liupanshi in Guizhou area, reported South China Morning Post on Sunday.
Pigs were prepared to inject their pigs with a vaccine in pigs on May 30, 2005, in Xining, Qinghai, China.
He allegedly traveled with his cousin from nearby Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of the neighboring pig was open.
He said there was a big male pig in the pig's mouth.
The forensic investigation confirmed that the pig weighed 550 pounds and killed the farmer, as mentioned in the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and broken," said a relative who introduced himself as Wu, conveys Guiyang Evening News.
The security camera footage shows Yuan who came to the market on Thursday at 4:40 in the morning to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed a man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent the attack on other people while the police collected evidence on the spot.
Yuan's family and market owners are allegedly negotiating a deduction for his death.
Although rare, cases of swine attacks on humans have been reported earlier.
Pig attacked a woman and her husband in 2016 on their farm in Massachusetts, causing critical injuries to a man.
Ten years earlier, the pig had a heavy 650-pounded big farmer with his tractor until his wife was frightened and driven away.
After the pigs ate the Oregon farmer in 2012, a Manitoba farmer said to the CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as an "offender".
"They're just playing.
They like to kick, they're very curious... they don't intend to hurt you.
You just have to respect them enough," he said.
The remains of the Rosa hurricane bring widespread rains to the southwest of the United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa weakened moving above the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring floods due to rains across North Mexico and southwest of the United States in the next few days.
Rosini's first category hurricane winds reached 85 miles per hour from five o'clock in the morning on Sunday morning, and it was 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, I form in the Pacific and move towards the east and west coast of the United States. As the tropical rain of Rosa approaches the Bay California peninsula on Monday, it will start pushing tropical moisture north to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring about 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then the tropical wet together with the rising tail will create widespread rains in the southwest in the following days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will result in floods, pineapple and possible cliffs in the desert.
High tropical moisture will result in falls that will reach locally and 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in the parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Even 2 to 4 inches of rain are expected in the southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
Floods are possible as a result of a sudden deterioration of weather conditions and typical precipitation of the tropical rain.
Walking through the desert would be extremely thoughtless with the danger of tropical rains.
Many rains in the canyons could result in wild rivers and thunderstorms with local strong winds and sandstorms.
As I arrive, I will bring local rains on the parts of the southern coast of California.
It is possible that total falls from more than half an inch, which could cause nanos and slippery Augustes.
This will be the first wet season rain in the region.
The peace of the scattered tropical rain will reach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before the rain becomes more widespread later on Monday and Tuesday.
The beaches will reach Four Corners on Tuesday and will continue on Wednesday.
In October, large fluctuations of temperatures across the United States may occur as the Arctic is getting colder and the tropicals remain rather warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature in short growth.
There is an excellent example of the dramatic difference in temperature in the Central United States on Sunday.
The difference in temperatures in Kansas City, Missouri and Omahi, Nebraska and between St Louis and Des Moins, Iowa, was almost 20 degrees.
During the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try again to buy and expand.
The beginning of October will be warm in most of the central and eastern parts of the United States with temperatures from about 80 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
The temperature in New York could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above average.
The long-term weather forecast announces a great possibility of temperature above average in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people saw Brett Kavanaugh's exciting testimony on Thursday before the High Court and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman who accused him of sexual assault alleged to have occurred in the 1980s on six television networks.
Meanwhile, political resistance continues, with issuers interrupting regular broadcasting due to the latest complexity on Friday: an agreement made by Senator Arizona Jeff Blake with the FBI on a one-week prosecution.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Commission that it was 100% sure to join Kavanaugh and tried to unwind at a high school party.
In a passionate confession, Kavanaugh said that it was 100% sure it didn't happen.
According to Nielsen, this was probably seen by more than 20.4 million people on Friday.
The company calculated CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC viewers.
The numbers were not immediately available for other networks that broadcast it, including channels PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen's usually having trouble wearing people who follow the transfer from the office.
In order to get better acquainted, it's a audience similar to one that's following football elimination swords or Oscar's division.
Fox News Channel, whose editors supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, led in front of other networks with an average number of 5.69 million viewers during the day-to-day hearing, said from Nielsen.
ABC was the second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, said from Nielsen.
Interest is high and after hearing.
Flake was the central character of the drama on Friday.
After the office of the moderate Republican issued a statement that it would vote for the benefit of Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS network cameras recorded footage of the protestors who shouted at him after he tried to enter the elevator to attend the hearing of the judicial commission.
He stood down looking down for a few minutes while he was being insulted, with a live transmission to CNN.
"I'm standing here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the earth?
He was told, 'You have power while so many women are impotent.'
Flake said his office issued a statement and said, before the elevator closed, it had more to say at the commission's hearing.
Cable and television networks had live transmission hours later while the Judicial Commission voted to pass the appointment of Kavanaugh to the Senate to vote.
But Flake said he would do it only on condition that the FBI investigates charges against the so-called next week, which the minority of Democrats calls for.
Flakea was partly convinced of talks with a friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and a few more senators after that, Flake decided.
Flake's choice was significant because it was obvious that Republicans would not have enough votes to confirm Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an investigation of the FBI's charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accused critics of "playing politics" about Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with Britain's future and undermining national interests in a Sunday Times interview.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived at a conservative party conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on 29 September 2018.
In the second interview, which is up to her headline, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued to attack her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying it was a proposal that the UK and the EU take customs from each other "very absurd".
Killing Waydea Sims: Police arrested Dieteon Simpson, a suspect for the death of the LSU player
Police arrested a suspect in a deadly shooting that killed Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson (20) was arrested and arrested under the second-degree murder charge, said Baton Rouge's police department.
Officials published a video recording of the clashes between Sims and Simpson, and the police said Simpson lost his glasses during the fight.
The police took the glasses from the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, the WAFB channel reported the CBS network.
After Simpson's investigation, police said he confessed he killed Wayde.
His bail is $350,000, the lawyer said.
Baton Rouge's death scene issued a preliminary report on Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot shot in the head and neck.
The department said the merits belong to the police working group for the refugees of Louisiana, the criminalist state police lab, the Southern University police and the authorities who helped during the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU's sports club director Joe Alleva thanked the local law enforcement agency for "adultness and desire for justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
A 6-foot and 6-inch attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne was also a basketball player at the LSU.
His average last season was 5.6 points and 2.6 jumps by the sword.
On Friday morning, basketball coach LSU Will Wade said the team was "depressed" and "in shock" because of Wayde's death.
"This is what we keep worrying about," Wade said.
Vulcan throws ashes around Mexico City
The ash that's blushing Volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southern quarters of Mexico's capital.
The National Disaster Protection Centre warned the Mexicans on Sunday to stay at a safe distance after volcanic activity in the crater increased and after 183 gas and ashes emissions were registered within 24 hours.
The center was tracking more earthquakes and thunderstorms.
Pictures on social media show a thin layer of ashes covering windshield cars in Mexico City districts like Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed the increased activity of volcanoes located 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital since the 7.1 earthquake hit Central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police clashed with Catalan separatists in front of the annual independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Sunday after the protestors, independence supporters, clashed with a special police unit, when thousands of people joined counter-demonstrations on marking the annual polarising Catalan expulsion referendum.
A group of masked separatists, detained by a special police force, threw them into the dust with their eggs and colors, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that are usually full of tourists.
Later in the day, he was kicked out and beaten by a police officer who used his pendulums to get him to fight.
Independence supporters have been scanning for hours "No Forgotten, No Forgiveness" and clashing with the Union's supporters who called "Live Spain".
Fourteen people received medical treatment for fewer injuries they suffered in protests, local press reported.
The tensions are still high in the region, which was defined as independence one year after the first October referendum which Madrid declared illegal, but which Catalan separatists celebrate.
The voters chose independence by a vast majority, although the outcome was low because the anti-vaccination opponents boycotted the referendum.
According to information from the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the voting of violent conflicts across the region.
The groups that advocate independence camped Friday night to prevent demonstrations and support the national police.
The demonstrations were still held, but they changed the route.
Narcis Termes (68), an electrician who participated in separatist protests with his wife, said he was no longer optimistic about Catalan independence.
"Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry for happiness because they were allowed to vote, but now we're in a joke," he said.
Although they took a key, but tight victory in the local elections last December, the Catalan parties that advocated independence had difficulty keeping track because some of their most famous leaders were in self-intention or detention, awaiting trial for their role in the organization of the referendum, and then declaring independence.
Joan Puig, a 40-year-old auto mechanic who recorded a police support protest on the phone, said politicians on both sides supported the conflict.
"It's getting tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who was detained since the end of last year, announced his candidacy in the European Parliament elections next year.
"The candidacy in European elections is the best way to condemn the backwardness of democratic values and the repression imposed on us by the Spanish authorities," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after being hit by a car in the house
Three men (33, 34 and 39) were arrested after being hit by a car several times in the Londonderry house.
The incident took place at Ballyngard Crescent Street on Thursday at 7:30 p.m.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gate was damaged as well as the building itself.
There's a possibility that at one point the car was shot from a single shot.
Menge's hit on Livingstone won the 1:0 against Rangers.
First goal Dolly Menge secured a victory for Livingston
The advanced Livingston surprised the Rangers and recorded only another loss for Steven Gerrard in 18 Ibrox matches.
The goal of Dolly Menge was key, while Gary Holt's club was aligned with the Hibernian elsewhere.
Gerrard's club hasn't scored any victory in guests at the Premier League this season and will play against the first-placed Hearts for which eight points remain next week.
Before that, Rangers will be hosting Rapid from Vienna in the European League match on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston extended a series of wins in the league to six matches, and Chief Coach Holt hasn't yet experienced defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed opportunities against a missing guest
Holt's team was supposed to be in charge a lot before they scored because their direct game was very problematic for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson tried, but his attempt went by naked, then Alan Lithgrow's attempt went through naked after he cleaned up to get the ball that Craig Halkett had put on his head.
Hosts were told to allow Rangers to play in front of them, knowing that they could create trouble for guests from free strikes.
And that's how the key goal has been achieved.
He was sentenced to a free blow against Rangers, Livingston made a passage, Declan Gallagher and Robinson together created an opportunity for Mang, who took the ball and hit it from the center of the prison.
So far the Rangers have dominated the ball, but the defense host remained unprovoked and the goalman Liam Kelly didn't have much trouble.
That form continued in the second half, although Kelly had to intervene because of Alfred Morelos.
Scott Pittman stopped the barefoot Ranger Allan McGregor, and Lithgow shot too wide from another free shot for Livingston.
The Croses were constantly arriving in Livingston's penal space and were constantly defended, while two penals they were looking for – one after the faula against the replacement player Glenn Middleton, and the other because of the game – were not assigned.
"The Phenomenal Game" by Livingstone – Analysis
Newspaper BBC Scotland, Alasdair Lamont is in Tony Macaroni arena
The phenomenal game and the result of Livingstone.
Everyone up to one was great and they continue to exceed expectations on the way out.
Their style of games and players have hardly changed since their return to the top, but the great merits belong to Holta who gives energy to the team from his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great, leading an excellent organized defense until Menga gave peace to Connor Goldson and Joe Worral.
However, Rangers lacked inspiration.
From time to time, as good as under Gerard's bat, they didn't reach that level.
The final hits were missing – only once through host lines – and this is a kind of wake-up call for Rangers located in the middle of the table.
Mixed reception for Erdogan in Cologne
Saturday (September 29th) was a sign of a smile and blue sky while Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, whose aim is to improve NATO's relations with the allies.
Issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey's entry into the EU have been distinguished.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
This is the town where the greatest number of Turks live outside Turkey.
Police have cited security measures as a reason to block the gathering of 25,000 people in front of the mosque, but many dockers have gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of Protestants who opposed Erdogan – many of them Kurds – were also loud, condemning Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
Double protests reflect a division in opinions about a guest whom some German Turks celebrate as a hero, while others blame him for being an autocrat.
Traffic accident in Deptford: Biker died in a car crash
The biker died in a car crash in London.
There was an accident near the intersection of Beswood Street and Evelyn Street, on the road in Deptford, on the southeast of the city, about 10:15 after British time.
The car driver stopped and intervened with the ambulance team, but the man died on the spot.
The crash occurred a few months after another biker died in an ambush where the driver left the accident place, on Childers Street, which is about a mile away from the scene of the Saturday accident.
The London police said they were working on the victim's identification and family information.
The streets are closed, the buses are redirected, and drivers are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officials injured in riots
Six prison officials were injured in the riots in the prison of high security for men, said from the Prison Office.
The riots took place in Long Lartin prison, in Worcestershire, on Sunday about 09:30 after British time, and still persist.
He's been invited by a special squad of "Tornado" officials to calm down the nerds in which eight guards participate in one wing of prison.
Officials have suffered fewer facial injuries and help has been given to them on the spot
The prison administration spokesperson said: "We have arranged specially trained prison personnel dealing with an incident in the Long Lartin prison.
Six staff members received medical assistance for the injury.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we have made it clear that the police will be responsible for this and that prison sentences could be extended to them."
Long Lartin prison has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison manager was admitted to hospital treatment after being attacked by the prisoner.
And in October last year, a special squad was called to prison because of serious incidents where personnel were attacked by billiards.
Hurricane Rosa threatens to flood Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Late City (which can be of use in areas affected by drought)
Rarely when tropical depression strikes Arizona, but that's exactly what's likely to happen at the beginning of next week while Hurricane Rosa goes through the desert southwest region with her remaining energy, carrying the risk of flooding.
National Meteorological Administration has already issued flood warnings Monday and Tuesday for West Arizona and South and East Nevada, Southeast California and Utah, including cities Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to pass directly through Phoenix on Tuesday, and her approach will announce on Monday evening.
The National Meteorological Administration in Phoenix said on Twitter that only "ten tropical cyclones since 1950 had maintained the status of tropical storms or depression around 200 miles around Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) is a hurricane that was 40 miles from the Arizona border."
The latest projections of the National Hurricane Centre predict 2 to 4 incandescents and in isolated parts of Mogollon Rome in Arizona and up to 6 incandescents.
In other areas of the Southwest, including the central part of the Rockies and Great Basin chain, there will probably be 1 to 2 inches, and possibly up to 4 inches in isolated parts.
In areas where there is no fear of flood, Rosina rain could be a blessing because the area is hit by drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, some of these falls are likely to be of benefit because the southwest is currently hit by drought.
According to the U.S. Dry Control Agency, little more than 40 percent of Arizona was hit by extreme drought, the second highest category," weather.com said.
First, on its way, Hurricane Rosa will lead to a ski resort on the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
Rosa, who will still have the power of hurricanes on Sunday mornings with winds 85 miles per hour, will be 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and will move at 12 miles per hour.
The storm will reach the colder waters of the Pacific and that's why we'll start eating.
Therefore, it is expected that Mexico will be hit by a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or at night.
The rains in the parts of Mexico could be very strong and can represent a great risk of flooding.
"Total falls from three to six inches are expected from Baja California to the northwest Sonor, and perhaps even 10 inches," weather.com reported.
Then Rosa will go north through Mexico with the force of tropical storms before coming to Arizona early in the morning in the form of tropical depression, which will then pass through Arizona and South Utah on Tuesday late at night.
"The main danger expected from Rose or her remains are the great rains in Baja California, the northwest Sonora and the American South-West Desert," the National Hurricane Centre said.
It is expected that these rains will cause wild floods of life and pineapple in the deserts, as well as cliffs in the mountains.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four persons arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested under suspicion of attempted murder after a sixteen-year-old was found stabbed in Somerset.
Teenagers found injured near Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton on Saturday about 4 a.m. after British time.
He's taken to the hospital and he's in stable condition.
Seventeen-year-olds, two eighteen-year-olds and twelve-year-olds were arrested in the Radstock area, said Avon and Somerset police.
Officials are calling for those who have any video on the phone.
Trump said Kavanaugh "suffered the inferiority and anger" of the democratic parties
"A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the cruel and disrespectful tactics of a democratic party," Trump said at a gathering in Whelling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "suffered the inferiority and anger" of the democratic parties during the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's claim that he had sexually assaulted a few decades ago while he was a teenager.
Ford also testified to the hearing of his charges.
The president said on Saturday that "Americans saw the glory, quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most effective legal minds of our time, a lawyer with great achievements in public service," said a group of supporters in West Virginia.
The president touched directly on the appointment of Kavanaugh as he spoke about the significance of the Republican elections in the middle of the mandate.
"Five weeks of the most important choices in our lives.
Although I'm not running personally, I'm actually running," he said.
"That's why I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere."
Trump claims democracy is trying to "provide resistance and hinder."
The first key procedural vote in the Cavanaugh nomination Senate is expected not later than Friday, a senior member of the Republican Party told CNN.
Hundreds have lost their lives in the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, and the number continues to increase
At least 384 people died, many of them collected by huge waves that hit the beaches, when the great earthquakes and tsunamis hit the island of Sulawesi, the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered because of a beach festival in the city of Pala on Friday when waves hit the coast in the evening up to six meters (18 feet) and many died and destroyed everything they found on their way.
The tsunami followed the earthquake of 7.5.
"When the tsunami threat was announced yesterday, people were still doing their business on the beach and they didn't run away right away, and they died," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesperson of Indonesia's disaster recovery agency, turning to Jakarta.
"Cunami didn't come alone, carrying cars, balvanes, houses, he hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that he traveled over the open sea at 800 kilometers per hour (497 miles per hour) before hitting the coast.
Some people went up to the trees and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in the city of Pala.
Photos from the air, issued by the disaster agency, show a multitude of destroyed buildings and shops, torn and broken bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The raids continued to strike the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquake series hit an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy of the huge earthquake on Friday was 200 times greater than the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
It is possible that the geographical position of the city, located on the edge of the long, narrow Gulf, increased the power of the tsunami, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as an "abundance" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, malls and hotels were destroyed.
The bodies of several victims were found under the ruins of destroyed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 disappeared.
Nugroho said that victims and damage could be larger along the coast 300 km (190 miles) north of Palau, in the area of Dongal, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications "were completely cut off without any information" from Dongala, Nugroho said.
"More than 300,000 people live here," said the Red Cross in a statement, adding that their personnel and volunteers are on their way to the endangered areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could get even worse," they said.
On Saturday, the agency was severely criticized because it did not report that the tsunami hit Paul, although officials said the waves arrived at the time the warning was issued.
Amateur records shared on social networks show a man on the top floor who alerts people on the street below panickingly to the coming tsunamis.
Within a few minutes the water wall hit the shore, carrying with it buildings and cars.
They couldn't verify the authenticity of the video immediately from Reuters.
Earthquakes and tsunamis have caused the disappearance of electricity that has cut off communications around Palu by hampering the government's rescue efforts.
The military began sending cargo planes with humanitarian aid from Jakarta and other cities, the authorities said, but the evacuations still need food and other basic needs.
The city airport is only reopened for humanitarian flights and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo ordered a visit to the evacuation centres in Palau on Sunday.
The number of Indonesian tsunami victims has risen to over 800.
It's very bad.
Although World Vision's staff must have arrived from Dongale in Pala, where the employees were located in tents built in the yard of the office, they witnessed the sights of destruction on the road, said Mr. Doseb.
"They told me they saw many destroyed houses," he said.
It's very bad.
Even when relief teams began taking the first steps to alleviate the disaster, there was a complaint that foreign highly qualified humanitarian workers were not allowed to travel to Paul.
According to Indonesian regulations, the flow of foreign funds, supplies and peoples is only possible if the accident site is declared to be a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"This is still the disaster of the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says 'Okay, this is a national disaster', we will be open to international aid, but that status has not yet been declared."
As the second night of the earthquake and tsunami falls on Paul, friends and families of the missing still hope that their loved ones will be saved by a miracle and that their earthquake story in this natural disaster will be relieved.
On Saturday, the boy was pulled out of the sewer.
On Sunday, the rescuers freed a woman who had been trapped for two days under the ruins of her mother's body.
Gendon Subandano, a Indonesian paragliding team coach, trained two missing paragliders in front of the Asian games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other prisoners at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagija, were his students.
"As an older member of the paragliding team, I carry my emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon recalls that hours after the news of the collapse of Roa Roa's hotel expanded to the paragliding circles, whatsApp sent messages to competitors in Palu who participated in the festival on the beach.
However, his messages had only one gray hook, instead of two blue hooks.
"I think that means messages have not been delivered," he said.
Thieves took $26,750 while filling ATMs in Newport on the Levee complex
On Friday morning thieves stole 26,750 dollars from a Brink employee who filled a ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a police report.
The car driver emptyed the ATM in the entertainment complex and prepared to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a statement.
While he was busy, another man ran behind Brink's employee and stole a bag of money that was supposed to be delivered.
The witnesses saw more suspects running from the scene, standing in a statement, but the police did not specify the number of incidents involved.
All those who have any information about their identity should contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Reper Rename to Ye
Reper Kanye West has changed his name to Ye.
Posting a change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "It will be known in advance under the name of Kanye West."
West (41) has been known for some time under the name Ye and used the title for his eighth album, which was published in June.
There was a change before his performance at Saturday Night Live, where his new Yandhi album is expected to be promoted.
He replaced the singer Arian Grande who canceled the performance for "emotional reasons," the emission author said.
With regard to the abbreviation of his current professional name, West said earlier that this word had religious significance for him.
"I believe that 'yes' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," said West earlier this year as he discussed the title of the album with the radio leader Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It came from Kanye, which means the only, only Ye – which is the reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is more reflective of what we are."
He's one of the many famous repertoires that changed their name.
Sean Combs was known under the names of Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he published that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
Former West's co-worker, JAY-Z, also used versions with or without drawings and big letters.
AMLO in Mexico swore not to use the army against civilians
Mexico's elected president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has sworn that he will never use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of revenge against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday that "he will never use the army to obey the Mexican people".
The army shot at peaceful demonstrations on the market on October 2, 1968, killing even 300 people at the time when left-wing student movements were rooted in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to provide support to young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to those studying and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of opportunity to educate young people into criminal gangs.
The United States should double the funding of artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount spent on research in that field, the investor and artificial intelligence practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple, said.
The comments came after various parts of the American authorities published publications on artificial intelligence, although the United States generally does not have an official strategy in the field of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China published its plan last year: their goal is to be the first in the field of artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
"The double artificial intelligence budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind the United States, and we are looking for a new breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence," Lee said.
Double funds could double the chances of next great achievements in the field of artificial intelligence happening in the United States, Lee said in an interview with the CNBC this week.
Lee, published by the publishing house Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is the executive director of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most outstanding art intelligence companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an artificial intelligence system that proved to be superior to the most ranked American Othello player, and later he was executive director of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese Google border.
Lee confessed to earlier American government technological competitions such as the Robotics Challenge Agency for advanced research projects and asked when they planned the next competitions that could be identified by future visionaries.
Researchers in the United States often have to make huge efforts to get government subsidies, Lee said.
"We're not being taken away by China's academic leaders, they're doing corporates," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have over the last few years hired brilliant individuals from the university to work on art intelligence.
Lee said that changes in immigration policies could also help the United States to strengthen its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think we should automatically offer green cards to doctors from the field of artificial intelligence," he said.
The Chinese State Council issued its plan to develop the artificial intelligence of the new generation in July 2017.
The Chinese National Foundation for Natural Sciences grants grants to people in academic institutions in a similar way as the National Scientific Foundation and other government organisations give money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year in the United States, the Department of Defence formed a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, which seeks to include partners from industry and the academic community, and the White House published the formation of the Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced an investment of two billion dollars for an initiative called AI Next.
As for the National Scientific Foundation, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in the research of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, American legislation that has tried to form the Commission's national security for artificial intelligence does nothing for months.
Macedonians vote on a referendum on the change of state name
Macedonian citizens voted on Sunday's referendum to change the country's name in "North Macedonia Republic", a step that would resolve a decade-long dispute with Greece that blocked their membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that its northern neighbour's name represents the occupation of its territory and has vetoed their entry into NATO and the EU.
Two governments have reached an agreement on the proposed name in June, but nationalist opponents claim that this could endanger the ethnic identity of the majority of Slavs in Macedonia.
President George Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign raised questions as to whether the referendum would result in a minimum of 50 per cent of what it takes to make the referendum valid.
The question on the ballot was: "Are you in NATO and the EU for membership by accepting an agreement with Greece?"
Actors of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaeva, claim that this is the price Macedonia, one of the countries created by the collapse of Yugoslavia, is worth paying to enter bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they could live freely within the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us," said Oliver Georgievska (79) in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, a sufficient number of members of parliament said they would be guided by the result of the vote and the result would be decisive.
A two-thirds majority in Parliament would be needed to change names.
The State Election Commission said there was no report of irregularities by 1 hour in the afternoon.
However, output was only 16%, compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when a total of 66% of voters were elected.
"I came to vote for my children, we have a place in Europe," said José Tanevski (62), a voter in Skopje's capital.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dusko voted in the Macedonian referendum on change of name, which could open their way for membership in NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov (54) prepared a small bin and dragged chairs in front of the tents that had been torn apart by those who would boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join raised heads, not at the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are poor, but a proud country.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of the Euro-Asian community."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership will bring over the necessary investment in Macedonia, whose unemployment rate is more than 20 per cent.
"I believe that a large majority will vote 'for' because more than 80 per cent of our population for the EU and NATO," Zaev said after posting the leaflets.
He said the "for" result would be "the confirmation of our future."
The poll published on Monday at the Macedonian Institute for Political Research says that between 30 and 43 per cent of voters will participate in the referendum – which is below what is needed.
According to another poll conducted by Macedonian Telma TV, 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of that number, 70% said they'd vote for.
In order for the referendum to be successful, it takes an exit of 50 percent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the Western government since it came to power last May.
See: player Manchester City Sergio Aguero passes through the entire Brighton defense and achieves goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling resolved Brigton's defenses in the victory of 2:0 Manchester City against Brigton at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
It seemed very easy when Aguero reached the goal in 65 minutes.
The Argentine attacker received a ball in the middle of the field at the start of the action.
He ran between three Brighton defense players before he found himself in the open field.
Aguera then surrounded three green clothes.
He rushed around a defensive player and was faster than a few more on the edge of Brighton's naked.
Then he added on the left, finding Sterling.
The British attacker took advantage of his first hit in the penal space to return the ball to Aguer, who right-handedly dominated the Golman Brighton Matthew Ryan by hitting the right-hand side of the net.
"Aguero had some foot problems," coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what it was.
We're happy that he scored the goal at that point."
But Sterling was the one who gave the skyscrapers the first advantage in the Prime Minister's mess.
He scored a goal in 29 minutes.
In that action, Aguero received the ball deep into Brighton's part of the field.
He added Leroy Sane beautifully on the left.
Sane touched a few times before sending Sterling to naked.
The blue attacker threw the ball into the net before he slipped out of the field.
The city is fighting Hoffenheim in the group phase of the League of Champions at 12:55 on Thursday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play a game without competing with Rockies
Since the Nationals were eliminated in the elimination game, there was no reason to insist on another party.
But the contestant Scherzer hopes to take a stand Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies, who are taking the lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West, are still in high school.
Rockies at least have a direct pass for the 5:2 victory against the Nationals on Friday, but they're still trying to win the first title in the league.
"Although we don't play for anything, at least we can go out on the field knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with fans and other teams will probably be at the highest level compared to all the other years.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in those circumstances?"
Nationals still need to publish the initial team for Sunday, but they're supposed to let Scherzer throw in that situation.
Scherzer, who would be the 34th time he started the game, trained Thursday and will throw Sunday when he usually takes off.
The Washington Right Guides 18:7 this season at an average of 2.53, 300 standing in 220 2/3 inches.
Trump held a meeting in West Virginia
The president took a brief look at the situation regarding the election of his candidate for the Supreme Court, Bretta Kavanaugh, as he spoke about the importance of the Republican's leaving in the elections at half the term.
"All we've done will be on the dice in November.
We're five weeks from the most important choices in our lives.
These are one of the big, big – although I didn't run, I was actually a candidate because I fight for great candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump went on, "Look at these terrible, terrible groups of radical democrats, that's what's happening right now.
And they are determined to give back power using all possible ways, see evil, dirty games.
No fear shall be on him who is injured, nor on him who is overtaken, in order that he attains power and control; these are the ones whom they desire, and We shall not grant them that.
The Democrats, he said, are in the mission of "resistance and interference."
"And you've seen it in the past four days," he said, calling the Democrats "an angry, evil, and dishonest."
He cited a democratic senator and a member of the Senate Judicial Commission, Diana Feinstein, as the name that prompted the public to speak out.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you let the document go to the public?
Uh, uh, what?
No, no, I'm waiting -- that was really a bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party no longer accepts different positions.
It is intolerant to those who express their opinion
When Momentum activists in my local party border voted to censor me, I was not surprised at all.
After all, I am the last in a number of Labour Members of Parliament who were told not to welcome, and all because of what we have expressed our opinion.
My colleague in Parliament Joan Ryan was treated similarly because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censors criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corby.
The importance of responsible economic policy, of national security, of Europe, and it is ironic that these are similar problems that Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
Notice from the meeting of the Nottingham East Labour Party's border "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
During the eight years I spent as a local laboratory member of parliament, Friday night meetings were mostly the same.
Unfortunately, the tone of many meetings today is not the same and the promise of "more kind, more gentle" policy has long been forgotten, and the question is whether it has ever been.
It has become increasingly evident that different opinions are not tolerated in the Laborist Party and each opinion is assessed on the basis of whether it is acceptable for the party leaders.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when my colleagues I believed we were sharing similar political views, began expecting me to turn 180 degrees and take up positions that I would never agree with otherwise, whether it was national security or the single market of the European Union.
Whenever I speak in public – and it doesn’t matter what I say – it is accompanied by a wave of insults on social networks, calls for removal from the party, condemnation of central politics and telling me I shouldn’t be in the lab party.
And it's not just me.
On the contrary, I know that I am happier than some of my colleagues because the comments are mostly political.
I'm impressed by the professionalism and determination of a colleague who's going through every day with a bunch of sexist or racist insults, but he's not pulling back.
Something that disappointed me most at this political time was how these levels of insult became normal.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the labyrinth party should care for the culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer parties that accept different positions and each voice of distrust or change the rules of the party selection is narrowed down.
I've got a lot of advice, and for the last two years, they've been telling me to raise my head, be less loud, and then I'm gonna be "okay."
But that's why I didn't get into politics.
Since I joined the Laborist Party 32 years ago, provoked by the government of Prime Minister Thatcher, which literally led my elementary school student to fail, I have been struggling to assume that better public services to those who are most needed, either as local councillor or as a minister in the government.
I've never hidden my policy, including the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could have been confused by my political positions and areas of disagreement with the current management.
To those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would recommend that, when the country rushes to Brexit that threatens the households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand why someone would waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labor Party.
But the main message I have is not addressed to Momentum in Nottingham, but to voters in my election unit, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that the threat of removing me from the party or political stimuli will not prevent me from acting in a way that I think is in the best interest of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unbeatable Ayr at the top
Two late attempts may have somewhat distorted the final outcome, but there is no doubt that Ayr won a win in this exciting day's game at Tennant's League Prime Minister.
Now they're at the top of the table, the only unbeatable of ten teams.
In the end, the home team took the victory thanks to the superior defense, as well as the larger number of opportunities used, and coach Peter Murchie had reason to be satisfied.
"So far we've been tested in games and we're still unbeatable, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melbourne said, "Ayru any honor, they've taken advantage of their opportunities better than we have."
The attempt by Grant Naderson in the 14th minute that turned Frazier Climo, gave the advantage to Ayr, but it was a yellow card for Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, whom the Warriors let play, allowed Melrose to take advantage of the numerous advantage and Jason Baggot caught an unimaginable attempt.
Climo's pendulum increased Ayra's leadership before, just before half-time, he made a solo attempt to score 17:5 for Ayr in half-time.
But Melrose began well in the second half and tried Patrick Anderson, who turned Baggot into a five-point leader.
Then there was a long interruption due to the serious injury by Ruaridh Knott, who was brought out on the carrier, and Ayr continued to increase the advantage of the attempts by Stafford McDowall, who transformed Climo.
Captain Ayra's deputy, Blair Macpherson, then got a yellow card, and Melrose again took advantage of a number of powers with Bruce Colvin's unimaginable attempt, after a period of severe pressure.
However, the hosts recovered and when Struan Hutchinson got the yellow card because of the faul over the no ball. MacPherson reached the touch down from the penal line behind the approaching Ayra.
Climo turned, as he did almost from the beginning of the sequel, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's punch into the penal space and sent Gregor Henry's wing for the fifth attempt of the host.
Still game star is preparing for a new career in the restaurant industry
The Still game star, Ford Kieran, is ready to move to the hospitality industry after learning that it is appointed director of the company of licensed restaurants.
A 50-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC series that he writes about and plays together with his longtime comedy partner, Greg Hemphil.
The two announced that the upcoming ninth season would be the last in the series and Kiernan seems to be planning life after Craiglang.
According to the official records, he is the director of Aragingmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the news, although the source of the Scottish Sun's journal revealed that Kiernan wanted to be included in the "growing restaurant business" in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, which has no way out of the sea, hopes that the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
Marines patrol the marine headquarters in La Paz.
In public buildings, the winds of the oceanic flag.
Sea bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are intertwined with slogans: "We have the right to the sea.
Returning to the sea is our duty."
Throughout Bolivia's land, there is still a strong memory of the coast lost to Chile's bloodstream around the natural resources of the nineteenth century – as well as the desire to reinvigorate the Pacific.
These hopes may be the greatest in the last few decades while Bolivia expects the verdict of the International Court of Justice on October 1st after five years of consultation.
"Bolivia has caught a bite, in the spirit of unity and virtue, and of course expects a positive result," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the verdict of the International Court of Justice on large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague court will judge for the benefit of Bolivia and claims that, after decades of grueling negotiations, Chile must agree to negotiations on giving Bolivia a sovereign exit to the sea.
Here's Morales, the charismatic Bolivian president of native origin, who faces a controversial fight for a re-election next year, also has a big role to play when it comes to the verdict that will be delivered on Monday.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide for the benefit of Bolivia, and that it will change a little even if it decides.
The United Nations body with its seat in the Netherlands has no power to allocate Chilean territory and has indicated that it will not decide on the outcome of the negotiations.
The fact that the verdict was expressed only six months after the last arguments were heard suggests that the case "was not complicated", said Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And instead of making progress in the Bolivian case, for the last four years, it may have been backwards.
"The problem of getting out of the sea has been captured by the current Bolivian authorities," Zarate said.
Morale's war rhetoric has killed the rest of Chilean goodwill, it's gone.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at one time, but it will be very difficult to hold those negotiations after this.
These two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltze, a Bolivian representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually quick.
On Monday, Bolivia will bring "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "put a point on 139 years of dissatisfaction on both sides," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America – used the issue of going out to sea as a political stick.
"Bolivia will never give up her right to exit the Pacific," he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to realize that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says it won't come to disarmament until they can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people would not stop nuclear weapons until they believed in Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to comply with the promises made during the Singapore summit between conflicted leaders.
His comments came at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the border to resume the deadening of nuclear negotiations, more than three months after Singapore and a meeting with Kim Jong Un from North Korea.
Rei says it's just a dream that the continuation of the sanctions and opposition of the US declaration ending the Korean war will ever throw North Korea on its knees.
Washington is not prepared to agree with the declaration until Pjongang takes significant steps towards disarmament.
And Kim and US President Donald Trump want another summit.
However, the government is general skepticism when it comes to the seriousness of Pjongang's rejection of the nuclear arsenal that that country probably sees as the only guarantee of its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pjongang next month to prepare another Kim and Trump summit.
The latest series of huge hats presented in Paris’ fashion magazines that you will soon see in the nearby shopping street
If you want to increase the collection of hats or completely protect the sun, you are in the right place.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a series of draped huge hats on the tracks of their summer and summer magazines, all in Paris's fashion week.
Extremely practical hats have won Instagram this summer, and these designers on fashion trails have shown their impressive creations.
Valentine's most prominent piece was a highlighted hat with a wide pern area that swallowed the head of the model.
Among the other bulky additions there were beads with decorative stone, magic hat, and even pineapple, but their aim is not to keep your head from freezing.
Thom Browne also presented a collection of bizarre masks and it was just in time for Halloween.
Many of the hairy masks had our lips twisted, and they looked more like Hannibal Lecter than they were in high fashion.
One creation resembled a diving equipment with a breather and a mask, and the other resembled a cornet with an incinerated ice cream.
And if you are among those who follow the trend of attracting attention - you are lucky.
Those who follow fashion predict that huge hats can be found on nearby shopping streets.
The huge hats came after the "La Bombe", a broken hat with a two-foot band seen on many stars, from Rihanne to Emily Ratajkovski.
A cultural brand that invented this very impractical hat that flooded social networks, sent another great creation on the track – a broken beach bag that is almost as big as the model it wore.
Zagasitonarangasta bag of rafia with travels and white skin lunch was highlighted in detail by Jacquemus La Riviera collection for spring and summer 2019 at the Paris Week Fashion.
Stylist of the famous Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: "I expect big hats and beach bags to arrive at the shops in time for next summer, since the designer left such a huge impression it would be difficult to ignore the demand for pre-eminent fashion supplements."
John Edward: Getting to know the language is of key importance to the citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland can be commended for their outstanding academic achievements, and this has continued in 2018 with a new series of extraordinary results in the trials, which has been further strengthened by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other activities in the community.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, this school that represents the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strives to provide the best level of service to its students and parents.
Independent schools are trying to prepare students for further education, a chosen career and a place in the society of citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement its own teaching plan and programme, we see that modern languages are still popular and desired election subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it's up to him.
If you speak to him in his language, it will touch his heart."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely only on English if we want to build good relations and trust with people from other countries.
Judging from the results of this year's exam, we see language at the top of the league table, with the highest pass scores in independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who learned foreign languages received A at the final high school exam.
Data collected by 74 SCIS school members showed that 72% of students received A from the Mandarin language in the final exam in secondary school, while 72% of those learning German, 69% of those learning French and 63% of those learning Spanish also received A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as key skills that will undoubtedly be needed for children and young people in the future.
Languages are now treated in the same way as STEM subjects (natural sciences, technology, machinery and mathematics) and in programs of independent schools, and elsewhere.
A survey carried out by the British Commission on Employment and Skills in 2014 showed that 17 percent of the reasons why employers cited difficulties in filling jobs were just a lack of those who know foreign languages.
So knowing foreign languages is becoming more and more necessary for young people to prepare for their future careers.
With more and more potential jobs requiring knowledge of foreign languages, this skill is necessary in the world of globalisation.
No matter what career a person chooses, if he knows another language, he will have a true advantage in the future because it is a lifelong skill.
They will be able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically put a person who speaks more languages in front of competition.
According to a survey conducted by more than 4,000 British in 2013, 75 percent did not know how to speak another language well enough to conduct the conversation, while the French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15 percent.
Therefore, investing in learning foreign languages is important for today’s children.
Knowing more languages, especially those used in developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding a meaningful job.
Every school in Scotland is different when it comes to the language you learn.
Many schools will focus on classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered more important for Britain by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interests are, there will always be several languages he can choose in independent schools, with professional teaching staff in this area.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing learning environments that will prepare children and give them the skills they need to succeed, regardless of what lies ahead.
At this time, it cannot be denied that in the global business environment, language is of key importance for the future of the country, so it must be reflected in education.
Modern languages must certainly be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to provide this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
It's a good thing to do.
John Edwards is the director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council.
LeBron will debit to Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
Waiting is soon over for fans who want to see LeBron James' first performance for Los Angeles Lakers.
Coach Lakers, Luke Walton, announced James will play Sunday in a pre-season match against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But you still don't know how many minutes they're gonna play.
"It'll be more than one and less than 48," Walton said at Lakers' official website.
Reporter Lakers, Mike Trudell, claimed James would probably play a limited number of minutes.
After training at the beginning of this week, James was asked about plans in six games during the Lakers Presession.
"In this stage of my career, I don't need preseasonal swords to prepare," he said.
Trump's gathering in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump started a series of pre-election meetings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of Trump's five scheduled meetings next week, including visits to friendly and friendly places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While waiting for his vote to fill the empty space in the Supreme Court, Trump plans to increase support in the upcoming elections at the centre of the mandate, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress after the vote in November.
When's Trump's meeting in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it on the network?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for seven hours this evening after east time, on Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can watch Trump's band in West Virginia under live broadcast on YouTube.
Trump will probably talk about hearings this week about Brett Kavanaugh's nomination for the Supreme Court in which he was charged with sexual harassment, and the expected vote in the Senate was postponed within seven days until the FBI conducts the investigation.
But the main objective of this series of meetings is to help the Republicans achieve a better outcome in the November elections.
Therefore, President Trump's campaign said that meetings this week are being held to "give energy to volunteers and supporters while the Republicans are trying to protect and extend the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters information.
"Congress control is such a key part of his agenda that the president will travel as many countries as possible as we enter the pre-election campaign season," Reuters spokesperson Trump's campaign that refused to present itself.
Appointed at Westbanko Arena in Wheeling, tonight's assembly could bring together supporters from "Ohia and Pennsylvania and attract the attention of the media from Pittsburgh", according to a West Virginia Metro News exhibition.
On Saturday will be the second time this month Trump will visit West Virginia, a country in which he won a victory with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate for the Senate from West Virginia, which is not well on the polls.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has come to try to raise his rating in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a politician at West Virginia University, according to the Reuters report.
Ryder Cup 2018: US team showed fighting to keep hope before individual matches on Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, the four on Saturday afternoon may be exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
The bell is a completely invented concept in sport, but one of those in which players truly believe, especially in competitions like this.
What do they think, who's got a spell right now?
"They've run six points, and now four, so it can be said that the swing is on our side," Jordan Spieth said on his way.
Europe, of course, has an advantage, four points more, with 12 more in play.
The Americans, according to Spieth, still believe that they have some wind in their wings, and there are many things that provide them with encouragement, between the rest of the forms Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each took three points of possible four.
Spieth was brilliant from the first to the last blow and led by his example.
Celebrations became louder during his round to finally play a key blow for unresolved result in the fourth match when he and Thomas were behind for two after two.
His final blow with a 15-hole match was welcomed by a similar call, the one that reflects the faith that there is hope for the American team.
"You just have to give everything up and take care of your sword," Spieth said.
That's all that's left of these players now.
18 holes that can bring glory.
The only players with more points than Spythe and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, undoubtedly Ryder's main story.
An unusual but unbearable European couple won all four matches and played without a mistake.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't play God's hits on Saturday afternoon, and they got away from them on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
The game they have shown up to now also the way they exchange energy with the loud audience have strengthened them in the position of main favorites on Sunday and there are no more popular players than Fleetwood or Molinaria who could take a potential European victory while the sun falls on the Le Golf National grounds.
It would be best both at the same time at different holes.
However, it is still early to talk about the European celebration.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly took control of Sergey Garcia, a hero of the four-ball game that morning, when he was playing together with Alex Noren.
One divine blow and two doubles in the first nine holes buried Spain and Sweden in a hole from which they could not even dig.
However, on Sunday no one can help you get out of your hole.
The game with four balls and fours is so fascinating to watch the proximity due to interaction between couples, advice that they give and that they don't give, and the ways in which the strategy can be changed at the moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has a great advantage before the final day, but this session has shown the four and that the US team has a desire to fight in which some have suspected, especially in the continental part of America.
Europe leads 10:6 before the last day of Ryder Cup
Europe will enter the last Ryder Cup with considerable pretence, since after Saturday's games with four balls and four of them won a 10-6 victory over the United States.
To inspire a couple, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, the first to lead with two victories over the unsatisfied Tiger Woods, increasing the results so far on the Le Golf National field at four points.
Europeans Thomas Bjorn fought to regain the trophy they lost at the Hazeltine Golf Club two years ago, dominated the inaccurate Americans in the morning game with four balls and won the 3:1 series.
The United States has provided greater resistance to the four-star tournament, winning two matches, but they could not cut back.
Team Jim Furyk has to win eight points in 12 individual matches on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European debit to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, called "Molliwood" after a fantastic weekend, only the second pair in Ryder Cup history, won four points in the first four matches.
After crossing Woods and Patrick Reed in the game with four balls, they made great compositions and mastered the exhausted Woods and American debuter Bryson Dechambeau with even more convincing 5:4.
Woods, who pulled himself through two swords on Saturday, was flashing for moments, but now he lost 19 of the 29 matches in a game with four balls and fours and seven in a row.
Juston Rose, who took a break during the morning game with four balls, returned to partner Henrik Stenson to the fourth tournament and suffered defeat 2:1 from Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepk – the first and third in the world.
Yet Europe did not all go according to the plan of this pleasant afternoon south-west of Paris.
The triple winner of the Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas tournament set the goal for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They had a hard time winning 2:1 over John Rahmo and Ian Poulter in a game of four balls to come back and win Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4:3 in fours, after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder's history buys some team came back after four points left before the individual matches, although Fury's side defending the title is enough unsolved result to keep the trophy.
However, after two days in another location, it seems that they could not carry out the attack on Sunday.
North Korea advises that "no speech" about unilateral disarmament if there is no trust
North Korean Foreign Minister said on Saturday to the United Nations that extending sanctions deepens its mistrust in the United States and that in such circumstances the country will not give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
At the annual UN General Assembly, Ri Yong Hu said North Korea has taken "significant steps to show good will" over the past year, such as the interruption of nuclear and missile testing, the dismantling of nuclear polygons and the promise not to increase nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, there is no proper response from the United States," he said.
"Without any confidence in the United States there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there will be no talk of the first unilateral disarmament."
Although Ri reiterated the well-known North Korean complaints of Washington's opposition to the "step" approach to denuclearization that North Korea would be rewarded for step by step, the significance of his statement was that he did not reject unilateral denuclearization from the game as Pjongang had previously done.
Ri called for a joint statement by Kim Jong Una and Donald Trump at the first summit held between the current president of the United States and North Korea on 12 June in Singapore, when Kim promised to work on "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula", while Trump pledged to provide North Korea with a security guarantee.
North Korea seeks the formal end of the Korean War (1950-53), but the United States has announced that Pjongang must first surrender its nuclear weapons.
Washington also listened to calls to mitigate international sanctions in North Korea.
"The United States does not give up 'denuclearisation first' and increases the level of pressure on sanctions to achieve its goal in force, even opposed to 'declaration of the end of the war'," Ri said.
"The idea that sanctions can throw us on our knees is to let the dreams of people who don't know us.
But the problem is that extended sanctions deepen our mistrust."
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump that American leader spoke about in the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae over the past five months and added: "If we were to negotiate this problem on denuclearization with South Korea, rather than the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not come to such an unprecedented position."
Yet, the tone of Rio's speech was radically different from last year, when at the UN General Assembly said that shooting American ground rockets in North Korea was inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim "a rocket" on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations Trump, who threatened last year to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take steps to armament, but said that much more must be done and that sanctions must remain in force until North Korea is denuclearised.
On Wednesday Trump said he had not set a time frame for this, saying, "If necessary, let it last two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter."
China and Russia claim the UN Security Council should reward Pjongang for the steps they have taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The sanctions of the Security Council must continue to be strictly and unhindered until complete, final, confirmed denuclearisation is achieved."
The Security Council unanimously supported sanctions against North Korea that have been applied since 2006, in an attempt to prevent the financing of nuclear and ballistic missile programmes in Pjongang.
Pompeo met with Rio outside the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pjongang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
He's been visiting North Korea three times this year, but his last trip didn't go well.
In July he left Pjongang with the words that he had made progress, and North Korea condemned him after just a few hours for "gangster demands".
North Korea promised at a meeting with Moon this month that it would dismantle a rocket polygon as well as a nuclear complex if the United States took "relevant measures".
He said Kim told him that there are "adequate measures" requiring security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and steps to normalize relations with Washington.
The Harvard students take a course on how to get enough rest
The new course at Harvard University this year aims to make students sleep more in an effort to eliminate the increasingly popular sword of learning culture "all night with the help of caffeine".
One academic observed that students at the leading university in the world are often ignorant of their basic concern.
Charles Cheisler, professor of medical science at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has set up a course he considers to be the only species in the United States.
The inspiration to start this course was given after a speech that held about the impact of lack of sleep on learning.
"Then came a girl to me and said, 'Why are you telling me this now, in my senior year?'
She said that no one ever told her how important a dream was – which surprised me," she said about The Telegraph.
The course this year is held for the first time gives students the basis for how good sleep habits contribute to better academic and sports outcomes, as well as to improving their overall situation.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University Health Service, said the university decided to introduce a course after it was observed that during the week students suffered from a serious lack of sleep.
The one-off course covers a number of interactive tasks.
In one part is a picture of the room in the student home and students should click on the coffee schools, curtains, patches and books to hear more about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as about the impact of lack of sleep on athletic performances and the meaning of pre-sleep routines.
In the second part, participants were told that a long-term lack of sleep could increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Then the map of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We are aware that this will not at the moment change the behavior of students.
But we believe they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know what health effects it has on smoking cigarettes," said Professor Cheisler.
The culture of pride for the "awaken night" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students have led to a growing shortage of sleep.
A sufficient amount of sleep, and that of quality, should be the "secret weapon" of students in the fight against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said -- even against a higher kilograms, because as a result of the lack of sleep, the brain is going into the mode of starvation, so they are still hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student of chemical and physical biology from California, helped Professor Cheisler to come up with a course after he attended one of his lectures last year at Harvard.
He says this course opened his eyes and inspired him to bet on his maintenance at the level of the whole campus.
It is hoped that the next step is to ask all post-graduate students to pass a similar study programme before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Cheisler recommended that students think about setting up an alarm in time for sleep and awakening and that they account for the damaging effects of "blue light" that emit electronic screens and LED lighting and can interfere with the Circadian rhythm, thereby causing sleep problems.
Livingston 1 – 0 Rangers: Mengin goal defeated Gerrard's team
The Rangers experienced another depressing defeat in the guests when Dolly Menga sent his shoe to the clear Steven Gerrard team to defeat 1:0 from Livingstone.
The team from Ibrox wanted to take the first victory in the guests after the February 4th triumph in St. Johnstone, but the team of Gary Holt won Gerard as manager only a second defeat in 18 matches, leaving his team eight points behind the invincible leaders of the Ladbrokes League Prime Minister, Hearts.
Menga hit seven minutes before half an hour ago, and the uninspired character of Rangers never came close to evening.
While the Rangers now fell to six places, Livingston climbed up to the third and behind are Hibernian only because of the goal difference.
Rangers could face additional problems after the Linen Judge Calum Spence had to show help when he was being shot on the side of an object.
Gerrard made eight changes in the team that beat Ayr and placed himself in the semifinals of the Bethfred bath.
On the other hand, Holt identified himself as the same eleven Livingstone players who took the point of Hearts last week and would be thrilled by the way his well-trained team pressured opponents on every step.
Maybe the Rangers dominated the possession of the ball, but Livingston made better use of his time with the ball.
It was a little short of reaching the goal just two minutes after Menga sent Scott Pittman to the goal of Allan McGregor, but the player in the middle of the field missed a great chance and shot next to the goal.
Deeply free hit Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett, but his partner in defense Alan Lithgow just managed to shoot next to the naked end of the station.
Rangers managed to take control, but their game in the last third gave more hope than faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly thought he was supposed to get a penalty in 15 minutes when he and Steven Lawless clashed, but Judge Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian request.
The Rangers made only two hits on the goal in the first half, but the former goalman Ibrox, Liam Kelly, without any major problems, defended the hit by Lassana Coulibaly's head and captured the shot that directed Ovie Ejaria.
Although the first goal of Livingstone in the 34th minute may not reflect the real relationship of the force during the game, no one can argue that he was deserved, if for nothing else, then for the effort he made.
The Rangers couldn't afford to fight Jacob's deep free strike again.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher added Scott Robinson's ball, which remained calm and chose Meng for a simple finish.
Gerrard reacted to the interruption of Ryan Kent's introduction instead of Coulibaly and this replacement almost immediately resulted in the wing player's employment of Morelos, but impressive Kelly ran off his line and blocked him.
Livingston, however, continued to instruct guests to play exactly the way it suits them, with the long balls of Lithgowa and Halkett.
Holt's team had an opportunity to increase its edge in the last few minutes, but McGregor held up well and defended the attack of Jacobs, then Lithgow from the corner sent a ball over naked.
The alternate Rangers, Glenn Middleton, at the end of the game, sought another penalty when he joined Jacob, but Thomson didn't react again.
Almanah: Geiger's inventor
And now, the station from our Sunday Morning German: September 30, 1882, today, 136 years ago... the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger has developed a method of detection and measurement of radioactivity, an invention that in time will become the device known as Geiger's counter.
In addition to being one of the main points of science, Geiger's numerator also has its place in pop culture, as in the 1950's "Zonna Koronada" movie, in which they played apparently amazing Cuban scientists, Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
The man said, "What's that?"
Rogers: "It's Geiger's counter, used to locate radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can hear the effects of atoms in your ears thanks to the radioactivity in minerals."
Evans, "Yeah, that's a little crack!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine could teach an immune system to "see" evil cells.
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to "see" the evil cells and then kill them.
The vaccine studies the immune system to identify malignant cells as part of treatment
The procedure includes the removal of immunological cells from patients and their changes in the laboratory
They can thus "see" the protein that is together in many kinds of cancers, and then injecting themselves again.
The test vaccine has shown promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
The cancer of the woman's ovaries who received treatment with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells has disappeared for more than 18 months.
The procedure includes the removal of immunological cells from the patient, their transformation into the laboratory so that I can "see" protein HER2, and their reinjection.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. Institute for Diseases in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "helps growth of several types of cancer" including breast cancer, ovaries, lungs and colorectals, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach to removing immunological cells from patients and "learning" the same as to target small cells was effective in treating one type of leukaemia.
Kanye West gave a loud speech to support Trump, wearing the MAGA hat, after his performance at the SNL show.
He didn't have a good time.
Kanye West was released in a study during the Saturday Night Live show after the wagat performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run in 2020.
After performing his third song called Ghost Town, and the evening he was wearing a hat with the title "Make America Big," he was insulting the Democrats and again talking about his support for Trump.
"I've talked to white people so many times that they say, "How can you like Trump, he's a racist?
So if I didn't care about racism, I'd have moved from America a long time ago," he said.
SNL launched a ski show in which Matt Damon played and in which the Hollywood star ridiculed Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate's judicial commission on claims about Christine Blasey Ford's sexual harassment.
Although it's not broadcast, the video of West's speech was shared by comedian Chris Rock on social networks.
It's not clear if Rock tried to laugh at West by putting the tape on.
West also complained to the public that he had a hard time behind the scenes because of his hat.
"I got caught up in the back of the stage.
They said, "Don't go out with that hat on your head."
I've been bitten!
And then they say I'm pissed," he said according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see what it looks like?" adding that "will wear Superman's coat because it means you can't order me.
Try love."
His comments sparked the bluffing of the audience at least twice, and the members of the SNL show were visiblely injured, Variety said, while one person who was present said, "The whole studio is completely silent."
West was replaced by Ariana Grande, whose ex-partner, Mac Miller's rapper, died a few days ago.
The West has confused many with the song's performance and they're chasing it into Perrier's bottle.
Westa supported the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "One of the bravest souls: Thank you for not being caught up in the face of abuse."
But the show leader Karen Hunt tweeted that the West was simply "what he really was and that it was absolutely beautiful".
"But I choose not to reward someone (such as buying his music or clothes or supporting his "art") for whom I believe he has embraced and expanded the ideology that harms my society.
He's free.
So are we," she added.
Before the show, the rapper on Twitter announced that he had changed his name, saying that he now "will be previously known as Kanye West".
Not the first artist to change his name and follow Diddy's footsteps, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
A colleague of Snoop Dogg was called Snoop Lion, and of course the late music legend Prince changed his name into a symbol, and then "an artist previously known as Prince".

The star of the series "Game of the Throne", Kit Harington condemned toxic sword culture
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow, who swords in a violent medieval fantasy, HBO series of the throne game.
However, the actor (31) turned to the stereotype of a hero's sword, saying that such roles on the screen mean that boys are very often considered to be rude in order to be respected.
In a statement on Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed that "something went wrong" and wondered how to deal with the problem of the toxic sword of culture in #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married a partner from Leslie Rose's throne (31), admitted that he had a "strong need" to deal with this problem.
"I am currently quite troubled by the question -- what have we made a mistake in presenting manhood?" he said.
"What do we teach men as they grow up, when it comes to the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for spreading the toxic sword of culture due to the depiction of characters that appear as males.
And he said: What is it that is born, and what is the matter with it?
What is it that teaches us on TV and on the streets why young people think they have to fit into a certain pattern of behavior of men?
I think that is actually one of the main issues of our time — how can we change it?
Because obviously something went wrong for young people."
He also admitted in the interview that he would not agree to the lectures or continuations of the series of the Game of the Throne at its end next summer, saying that he "completed with battlefields and horses".
From November on, Kit will play in the playroom of Sam Shepard True West, talking about a film producer and his brother, a robber.
The actor recently discovered that he felt that what he met his wife Rose was the best thing that happened in the series of the Games of the Throne.
"In this series I met my wife, so it can be said that she gave me the future family and my life from now on," he said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the love partner of Kitt's character Jon Snow in this fantastic series that won Emmy's award.
Couple got married in June 2018 at the possession of Leslin's parents in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reported a rise in new cases of 14%
China reported a 14% jump in the number of new cases of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people in the country have been hit, health officials say.
About 40,000 new cases were recorded only in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases have been transmitted through sexual relations, which is a change in the previous situation.
In the past, HIV spread rapidly to some parts of China as a result of blood transfusions infected with the virus.
However, the number of people in this way getting HIV is almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, from year to year, the number of people in China living with HIV and being increased by 100,000 people.
The transmission of HIV through sexual relations is a hot issue in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has no longer been considered illegal in China since 1997, but they say that LGBT discrimination is a very widespread person.
Studies estimate that due to conservative country understandings, 70-90% of men who have sexual relations with men end up in marriage to women.
The transmission of the virus is often due to inadequate sexual protection in such relationships.
In 2003, the Chinese government promised universal access to HIV drugs as part of a plan to address this problem.
Maxine Waters denied the allegations that one of her staff published information about the Republican senators, condemning "dangerous lies" and "theory of conspiracy"
US MP Maxine Waters has denied the statement that one of her staff has published personal data from three American republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of these legislators.
The Democratic MEP from Los Angeles claims that these claims are posted by experts and websites of the "ultradexist wing".
"False, lie and even more disgusting lies," Waters said in a Twitter post.
The published information reportedly included home addresses and phone numbers of American senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatcha, both from Utah.
The information appeared on the network on Thursday, and an unknown person published it on Capitol Hill during a hearing by the Senate commission on sexual harassment against the Supreme Court candidate Bretta Kavanaugh.
The release of the information came at some point after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative web sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the publication is linked to the Waters office and published information about its staff member, Hill reported.
"This unsubstantiated claim is a completely inaccurate and absolute lie," Waters continued.
"A member of my staff -- whose identity, personal information and security are threatened by these false and incorrect claims -- is not in any way responsible for the dissemination of this information.
This unsubstantiated claim is a completely inaccurate and absolute lie."
Waters' statement soon sparked a condemnation on the Internet, which he issued, and former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This negation goes off with anger," Fleischer wrote.
"This concludes that she does not have the temperament needed for a Congressman.
When he accuses someone of something he hasn't done, he can't be angry.
He can't be a jerk.
The defendant's motives must not be excused.
They must be calm and calm."
Fleischer obviously countered Waters' reaction to the criticism of Judge Kavanaugh's democrats, who were accused by critics of acting too angry at the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who was running to change Waters in elections in the middle of the mandate, also announced himself via Twitter.
"A great thing if it's true," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said her office warned "the relevant competent authorities and judicial authorities about these false claims".
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are discovered," she continued, "and that before the law they are responsible for all their actions that are unstable and dangerous to all members of my staff."
Film review Johnny English again in action – a milk spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
It has already gone into tradition to look for a subtitles about Brexit in every new movie with British theme, which can also be applied to this continuation of French satirical action comedy about Johnny English – which began in 2003 with the creation of "Johnny English" and returned to screens in 2011 with "Johnny English: born again".
Will ironic self-satisfaction about how obviously useless we are be a new export opportunity for the nation?
In any case, bubbling, incapacitated Johnny English of the rubber face was given a new opportunity to fry something – with his name more than anything in his mind that it was a general comedian creation designed for cinema-based audiences with no English mother tongue.
It's, of course, a crazy secret agent who, despite bizarre claims on the highest glamour, wears a little Clouseau, Mr. Bean's tummy and a little bit of that guy who played only one note under the theme melody of the "Chariots of Fire" at the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in London 2012.
It was also originally founded on a passenger and an international man by a veil of secret that Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV ads, leaving chaos behind.
One or two scenes of the newest IS catch are good.
I liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in a medieval Vitreous armor and when the blades of the rotor briefly flashed about his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is obvious, but humor is felt weak and in a very strange way too much, especially now that "serious" film brands like 007 and the Impossible Mission add comic elements to their confidence.
The idea is that it's about humor for children, not adults, and for me the crazy adventures Johnny English isn't inventive and worked out like Atkinson's gegs in the style of the fake movies like Mr. Bean.
Now it's a very current topic that the United Kingdom is in serious trouble.
Hacker was infiltrated into the British super-secret network of spies, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground, to the horror of the agent on duty – unfortunately, a small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last drop in a glass of water for the prime minister, the Pompey and the influential person who already has a complete breakdown due to the fall of political popularity: Emma Thomson has masterfully played this character designed by a model on Theresa May, but the script is quite scarce.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that all active spies are compromised and that she will have to hire one of the pensioners.
And that means the dirty Johnny English, who now works as a teacher in some fancy institution, but informally holds lessons about how to become a secret spy: there are some interesting gegs when English holds the Academy of Spyioning in the manner of the movie "School Hand".
English quickly return to Whitehall for emergency instructions and to re-compile it with former incredibly patient partner Bough, who plays Ben Miller again.
Bough is now a married man, married to a submarine commander in whose energetic and noisy role Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
So Batman and Robin are once again in the service of Her Majesty's secret service and fortunately beautiful fatal woman, Ophelia Bulletin, interpreted by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls into the trap of a charismatic technological billionaire who claims to be able to solve British computer problems: criminal Jason Volta, who plays Jake Lacy.
English and Bough relaunch their odise of comic events: broken into canoes, they set fire to an elegant French restaurant, a real chaos with a crash on the Voltina luxury yacht, and English moves a real anarchy trying to get to know the interior of Voltina's house using hearing aids for virtual reality.
It's obvious that a great effort has been made in that last sequence, but no matter how nice and happy, a whole movie like it was made for children.
Pretty central quality.
As in other movies about Johnny English, I can't ask myself: Could the British film industry invent a role for Rawan Atkinson that would really show his talent?
Laborist party denies that the British plan will work for four days a week and will be paid in five days
The Laburist Party of Jeremy Corby will consider a radical plan whereby the British would work four days a week, but were paid for five.
The party allegedly wants the company's bosses to transfer time to workers who save thanks to the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution by giving them another day off.
The employees would enjoy this three-day weekend – but they would still receive the same salary.
The sources say that this idea would "integrate" into the economic programme of the parties and plans to improve working conditions and workers' rights.
The four-day shift was approved by the Syndicate Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of a changing economy.
A high source from the Laborist Party said to Sunday Times: "New policy is expected to be published before the end of the year.
This won't happen overnight, but the four-day workweek is an ambition that fits in the party's approach to rebalancing the economy for the benefit of the workers, as well as the party's industrial strategy at all."
The Labour Party would not be the first to approve such an idea because the Green Party promised a four-day working week during the 2017 pre-election campaign.
However, this ambition is not supported by the entire Laborist Party.
The Laburist Party's spokesperson said: "The four-day working week is not party policy and the party is not considering it".
The opposition officer John McDonnell used the Labour Party conference last week to expose his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take power from the hands of "unfair directors" and "profit" in municipal businesses.
The plans of the opposition's office also mean that current shareholders in water-supply companies may not recover their total investments because the labs could impose "debts" on the basis of perceived injustices.
He also confirmed plans to include employees in company committees and create inclusive ownership funds that would allocate 10% of the value of private sector companies to employees for which it is likely that they will kill annual dividends up to 500 pounds.
Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy is talking about a 60-minute show about whether the FBI investigation could change their opinion.
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has suspended the final vote on his nomination for the Supreme Court for at least a week and raises the question whether the Bureau's investigation could have led some Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview on Sunday, Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could find out anything that would lead them to change their mind.
Kennedy felt more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I think so, of course," Kennedy said.
"Before the hearing, I said I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the charges came up, I asked, "Did you do it?"
"He was unbreakable, determined, unconcerned."
But Senator Graham's voice seems to be tarnished.
"My opinion on Brett Kavanaugh has been formed and there would be a need for a severe accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett was energetically denying it," Graham added, speaking of Christine Blasey Ford.
"And anyone she calls can't confirm it.
It's 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes."
What is the festival of the citizens of the world and did he do anything that would reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will be the host city of the Festival of World Citizens, an annual music event with a truly impressive list of stars that will take place, and an equally impressive goal – to end poverty in the world.
Now in its seventh year, the Festival of World Citizens will bring together tens of thousands of people on the big grassy Central Park that will not only enjoy the performances of artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raise awareness of the true objective of this event, which is the end of extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizens' Festival, which was held for the first time in 2012, is an extension of a global project against poverty, an international group that advocates the end of poverty by increasing the number of people who will actively fight it.
To get a free card for the event (unless you are willing to pay for the VIP card), those who wanted to attend the concert had to do a series of tasks or "parts", such as volunteering, sending e-mails to world leaders, telephone calls and any other meaningful way to raise awareness of their goal – ending poverty.
But how successful is the project of a citizen of the world with only 12 years left to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of awarding people a free concert the right way to convince people to do something, or just another view of so-called "clickivism" – when people believe that they have done something that will change the world by signing a petition on the Internet or tweeting?
Since 2011, the World's Citizens' Initiative has claimed to have marked more than 19 million "actions" of their supporters who advocated a number of different objectives.
These actions are said to have led world leaders to publish promises and political directions worth more than $37 billion and will affect lives of more than 2.25 billion by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group entered 390 promises and published the proceeds of their actions, and at least $10 billion was already allocated or collected.
The group estimates that the accumulated funds have already directly affected 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key promises are Power of nutrition, the partnership of investors and performers from Britain who promised that they would "help children grow up to their full potential", promising that Rwanda would allocate 35 million dollars to end malnutrition in that country, after receiving over 4700 tweets from the world's citizens.
"With the support of the British government, the donor, the national governments and the citizens of the world, as you are, we can make the social injustice of nutrition become a historical funni," said Ambassador Power of nutrition, Tracey Ullman, to the visitors of the live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions that called on Britain to improve the Icelandic mother and children, the government announced that it would finance the Power of Nutrition project, whose interventions will affect the lives of 5 million women and children.
In answer to one of the frequently asked questions on their page that says, "Why do you think you can end extreme poverty?"
The people of the world will say, "It will be a long and difficult time. Sometimes we will fall and fall.
However, like all major civil rights movements and against apartheid before us, we will succeed because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are just some of the artists who will perform on this year's New York event, led by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could "block" Russia in energy exports by the Navy – Secretary of Internal Affairs
Washington can "if necessary" use its Navy to prevent Russian energy exports to third markets, including the Middle East, discovered Ryan Zinke, US Secretary of Interior, and transferred Washington Examiner.
Zinke claims that Russian engagement in Syria – that is, there are legitimate government calls – is an excuse for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they want to sell energy, just as they do in Eastern Europe and the centre of southern Europe," he said.
And according to the official statement, there are ways and means of resolving this issue.
"The United States has this option to ensure that the sea corridors remain open or block them if necessary to ensure that their energy does not go to the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to those present at the event whose organizer was the Alliance of Energy Consumers, a non-profit group calling itself "the voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to relations with Russia and Iran, finding it to be the same thing.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is less and more involved in the use and replacement of fuels," he said, saying that Russia owns only one ingredient, and that its production depends on fossil fuels.
Statements come after the Trump Administration's mission to increase the exports of concentrated natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia with a far more favourable option for European consumers.
To this end, officials of the Trump Administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "unappropriate" North Stream 2 pipeline project, which would have made Berlin "a prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2 pipeline is worth 11 billion dollars and that the existing gas pipeline capacity is to be doubled to 110 billion cubic metres, a purely agricultural project.
Kremlin claims that the reasons for Washington's fierce opposition to this project are purely economical and that this is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should have the option of selecting a supplier," Russian Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry, held in Moscow in September.
The U.S. state called for Germany's reaction, which reaffirmed its definition for the project.
The leading industry organisation in Germany, the Federation of German Industry (BDI), urged the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, president of the German Industry Alliance (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "consider seriously" about the presidential candidacy for 2020, said Senator of the state of Massachusetts
Senator of the state of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that he would "consider seriously" to run for president after the next mid-term elections.
During a meeting in a city council in the city of Holyoke in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider the candidacy.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our corrupt government, which includes a woman at the top," she said, and transmits the source of The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will seriously think about running for the president."
Warren called on President Donald Trump during a meeting in the city hall, saying that he “is leading this country in the wrong direction.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren was summoned for criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court judge, Brett Kavanaugh.
In her tweet on Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
However, the results of the poll published on Thursday showed that the majority of the election body that voted for Warren did not think it should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of voters who will "probably" vote in Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to a poll conducted by the Centre for Political Research at the University of Suffolk/list Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidacy.
The survey showed that there is greater support for former Governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38% of voters supporting potential candidacy and 48% against candidacy.
The remaining sound names from the series of Democrats discussed in terms of their potential candidates in 2020 are former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'd make an official decision by January, as the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin was talking about PTSP Track Palin at Donald Trump's expensive support
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after the election in September.
He was arrested and accused of family violence after the incident that happened on Monday night
"What my son goes through, what he goes through after returning, can be linked to what is happening to other families suffering from the consequences of the PTSP and the vulnerability that our soldiers are returning with," said the public at the combined support president Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "a hot topic" and, speaking of his son and other war veterans, added "they return a little different, return harder, return wondering if there is respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots have given to this country."
He was arrested on Monday in the city of Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence - an attack on a woman, an interruption of reporting violence in the family and possession of weapons under opiates, according to Dan Bennett, spokesperson of the Wasilla Police Administration.
18 countries, D.C. support the challenge of a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the review of a new U.S. policy that reduces asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 countries and Districts filed a friendly report in Washington on Friday to provide support to asylum seekers who challenge this policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the prosecutor in Grace's suit against the Sessions that the US Civil Liberties Union filed in August against the federal police has not been found.
She said she was abused by her partner "and violent members of his gang," but US officials rejected her asylum request on July 20th.
She was arrested in Texas.
National lawyers who support Grace explained how the states of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum seekers come to the United States, face an increasing problem related to gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy annulled the 2014 Committee on Immigrant Complaints, which enabled immigrants who do not have documents and are fleeing from domestic violence to apply for asylum.
State prosecutor District Columbia, General Karl Racine, said in a statement he made on Friday that the new policy "is disregarding decades of state, federal and international law."
"The Federal Law requires that all asylum claims be decided on the basis of individual facts and circumstances of the request, and that the chamber thus violates that principle," says the friendly report.
Lawyers continue to claim that the police who disables immigrants' entry are damaging the US economy, and that they are likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary labour force."
In June, state prosecutor Jeff Sessions ordered judges in migrant-related cases to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
"Assil is only available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear of belonging to a particular race, religion, nationality or social group or because of their political opinion," Sessions said in a statement of 11 June about politics.
The purpose of asylum was never to alleviate all the problems, even all the serious problems that people around the world are facing every day.
Desperate rescue efforts in the city of Pala as the number of dead doubles in search of survivors
The situation for survivors is getting worse.
"It's very tense," said 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, comforting her sick little boy at the evacuation center in the deserted town of Pala.
"Emergency assistance shall be carried out by the authorities every minute.
The government is wasting clean water."
The residents return to their broken homes, overrun by flooded things, trying to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people have been injured, and hospitals destroyed by an earthquake of 7.5 degrees are suffering.
Some of the wounded like Dwi Harris with broken back and shoulder are located outside the Palu War Hospital, where patients are provided help outside due to continued strong emergency.
His eyes are filled with tears as he talks about how he felt a strong earthquake that shook the hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I think I've been pressured by the ruins of the wall," Harris told the Associated Press agency, adding that his family was in town for the wedding.
"I heard my wife crying for help and then quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
The US Ambassador accuses China of "violence by propaganda ads"
Seven days after the official Chinese newspapers published an ad on four pages in U.S. Daily, praising the mutual benefit of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump turned to a paid Chinese newspaper supplement at the Des Moines Register, the most sold in Iowa, after accusing China of joining the US Congress elections that will be held on 6 November, which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to get involved in American elections indicates that US officials told Reuters, a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
And while it is customary for governments to publish advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently trapped in a escalating trade war where each other increases import tariffs.
As a countermeasure, earlier Chinese tariffs in this trade war were directed towards exporters in countries such as Iowa, which supports the Trump Republican Party, said in Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, an American ambassador to China and former state mayor of Iowa, who was the main exporter of agricultural goods in China, said Beijing had damaged US workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a comment published in the Sunday issue of the Des Moines Register, "now doubles that violence by publishing propaganda advertisements in our free press."
"By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses a valuable American tradition of freedom of speech and press freedom, placing paid advertisements in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, at a kiosk down the street in Beijing, you will find a limited number of different opinions and you will not be able to see any true reflection of the different opinions that people in China may have about China's problematic business path, bearing in mind that the Chinese media are under a solid baton of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most prominent Chinese newspapers has refused to publish" his article, although he did not mention the newspaper.
Republicans turn women away from voting in front of mid-term elections with the Kavanaugh debacle, analysts warn
Analysts have warned that a large number of the most prominent Republicans who defend and stand with the candidate for the judge of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh, who faces several allegations of alleged sexual assaults, will experience negative reactions, especially women, during the upcoming mid-term elections.
The emotions associated with this issue are very intense and most Republicans already show that they want to vote.
There is no back in these things," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell University School of Syracuse, in an article for the magazine that was published on Saturday.
Reeher said he suspected that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) would have recently requested an FBI investigation to be enough to put an end to angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow, nor in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and state spokesman for the Progressive Group MoveOn, in Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, demonstrators called "newbar coming!" during a demonstration in the Senate hall, while Republicans controlling the Justice Committee decided to investigate with Kavanaugh candidate despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be huge," said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst.
"People say it's already high, which is true.
But it could be higher, especially among indecisive female voters in suburbs and among younger voters between the ages of 18 and 29, who, although they don't like the president, don't vote."
Even prior to Ford's public testimony, in which she made details of the alleged sexual assault against a judge of the Supreme Court, analysts were of the opinion that negative reactions could occur if the Republicans investigated the nomination.
"This has become a big mess for the Big Old Party," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, earlier this week, broadcasts the NBC News network.
"It's not only about the Committee's vote or the final vote, nor about whether Kavanaugh will be a judge, it's also about the way the Republicans dealt with this issue and how they dealt with it," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA Group, who supports the choice of democrats.
Yet, it seems that the Americans are somewhat divided in terms of who to trust after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a slight inclination to the side of Kavanaugh.
The new YouTube survey shows that 41% of respondents definitely or probably believe in Ford's testimony, while 35% said they definitely or probably believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said they thought that Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30% said that they thought the same thing about Ford.
After Flake's initiative, the FBI is currently investigating the statements made by Ford and at least one other person who filed the charge, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Justice Committee last week that Kavanaugh attacked her in a drunken state when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez allegedly claims that her candidate for the Supreme Court judge showed her genitals while attending parties during their studies in Yale in the 1980s.
Web Designer World Wide Web plans to start a new Internet that will surpass Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, an inventor of the World Wide Web network, is launching startups aimed at being a competitor to Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this technological legend, Inrupt, is a company based on an open source solid platform, the manufacturer of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and which people have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview for the Fast Company, Berners-Lee hoped that the Inrupt's intention was "world domination".
"We have to do it right away," he said about the start.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own "personal data store on the network" or POD (personal online data store).
It can contain a list of contacts, a list of obligations, a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, they're all available in one browser and all at the same time.
What is unique for a personal data store on the network is that it depends entirely on who can access any kind of information.
The company calls it "personal data enhancement".
According to the company's CEO, John Bruce, the idea is that the Inrupt company provides sources, processes and appropriate skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company is currently made by Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform of IBM, a number of employee development engineers engaged in the project and the volunteer programmer's community.
Since this week, technology engineers around the world can create their decentralised applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change where all their business models overnight will be completely destroyed.
"We're not asking for their permission."
In a statement on Saturday on the Media platform, Berners-Lee wrote that Inruptt's "mission to secure commercial energy and ecosystem that will protect the integrity and quality of the new Web built on Solid."
Berners-Lee transformed the Internet in 1994 when he founded a World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a very influential voice in the debate on network neutrality.
Although Inrupt starts, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this new era for the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of Victoria's cross assigned to a priest in World War I
Celebrations in honor of the only Anglican Church priest who was distinguished by the Victorian Cross as a fighter in World War I are relatively prominent in his hometown 100 years later .
Colonel Bernard Vann won recognition on September 29, 1918 for an attack on the cities of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
A few days later, however, he was killed by a sniper and never found out that he had won the largest British military confession.
At a parade held on Saturday in Rushden, Northamptonshire, his two grandchildren discovered a memorial record.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said that it was "incredibly symbolic" that the monument was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather received the prize.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Canal Saint-Quentin "through a very dense fog and a strong shot from a battlefield and a mitral fire."
He later rushed to the fire line and with "the greatest heroism" led the water forward before he ran without any help to the Polish top and smashed three of the military squad.
Colonel Vanna died a German sniper on October 4, 1918, a little over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's moves were "something I know I could never achieve, but also something that causes obedience."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also placed the winery after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he "felt honored to participate in the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero shows the support that many will give."
MMA fans who stayed up all night watching Bellator 206, instead got Pepu Prase
Imagine that, you've been up all night watching a series of Bellator 206, so you can't finally watch the main event.
The San Jose program contained 13 fights, including six on the main list and was live during the night on Channel 5 in Britain.
At six o'clock in the morning, just as Gegard Mousesi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face, viewers in the United Kingdom were amazed when the transmission of Pepa Prase was interrupted.
Many were not impressed that they stayed up all night until early morning just because of the fight.
One Twitter fan described this interruption of the transmission of cartoons as "a kind of sick joke."
"It's a government regulation where it says that at 6 a.m. this content is inappropriate, and they had to replace it with a children's programme," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of the Bellator for marketing and communication, on the issue of transmission.
"Pepa Prase," yes."
The president of Bellator Scott Coker said he would work on his schedule to include viewers from Britain in the future.
"I think when I'm talking about reprisal, I think we can probably handle it," Coker said.
"But the transfer is there at six in the morning on Sunday and we will not be able to accomplish anything until we have Sunday, when they will already have Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the break came, they circled the scriptures and they were all hostile.
We were trying to fix it. We thought it was a technical breach.
But it wasn't like that. It was a government matter.
I can promise you it won't happen again.
We're going to reduce the number of fights from six to five, as we usually do, we tried to give more to our fans, but we've been over-exceeding.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "inferior" because of sexuality
Olympic driver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality, but it gave him motivation to become successful.
The 24-year-old said that only in high school did he realize that "not everyone is like me."
Speaking on Radio 4 Desert Island Discs, which represented Lauren Laverne, he said he was openly talking about gay rights to give others "hope."
He also said that what became a parent made him less worried about winning the Olympics.
The regular leader of the long-term program, Kirsty Young, was absent for several months because of the disease.
Appearing as a waste in Laverne's first show, Daley said that during his growing up he felt "less valuable" than others because "it was not socially acceptable to love boys and girls."
He said: “To this day, these feelings of inferior value and feeling that I was different were real things that gave me the power and strength to succeed. ”
He wanted to prove that he was "someone," he said, so people don't get disappointed when they eventually learn about his sexuality.
The double winner of the bronze Olympic medals became a very important fighter for the LGBT population and used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to several countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he was speaking because he considered himself happy that he had the opportunity to speak publicly without consequence and because he wanted to give others “hope. ”
The triple world champion said he was in love with a man, American producer Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 "surprisingly".
Last year, Daley married Oscar, who was 20 years older than him, and said that the difference in years was never a problem.
"When you live so much while you're so young" -- the first time he showed up at the Olympics when he was 14 years old, and his father died of cancer three years later -- he said it was hard to find someone the same years he had experienced similar climbs and falls.
A couple took part in the role of the boy's parents Robert Ray Black-Daley in June, and Daley said his "total perspective" changed.
"If you asked me last year, it was only about "I have to win the gold medal," he said.
"You know what, there are bigger things than gold medals at the Olympic Games.
My Olympic gold is Robbie."
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 in the year 40 after his brain tumor was diagnosed.
Daley said his father didn't accept that he was going to die and that one of the last things he asked was if they still had tickets for London 2012 because he wanted to sit in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him "you won't be here to sit first, Dad," he said.
"I held him by the hand while he stopped breathing and only when he really stopped breathing and when he was dead I finally realized he wasn't invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
"I just knew it was what I had dreamed of all my life - swimming in front of the home audience at the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
It served as an inspiration for his selection of the first song -- the stream of Heather Small -- which he responded to as he prepared for the Olympics and from which the twins still pass.
Desert Island Discs is on Radio 4 BBC on Sunday at 11:15 after British summer time.
Mickelson of the shape on the bench at Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he'll play his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he'll have to recover the form so this won't be an unwelcome switch.
Mickelson, who plays on record 12th time, Captain Jim Fury has sent to the club in Saturday games with four balls and four games.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as was often the case for the United States, the fifth major winner spent a day cheering and improving the area in the game, hoping he would correct what was bothering him.
This 48-year-old, who has never been the best player, even at the top of his career, is not an ideal choice for the demanding area of Le Golf National, where the long unbalanced terrain regularly penalizes stray strikes.
And if I'm not scary enough, Mickelson's in the ninth game on Sunday is facing British Open, French Molinarie champion, who won all four of their games this week in a team with beginner Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans, who start the 12 individual games with four points less, get to the hot start, the Mickelson game could prove absolutely decisive.
Fury said he had confidence in his man, but he couldn't even say anything more.
"He fully understood the role he had today, stabbed me in the shoulder and hugged me, and said he would be ready by tomorrow," Fury said.
"He has great faith in himself.
He's a member of the House of Fame and has contributed so much to these teams in the past, and this week.
I'm sure I didn't imagine playing two games.
I figured there'd be more of them, but that's how it went and we thought it had to go.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else."
Nick Fald's record on Sunday will be the number of Ryder Cup matches played.
That could mark the end of his career at Ryder's shop where he never fully reached the level of his individual achievements.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven half-times, although Fury said his presence brought certain intangible value to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, he likes to joke with people and it's great to have such a guy on the team," he explained.
"I think it was fun for younger players to give him a chance, and this week, which was fun to watch.
He gives a lot more than a crack game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a huge advantage could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, European Captain, knows from experience that a significant advantage in the last day of Ryder Cup's single swords can easily be turned into an uncomfortable experience.
The first time he appeared in a game played in the city of Valderram in 1997, when the party whose captain was Seve Ballesteros had the advantage of five points over the Americans, but ended the competition with a narrow difference of 1411⁄2-1311⁄2.
"You always remember that we had a great advantage in Valderram, we had a great advantage in Brooklyn where we lost, and in Valderram where we won," said Bjorn, imagined after viewing the 2018 team that won the 5-3 match on Friday and yesterday led 10-6 on the Le Golf National field.
So the story and everyone on that team will show me that this isn't over.
You're going to finish tomorrow.
Get out there and do all the right things.
This isn't over until you get points on the table.
We have a goal, and that's to try to win this trophy and it stays focused.
I've been talking all the time, I've been targeting 12 players on our side, but we're very well aware of what's going on over-roads on the other side - the biggest players in the world."
Enthralled by the performance of his players at the hard golf tournament, Bjorn added: "I would never let this take me.
Tomorrow's the new day.
Tomorrow they're on the line for a single game, and that's something else.
It's great to be there with your partner when things go well, but when you're there alone, you're testing the ultimate possibilities of yourself as a golfer.
It's a message you have to deliver to players - give the most of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner and he must also do his best."
Unlike Bjorn, his colleague Jim Furyk will ask his players to play better individually than they played in pairs, excluding Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Suryk himself was at both ends of those big turnings of the last day, since he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn before he ended up as a loser after Europe performed a "miracle in Medina".
"I remember every damn word," he answered when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, encouraged his players before the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but you should strive to achieve excellent results at the very beginning of what you saw in Brooklyn, as you saw in Medina.
When he's on such a run, he's putting a lot of pressure on the middle game.
We formed our character according to that and we prepared the guys so we could try to do some magic tomorrow, you know."
Thomas was assigned to try to counterattack and face Rory McIlroy in the main game, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahmo, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and other Europeans in the upper half.
"I went with this group of guys in this position because I think she can cover up until the end," Bjorn said about choosing a single player.
New German warship on hold
The new German Navy frigate was due to be launched in 2014 to replace the older warships from the Cold War, but will not last another year due to system and emergency costs, local media reported.
The launch of the ship "Rheinland-Pfalz", a leading ship in the class of completely new Baden-Wuerttemberg frigates, was postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper, which quoted the military spokesman.
The ship was to join the Navy in 2014, but problems after delivery threatened the fate of this ambitious project.
Four sailors from Baden-Wuerttemberg class who were commissioned in 2007 will replace the old frigate class Bremen.
As well as some invisibility technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible for the latest frigates to be distributed up to two years without returning to their native ports.
However, constant delay means that the most modern warships, which were to enable Germany to deploy forces outside its territory, will be obsolete when they are used, says Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate arrived last year in the newspaper, when German Navy officially refused to release the ship in use and returned it to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
That was the first time that the Navy returned the ship to the shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons why it came back, but the German media reported a number of key "software and hardware deficiencies" that would have caused the ship, if it had been deployed in a combat mission, to be unnecessary.
The software deficiencies were of particular importance because the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships will run a crew of some 120 sailors - exactly half of the number of people who run the old Bremen class frigates.
It also turned out that the ship is a significant overload that reduces its impact and restricts the capacity of the Navy to add future upgrades.
It is believed that 7,000 tonnes of heavy ship "Reinland-Pfalz" is twice as heavy as ships of a similar class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to wrong hardware, the cost of a complete project, including staff training, also becomes problematic.
It is said that it has reached a staggering 3.1 billion euros (US$ 3.6 billion) compared to the initial 2.2 billion.
The problems associated with the latest frigates are particularly significant in the light of recent warnings that the maritime power of Germany is being reduced.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, president of the German Parliamentary Defence Commission, admitted that the Navy actually "is missing ships that can be arranged."
The officer said that this problem grew over time, because old ships were cancelled, and no replacement ships were acquired.
He complained that none of the baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates could join the Navy.
The National Fund Listens to the Secret Life of the Frog
A new study carried out on one property in the mountains of Scotland is aimed at discovering how bats use the landscape in search of food.
The results are expected to shed new light on the behaviour of the only flying mammals and serve as a guide in future conservation activities.
A study conducted by scientists from the National Fund of Scotland will follow the usual bats and the type of soprano Pipistrelle, and the brown long bats and bats of the Daubenton species in the Gardens of Inverewe Gardens in Western Ross.
Special recording devices will be set at key locations around the property to monitor bat activity throughout the season.
The NHS employees and volunteers will also perform mobile research using hand detectors.
The expert analysis of all records will determine the frequency of the call for bats and what they do.
Then a map of the sites will be produced and a report will be created to create a detailed picture of their behaviour at the level of the landscape.
Rob Dewar, NTS Nature Conservation Advisor, hopes that the results will show which areas are the most important bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help to determine the benefits of work on housing management, such as creating a habitat, and which is the best way to maintain forest for bats and other related species.
The bat population in Scotland and the UK declined significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by works of construction and development, which have a negative impact on beds and housing losses.
Windmills and lighting can also pose risks, including sticky paper and chemical processing of building materials, and attacks of domestic cats.
The bats aren't really blind.
However, because of their habit of hunting at night, their ears are much more useful than their eyes when catching prey.
They use sophisticated echo-location technology to locate bugs and obstacles on their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 ha of countries across the country, is very serious about bats.
There are ten trained experts who regularly carry out checks, lay inspections, and sometimes rescue.
The organization even established the first and only bat reserve in Scotland on the property of Thrave in Dumfries and Galloway, which are home to eight of the ten species of bats in Scotland.
The manager of David Thompson's estate says the property is an ideal territory for them.
"Here in Thrave we have a large area for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all good dwellings.
But there's still so much unknown about bats, so what we do here and in other properties will help us understand better what they need to make progress."
He emphasises how important it is to check that bats are on the property, because it is possible that the accidental destruction of one mother's bed kills up to 400 women and young people, which is likely to result in the extinction of the entire local population.
The bats are protected animals, and the law prohibits the killing, abuse, harassment or destruction of their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, an official of the Scottish Shrine Conservation Fund, encouraged the public to engage and help.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we simply don't know how the population of most of our species is developing."
Ronaldo rejects allegations of rape while lawyers file a complaint against the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo is accused of rape that he has been referred to as "false news," saying that people "want to promote" using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, who published the charges.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus was accused of rapeing one American named Kathryn Mayorg in a hotel room in Las Vegas 2009.
Apparently he paid her $375.000 to shut down this incident, reported Der Spiegel on Friday.
Addressing his followers of 142 million in video recording on the Instagram Live network, a few hours after the charges report, Ronaldo, 33, criticised reports calling them "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false news," the five-fold Golden Ball winner said in the camera.
"They want to promote using my name.
That's normal.
They want to gain fame by talking about me, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's okay," the player added smiling.
Ronald's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for these allegations, which they called "an unauthorized report on privacy concerns," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "unmaterial damage to the amount corresponding to the severity of the injury, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The incident reportedly occurred in June 2009 in the hotel apartment Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After a meeting at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorg reportedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anonymously, according to documents delivered to the District Court of Clark County in Nevada.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo kneeled on his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was "99% good guy" who failed those "1%".
The papers say Ronaldo confirmed that a couple had sexual relations, but that he was voluntary.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that her injuries were photographed in the hospital, but that she later agreed to an extrajudicial agreement because she felt "fear of revenge" and worried that she would "be publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old says she's now looking for cancellation of the deal because she's still traumatized by an alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the edge of going to Real Madrid from Manchester United when the alleged attack occurred, and this summer he went to the Italian giant Juve for 100m euros.
Brexit: UK will forever regret losing car manufacturers
The UK will "always regret" if it loses world leader status in car production after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that what Toyota UK said to the BBC - if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement that it will temporarily stop production in its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of delays on the borders in case Bexit remained without an agreement could cause job losses.
A factory from Burnaston that manufactures Toyotin Auris and Avensis produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% was exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain comes out of the EU by the end of March we will see stopping production in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Director General Toyote in Burnaston.
Other UK producers including Hondu, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover expressed fears about how cross-border trade will work if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement.
BMW, for example, says he'll close his mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main fears relate to what car manufacturers call risks in the procurement chain in the Brexit case without agreement.
Toyote's production line works on the "just on time" principle, where the parts arrive every 37 minutes from UK and EU suppliers for cars made by order.
If the UK leaves the EU without the agreement of 29 March, it may break down on the border which could lead to a delay and a lack of parts towards industry.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep supplies longer than one day in his factory in Derbyshire, they said from the company, so the production would be stopped.
Mr Clark said the "Checkers" plan that offers Theresa May for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid these checks at the border".
"We need to have an agreement. We want to reach the best agreement that will allow me to say, not only to enjoy the present success, but also to seize this opportunity," Radio 4 said in today's BBC programme.
"The example not only of Toyote but also of other manufacturers is that we have to be absolutely capable of continuing what has been extremely successful in a range of supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would be suspended, but warned that long-term additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory on the market and eventually reduce the number of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who worked in Burnaston for 24 years and president of the Union Union Union Union Union Union Union Union Union Union Union, said that his members were increasingly concerned: “According to my experience, when such jobs are closed, they never come back.
The government spokesman said: "We need to draw up a precise and convincing plan of our future relations with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again, they say from the White House
A very important meeting by Donald Trump with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "delayed for another week" because a fight continues with the candidate for Judge of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh, said from the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates the case of Russian involvement in the elections, the links between Trump's assistants and Russia, and the potential disruption of justice by the president.
Whether Trump will fire the deputy prosecutor's deputy or not, thereby jeopardizing Mr. Mueller's independence, has been the subject of talks in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had also spoken about the sound to record talks with Trump and about the possibility of changing the president on the basis of the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein rejected these rumors.
But last Monday he was in the White House, in the middle of a rumor that he was going to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced Thursday, which was then in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he would "not like" to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid interrupting with the hearing of the Senate Judicial Commission, which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
Trump ordered the FBI on Friday to conduct an investigation of charges against Kavanaugh for a week, which further postponed the Senate's vote in full.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Sunday on Fox News.
Regarding a meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The date for this is not yet established, it could be this week, and it could be postponed for another week, having in mind all the other things that are happening in connection with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists would reject this claim: Sandersov has not made a brief speech for journalists in the White House since 10 September.
Chief Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the smaller number of short speeches is not the consequence of the resistance to "theatrical behavior" TV reporters, although she said, "I will agree with the fact that they are exaggerated."
Then she said she'd strengthen direct contact between Trump and the press.
"The president holds more sessions with questions and answers than any president before him," without mentioning the evidence: "We have seen these numbers."
A short talk will continue, Sanders said, but “if the press has a chance to directly question the president of the United States, it is much better than talking to me.
We're trying to do it as much as possible and you've seen us do it over the past few weeks, and those talks with the president of the United States will replace short talks with journalists."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in open sessions or press conferences during an official visit.
The individual press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why, acting in front of assembled journalists unassumingly and occasionally strange.
The Secretary of Health writes to EU workers employed in the National Health Service (NHS) Scotland about Brexit's fears
The Health Secretary wrote to EU employees working in Scotland's NHS to express their gratitude for the state and their desire to stay after Brexit.
A member of the Parliament of Scotland, Jeane Freeman, sent a letter less than six months before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The government of Scotland has already committed to meeting the costs of resolving EU citizens' demands for their status in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: "The negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal have been set in summer, and decisions are expected this fall.
But the UK government has also speeded up its preparations for a possible scenario without an agreement.
I know for all of you this was a very restless time.
That is why I wanted to repeat how much I appreciate each member's contribution, regardless of his nationality.
EU-wide colleagues, and more widely, bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, which benefits patients and communities to whom we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we want you to stay here.
Christian Abercrombie underwent an emergency operation after head injury
The defense player State Tigers Tennessee, Christian Abercrombie, was subjected to an emergency operation after he injured his head in the Saturday battle at 31:27 from the Vanderbilt Commodores club, Mike Organ from Tennessee reported.
Chief Coach Tennessee State, Rod Reed, told reporters that the injury had occurred just before half an hour ago.
"He came to the field line and just collapsed there," Reed said.
Coaches and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the edge of the field before they put it on the carrier and took it to further investigation.
The Tennessee State official told Chris Harris from the WSMV Nashville channel, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had completed the operation at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no detail about the type/both of the injuries" and that Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a student of the second year in red dress, plays the first season for Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He had five total rounds on Saturday before leaving the game, reaching 18 total rounds in the season.
Foreign buyers will charge higher real estate fees in the UK
Buyers from foreign countries will pay higher taxes on the purchase of real estate in the UK, with additional funds being used to help homeless people according to new conservative plans
This move will neutralize Corby's success in attracting young voters
More taxes will be charged to those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The vault expects to raise up to 120 million pounds a year - to help homeless people
Foreign customers will be charged higher taxes on the purchase of property in the UK, and additional money will be used to help homeless people, Theresa May will be published today.
This step will be considered by trying to neutralize the success that Jeremy Corbyn has achieved by trying to attract young voters with promises to ensure more affordable housing and focus on those who earn more.
More taxes will be charged to individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, thereby strengthening the government's intention to fight against open sleep.
An additional fee, which is in addition to the existing fee, including more levels, introduced two years ago on the second property and purchase for rent, could amount to even 3%.
The Treasury expects this move to increase income to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built properties in London buy people who don't have a place in the UK, which is why the price increases, and buyers who buy real estate for the first time are becoming more difficult to own.
Many rich areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become "the cities of spirits" because of a large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a taxi reduction to help a larger number of young people get to their first home.
He accused construction companies of holding high real estate prices by buying on the first chance land they don't use, and asked Mrs. May to immediately give up the access home quota to stop the British "demeanour of housing policy".
Mr Corbyn announced an attractive series of proposed housing reforms, including rental control and cancellation of any associated shares.
He also wants to give councils more authority to build new houses.
Mrs. May said: “Last year I said that I would dedicate my Prime Minister’s mandate to return the British dream - that every new generation’s life should be better.
And that means repairing our poor residential market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build life in it.
However, it can't be right for individuals who don't live in the UK, as well as the side of the company, to buy houses easily as well as valuable British people.
The dream of ownership over the house has become for many people too far away, and inhuman sleep on the open still remains quite real."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland"
Chief Sunderland Jack Ross says his "final ambition" is to be the management of the Scottish representation at a certain time.
Forty-two-year-old Scott enjoys the challenge of returning to the life of a club from the northeast, which is currently in third place in the First League, with three points less than the leader.
This summer he moved to the Light Stadium after last season returned St. Mirren to the Scottish Prime Minister League.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I was in the B team and that was it," Ross said about the sports sound BBC Scotland.
"But I grew up looking at Scotland in Hampden with my father as a child, and it always dragged me back.
However, such an opportunity would be offered only if I was successful in running the club."
Rose's predecessors as Sanderland managers include Dick Lawyer, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neilla, Roy Keane, Gus Poyette and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of the Alloa Athletic club says he didn't feel upset because he came after such great names in such a big club, after he refused to offer Barnsley and Ipswich Town clubs.
"The measure of my success at this point will be 'will I be able to get this club back to Prime Minister League?'
Judging from the structure and possibilities of this club, he undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to get him there, but I think I can only be successful if I can get the club back where it belongs."
Ross is only in the third year of his managerial career, after a period that he spent as a deputy chief in Dambarton and 15 months that he spent as part of Harts' coach staff.
Then he helped alloa recover from the fall into the third category, and St. Miren withdrew from the edge of the fall into the lower league to the winner of the next season's Championship.
And Ross says he now feels more comfortable than ever during his toy career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirrena and Hamilton Academy.
"It was probably a real crossroads," recalled the acquisition of the Alloa Club.
"I honestly believed that management was the right thing for me, more than playing.
It sounds weird because I wasn't bad, I made a decent profit, and I enjoyed some solid success.
But playing can be hard.
It's so much that you have to go through every week.
I'm still going through it in terms of stress and work pressure, but the management just fits me.
I've always wanted to deal with management and now I've done it, in my entire adult life I haven't felt more comfortable than now."

The perfect time for the glass is Saturday at 17:30, discovers research
The summer wave of heat increased the traffic of British pubs fighting for survival, but increased the pressure on restaurant launches.
In a group of pubs and bars, sales grew by 2.7% in July, but traffic in restaurants fell by 4.8%, as figures show.
Peter Martin, from CGA’s consulting company, who collected the data, said: “Sustainable solar time and longer than expected participation in the World Cup in England contributed to the follow-up of a similar pattern in July as in the previous month of June, when the pubs grew by 2.8% and the restaurants had an even higher fall.
The fall in traffic in restaurants from 1.8% in June only got worse in July.
The pubs and bars focused on drinks achieved far better results with higher growth compared to the results from the previous period than was the fall in traffic in restaurants.
The pubs focused on food were also lost because of the sun, but not as dramatic as the owners of the restaurant.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In pubs and bars there is an increase in the sale of drinks by 6.6% for a month, with a fall in food sales by three percent."
Paul Newman, from the Agency for the Analysis of Entertainment and Hospitality RSM said: “These results continue to be a trend that we have witnessed since the end of April.
Timely opportunities and the impact of major social and sporting events are still the main factors when it comes to sales on the outside market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to fight hard, although the drop in sales of 4.8% per annum will be particularly ill with the already present price pressure.
Long hot summer could not come up in time for food-focused hosts, and time will show whether the temperatures we had in August will provide a little over the necessary relief."
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened facilities, amounted to 2.7% in July, reflecting a slower introduction of new brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker, an industrial sales monitoring service in the U.K. bars, pubs and restaurants, collects and analyzes information on the impact of 47 business groups with a total turnover of over 9 billion pounds and constitutes an accepted industrial measure.
Every fifth child has a secret order on social networks that hides from his parents
Every fifth child, some of whom have only 11 years of age, has a secret mission on social networks that hides from their parents and teachers, discovers research
A survey involving more than 20,000 students in the upper secondary school class revealed a rise in the number of "false Insta" pages
This news increased the fear of publishing sexual content
Twenty percent of his uncles said he had a "main" mission that showed his parents
Every fifth child, one of whom is only 11 years old, has a real role to play on social networks that are hidden from adults.
A survey involving 20,000 high school students revealed a sudden increase in the "false Insta" task, which refers to the Instagram photo sharing page.
This news has reinforced the fear of the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of the dicks said they have a clean "main" mission that shows their parents, but they also have private tasks.
One mother who came to the secret page of her 13-year-old daughter discovered a teenager who calls others with the words "strengthen me."
The research carried out by the organization Digital Awareness of the UK and the Conference of Directors and Directors of Independent Schools (HMC) revealed that 40% of children 11-18 years of age had two profiles, while half of them admitted to having private assignments.
HMC President Mike Buchanan said: "It upsets the fact that so many teenagers are being tempted to create a space on the Internet where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Elid Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" in the Scottish Athletics Committee
Elid Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as a non-executive director at the annual meeting of that administrative body.
Doyle is the most rewarding Scottish athlete, and chairing Ian Beattie described this move as an excellent opportunity for those taking the lead to benefit from her rich international experience over the past decade
"Eildh enjoys great respect for the athletic community in Scotland, the UK and the world and we are sure that athletes in Scotland will have enormous benefits from its membership in the committee," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I want to be the voice of athletes and I hope that I can really contribute to sport in Scotland."
The American, who won a total of four Olympic gold, including 200 and 400 meters in the games in 1996 in Atlanta, and now a regular expert on BBC, remained steadfast after experiencing a transitional ischemic attack.
On Twitter he wrote: “I suffered a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said only time can show me if I can recover and how much.
It's been a hard job, but I've recovered completely, learned to walk again, and today I've been working on agility exercises!
Thank you for your encouraging messages."
Advertising for a publisher whose mother shares her views on the Internet
The company that produces traitors shared views on the Internet advertising that is more likely to match the cows of the Mussar.
In order to mark the launch of a product described as "the first silent publisher", the company for consumer technology Elvie published an advertisement inspired by a fun music video showing the freedom that new pump provides to mothers who issue milk.
Four real mothers dance in a barn between the shadows and cows with a song whose text reads: "Yes, I am married but I don't have tail" and "If you haven't noticed, but it's not a cow, it's my chest."
The following is the cold: “Spring, pumping, feeding my babies, pumping, pumping, masculine myself.”
However, advertisements published on the company's Facebook site caused controversy over the Internet.
With 77,000 reviews and hundreds of comments, the video triggered various reactions from the viewers, while many said it was throwing light on the "fears" of the dairy industry.
"The use of cows for advertising this product was a very bad decision.
And they have to get pregnant and have babies like us to produce milk, but their babies are kidnapped a few days after they were born," someone wrote.
The Elvie issue pump is discreetly standing in the breast-feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: “It is clear that it is traumatic for both mother and baby.
But yes, why don't we use it to advertise the betrayers for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Another added: “Ad without any sense. ”
Others stood in defense of the advertising, and one woman admitted that her song was "urnish".
"I think the idea is brilliant.
I'd buy this if I still got it.
The betrayal made me feel just like a cow.
The commercial's a little crazy, but I figured it out.
This is a brilliant product," someone wrote.
Another commented: “This is a funny advertising directed at mothers who issue milk (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like "sweet".
This isn't advertising that praises or takes away the milk industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women discovers that they all danced with discreet pumps hidden in their bras.
The concept of advertising is based on the knowledge that many mothers who betray milk say they feel like cows.
However, Elvie's pump is completely insensitive, there is no wire or tube and stands in a breast-feeding bra, which gives women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go out while they deliver milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and executive creative director of Mother, commented: “Pumpa Elvie is such a revolutionary product that it deserves bold and provocative launch.
By withdrawing the parallel between breast and cow musar we wanted to put into focus the issue of milk and all the challenges that come along, showing in a fun and understandable way the incredible sense of freedom that this new pump provides.
This is not the first time Elvie's pump has reached the headlines.
During the Seventh Fashion in London, the mother of two children appeared on the track in the creation of Martha Jakubowski using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children secretly moved to tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of children detained has increased, although the number of monthly crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because of the sharp rhetoric and policies introduced by Trump's administration have made it difficult to find caregivers for children.
Traditionally, most caregivers and themselves were undocumented migrants who were afraid of endangering their chances of remaining in the country by appearing to accept the child.
The risk increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that potential caregivers and other adult members of their household would have to give fingerprints and that these data would be shared with immigration services.
Matthew Albence, a senior officer of the Immigration and Customs Service, said last week before the Congress that this service had arrested dozens of people who applied for custody over unaccompanied minors.
The service later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had not previously been convicted.
"Approximately 80% of the persons who are either caregivers or homeowners are illegal in this country, and a good part of them are foreigners who have committed criminal acts.
So we're gonna keep looking for those people, Mr. Albence said.
In order to ensure that children get through the procedure faster, officials have introduced new rules to which some of them will have to appear before the court within a month of detention, instead of 60 days, which was a previous standard, workers say at the reception.
Many will respond to a video call instead of personally to request the immigration judge's legal status.
Those who are determined not to meet the conditions will be deported quickly.
The longer the children remain closed, the greater the chance that they will become anxious or depressed, which may lead to an outbreak of anger or runaway attempts, the workers of the shelters and reports that have come from the system over the last few months.
Lawyers say such risks are increased in larger institutions such as those in the city of Tornillo, where it is much easier to predict signs indicating that the child has problems.
They added that moving children to a tent city without enough time to prepare emotionally or to say good - bye to friends can cause a trauma that many children are already struggling with.
Syria seeks urgent withdrawal of US, French and Turkish "occupational forces"
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moual has also called on Syrian refugees to return, although the war in that country has lasted for eight years.
Moualem, who is also in the post of Deputy Prime Minister, said that the parties are illegally in the Syrian country, in response to the fight against terrorism and that "they will be counted accordingly".
They have to withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said at the session.
Moualem insisted that Syria's "war on terrorism is almost over", where over 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have left their homes.
He said Damascus will continue "a holy fight until we destroy all Syrian terrorists", including terrorist groups and "every foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly responsible for training and advising Kurdish and Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 soldiers on the ground in this country with a war.
As for refugees, Moualem said there are good conditions for their return and he blamed "the individual Western countries" for "spreading irrational fears" that encourage refugees not to return.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to allow these returns," he said.
"They politicise what should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no aid for the reconstruction of Syria until Assad and the opposition reach an agreement on the end of the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last major rebellion in Idlib created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has rejected a large attack by the Syrian forces supporting Russia in a province in which three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that a military action against the jihadist and the Nusra-related fighters from Al-Qaeda will be launched.
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes that he will soon convene the first meetings of the new committee consisting of the authorities and members of the opposition in order to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and prepare the way for the elections.
Moualem outlined the conditions of the Syrian government to participate in the work of the committee, saying that the work of this body should be limited to "the consideration of members of the current constitution" and warned of the possibility of external involvement.
Why Trump will be chosen for another mandate
According to that logic, Trump would be re-elected in the 2020 elections unless, as many liberal viewers are likely to hope, the revocation and scandal did not break his mandate earlier.
This would undoubtedly represent "the most dramatic end of the presidential mandate of all times!"
For now, there's no sign of the viewer's fatigue.
Since 2014, the impact rating has doubled to more than 1.05 million on the CNN channel and has nearly tripled to 1.6 million on the MSNBC channel.
According to the Nielsen agency, channel Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the impact term, unlike four years ago when it had 1.7 million, and the show Rachel Maddow Show channel MSNBC exceeded cable channels rating with 3.5 million viewers during the evening with impact news.
"It's a fire that attracts people because it's about something we don't understand," said Neal Baer's producer of the "Elected Survivors" drama on the ABC channel, about a government secretary who becomes president after the attack that destroys Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a long-standing writer of comedy and author of the book "Only funny parts: and a few harsh truths about the entry into the club of Hollywood guys", has a different theory.
She remembers driving by taxi in Boston before the 2016 election..
The driver told her he'd vote for Trump.
Why? She asked.
"He said, 'cause he's laughing at me," Mrs. Scovel told me.
Chaos has fun value, too.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, stories coming from Washington can decide the future of the law on abortion from the Roe v. Wade procedure, whether immigrant families will be able to connect and what the state of global farming will be.
Exclusion is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you went a little further from the general information when you realized that you were watching a panel of experts for six hours discussing how Bob Woodward used the sources of "deep backgrounds" for his book "Stras," about Paul Manafort's jacket from a noves skin worth $15,000 ("a section with a fat attitude of vanity", wrote Washington Post) and the implications of the picturesque descriptions, this, anatomy, Mr. Trump giving Stormy Daniels.
I, for example, will never look Super Mary with the same eyes again.
"Part of what he makes you experience as a reality show is that something feeds you every night," said Brent Montgomery, executive director of the Wheelhouse Entertainment and producer of the show "Zalgaonica", commenting on the rotation of the acting position and the daily complexity of the Trump show (criticizing the American football team, commending Kim Jong-una).
You can't let yourself miss an episode, otherwise you're in the back.
When I arrived this week at Mr. Fless, in front of his house on the northern coast of the island of Kauai, it was sunny at a temperature of about 80 degrees (27°C), but he closed inside and watched MSNBC and at the same time recorded CNN.
He could not have separated himself from the screen, not while Brett Kavanaugh was preparing to face the Senate Judicial Commission and his future in the Supreme Court was uncertain.
"I remember when we were doing all these crazy shows in the past, and people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right."

Big cash flow on the side in the most uncertain mid-term election race for the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania is experiencing a flood of money, thanks to the redistribution of congressional districts resulting from two candidates in the race for the same place.
The recent border crossing of the district in Pittsburgh suburbs led to the election of Democratic Representative Conora Lamba, who came to the head of the other county after the extraordinary elections last spring.
Lamb is fighting against another current representative, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the 12th-century Pennsylvania district, which is becoming much confused with the new 17th district.
The maps were re-designed after the Supreme Court in Pennsylvania in January decided that the old districts were permanently formed for the benefit of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district launched a campaign to fund the main party funders, the Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Republican National Congress Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after a tight victory in a wide-ranging special election for the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania in March.
This position has been held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump has won a 20-point pre-eminent district.
Political analysts have given little priority to democracies.
The United States is considering punishing El Salvador for China's support, but then withdraws
Diplomats have found that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognised Beijing, with little encouragement from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Trump team.
State Department officials have decided to withdraw the heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for "the recent decisions to no longer recognise Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, a spokesperson for the Department, in a statement early in the month.
However, the penalties were considered only for El Salvador, which is estimated to have received US$ 140 million in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The sanctions proposed, including the reduction of financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would hardly hit this Central American country with a high level of unemployment and murder.
As internal meetings progressed, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity, which was to be a continuation of a similar set last year, which was a step forward in efforts to prevent the flow of migrants to the United States.
However, by mid-September, senior officials of the administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to be held and that they had actually interrupted any review of the sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence should address the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, which is a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, the diplomats said.
And three American envoys secretly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new heavy messages or Washington sentences.
The spokesperson for the White House, on behalf of Mr Bolton, refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal debates on condition that they remain anonymous.
Their statements were confirmed by an external analyst near the administration who also wanted to remain anonymous.
History
The next item is the report by Special Investigator Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of Trump's judiciary, which now has significant evidence in the public records.
Mr. Mueller, according to the reports, also directed his investigation to discover a possible link between the Trump campaign and Russia's attack on the elections.
If the majority changes in Congress, Mr. Trump will face responsibility in that body, just as he is prepared to step back to the electorate, and perhaps even before the jury.
There is a lot of these "if" and I do not want to suggest that Mr. Trump's fall, nor those in Europe who are like him, is inevitable.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German soldiers were ready to launch a coup against Hitler, only if the West opposed and supported the Czechoslovakian people in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
The course of history revolves around such breaking points, and the incessant march of democracy is accelerating or slowing down.
The Americans are now facing more of these breaking points.
What will we do if Mr. Trump fires a deputy prosecutor, Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mr. Mueller's fate?
Rosenstein has been in an unresolved position ever since this letter last year reported that he has proposed a secret filming of the president and suggested that he is not similar to the performance of the function.
Mr. Rosenstein says the evidence from the Times is incorrect.
"How will we react if the recently commissioned FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if his candidacy for the Supreme Court is confirmed despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, are we going to vote in the mid-term elections for the Congress that Mr. Trump will call for responsibility?
If we fall into these tests, democracy will sleep a long winter dream.
But I believe we're not going to fall, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz to the same Nazi regime that once occupied the country where I was an ambassador.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later, sent me to light candles for the Sabbath on that table with a cowardly cross.
With such an inheritance, how can we not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans from Rangers optimistic before facing Rapid from Vienna
On Thursday, the Rangers hosted Rapid from Vienna, knowing that they would win over the Austrians, after an impressive remion in Spain against Villarrela at the beginning of this month, put them in a good position to qualify from the G European League.
The knee injury prevented the tied player Graham Dorrans from debiting this season until an unsolved match with the Viralal final result 2-2, but he is convinced that Rangers can use that result as a jumpboard for further.
"It was a valuable point for us because Villareal is a good opponent," the 31-year-old player said.
"We entered the game believing that we could achieve something and went with the point.
We may have been able to take them in the end, but all in all, the unresolved result is probably fair.
They were probably better in the first half, and we got back in the second, and we were better.
We are again expected to have a great European evening on Thursday.
We hope we can take three points, but it will be a difficult match because they had a good result in the last game, though, with the support of the audience we can certainly push and achieve a positive result.
Last year, it was undoubtedly a tough start, starting from everything that happened to my injuries, until the change in the club itself, but now we're satisfied with what we have at the moment.
The team is in good shape and the guys really enjoy it; we're good at training.
I hope we can continue now, leave the past season behind and be successful."
Women can't sleep out of worry about saving their pension
Despite the fact that the respondents had a clear idea of how they would want to care for them, a few spoke to their family members about it.
About half of the people involved in the nationwide research said they talked to their spouses about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10% of them said they talked to their children about it.
"People want someone from the family to get older about them, but they don't want to start a conversation on this," says Holly Snyder, vice president of the Life Insurance Sector at the Nationalwide company.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide for you if you do not express your wishes in advance.
Work with your counselor and your family and consider where and how to give it to you, because such decisions can be a significant factor in determining the price.
Include your financial advisor: Your advisor can help you and figure out a way to pay these costs.
Your choice of long-term care funding can include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value that will help you cover these costs or self-insurance with your own savings – provided you have enough money.
Find your legal documents: Prevent legal battles in the root.
Make an authorisation to make a medical assistance decision so that you have a trusted person who will monitor the medical care provided to you and ensure that healthcare professionals act in accordance with your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Consider, too, the conclusion of a financial power contract.
This means choosing a person from trust who will make financial decisions on your behalf and take care of paying your bills if you remain unable.
Do not forget the details: imagine that your elderly parent is in a situation where he needs urgent medical attention and is taken to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Enter the details in the schedule to be ready.
"It's not just about the finances, it's about who the doctors are?" asked Martin.
"What are the medications?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Plan it."
A man shot with several air rifles in Ilfracombe
One man was shot with several air rifles while his feet were returning home from the night out.
The victim, in her 40s, was located in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and arm.
Policemen described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 according to British summer time, as "a random act".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police have called witnesses to report.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died from a severe earthquake and tsunamis that hit the Indonesian city of Paul on Friday, officials announced, and it is expected that the number of dead will grow.
As a result, relief officers could not obtain any information from Dongala province, a region north of Palu, which is close to the epicenter of the 7,5-degree earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palau after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palau and Dongali, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Sulawesi, located at the end of the narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by earthquakes and tsunamis.
It reached a county extending more than 300 km (180 miles) to the north-west coast of the island of Sulawesia.
The county, which is administratively lower than the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 people in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the basis of the farm in Central Sulawesi, and in particular the coastal region of Dongal.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but mostly concentrated in Morowalia, on the opposite coast of Sulawesia.
Paul and Dongal were hit by a tsunami several times over the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency.
In 1938, he killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongali.
Cunami also hit West Dongal in 1996 when nine people died.
Indonesia is located on the Seismic Pacific Fire Circle and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
These are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on December 26th caused tsunamis that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of which in Aceh.
2005: The series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra by the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias near the coast of Sumatra.
2006: The 6.8-degree earthquake hit the south of Java, the most inhabited Indonesian island, and started the tsunami that hit the southern coast and killed almost 700 people.
2009: The 7.6-degree earthquake hit the town of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: The 7.5-degree earthquake hit one of the island of Mentawai, near Sumatre, causing tsunamis up to 10 meters that destroyed tens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: Plitki earthquake hit the Pide Jaya region in Aceh, causing destruction and panic because it reminded people of the deadly destruction of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died in the collapse of the building.
2018: Great earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island Lombok, where more than 500 people lost their lives, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists remained temporarily trapped.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested for charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of former governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice-President Sara Palin, was arrested for charges of assault.
Palin, 29, from the city of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on the basis of suspicion that he committed violence in the family, that he was prevented from reporting violence in the family and that he was opposed to arrest, says a report published by the state police agency in Alaska on Saturday.
According to the police report, when the acquaintance tried to call the police and report alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin was detained in Mat-Su's detention unit and he had a conditional guarantee of $500, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday where on the issue of explanation of guilt he explained that "it is certainly not guilty", this network said.
Palin faces three Class A violations, which means he's threatened with a prison sentence up to a year and a 250,000-dollar fine.
He was also charged with a Class B violation, which is punishable by a prison sentence for one day and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time Palina's criminal records have been filed.
In December 2017 he was charged with assault on his father, Todd Palina.
His mother, Sarah Palin, invited the police to report an alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Veteran Court in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, of disturbing the reporting of domestic violence and of possession of arms in an alcoholised state linked to the incident.
His girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin criticised the Veteran Group in 2016 after she brought into contact with her son's violent behaviour with the PTSP after his service in Iraq.
tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after the earthquake that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A 7.5 - degree earthquake that caused tsunamis destroyed hundreds of homes.
There has been an interruption of electricity supply and connections, and the number of dead is expected to increase in the next few days.
The epicenter of the earthquake was directly along the central part of Sulawesi, northeast of the capital of Indonesia, Jakarte.
There's video footage on social networks showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the city of Pala when the tsunamis flooded the coast.
Federal prosecutors are looking for a rare death penalty for a terrorist attack suspect in New York.
Federal prosecutors in New York are looking for a death penalty for Sayfull Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York where eight people died -- a rare sentence that has not been committed for a federal crime in the country since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly used the rented truck of Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bicycle track along the West Side road in Lower Manhattan, which selected pedestrians and bikers who were on his way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intendedly" killed eight victims and "intendedly" caused serious bodily injury, it is stated in a request for the execution of the death penalty, which was filed in the southern district of New York.
According to both of these points, it is possible to impose a death penalty, as stated in the court document.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal grand jury charged Saipov with 22 counts of charges that included eight charges of murder and retrieval, which federal prosecutors usually use in cases of organised crime, and charges of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack demanded "significant planning and preconceived," the prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov carried it out as "disgusting, cruel and corrupt".
"Sayful Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelinija, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erly, Hernan Ferruchija, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damiana Pagnucca," he said in his application for execution.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the South New York District had the last case in which the death penalty was threatened.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers, but eventually he was sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last death penalty in a federal case in New York was executed in 1953 on Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple killed after being sentenced to imprisonment for spying on the Soviet Union during the Cold War, two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were killed on 19 June 1953 in an electric chair.
According to court documents, Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, did not show repentance in days and months after the attack.
He told the investigators that he felt good about what he did, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that after watching the ISIS video on his phone he was inspired to carry out an attack, he was charged.
He also asked to highlight the ISIS flag in his hospital room, the police reported.
He made it clear he wasn't guilty of 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were clearly disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek a death penalty, instead of accepting life imprisonment without the possibility of acquittal of guilt, will only extend the trauma of these events to all involved," Patton said.
Saip's defense had previously asked the prosecution not to sentence death.
Conservative MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for Brexit's negotiations
Nigel Farage pledged today to "mobilize the National Army" during a protest at a conservative conference.
Former leader of the UK Independence Party said politicians had to "taste the dissatisfaction" of Eurosceptics, since one of the MPs Theresa May suggested that he should be responsible for negotiations with the European Union.
Conservative representative Peter Bone said at a meeting in Birmingham that the UK would "be out" so far that Mr. Farage was the secretary for Brexit.
But the challenge faced by Mrs May in trying to unite her deeply divided lines has been stressed by conservatives who advocate a stay in the EU and who joined a special protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to maintain his compromise plan from Chequers despite attacks and attacks on Brexit and the EU opponent.
The allies insisted that she continue with the attempts to conclude an agreement with Brussels despite negative reactions, and forced Eurosceptics and Laborists to choose between its package and "haosa".
Mr. Bone said at the meeting "Go" means go to Solihull that he wants to "reject the Chequers".
He proposed that Mr Farage should be given the title and be responsible for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were in charge, we'd be out by now," he said.
The Ambassador from Wellingborough added: "I will fight for Brexit, but we must expel the Chequers."
Explaining its opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in world wars to be subordinated.
We want to bring our laws into our country."
Mr. Bone has rejected the statement that the public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their opinion and that they want to remain completely inaccurate."
Brexit’s spokesman Andrea Jenkins, who also attended the meeting, told reporters: “I’m just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is not popular in the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, is not popular in our stranger and among our activists who were actually those who came out on the streets and chose us.
"Please discard the plan from the Chequers and start listening."
In a sharp message, Mrs. May added: "The prime ministers manage to keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr Farage told the gathered that politicians must be forced to "taste dissatisfaction" if they are going to fail the decision made at the 2016 referendum.
"It is now about trust between us - the people and our political elites," he said.
"They're trying to play Brexit, and we're here today to tell them "that won't happen to you".
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: “I want our political class, which is on the brink of Brexit’s betrayal, to feel discontent.
"We mobilize the national army of this country that has brought us victory in Brexit and will not calm down until we become independent, self-government, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the remnants marched through Birmingham before holding a two-way assembly in the city center.
A number of activists went ahead with the transparency of "Torians against Brexit" after the formation of a group this weekend.
Laborist Lord Adonis joked at the conservatives about the security problems they had with the party's application at the opening of the conference.
"It is people who tell us that they can have IT systems and all the technology for the Canada Plus Plan, for the smooth state of the border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's all a complete farse.
Good Brexit isn't possible," he added.
Warren plans to seriously consider the presidential candidacy.
US Senator Elizabeth Warren says he will seriously consider the presidential candidacy" after the November elections.
Boston Globe reports that a home-time from Massachusetts spoke about her future during a participating meeting in Western Massachusetts on Saturday.

Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after the order assures him of victory over Sebastian Vettel.
From the moment that Valteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the team's ranks would play a major role in the race.
Bottas had a good start from the beginning and almost left Hamilton behind as he defended his position in the first two circles and called on Vettel to attack his team.
Vettel first went to the boxing and left Hamilton behind to get involved in traffic at the beginning, which was supposed to be decisive.
Mercedes entered the box one round later and went out behind the Wettel, but Hamilton went forward after the action of the wheel that the Ferrari driver was reluctant to leave the free interior with the risk of delay after a double move in the defence of the third turn.
Max Verstappen started from the last row of the grid and was the seventh at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led most of the race, relying on his tires to reach the speedy finish and ran Kimi Raikkonen in the fourth place.
He finally got into the boxing in the 44th round, but failed to speed up the pace in the remaining eight circles while Raikkonen took fourth place.
The day was hard because Valtery had been doing a fantastic job all weekend and he was a real gentleman who let me through.
The team has done a really great job to achieve one or two formation finishes," Hamilton said.
It was a very bad speech of the body.
President Donald Trump laughed at Senator Diana Feinsten at a meeting on Saturday because of her insistence that she did not release Christine Blasey Ford's letter in which a candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh accused of sexual abuse.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly witness Ford before the Senate Justice Committee, but commented that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are wicked, malicious and lying.
The only thing that could have happened and the wonderful thing that has happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and angry and lazy and lying, he said.
When you look at the advertisements and the information they've leaked into the public, and then they say, "Oh, I didn't do it."
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Diana Feinstein, did you let the information go to the public?
You remember her answer... did you let the document go to the public... what?
Oh, no.
I didn't let the public go."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we let... No, we didn't," he added, imitating the senator.
Ford Feinstein sent a letter in July with details of Ford's instructions against Kavanaugh, and it searched in early September - however Feinsten demented that the information was being processed from her office.
I didn't hide Dr. Ford's instructions, I didn't let her story go public."
She asked me to keep it in secret and I kept it in secret, as she asked."
But her denial did not come to the president's approval, who said at a meeting on Saturday night: To tell you, it was really a bad speech of the body.
Maybe it's not, but I've never seen a worse body speech in my life."
Continuing his defence of the Supreme Court candidate, whom three women accused of sexual abuse, the president suggested that the Democrats use these statements for their own purposes.
They are determined to restore power at all costs.
You see the evil, poverty, they don't care who's gonna hurt, who they have to run to get to power and control," the media conveys the President's words.

Heavy tax earthquakes continue to strike this area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palau.
Despite his colleagues running away trying to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agg refused to leave his job in the control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Pala Airport, which was drifting heavily.
He stayed to ensure a safe flight of Batika Air Flight 6321, which was standing on the runway at that time.
When he realized the control tower was falling apart, he jumped out of it.
He went to the hospital later.
Portword Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirat, said his decision might have saved hundreds of lives, reports ABC News Australia.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to transfer him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter got to Palu.
Our heart breaks because of this news," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the number of victims could reach thousands, while the State Agency for Disaster Relief indicates that access to the cities of Dongal, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
It is believed that the number of victims continues to grow as the number of bodies remains below the ruins, and many cannot be reached," Sotopo Purwo Nugroho's spokesman said.
The waves that reached the height and up to six meters devastated Paul, where a mass burial will be held on Sunday.

Are you ready?" CNN reports.
Indonesia hit an earthquake in Lombok earlier this year in which more than 550 people were killed.
A plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini announces that after a plane crash in the lagoon one face runs like a missing one.
The airline whose aircraft crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia reported that one face was run as missing, after it had previously declared that all 47 passengers and crew members were safely evacuated from the plane that it had ton.
Air Niugini in the statement states that from Saturday afternoon they are not able to follow the passenger.
The airline reports that in cooperation with local authorities, hospitals and researchers are working to find this man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more detailed information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local vessels helped save other passengers and crew members after the plane crashed into the water trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials announced on Friday that seven faces were transferred to the hospital.
The airline reported that six more passengers were detained in the hospital on Saturday and that they were all in stable condition.
It's still unclear what caused the fall and exactly what the outcome was.
And the airline and the U.S. Navy reported that the plane ended up in the lagoon without getting to the runway.
Some fathers think the plane flew over the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was very low.
That's very good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and the others managed to get through to the exit for a case of danger through the water that cut them to the section of the plane that went down.
He said the crew was panicking and screaming, and that he had suffered a head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that the sailors who worked nearby at the port repair also helped to rescue the boat on board that passengers moved to the coast before the plane sank at a depth of about 30 metres (100 feet).
Data from the Air Safety Network indicate that in the accidents of the aircraft registered in PNG over the past two decades, 111 people were killed, but none of them participated in Air Niugini.
The analyst reconstructs the incident the night the woman was burned alive.
The prosecution ended the case on Saturday in a repeated trial against a man accused of burning a live woman in Mississippi in 2014.
American Justice Ministry analyst Paul Rowlett witnessed for hours as a intelligence intelligence expert.
Before the jury, he said he used cell phone data to set up a picture of the movement of accused Quinton Tellis, 29 years old, and the victim of Jessica Chambers, 19 years old, on the night she died.
Rowlett said that he got location information from several phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of her death, which is contrary to his earlier claims, the Claryon Ledger reports.
When the data showed that his phone was in the same place as Chambersin at the time when he was, according to his own claims, with friend Michael Sanford, the police went to question Sanford.
Sanford testifying on Saturday said he wasn't in town that day.
On the question of whether Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was lying because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis claimed that Chambers met about two weeks before her death.
The cell data indicated that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett was that Tellis had deleted her messages, calls and contact information after Chambers died on his phone.
He erased her from his life," Hale said.
The defense should begin on Sunday with the words of end.
The judge said he expected the trial before the jury to follow later in the course of the day.

Hip-hop wants to try to challenge the negative attitude towards that genre by fulfilling its compositions with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol claims that the hip-hop was far from its beginning when it dealt with political messages and social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and return popularity to the enlightened hip-hop.
Artists like the Fugees and the Commons are once again gaining popularity in Britain through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
The New York nanny sues a couple for dismissal after a racist text message.
The New York nanny sues a couple for dismissal on a discriminatory basis after having received a message from a mother who complains that she is another black person by mistake."
A couple deny that they are racists, judging the charge as a nuisance."
Lynsey Plasco-Faxman, the mother of two children, showed a dissatisfaction when she realized on her first working day 2016 that she was a new cousin of children, Giselle Maurice, a black woman.
No, no, no. There's another black woman," Mrs. Plasco-Faxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending her to her wife, Mrs. Maurice sent her twice.
When she became aware of her boss, Plasco-Faxman fired Mrs. Maurice, claiming that their ex-nanny, who was an African American, was already doing her job badly and that instead of expecting her to be a Filipino, she was carrying New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice has been paid for one day's work and she's been sent home.
Maurice now sues for a couple seeking compensation for dismissal, as well as a $350 fee per day for six months, on how much she was initially engaged to live with her family, even without a contract.
I want to show them, you see, you can't do such things," she said to Post on Friday, adding that I know it's discrimination."
A couple of charges of racism rebuffed that the cancellation of Mauritian engagement was reasonable because they feared that after being offended, they would not be able to believe it.
My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist," Joel Plasco said to Post's husband.
But would you believe your children to whom you have offended, even if they have done so by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
"Plasco said that his wife had only received two months of maternity leave and that she was in a very difficult situation."
Are you going to chase someone like that?
That's not very nice," the investment banker added.
Although the trial is still under way, the court was quick to condemn the money on social networks, criticizing them for such behavior and thinking.
Paddington's publishers were afraid that readers would not confess to a bear who spoke, a new letter was revealed.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, says about the letter: It's hard to put someone in a position who reads it the first time before the publication.
It's very interesting to know what we now know about Paddington's success."
Saying that her father, who, before he was inspired by a little spitted bear to write a book for children, worked for BBC as a cameraman, was still positive if his work was rejected, added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book was filled with happiness and sorrow after his death last year.
She added that her father was secretly proud of Paddington, whom she described as a very important member of our family."
He was such a man, he didn't like to brag," she said.
But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if your child had achieved something and you're proud of him, though it's not really your fault.
I think he was looking at Paddington's success in some way.
Although he was the fruit of his imagination, he always attributed all the credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter died, and we had to apologize on the phone.
Her daughter was transferred to Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors fought for nothing to save her life.
Over and over he regularly called to say it was bad, and they didn't expect to survive," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperous.
Then Nad called me to say that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to forgive her.
I did it, too.
I said, Tashi, I love you, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications doctors gave her to keep her heart pumping blood slowly stopped working and no longer flowed through her bloodstream.
She died just a few moments before that, and it's all gone.
I could just sit there and wait, knowing what was next.
I couldn't scream, scream, or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to be gathered."
In the end, Mrs. Ednan-Laperous, who was now in mourning for the death of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, who had not even dreamed of what pain she was going through.
No one knew," she said.
I've got my head down, and my tears are running down my face without stopping.
It's hard to explain, but during the summer, I was overwhelmed with compassion for Hope.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
The grieving women leave messages to prevent suicide on the bridge.
Two women who loved to commit suicide want to stop others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humpreyes on the big bridge put cards with motivational messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Tyler, Mrs. Davis' son, was 13 years old when he started suffering from depression to commit suicide when he was 18.
I don't want any parent to feel what I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis (45), who lives in Lydney, said her son was a prospective chef with a contagious smile.
Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that his smile would make every room look."
But before he died, he left his job because he was in a very dark phase."
Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, was the one who found his brother after he committed suicide in 2014.
Mrs. Davis says, "I'm always worried that this will leave the consequences."
Mrs. Davis invented those cards so that people would know that there was someone you could contact and who you could talk to, even if it was just a friend.
Don't sit down and shut up - talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, Mrs. Davis' long-term friend, lost Mark, who was her partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
He didn't say he was unwell, depressed or anything else," she says.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his mood.
He was on the bottom of Christmas when his children opened their presents, and he did not look at them, nor at anything else.
She says his death was a huge trauma to them, but they have to overcome it: it leaves a huge void in the family.
That's what's gonna blow us up.
But we will continue and fight."

With the opening of an FBI investigation, the future of Brett Kavanaugh is uncertain.
I thought that if we really managed to get something out of what he was looking for -- a limited length and scope investigation -- maybe it would bring us together a little bit," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee would fall apart" because of unrestful party views.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their discontent is caused by the choice of the moment.
The Congress elections are held for all five weeks, 6 November, and if Republicans go through bad, as expected, their attempts to elect their man in the highest court in the country will be seriously weakened.
George W. Bush called the senators on Saturday, lobbying for Mr. Kavanaugh's support, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI makes his report?
He will vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavnaugh can have at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to decide by his vote and confirm his appointment to the Supreme Court.
The number of refugees from North Korea falls below Kim.
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, the South Korean legislator said.
Calling for data from the Ministry of the Unity of South Korea, Park Byeong-seug said that last year 1127 were recorded as compared to 2011 when the number was 2706.
Mr. Park said that two decisive factors were stronger border control between North Korea and China and higher tariffs charged by human traffickers.
Pyongyang didn't go public.
The vast majority of refugees from the north will eventually be offered the citizenship of South Korea.
Seoul states that more than 30,000 North Korean citizens have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most run across China, which has the longest border with South Korea and is easier to cross than the firmly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between two Koreas.
China sees refugees as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often returns them.
Relations between the North and the South - which are still technically at war - have been significantly improved in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang primarily to discuss halted negotiations on denuclearization.
This was followed by a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in June in Singapore, on which a broad consensus was reached that they would work on the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for the so-called lack of progress.
Without confidence in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances we do not consider ourselves first to be disarmed unilaterally," the RI said in his address to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Bretta Kavanaugh hysterical," saying he was uncomfortable for service in the Supreme Court.
The minority leader in the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi called the candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh hysterical" and said that because of his temperament, he was uncomfortable for service in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I couldn't think of a woman if she ever acted like that as hysterical," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the allegations that he was sexually abused by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his initial exposure, Kavanaugh was very emotional, occasionally almost shouting and grinning when talking about his family and his high school years,
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the committee, assessing the statements against him by a grotesque and orchestrated attack on his personality" that they organised to free themselves from the wrath that Hilary Clinton lost in the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said he believed that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not perform a function in the Supreme Court because it showed his bias towards the harm of the Democrats.
I think he is disqualifying himself with such statements and the way he went against Clintons and Democrats," he said.
The question is whether he will try to revoke the Kavanaugha if it is confirmed, and if the Democrats get the majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi is down.
I'll say next - if he doesn't tell the truth before Congress or the FBI, then he's not like not only to be in the Supreme Court, but also in the court he's in now," Pelosi said.
Kavanugh is currently a judge of District Court of District Columbia.
Pelosi added that as a democrat she was concerned about the possible Kavanaughi judgments against the Accessal Health Protection Act or in the case of Roe against Wade, as he was considered a conservative judge.
At the hearing for his confirmation, Kavanaugh avoided answering questions about whether he would change certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
It is not time for a hysterical, biased person to be put in court and for us to be expected to say whether that is beautiful," Pelosi said.
And women have to deal with it.
Reasonable anger, anger that has accumulated for months and years, and it can't be solved without pay.
We cry when we're angry," Mrs. Steine told me 45 years later.
I don't think that's unusual. What do you say?"
She continued: She helped me a lot when she was a executive director, and she said that she was crying when she was angry, but that she developed a technique that made her feel that when she got angry and started crying, the person she was talking to said that you might think I was sad because I was crying.
I'm angry."
And then I'd just keep going.
And I thought she was great."
The tears are allowed to shed some anger and because they are basically misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories of earlier work, in the office where most of the men were, is that, once I cried because of the undescriptive anger, an older woman -- the cold boss that I was always a little scared -- grabbed me by the neck and pulled me out to the stairs.
I never let them see me crying," she told me.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad so they'll be happy because they think they hit you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic Congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
When in 1987 Hart was caught in an out-of-marry affair on Moneky Business and retired from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, discovered that there was no reason not to consider the idea of running for president himself.
That wasn't a well-considered decision," she told me through the laugh 30 years later.
There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone called it Snowman and seven puppies."
Since the campaign had already been delayed, she was late for the fundraiser, so she said she wouldn't be in the race unless she collected $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave her $1,000 would give her a total of $250.
Do they think I have a discount?" she wondered.
When she announced in her speech that she would not launch an official campaign, she was so obsessed with emotions - gratitude for the people who supported her, frustration over the system that made it difficult for her to raise funds and target voters instead of their representatives, and anger over shavinism - from which she got into her throat.
You'd think I had a nervous breakdown," recalled Mrs. Schroeder how the press reacted to her.
You'd think Kleinex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking what they'd put on my memorial?
She's crying."
How a trade war between the United States and China can be good for Beijing
The first cannons of the trade war between the United States and China were deafening, and until the end of the battle is not yet seen, the gap between countries can be of long-term benefit to Beijing, hard experts.
Donald Trump, U.S. President, issued the first warning at the beginning of this year by taxing key Chinese export articles including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The biggest hit occurred this week with new tariffs that hit items worth $200 billion (150 billion pounds), which practically reduces half of all goods coming to the United States from China.
Beijing has returned the same measure every time, and the latest is the introduction of a five to ten percent rate on American goods worth $60 billion.
China has vowed that the United States will respond to the same measure, and the second world economy, according to its size, will not seem to stop soon.
To force Washington to withdraw means to meet the demands, but public surrender to the United States would be too uncomfortable for Xi Jinping, Chinese President.
However, experts claim that if Beijing is playing its next move well, US pressure to trade war can sustain China in a long-term positive way by reducing its dependence on two economies.
The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions for the start of a sharp fall in some of these two countries is actually much more dangerous than observers believed," said Abigail Grace, a researcher whose focus is Asia at the Centre for New American Security.
Syria is ready to return refugees, says Foreign Minister.
Syria says it is ready for a voluntary return of refugees and appeals for help in rebuilding a country torn down by war that has lasted more than seven years.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country are improving.
Today, the situation on the ground is much more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rebuild areas that have destroyed terrorists to restore normal life.
Now there are all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that were focused on their daily life and existence.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the war began in 2011.
Six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated land.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or help from the rebel nations.
Europe has won the Ryder Cup in Paris.
The European team won the Ryder Cup 2018 defeating this United States with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 on the Le Golf National van Paris, France.
The United States has lost six consecutive times on European soil so far and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe recovered the crown while the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team won 14.5 points they needed to win over the United States.
American star Phil mickelson, who was tortured throughout the tournament, hit the ball in the water with his first hit on the 16th hole of a pair of three, leaving the sword to Francesca Molinaria.
Italian golfer Molinari has been brilliant in all rounds, and has become one of four players who have ever reached 5-0-0 since the 1997 tournament started in this format.
The American Jordan Speith lost 5-4 from Throbjorn Olesen from Denmark, the lowest ranked European team player.
The world's best-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 to 1 by Ian Poulter from England who might have been the last Ryder Cup.
Veteran with eight Ryder purchases, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the best European tournament winner of all times from 25.5 points in career.
I don't usually cry, but I couldn't hold back today.
It's been a tough year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very happy, I'm very happy we won the cup again.
Here is an important team and I am glad that I could be of help," emotional Garcia said after a European victory.
He's handing over to his country to John Rama who won the legendary American golfer Tiger Woods 2 to 1 in a single match on Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud to win Tiger Woods, I grew up looking at this man," 23-year-old Rahm said.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now holds a 13-21-3 career record on Ryder Cup.
Extraordinary statistics for one of the best players of all time who won 14 biggest titles and is only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had been struggling all weekend to find a way to the hole, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played the top golf course during the entire tournament.
After the disappointing performance of his team, US Captain Jim Fury said, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
There was a moment this morning when we gave resistance to Europe.
We didn't make it.
I'm taking off Thomas' hat.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played very well.
We'll regroup, work with the PGA of America and our Ryder team buys and we'll move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to admit who's better.
We're on the rise."
