I'm sure it was a coincidence.
It's alive, so of course it sucks.
Tom can write nice.
Are you a man or a woman?
Tom's gonna get better.
Tom works at marketing.
They're the quintet of limed smoke instruments.
I don't care if our team wins or not.
How far is it from here?
What are you doing?
Did I call you?
We won't let you die.
What can I say?
I'm a little sloppy.
You can't sit with me.
She keeps screaming like she doesn't have time.
Did you see Tom leave?
Everybody but Tom knows why his wife left him.
It's hard for me to understand French when they speak it quickly.
She didn't even blink.
What did that mean?
You can't make us leave.
I took the first step.
Everyone laughed.
It would mean to me if you could do that to me.
You're sad.
Tom worked hard to finish his job on time.
I gave them some food.
You disappointed me.
That's not a big deal.
How much am I gonna take?
I'm kidding you.
If you talk to a man in the language he understands, it goes to his head, if you talk to him in his language, it goes to his heart.
We're not done yet.
I want to see you behind bars.
Let's go to the bar now.
I tried to stop doing more things at the same time.
Are you sarcastic?
Let's try this.
Can I talk to you alone?
Have you seen the sunrise?
She put a ring on her finger.
He's as intelligent as his brother.
Tom's on a business trip.
I still can't remember where I left the keys.
Where'd you get that scar?
You wouldn't think of her appearance, but the story of a kid who ate two cakes is from her childhood.
I can't live a life like that.
Tom's hungry like a wolf.
It was a tough decision.
Everybody's crying.
October Paul was right.
He likes football very much.
What are you doing down here?
I'm not ready yet.
Are you gonna skip breakfast in the morning?
The Norwegian diplomat was hostile to the Soviet Union, so the KGB launched a compromise action against that Norwegian, he had a Russian girl and was asked to leave the country immediately.
Don't drink water.
Thank you so much for the inspired comment.
Didn't you do enough?
I'll take it from Tom.
Don't draw attention.
Do you think the games and learning are connected?
I think it's all funny.
Leila has a wide circle of friends.
Can you tell me how to get to the airport?
What's your birthday car?
Account, please.
Make sure the cat is out and the door is locked when you leave.
It's left to see if I can get there in time.
I could lose my job.
Forget Tom.
I work as a free translator.
Tom got his fingers on the table nervously.
You look pretty bad today.
I have a game I need to play.
That's what the doctor needs.
I like instrumental music.
You should thank Tom with the letter.
I'm blind.
What can't you tell me?
What were his first words?
Just be quiet, please.
We have one victim.
You should let me in.
The eternal snow doesn't look that long.
They're not mine.
What I saw was discouraging.
We'll never get back there.

Tom retreated.
These monasteries live in a monastery.
I don't trust talkative people.
Even a major detective like Tom can't handle all the problems without the help of a colleague and a co-worker.
How can I protect myself?
Maybe Tom can help us figure out how to solve this problem.
We need to get rid of Tom.
Are you involved in this?
I thought it was terrible.
Forget I said that.
I didn't make it.
Tom wants to work in the same hospital where Mary works.
I'd like to be as rich as Tom.
Another store will be opened in Boston soon.
I was shocked.
Tom's well-being.
Tom told me this morning that he and Mary were moving to Boston.
Can you keep me some cookies?
I have an allergy to milk.
Do you know what this sentence means?
I ate a box of chocolate.
Tom's a real nerd.
Eat soup while it's hot.
I'm not gonna let this go.
Let me help you avoid some problems.
I've never tried to do this before.
Did I miss it?
Mary can't stand Tom's boss because the man is a shovinist pig.
I was everywhere in Europe.
Are you coming soon?
It's a harmless lie.
What would I get for this?
The mini skirts are back in fashion.
Thank you for the correction.
I'm glad you found the money you lost.
Tom doesn't care what I do.
If you need help, tell me.
I've been looking for you.
I don't have a high opinion of him as a musician.
Tom was shot.
Did you tell Tom this?
Everybody's talking.
Everybody's sick.
My father said no.
A lot of people pray before they eat.
Where'd she go?
I think you'll be able to do that.
And who are you?
Keep working.
They have improved security procedures and are now better prepared than before.
It's empty.
Honestly, I'm not even sure I'm right.
Don't argue.

Defend yourself.

Don't forget to write your mail number.
How did you like Boston?
I can't hold it.
Her boyfriend didn't provide support.
The music started again.
I don't think you should tell Tom that.
I'll call.
The girl let the birds out of the cage.
Do any of your friends play guitar?
I thought you couldn't do that.
He got what he wanted.
Tom used to be afraid of snakes.
That may not be easy.
Why is it so interesting to paint trains?
I passed every test.
I'm sick of your cimetling.
There's only one way out.
What brother did you see?
I'll see.
He's very busy now.
I'm not sure if Tom wants to talk to me.
Should Scotland become an independent country?
Can you tell me something about yourself?
Don't open the window.
I believe in Kayla Mino since June 12, 1998.
You're very rude.
I went to bed yesterday without brushing my teeth.
The danger of predators at every corner.
When I went to high school, I got up at 6:00 every morning.
You're becoming inattentive.
Is it necessary to make such noises?
You never let me do anything.
Tom had a dirty year.
Come run with me.
Drive faster.
You're of great help, Tom.
Get in touch with Tom.
What we had was special.
You should write a novel.
You can't escape from the past.
I'm sorry I'm late.
Tom's holding on.
I hope I find Tom.
Tom didn't want to write about what happened.
I'm sure Tom didn't want to hurt you.
Dog house's new.
I got an e-mail in French yesterday.
Why are you so paranoid?
He's a spitting father.
Tom got his fingers through his hair.
I wrote some songs last week.
What am I doing here?
Do you have a dog?
They'll be OK.
The family had dinner at noon.
I thought you were going to the Boston bus.
He'll clean my room.
Tom and I are not friends.
I don't see who it is.
Don't stop.
I always thought it was weird.
I could have gone, but I didn't want to.
Her hands were cold like ice.
One day it'll be mine.
Tom refused to go to bed.
Turns out it's true.
Anything you remember can help.
You'll be known.
Don't stop.
Tom managed to escape right on time.
I love watching you dance.
I'm really proud of Tom.
We have to work hard.
You're very beautiful.
Please be honest with me.
I'm really glad to be here.
I can't answer your question with any security.
God save me!
None of us have seen Tom do that.
Let's talk about possibilities.
I was just about to suggest you do that.
She decided to go and study in the United States.
It was really inspiring.
Tom has three grown sons.
Take my card.
You still want this?
Well, what do we do?
This is my third marriage.
I'm sure next time it'll be better.
The text is very processed.
We're all trying to win.
Check around.
This box is almost empty.
Of course, Tom loves his children.
Nothing can stop us.
Tom didn't offer to pay.
I could go with you.
I don't know who they are.
I can't believe Tom kissed me.
I'll try to find them.
Hey, give me a chance.
Tom, are you and Joe brothers?
Have fun while you can.
Is that love?
Today, the ship was above the Mediterranean Greben - mountain wedding at the bottom of the ocean, at depths up to 4,500 meters.
Yeah, I love that!
It was a little awkward.
Do you have a copy?
When exactly did you do that?
I watched Tom die.
Do you have a blog?
Parliament is dissolved.
I hope that's not true.
Are you done yet?
Tom would never agree with that.
You look like a very intelligent person.
Tom is one of the most interesting guys I've ever met.
She got up and came to the window.
It was something that led to the boom of new ideas.
We'll visit you from time to time.
I'm in your hands.
I met some of Tom's friends yesterday.
Think again.
It's hard.
Tom was very nervous.
I've never repented of it.
It was imperative.
It's getting dark.
We'd better tell the others.
Tell me about your teacher.
I always think about it.
Tom bought a few black shoes.
I wasn't worried about that.
What was I supposed to do?
I'll have dinner at 7:00.
Pua was singing in the church.
Everyone was sitting at the table.
The students didn't know how to answer.
Tom asked Maria if she'd like to go to the movies or just take a break home.
Tom seems a little nasty.
It's started.
I'm proud of this team.
I'm still here.
Tom sings.
Don't laugh.
Did you tell Tom this?
You'll destroy your vision if you keep playing games.
I'm an Earthman.
I can read different parts of the language, but I don't speak any.
Who wants to talk to me?
Bad things will happen.
Say hello to your friends.
What, you still don't know how to drive?
I forgot.
I'll need some time to get used to it.
I'll be there.
We're not gonna get in the way.
You're a little right.
Although I told Tom not to open the door, he opened it.
Go straight.
Just like a paddle.
I've got a lot of things going well.
Tom's playing with his son.
I'm leaving school.
We'll visit you sometime.
The gap between my house and your house is two kilometers.
Just waste your time.
That says a lot about you.
I think it was intentional.
Don't work too hard!
I'm proud of this team.
He was speeding up.
Try this.
There's no consequences.
Say hello to your friends.
Tom's gonna go.
Is any of this real?
What are you gonna do today?
He's a man of tradition.
Do you have any paper I can write on?
Is it true that Tom won the race?
Can I hear another one?
I'd really like to see you again.
Let's sit down for five minutes.
What a question!
You're very brave, aren't you?
Tom looked angry.
I've never noticed that before.
It's probably better if you don't eat after seven o'clock.
I'm sure Tom's proud.
Are they in love?
Help me.
Which way are you going?
I like sleeping on a soft bed.
Stay positive.
It's all right with my ear.
I just want to get home.
You were right to be drunk.
How much money do we need?
I played golf with Tom a lot of times.
Tom lives in the center of town.
Don't be a jerk.
Now things are a lot different.
I'm so interested.
Tom got a cab to the hospital.
I really like your music.
There's no business here.
Can you please tell me how to get to the airport?
I'm excited about this.
I'm sure I'll win that tennis game.
You're infected.
We need your help.
Was Tom informed?
Tofu goes well with Sake.
I'm sure Tom's coming to the party.
I'm not swimming.
She's beautiful like her mother.
You got a point.
I've lived a long time.
Give us some space.
It doesn't stand.
That's enough, Tom.
Tom was going to ask his boss for a raise, but he changed his mind.
Come on in.
You win!
That's what they both like.
Tommy said I shouldn't talk to Mary.
I keep saying that.
Most scientists rejected the theory of continents moving because it was so hard to imagine that the motions of the panel were even possible.
How did I miss that?
What did you tell Tom?
It was a bad situation.
Give them as much food as they need every day.
Tom's gonna change.
I've been acting instinctively.
That's what you have to do somewhere else.
Don't push.
I predicted this would happen months ago.
How often do you upload pictures to Jutjub?
Do you know who Tom killed?
Everyone knows.
I'm sure Tom had something to do with it.
It's not that easy.
I'm deeply hurt.
I'm not upset anymore.
Have you completely recovered?
Tell Tom to come here.
It's raining.
Tom's sick today.
That's what they both like.
Is it dangerous when the melanoma spreads?
I'm sorry I'm leaving.
Tom almost got caught.
They're the ones who want to go.
The teacher explained to us what the poet wanted to say.
What does the doctor think is wrong with your shoulder?
Come on in.
We're in a tough situation.
It's just a personal opinion.
I just don't know what to say.
I'm just very grateful.
You got it all wrong.
So, what do you think?
Let's wait a minute.
Tom's in bad love.
Start counting.
You can never come back.
He is a man of blood and flesh with all his faults.
I predicted this would happen months ago.
Come tomorrow.
He's done in jail.
How much money do we need?
Don't drink water.
I'll always remember your advice.
She wanted me to come.
Tom saves the money so he can go to Boston.
Say hello to your friends.
What do you mean, what does this phrase mean?
Tom's not writing to me anymore.
Can I take a look at your card?
I'm sorry, I didn't follow up.
Tom knows the procedure.
If a man advances in front of a woman, it's called a favor, if she's advanced, in front of a man, it's called equality.
Are you dyslexic?
Come back in an hour.
Tom used that word a lot.
Tom was staring at his feet.
Are you still jealous?
How is this your fault?
I'm sure Tom would like to stay.
Tom just got sick.
Are you sure this thing is safe?
I'm here for you.
We're what we are.
He's a biologist.
That was a little weird.
Shut that dirty mouth.
Show me the papers.
I still mourn the death of my oldest son.
I'll call them tomorrow when I get back.
Are you going back now?
He must be over 60 years old.
Did you eat anything?
I've been there before.
I've never learned to write.
They wanted to punish me.
I agree with what you wrote.
Tell me what this is.
I'm available.
We need to talk about this alone.
I'm on Tom's side.
Some of the ans catch a few times.
I love this song.
Tom was John's best man.
Plato is a friend, but the truth is a greater friend.
You're lying!
Even a child knows that.
Who do you describe?
We were the only guests.
Tom's a painter.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Have you decided what you're gonna do?
Are you sure this thing is safe?
My family loved the dog very much.
You're right.
They can never accomplish it differently than by force.
I thought I'd have another chance for that.
He'll understand.
I'm not here for that.
I assumed you were busy.
She finally fell asleep.
Tom laughs at Mary.
It's almost half three.
I don't know if that's gonna be enough money for me.
Can you put your curtains on?
Have you ever tried?
It seems inhumane to me.
Did you have lunch?
Can you tell me how to get to the airport?
What is it, little cat?
We didn't mean this to you.
We've never played football before.
How did you like Boston?
Tom seemed nervous.
Tom would still be alive if he tied his belt.
It seemed yellow to me.
I'm celebrating.
I'm firmly against compromise.
Everything has its price.
Tom picked up Mary.
Maybe I won't sleep tonight.
Tom comes here three or four times a month.
We've never been here.
I knew you couldn't do that.
Jawbreaker rounds multi-layered candy like a pearl.
What's your problem?
How would you feel if your wife left you?
Everyone laughed.
I'm lying.
Tom's on a date.
Don't argue.
Just take care of Tom.
I'll get it.
I'm in a better shape than you.
Maybe they're somewhere around the lake.
At least I knew.
We've got a good chance of winning.
Tom's not in shape.
I don't have enough time to explain this in detail.
I'll talk to Tom about it.
I'm hurt.
Let's talk about your idea.
It's normal.
That's exactly what I meant.
I'll call her tonight.
She's been crazy for years.
It's all right, Tom.
It's impossible to say for sure.
Tom never left his home before.
I'm not burning Turkish.
It's only been a day.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
What's your story?
Here you go.
It'll last forever.
Why would I want to kill you all?
This knife isn't sharp.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom knew French.
These are my best friends.
I'm swimming in the ocean.
Have you seen Tom's room?
Let's take some pictures.
I found something, too.
Don't stop.
We've never played football before.
She tried.
I have a serious question.
I predicted this would happen months ago.
I looked around.
One senator called the president of another country, an old intelligence officer who would like to restore that country's old empire.
Would you like some more tea?
Exer blew the tire.
Do you think Tom broke the window?
I'll talk to Tom about it.
Don't stand.
There are many galaxies in the universe.
You're very pale.
She hesitated for a moment.
Could it be done?
Can I ask you something?
I want us to be more than friends.
Can you explain?
I bought some groceries.
All things are coming to an end.
You just saved me a lot of time.
He was Leyl's own dance partner.
A little bird told me.
Can I take you home?
Tom has his reasons.
Tom said he needed my help.
No doubt.
Just tell Tom I called.
We could use some help.
Tom's still frustrated.
Tom made it clear he wouldn't.
The infrared and ultraviolet rays are the kind of light invisible to the human eye.
This is useful information.
Sit still for a second.
I shouldn't have taken that off.
Tell me what you wrote.
"Learn from your mistakes" and "Experience is the best teacher," they say, but in the long run even the best teacher is angry, if he or she has too much to teach in little time.
Deal the cards, Tom.
I agree with what you wrote.
There's really no need to do that.
I hope it'll be dry time.
Could you take a look and see if there's enough bread for our lunch tomorrow?
I know him well.
Are they in love?
No one knows what's going on behind those doors.
How could I resist?
I bought a lot of things.
I'm just not very happy.
Let me see you, Tom.
It's very hard for me to trust anyone.
In our world, education is disappointing.
I've read about a hundred books so far.
Mario bought a microscope.
I've never camped.
I'm only listening to you.
He rarely gets angry.
Why do you want to hurt me so much?
Did you wash the dishes?
When he got back from duty in Afghanistan, Tom was chased by the nightmares.
I made up my mind.
Thank you so much!
It won't have any effect.
Don't be blushing.
Do you have the right one?
I need your help.
I'm the responsible person.
Add some more water.
What Tom suggests could save us all time.
Beautiful!
He's pretty busy now.
We're not proud of that.
It's a Cuban cigarette.
Tom cooks potatoes to make potato salad.
Everyone else.
Come closer.
I'm not always right.
Tell me what that is.
This isn't your hat, is it?
That's not a good sign.
I'm trying to figure out how you did it.
Anyway, you're not right.
It's hard to give up long-term love of one.
Tom likes extreme sports.
Strong commitment to the environment is not compatible with large investments in oil and gas.
I got a white horse.
Let's talk about this during lunch.
Say hello to your friends.
How did I miss that?
Is breakfast included in the price?
Tom hates strangers.
We need to respect personal rights.
What's that thing and your right hand?
Can I call you around 2:30?
Anybody in Disneyland with me?
Why is it so interesting to paint trains?
I don't usually write songs like this.
It's really so simple.
That was a ridiculous mistake.
What are you eating at all?
Don't talk.
Call him whatever you want.
I feel safe with you.
Tom tried to convince Mary not to do that, but he didn't make it.
Jumi will be a teacher.
I need you.
Fuck you!
His mother is a Yugoslav.
There must be a better way to do this.
That didn't matter to me.
He loves me tomorrow!
It's too loud for me here.
I'm glad Tom won.
There's nobody like you.
Tell Tom you love him before it's too late.
Tom wrote a long letter to Mary, but he didn't send it to her.
He's got a good memory.
The widows are choking from the cold.
Tom's not very nice.
I really need Tom here.
I believe you're honest.
Come play with us.
Do you know Tom ever lied?
Mary is a Catholic, but her boyfriend is an atheist.
I'll never tell anyone who you are.
Tom arrived this morning.
He's pretty busy right now.
Here's some good news.
I'm proud of my family.
Tom seemed very confused.
There was a list of available candidates.
Tom never said anything about it.
Don't get undressed.
Tom never asked why.
Come here.
Tom will know.
Her passport was stolen.
Did I ask you?
I've seen enough for now.
Turn around!
Four kilograms of gold was needed to get the winning medals.
Give me the sword.
He's not smart enough to know the numbers in his head.
Watch out for me, and I'll watch out for you.
You have to trust me.
I don't think your plan is realistic.
Are you familiar with the man?
Would you like to talk to Tom about me?
We have to work right now.
I'm not afraid of death, I'm afraid of dying.
Everybody says that.
He speaks clearly.
We're here to play golf.
Actually, I've never met Tom.
Don't yell.
This one's unique.
I'm too old for this.
We'll just follow you.
It's hard to know for yourself.
You'll need it later.
Tom's in the garage, working on his motorcycle.
You're just shot.
My income was reduced by ten percent.
It can be hard to go around the unknown field.
They're ready to talk about the problem.
Finally!
Tom appreciates contemporary art.
After a long consideration, at the end of the coincidence, I made things.
It's okay.
I can't believe you didn't recognize me.
Does that happen often?
We're down.
Can you talk to me?
It's a low TV.
I've been wearing short sleeves for years.
Old people often talk to themselves.
Tom was hoping to become a famous writer.
Tom became a member of this club three years ago.
Tom showed me the poems he wrote when he was a teenager.
Where's Avis' cellar?
Tom could tell us how to do it.
I was just leaving.
She spends three dollars a day on lunch and dinner.
I'll see you in your dreams.
Come in here.
I'll be home tomorrow.
I think you're stupid about that.
I've seen enough for now.
I feel bad because I lied.
They told me to wait here.
I'm not young enough to know everything.
How would you know that?
Tell me what you know.
Tom will remember.
Why doesn't he just tell Tom?
If there's no porn with that, porn will be made with that.
Canada is a country-mother hockey on ice.
What did I forget to say?
How often do you clean your room?
Tom's saving so he can go abroad.
I don't mean to change.
I want to go to Bala.
You can do it if you try.
I'm the one who gave it to Tom.
I'm glad Tom won.
This is no doubt a very unpleasant situation for me.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that.
She jogs every morning before breakfast.
This time it leads to the city.
I'm not happy with that.
These are my best friends.
I have to live.
We have two sons.
Tom was the only boy invited to Mary's party.
Don't talk.
We had a bad fight.
Stop watching TV and start learning.
We don't know our neighbors.
The police found stolen money.
I've never seen that before.
I came here a few minutes before you.
I didn't do it either.
How much does a bottle of beer cost?
Tom is so rich that even his servants have servants.
It's too bad!
I'm tired of arguing.
I've got enough room.
Don't yell.
I can't stop thinking about stolen money.
That train's over.
Come see us.
I don't think he knows I love you.
I'm not mad at anyone.
They need each other.
I'm trying to be careful.
Check this out.
Come quickly!
Where's my suitcase?
He wants to get rid of painful memories.
I'm convinced.
My music is important.
Do you have a favorite?
Please come.
Take it easy!
I thought I didn't know what was going on.
My friend got 95 points on the math exam.
Tom didn't let anyone else into his room.
It's better with grace than with force.
They're waiting for you.
There is no "freedom" in Russian.
I thought you were gonna be busy.
Could that be true?
Just keep quiet, Tom.
I hope Tom's safe.
We've been talking about it all night.
What are you gonna do this summer?
I tried to stop doing more things at the same time.
Let's get out of here.
That must have been hard.
I'll call her by phone tonight.
I had to make some difficult decisions.
The ammonia is the base.
Check again.
Are you honest?
That made sense to me.
Tell me what to do.
I'm not told anything.
Tom didn't make friends as easy as Mary.
I predicted this would happen months ago.
Bad weather stopped me from leaving.
Tom bought the paper.
And that's for me.
All future meetings will be held in this room.
Black smoke came out of the chimney.
I know sir.
You'll never catch me alive!
I was open and honest.
It's time for you to go to bed.
Give me the dollar for the book.
What is this?
Tom fell asleep again.
Don't move!
Tom only talks to Mary.
The first lesson is easy.
You grew up pretty fast.
Tom's gonna make it.
I got off the train.
I'm pretty good at doing more things at the same time.
Nobody's as fast as you.
I agreed to buy that.
Is it just me who's going to the party?
I really hope you're kidding.
Please, be honest with me.
Are you sarcastic?
Tell me where you live.
Can you prove that?
You can't go into that room.
It's all here.
Tom and Mary were wrong about it.
I'm not as tall as you.
How many years has it been since I last saw you?
Tom was quiet for a second.
I knew I should never have gotten involved in your stupid business.
We cooperated.
Do you think I missed something?
Tom's saving to buy a yacht.
Everyone except Tom knows why his wife left him.
You're driving me crazy.
I had nothing in common with them.
I'm claustrophobic.
The new branch to Haugesund will become the main effective travel link to Oslo and Eastern Norway for the entire Western region.
You let me down.
I'm really happy about that.
Tom doubts that Mary and I have something wrong.
Where did you find this knife?
You look good for your years.
Tom managed to find Mary's house without difficulty.
It's not easy sport.
I just don't want to do that.
You shouldn't have bought that.
Their right to vote.
Tell me where you are.
Shall we see Tom again?
My mother cooks for me.
I'm trying to be careful.
A woman eats bread.
I listened to music.
Are you involved in this?
I must have eaten something bad.
Let's go soon.
Is Tom still there?
Everyone knows I don't like Tom.
Avoid the addicts on the color-distorting device.
I liked that one.
Do you like roller-costers?
Tom says the same thing.
We just want to go home.
Can you smile at Tom?
You have no idea how right you are.
Tom and I were busy.
I assumed you were busy.
Tom couldn't attend the meeting because he was sick.
Tell me why you did it.
How many people were there?
I'm sure I'll miss Tom a lot.
So where did Tom go?
It's easy to hang out with Tom.
Mary came back from school crying because her friends were teasing her.
I don't think anyone knows.
Why are you so paranoid?
Tom was running around the room, unable to calm down.
Could I have a hug?
I got an empty cage.
Get some rest, Tom.
We're here to play golf.
Why don't you come by sometime?
She's wondering how that's possible.
Look at that.
Wake up!
You chose a nice one.
Look at the size of it!
Mary is the wedding planner.
Houston, we had a problem.
Why do you always have to get involved?
I have trouble talking about my feelings.
Mary came back from school crying because her friends were teasing her.
I'm not sure when Tom's gonna make it.
You should come home.
Alice laughed.
We can watch Tom in the suit, behind a big black piano with dramatic movements of fingers, creating music that is very pleasant to listen to.
The strong winds broke a lot of branches out of the tree last night.
Shouldn't you be getting ready for work?
There are 40 students in this class.
The way to a man's heart leads through the stomach.
It's time to get up.
The house is built of brick.
I didn't write this.
I can't help feeling partly responsible.
People were good to me.
Tom's out of sight now.
We should celebrate together.
Tom and Mary will leave today.
Have you ever tried?
I could go with you.
Take a minute.
Come on in.
There's really no need to do that.
I wonder what Tom's planning to do.
To join the mountain, you need to be able to read the notes.
Tom was shaking.
They wanted an apology.
Where was I wrong?
Does that make you angry?
I drink vitamins every day.
I'll call you later.
Why me?
Tom's cooking for us.
We live in the house.
Tom says he's healthy.
I'm the only one here who can do it.
The zoo is closed on Monday.
That's the point.
Learning foreign languages is useful for everyone.
They don't like to do that.
She let me go.
It is very natural for a human being to always give priority to the interests of others.
It's all right.
Do you think Tom broke the window?
I've got a lot of planned things for tomorrow.
I thought it was pathetic.
Why are you still awake?
I was in school yesterday.
Tom does what he's told.
I'm still working.
Unsatisfied, insensitive children can sometimes grow up in sociopaths.
I'd like to be with you.
Police work is to prevent and investigate crime.
Can you give me a remote?
This isn't exactly what I wanted.
We're all working too hard.
Thank you for everything you've done for us.
I'm not perfect.
Tom's studying very fast.
You're different.
She's an unknown hater of others.
This will make our job much easier.
He loves football.
Monasy was able to play tennis in monasteries.
Nobody trusts him anymore.
Keep out of the reach and sight of children.
Who's Tom?
I was wondering if I might dream.
Everything changes over time.
No one's going anywhere.
Driving to work for an hour and a half.
It's right.
Your time will come soon.
Tom had no idea I was gonna be there.
This doesn't matter.
Tom's in the warehouse.
I was in Rome.
I'm natural.
I turned around.
I completely forgot to do that.
Marriage is the main cause of all divorces.
He's here.
I'll make up something.
Play it again, Sam.
Some of us feel that such views are just crazy.
Someone could be hurt.
Tom didn't write a letter to Mary until he was here.
We've had enough of you.
We all know Tom's guilty.
We need to understand.
I'll be right back.
Look at these.
Don't forget to extend your passport.
I think Tom pulled the thicker end.
I bet Tom never talked to you like that.
I've changed.
When I woke up this morning, I felt a mild pain.
Is that the woman who knows the answer?
We hope Tom's OK.
I've read about a hundred books so far.
Come play with us.
And it was only with great pain.
I'll go if you go.
Let's watch TV.
Did you write the number?
That's not a reason for panic.
I only got 20 points on the math exam.
I'm really happy to be here.
What are you looking at?
I still don't understand anything.
My mother died the day I got married.
Investigate this.
My future is in your hands.
He's a liar, isn't he?
Tom has three sons and one daughter.
That's what I'm used to doing.
I met him the day before.
Don't stop.
Help us find this card.
I'm not mad at anyone.
I think that's really important.
That's so sad.
How clever!
In short, I don't agree.
I'm a responsible person.
You're not having fun with anyone, are you?
I played the piano a long time ago, so I can still play a little bit.
Is this your glass or your sister?
The battle lasted a week.
Tom knew what he wanted.
Mother and daughter represented two generations.
He drew out himself that he had to work in the garden for two hours a day.
Apples and pears are presented, not gold and green woods.
I'm resting my legs.
I really like to practice.
I'm really proud of that.
We were in the last place.
I added.
Is it true that Tom can't read and write?
Isn't that black?
You're absolutely right.
Come, sit next to me.
Let's not talk about this now.
It's time to break up.
What kind of food do you like to cook?
I was just thinking about you.
I love dogs.
Who are they talking to?
The rendezvous is ready.
She looks good for her years.
What is this?
What are you eating at all?
I don't like being judged.
I have an appointment tonight.
A man hopes for his life.
Be careful.
Let's discuss options.
That was a funny movie.
Bitcoin's encrypted.
I think it's a waste of time.
We're trying.
Why is this our problem?
Tom will take care of this.
Go take a look.
Some of us hate it.
"This came for you." "Uh..." "Do you remember the one she sent you when you asked you to take pictures of Epljek's brother?" "Yes." And then she told you to write a review of Mek's physical appearance." "Yes." "Then she sent a review of Mek's." "Yes." "What did you tell her that you learned from that?" "I realized that Philip's sraffiger was convincing, but not misleading; and that Rerit paid hardly things that I think she should do as a friend."
I've always loved horror movies.
Napoleon's horse was white.
People were nice to me.
How'd I miss it?
I go to church only out of respect for my mother.
It's better to live one day as a lion than a hundred years as a sheep.
Tom won't be able to answer these questions.
I'll do it with pleasure.
You don't have to eat right before you go to bed.
Tom's gonna wait.
The students didn't know how to answer.
I'm not a night bird.
Tom bought me a VIP card.
I'm the one who should do it.
Tom's gonna call.
He lit the oven before he went into the cave.
I'm not hiding from anyone.
This is a very good place.
I don't live with Tom.
I heard Tom dropped out of college.
Why do you hate me so much?
Tom will understand.
Those girls are very busy.
Give us some space.
There's truth in what Tom's talking about.
You didn't say anything wrong.
I'm sick of your whining.
Get out!
We have two TVs.
We like to play football.
Make a place.
The horse must have slipped and the knight fell off the horse.
I'm investigating it right now.
She's reached her goal.
Tom can do what he wants, as far as I'm concerned.
Tom said he needed money.
Tom was pretty good.
He couldn't understand a lot of what they said to each other.
Oh, leave me alone.
That's what they both like.
We've been sitting together for a while.
You look great.
I'm home.
He never goes by train.
The two sides will hold talks this week.
I'm planning on giving my son a computer at the end of the month.
Why did you shave your beard?
Tom's not a good writer.
I've never noticed that before.
We know who he is.
I need a cab.
I saw the cat.
I'm in the plaster.
Mom just went shopping.
I'm always nervous about passport control.
It needs help.
Defend yourself.
He got a cab to the hospital.
Can you chew?
Don't touch the lion while he sleeps.
Tom's uncomfortable.
Could it be alive?
Did you just meet him?
Honestly, I don't know.
It's your choice.
It's safer.
Tell me about your teacher.
I saw the house.
Maybe she has other plans?
The patient gave up.
Thank you all for that.
I don't see anything suspicious.
Am I so different?
Whose handwriting is this?
Feels good.
I'm sure you'll be fine.
Let's have lunch here.
I'll find the money somehow.
I shot a bear.
I'm sorry I'm leaving.
The oracle is the king's bird.
The fire hit the first floor.
Tom was very happy when his team won.
They decided to get married.
What did you two do?
I'm afraid you got this wrong.
I'm adopted.
We have direct access to information.
I'm being punished.
The cat lay stretched all the length of the sun's light passing through the window.
Are you going to school on foot or on a bike?
Tom's not much happier.
Will I just go to the party?
I'm proud of our team.
Only Tom and Mary were saved.
I'm done.
I wasn't so impressed with that.
I left Tom in 2013.
Mary knows that her main weapon is beautiful face and young body, passing values.
I saw the mouse.
He's trying.
Two countries have negotiated a peace agreement.
Tom's grandfather knew my grandfather.
Answer me right now.
It seemed like they knew what they were looking for.
You tried.
We're just gonna follow you.
I'd better go with Tom.
Let's try it.
I'd like to know what's going on here.
Tom really knows a lot.
It needs a dream.
That's what I have to tell Tom.
I don't live in that town.
I'm sure Tom will come to the party.
Tom's not a kid anymore.
I thought you were gonna be busy.
I'm a vegetarian.
I'm used to doing it.
I have a sharp knife.
Tom asked me if he could use my computer.
That's very nice of you.
I've heard this joke before.
I think I missed something.
Send Tom in.
Tom asked me some questions about what just happened.
I'll let you know.
I've been instinctively reactive.
The answer to this question is simple.
I'll make sure Tom has everything he needs.
He was bare boobs and bosses.
She's just out of my league.
What are we actually looking for?
Why are you all in shock?
Schools and roads are tax-paying services.
What does the doctor think is wrong?
Don't push.
Looks like we're just the two of us.
Things are very different today.
I couldn't stop crying.
Some religious people can be very judgmental.
I'm really sick of this.
Tom did it the old way.
Where's Tehran?
Let's look at that again.
Sounds like a betrayal to me.
That's what we need to practice.
Why are you all shocked?
That's part of my responsibility.
Under the drawing, he wrote, "Take the spears!"
You're driving slow.
What a man you are!
Two measures, one cut!
How long did Tom have it?
We can save some time if we do what Tom suggests.
If you want to talk to a lot of people, you need to learn Esperanto. Why is this language? Because at the same time it is beautiful and stimulates our learning. International language is very important because there are so many people from different countries around the world. Besides, Esperanto is not just useful for learning. If you learn Esperanto, you can travel to many countries. Come and learn!
I'm not the only one who doesn't like Tom.
Have you slept?
I'll take you to Tom's.
Could it be Tom?
I have three beautiful grandchildren.
Don't argue.
She got her fingers on the table.
I'm learning a few languages.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that.
I wanted to write to you, but I forgot.
You're good to everyone.
Tom showed up in the sky.
I wasn't interested.
That's not true, is it?
Tom said he didn't see anything weird.
You'll never make it in time.
That sounds like treason to me.
I'll make sure I don't bother you while you're studying.
Life is short.
They'll know.
All participants gathered in the main hall.
Don't overdo it.
Hey, relax.
I'm sure you're very busy.
Tom tried to convince Mary not to leave.
Tom's gonna make it.
Tom was totally scared.
Whose guitar is this?
This won't hurt at all.
We have to get out of here.
We can't stop Tom from doing that.
I'm not selective.
That's what I used to do.
Tom's still at work.
You'd better think when you shut up.
Are we all here?
It's turning around.
Tom was a painkiller.
Everything or nothing.
Do they love each other?
I've contributed.
I'll sign.
Shame him.
That's right.
We hope you like it.
Will the future be like science fiction?
It just happened again.
How long have you been here?
Tom's rich and free.
My mother bought two bottles of orange juice.
That's not exactly my job.
I'm turning around.
Honestly, I don't know.
I hope it's gonna be okay.
The wind calmed down.
In the bedroom, I have a mirror from the floor to the ceiling.
I wish I could've remembered that.
Don't say you didn't.
What can you do?
Get out of there.
The Czech festival was held in Latvia.
We're what we are.
Where did you get that idea?
She let me go.
You didn't answer the question.
We're in.
Nobody's coming to save you.
I don't want to do that.
Tom always bothers me.
Are you ready?
She's proud of her talent.
You can start right now.
You need one of these.
I'm impressed with you.
I can't decide where to park.
Cool!
How's this your fault?
Security has been increased in the city.
Cheers!
Tom will stay.
That boy talks like he's an adult.
The Sharks cost three dollars.
My bike's new.
Tom told me he loved me today.
I doubt Tom knows that.
Can I take you home?
That's what I've been trying.
Go upstairs.
There's no parking allowed.
I'm running early.
Tom thinks the same way.
It's so important.
How long have you stayed?
Tom's a passionate biker.
How did you find Tom's hideout?
We want to go to Boston and Chicago.
Let's take a look.
I'm too busy at work.
Tom's family moved a lot.
We liked food, especially fish.
And they lived happily ever after.
Tom's too poor to hire a lawyer.
Don't be blind.
I'm interested.
What's the problem?
He's not a doctor.
Tom was accidentally made.
Is the handsome man Arabic or Hindi?
Let's meet for a drink.
I forget where I leave my hat.
He's got it on again.
I want to see the ocean, too.
Don't even write!
Who doesn't do that?
Tom does it sometimes.
God knows.
Tom loved Mary.
What do you say I do that?
Let's discuss your idea.
Tom said he was innocent.
All the girls love Tom.
I'm sure you'll be fine.
Cover your mouth while you cough, yell, or yell.
Tom's got a finger.
He was a man who never dared to resist.
Probably the periodic appearance of anger is due to the fact that floating ice from Siberia can carry polar foxes on them.
I heard you didn't eat meat.
Maybe Tom was involved.
I've been having memory problems lately.
I'm a Canadian.
I'll try.
Am I ever wrong?
What's the name of that restaurant?
It's an official job.
Their friendship gradually turned into love.
Who's that?
Forget it.
I agreed to buy it.
What do the papers say?
The sun's surface temperature is about 6000°C.
He asked many questions about Islam himself.
If we leave right now, we'll be in Boston by 2:30.
What did you two do?
Where's Tom going to sleep?
Why would Tom want that?
It's hard to figure out what really happened.
She went through her hair with her fingers.
Tom is working hard to support his family.
Tom and I are very close friends.
Tom says he has four houses in five different countries.
Let's see what Tom's gonna say.
I'm starving.
Don't argue.
Come here.
Just tell me you're okay.
Who's Tom?
I'm not afraid of aging.
I don't fully agree with you.
There are many possible answers to that question.
Let's eat ice cream now, before it melts.
I'm just doing my job.
I took the first step.
I love watching you play.
It's hard to apply what we said in practice.
How long has your head been hurting?
Ole, the oldest eagle in the world, just died.
Come to the meeting.
I'm proud of this team.
I fell asleep.
Your mother put a collage on your top shelf.
Did you see anyone there?
My father is so old he can't work.
He got what he wanted.
What if I'm right?
I'd like to know how to paint like that.
I'll try to find them.
I had a problem solving that problem.
I don't know what's wrong, still or just before, it was good, but more times when I was trying to log on to the website today, I couldn't do it.
Do I usually seem happy?
I went there on my own.
You better think when you close your eyes.
They really thought that.
Have you ever been here?
Do you really think I'm selfish?
Everyone's here.
We're almost done.
Maybe they need something to eat.
I thought you'd be busy.
I'm adaptable.
The fugitive from prison was quickly caught again.
Everything seemed possible at the time.
I sent a map to Tom by fax.
I have a memory problem these days.
Tom may not make it to the meeting.
Tom died almost the same time.
The judge's got a check.
They also discovered that the same wrong assessment was made in some other cases.
Try to stay cool, Tom.
We need to find Tom.
I hope this will never happen again.
Please be honest with me.
Tom stayed for a few days.
Tom could be here.
I'll do everything for you.
I didn't understand the question.
It was just a matter of time.
Don't be blind.
You should be able to change.
Does Tom have a cable?
Those who want to stay can stay.
If the rental period is extended beyond the contractual period, the proportional rent supplement shall be calculated.
Why should I tell Tom?
Let your imagination be available.
Tom knows the names of all his customers.
Tom saves more than 80% of what he owes.
Are we safe now?
We're what we are.
It's not honest at all.
It's wonderful!
That's great!
Tom knows what he likes.
I'm dyslexic.
You've helped me a lot.
Identify yourself.
I'm really happy about that.
It just has to be like that.
I'll come when I can.
Don't get dressed.
It's not all gold.
Are we all here?
We need to focus on our virtues.
How fast!
Faith can move the mountains.
I don't give up!
Tom fell off the truck while he was feeding Irvase.
Tom became a pulsator even though his parents were wearing it.
I think we met earlier.
I've made a mistake before.

It's treason.
I'm not late, am I?
Let's go get Tom.
Tell me where you live.
You don't remember anything?
Tom's drinking a lot.
I'm not from here.
Tom was sitting on the grass under a coconut tree.
Everyone laughed.
I'm tougher than I look.
I don't want you to see me naked.
Can I go?
Tom doesn't like to do that.
Do you have a copy?
Come help me.
I barely got out of the house when it started raining.
Tom likes to be busy.
First.
Tom's just lazy.
I'm a little smacked.
Does that mean you love me?
Check this out.
Is there any evidence?
You must be strong!
Are you ready for more?
Tom turned on the trigger.
Tom always laughs at me.
She rarely, maybe never, goes to bed 11 hours ago.
Are they all crazy?
What are you eating at all?
He's so weird.
I'm pulling a line here.
Pay attention to school rules.
Keep digging.
Which school did you go to?
Can I hear another one?
Everyone's gone.
I've already written to Tom.
Tom had to rewrite the composition.
You want to get involved?
I knew I shouldn't be involved in your crazy business.
Tom asked me for permission to use my computer.
Was I really so happy?
Tell me what this says.
I'm not upset anymore.
Did Tom change his mind?
Get out of here.
Do you think what she said was a lie?
His younger brother is a famous footballer.
Saosam was too busy.
I already told him.
How does that work?
Will we see Tom again?
You're different.
Let's go somewhere, Tom.
That's my job, not Tom's.
Tell me what that is.
Tell him I'm innocent.
I'd like to help.
It'd be hard.
She's making him meals.
Where did you learn English?
Beauty lies in the eyes of observers.
How are you feeling today?

Naoko lives in a white house.
Tom plays the piano very well.

I don't know anything about her.
You just got hit.
I'm here for you.

The seniors should pay for their hats and their dress.
Is he looking at me?
Don't move!
It was all Tom's fault.
I've been training for months.
What was the plan anyway?
You should be here at least half an hour.
Tom said no one was hurt.
Maybe Tom was involved.
I thought I didn't know Tom.
I saw a Nile horse in the zoo.
I'm thinking about Tom sometimes.
Are you both drunk?
Please be honest with me.
Don't go out tonight.
It's not easy to entertain Tom.
He's a man of words.
I'll see if Tom can help us.
It broke into two pieces.
Muriel is now 20.
Did you eat anything?
Did you go see Tom?
Tom's gonna make it.
Why are you acting like a child?
That's exactly what the doctor ordered.
Could you read it?
It's a glass window.
Are you done yet?
Does Tom have the key?
Don't talk.
Don't stop.
Are you sure this is safe?
Better the devil you know than the devil you don't know.
You'll be better in a few days.
That's what Tom would like us to do.
Tom said to ask you.
Just tell me the truth.
I'm not ready yet.
I'm not upset at all.
Tom's a bookie.
I've changed my mind.
The problem is it's too expensive.
Many would like to be motivated, creative, thinkative beings, only if they had that chance.
You sound tired.
Tom was wrong about that.
Tom always makes a mess of things.
That's not the right thing.
Please record everything I say.
I wish you could sleep.
Maybe you can't hear me.
We're grilling.
I thought you were married.
Somehow I'll find the money.
I assumed you were busy.
I hear Tom's interested.
We should move forward.
What are your ambitions?
I don't like eating white oak in the morning.
I think Tom's very smart.
Do you really want to learn another language?
I think I'm fat.
I think we were lucky.
Don't talk.
Come on, have a drink with me.
Stop screaming.
It's Saturday.
They were evacuated to the American Polish Hospital.
We'll run to the park.
You can't sit next to me.
I'm not happy about that.
Could you read it?
We need to call Tom.
Tom's not strong enough.
Tell me what he says here.
I'm staying.
I know Tom let you down.
Tom was badly injured.
If you need help, tell me.
I took the first step.
I'm still a little tired.
I'm sure there's a better way to do it.
The first one goes at 5:30 and arrives at 20:25.
That was a little weird.
Does it read and write Japanese?
Tom put a card on the table.
It was just an accident.
Tom never even saw us.
I'm not going to do that.
Tom says he wasn't here.
It usually works.
How did you find Tom's hideout?
Go upstairs.
Can you give me a sign?
And now it's from our sponsor.
Do you have a copy?
We can't call him a witness.
That's not the main question.
We're glad we're here.
I'm armed.
Tom can't hold on.
It's time to sleep.
Tom wanted him to have a better cat than his neighbor.
I'm impressed with you.
Did you bring the fen?
I already ordered it.
We'll never know why.
How are you feeling?
Bitcoin and etherium are virtual currencies.
It's all very cheap.
Anything you remember can help.
A lot of predictions don't come true.
I admit I'm tired.
I'm still wrong.
Turns out it's true.
I'm sorry.
Tom likes a good party.
I don't care what he says.
Mary knows everything about the latest fashion trends.

My father doesn't like football.
This hat is from Australia.
I'm not talking to Tom.
Go take a look.
I thought the food was great.
I'm dumb and I'm not alone when I eat.
You look fat.
You have to learn English step by step.
That's better now than it was before.
Tom and Mary differ like heaven and earth.
Tom asked me for an opinion on who would win the race.
A man has many desires which he does not really want to fulfill and would even be wrong to suppose otherwise. He wants them to remain only desires, they have value only in his imagination; their fulfillment would be bitter disappointment for him. One such desire is also the desire for eternal life. If it was fulfilled, man would become completely ill from eternal life, and would faint for death.
Does Tom really speak French?
I'm not a prophet.
I can't fix the car myself.
She's taking care of her old mother.
Tom had the same problem.
Don't laugh.
Tom and I just wrote a few books together.
There's news.
No one really wants us.
They all paid.
Be careful.
I'm alone.
Don't drink water.
I don't want to ruin your day.
The price of gold changes every day.
Tom's married.
I could go with you.
Why are you wearing a sweater?
You don't have the right to enter that room.
Do you have time to come tomorrow?
Tom hates his little bedroom.
Why is it interesting to paint trains?
I hope you like it.
He'll be back very soon.
Enjoy it as long as you can!
Tom's a prostitute.
What are you planning on doing this summer?
Do you have any questions?
I know him well.
Betoven wrote nine symphonies.
I'll hurry.
We'll do the job.
It's time for the truth.
Do you like costumes?
I saw Marcus' house.
It's really pretty bad.
Thank you all for that.
They wouldn't follow us.
The house where Ataturk was born in Thessaloniki.
People are wrong.
He's got two cars.
That was three months ago.
Let's hear your excuse.
They formed a swim team.
Tom took the package to the orphanage.
Keep digging.
Tom jumped up and down.
Tom's dog was lying.
Don't talk.
This information is confidential.
No, no, no.
They're not mine.
I'm ready!
Don't overdo it.
I can't approve this project.
Are you sending a message to Mary?
I'll save your place first.
Mary pushes her kids to play football.
Have they arrived yet?
Don't forget to give me the pen.
I tried to convince Tom to come home.
What did you conclude?
I prayed for you.
The bathroom's upstairs.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
Tom cheated on you.
It's only a few minutes from here.
What do you know about me?
I got off the bus.
You're average students.
As a child, many violent criminals tortured animals indiscriminately.
How long are you gonna get angry and yell at us?
How important is that?
Do we want an appetizer?
If you want, I'll teach you how to play ukuules.
I'm used to it.
It's not so scary.
I like to play the music my friends wrote.
Tom confessed.
It's hard to work with you.
Tom grew up.
I'm guilty.
Don't answer.
Bring me some wine.
Things aren't always what they look like.
Show me the photos!
It takes a few old houses to be destroyed.
What did you do?
I tried to be aggressive.
Tom was sneaking into the party.
Tom's very sensitive.
When are you going?
This report is not written very well.
She points out that this last government move has multiple meanings.
Tom's here this morning.
It took about a year.
How did I miss it?
It could be a trick.
Don't forget to rub your sunscreen.
Tom didn't try to deny Mary's verdict.
Tell me what this is.
His hair almost covered his face.
How can I hate Tom?
India is the seventh largest country in the world.
How much did you have to pay Tom to get him to clean up the snow from the roof?
I'll take it from you.
A student from Oslo who falsified his diploma to enroll in college was sentenced to prison.
Tom knows it's over.
I wish I could think of that.
Tom made vegetarian chili.
I wanted to help you.
You were really good to me.
Who are you really?
We all cried a lot.
Did you wash the dishes?
I'll tell you the truth now.
Do I usually look happy?
It's not just an essay problem, it's all these devastating questions and explanations of words that drive me crazy!
He's here this weekend.
Looks uncomfortable.
What did you both do?
That was a lucky shot.
I thought Tom was amazing.
I've never seen anything like it before.
I'm buying a lot of stuff in that store.
I wish you were with me.
Try this.
Clear a little.
Don't push.
Can we try this?
Most people like chicken.
I didn't do that either.
Let's take a look again.
The last time I went to the beach, I was hot.
Pull back.
The city was destroyed during the war.
Watch out here, Tom.
We've repaired some damage caused by the spraying of stones on your car.
His girlfriend didn't provide support.
Do you doubt me?
Luckily, Tom didn't get seriously hurt.
Tom's gonna cry.
We need your help.
I think we've had enough.
Are you ready for more?
Just try.
Tom's upstairs.
We'll try your way.
How could I resist?
Tom's afraid of death.
I can't fix the car myself.
Most people think I'm crazy.
Tom says this is normal.
Tell me what you wrote.
I'm confident.
I don't think so.
My mother died the day I got married.
Don't let anyone in!
We're not getting into that.
Hold on, Tom.
Tom definitely pulled out a thicker end.
He's not even.
It's all right with me.
It's obvious Tom's sick.
I started to learn English when I was twelve, then I was interested in languages, but not to that extent. Now I speak English, French, Spanish and Portuguese; so it's time to learn Latin.
We live in a very safe country.
I can't remember the melodies of that song.
I need an honest girl.
She's a beginner.
Are they still there?
I'm sure I'll miss Tom a lot.
Tom won't run away.
I'd go.
Get down!
Tom couldn't bear it.
Anything you remember can help.
It's not something to worry about.
I realize they're thorny in the eyes of people like you, but this is just miserable.
Tom's gonna make it.
No free lunch.
Please leave this place as clean as you would like to find it.
Did Tom really move to Boston?
We can only do that.
Guys, can I talk to you for a minute?
It's your life.
We got lucky, didn't we?
I'm sorry.
Stop feeling sorry for yourself.
You learn what you do.
You'll never walk alone.
Tom's the one you want.
She won't take it.
There's no rule without exception.
Maybe you need a shovel.
I'm doing my job.
It's quiet again.
I didn't make it.
Tom's going to school for graphic design.
Since the message was in French, I couldn't read it.
He's always dissatisfied.
You should face reality.
We managed to escape right on time.
I'm tired of everything.
Tom doesn't fit in here.
I want to talk to Tom about it.
It's supposed to work.
She hated him.
I could talk to Tom.
It just happens that way.
Take a minute.
He's talking about others so they'd like to talk about you!
Tom was so confused he didn't even know what question to ask.
Find Tom.
I think I'm okay.
What do you think?
You changed my life.
The reaction is not always the best way to work.
I won't tell anyone you did it.
Tom asked Mary to take him to the airport.
The Committee recommends that those who complained should be compensated for the proportional share of annual interest payments.
Tom bought time.
This is my computer.
It was kind of supernatural.
In theory it's possible, but in practice it's very difficult.
Well, it was worth it.
Please send me your picture.
Tom's disengaged.
Remember file names before trying to revert deleted files.
I'm trying to be careful.
Tom was running down the street.
The answer to this question is free.
Let's get to work.
I wasn't nervous about that.
Tom said he wouldn't be waiting for us.
Tom had no idea I'd be there.
We won't let you die.
A lot of things go by my hand.
Tom wants his children to learn the importance of work.
Tom was always a pig.
I'm not married to Tom.
Tom is one of the best lawyers in Boston.
How much am I gonna get?
How many close friends do you have?
It's happening.
How long do you think Tom was getting ready for the exam?
Why are you doing this to yourself?
You don't have to throw stones at a glass house.
I'll scream.
Mary was quiet for a moment.
Do you have a dog?
I tried to get Tom to come home.
I'd turn myself in.
Don't cedillas.
I shouldn't have told Tom to do that.
All future meetings will be held in this room.
Check everyone.
I probably won't watch TV tonight.
Did Tom pull the thick end?
Give me all the money.
Mer has been very supportive.
The girl sees the boy.
It's very difficult, almost impossible, to find an apartment in Oslo.
My French is still not very good.
It happened right here.
I don't know Latin well.
Swimming is a form of exercise.
I'm waiting for my turn.
I got a lot of news.
You're not the one who died.
Would you like some tea?
I'll explain.
I'm too busy at work.
Tom asked for help.
They know you.
I passed every test.
There's no point just waiting for something to happen; you have to do something right now.
It's about the area with a lot of new houses.
I can't believe all this.
I could have gone, but I didn't want to.
The snow fell yesterday.
We walked through the park.
I was in a great mood.
Tom hid a spare key in his garden.
I'm sure Tom will win.
I went out to the wrong bus station.
I only wrote this song for you.
Have you read the Holy Bible?
And if I were rich, I wouldn't give him money.
Are we safe now?
Are you going to send this as an e-mail?
What do you suggest?
I don't have any homework today.
I was just too busy.
Did you talk about me?
The sky was darker and darker.
Watch out!
We did everything we could.
Am I ever wrong?
Come on, give me that.
Are you blaming me?
I wish I was beautiful.
For some strange people, the knowledge of a language is kept in secret.
I'm not going to change.
They moved forward slowly.
I survived.
Do you know how to use this machine?
Don't blink.
It's blue.
Come visit us soon.
Were you in an accident?
Tom's worried about what might happen.
He was an honorable man.
My father doesn't like football.
We're all out of alcohol.
Card, please.
My parents don't like my girlfriend.
Something was lying on the ground.
My friend lives a god behind his feet.
Do you think Tom would like to go fishing with us next weekend?
What are you gonna do today?
Tom looks like a banker.
It's Tom.
Tom still seems worried.
I didn't see anything.
Mary is a very shy girl.
Tom doesn't have that kind of problem.
You can't hide secrets from me.
It just happened again.
There's a hard day waiting for you.
It's okay.
Does that mean you love me?
It's really pretty bad.
I'm not going to participate.
Is it true that Tom can't read and write?
Justice must be completely satisfied.
I was so fat.
Let's stay inside tonight.
I thought Tom was amazing.
People don't always behave rationally.
I didn't even do that.
Did you pass the exams?
I wholeheartedly support your comments.
I'll try to convince Tom to help us.
Tom is one of the most interesting guys I've ever met.
Did we agree?
Let's talk in the hallway.
Can you ask Tom to call me?
We don't know for sure.
Tom went that way.
Am I safe now?
Give me the number.
I can't either.
I'm sure Tom won't do it.
Tom used to be scared of me.
Tom whispers something to Mary and she smiles.
Can I take a look at your card?
Be careful, the knife is very sharp.
It's clear.
It's your daughter's birthday.
Will anyone tell me what to do?
It's obviously a knock-on error.
Your book is twice my size.
We're both not as rich as we want.
Tom wouldn't be happy.
Tom has a nice garden.
The cup of coffee blew my head off.
Do I have a knife?
It just happened again.
It's Christmas.
Tom has a missing hair.
I've seen enough for now.
I hate that.
We'll miss you so much if you go to Japan.
Tell me what's going to happen.
He lied to us.
We're trying.
Tom's gonna look.
Here's what I think.
I could go with you.
I admit I'm tired.
I'm kidding.
Can you turn the bomb off?
I need another five minutes.
I bet you know who told me that.
Mary used the apples Tom gave her to make apple butter.
How many songs did you write?
We're glad to have you here.
You can write in any language.
How can we manage others when we cannot control ourselves?
Don't rush.
You can learn, regardless of your age.
He dedicated his life to the fulfillment of the vision of what he wanted to create for himself and others.
Did you give it to Tom?
Who did you help recently?
Just close your eyes.
Tom's a little worried.
How is this your fault?
How did I miss this?
What should I write here?
My father bought me a book.
I'm adaptable.
Citizenship is a prerequisite for voting.
How many times have you been here?
He's fixing electronic devices.
Lose yourself.
I'm ready, bro.
Please shut up as hard as you can.
This fish is big.
Pass me my sugar, please.
It's nice to be someone.
I hope we understand this.
We all have to face this.
I'm not sure when Tom will be back.
I thought it was shocking.
Then our manager came up with a good idea and we made a great plan.
I just want to eat something.
I'm so tired I can barely keep my eyes open.
Give me some sugar, please.
Come quickly!
Where'd you find the keys?
Have you ever hung a video on Jutjub?
I was very interested in participating in the construction of a more intensive academic programming plan.
Just give me the money.
She's pregnant.
Don't let Tom find out.
I can't wait for Monday.
Have you been here before?
Does Tom have any experience?
I don't understand.
Come here for a second.
So what did Tom see?
I could kill you now.
Mary used the walking sticks that helped her to climb and fall on her journey.
Compass points north.
Don't talk.
Some religious people can be very judgmental.
Whose initiative is this done?
Finish this.
What am I supposed to take?
I like cable food.
Where's your friend?
When do we start eating?
The Queen and the King have reunited their powers.
I don't know why my head hurts.
I suppose you already know the answer to that.
The flowers have been completely ingested.
"How old are you?" "Sixteen."
I like this book at least.
You look good in blue.
Tom wasn't as handsome as Marie said he would be.
Give me that other box.
Tom has an older brother, John.
I'd accept.
They'll know what to do.
Why'd you keep quiet all the time?
He's gone.
It was fun celebrating together.
I'm afraid I dislodged my right shoulder.
You really need to take a shower.
What is the purpose of life?
He's driving a pole.
She pulled my right hand.
I don't know anything about you.
Did you do something?
You should probably talk a little slower.
I need a beer.
I thought you were married.
It was a great success.
Sit down, please.
Does that happen often?
One bird told me.
I couldn't see who it was.
Crazy!
You pay me well.
I'm glad people saw that.
You need to talk to me.
It just wasn't our day.
Take everything.
I gave up.
It's all wrong.
It's all ruined.
Marriage between the same sex is now legal in 20 countries, including Ireland since yesterday.
Take this home with you.
She bought them bread.
We'll try your way.
Serve yourself.
You deserve my congratulations.
Since the message was in French, I read it easily.
Finish this.
Tom tried to answer Mary's question.
Can you give me some water, please?
It doesn't matter where I am.
Where have you been in Japan?
Everybody's gone.
I'll learn more.
I'm hurt.
I bought them for you.
None of us have seen Tom do it.
And you're wondering why we can't stand your company?
You were wrong to write my name.
You're different.
Shame on her.
I have two cats.
I already said I don't know how to do it.
His girlfriend didn't provide support.
That's not what I was interested in.
Some of them were and are still in constant danger of political repression and persecution.
I think your plan is too ambitious.
I still don't think the Internet is the place for kids.
That was hard for me.
What did you conclude?
You're made for me.
He needs it.
It's obviously a tipfeller.
Are we done?
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom was in Harvard.
She's my first love.
Have you ever seen one?
Are we safe now?
Tom's not a minor.
Control yourself.
Tell her.
I'd accept.
You're my luck.
I'm waiting for the bus.
Bad things will happen.
Several trees fell during the storm in our area.
I'm sure I've seen her somewhere before.
Everybody's smiling.
I didn't know you were so rich.
He refused to comment.
We're trying.
I'm giving up.
Tom looked angry.
Don't overdo it.
Oh, yeah, I'll have a job tomorrow.
Nobody cares about me.
So what's the plan now?
I'm sure they need you.
Tom's not a good worker.
I'm here to help.
I'm smart.
I think my writing's going very well.
Tom is no longer a member of this club.
That's a lot of help.
I've filled a glass.
I'm not selective.
How many uncles and uncles do you have?
That morning Maria went through the whole village.
The rumor has spread rapidly.
Am I so different?
Tom pulled out the keys and opened the door.
I just got here.
What Tom did helped a lot.
I've never seen that before.
Is it true that Tom can't read and write?
Mr. Jackson is our teacher.
I'm not worried at all.
It's helping.
Smoke slept with 25 men one night and then killed them.
I'm not doing it again.
I thought you wouldn't be able to do that.
We're just gonna follow you.
Tom asked me not to tell anyone, so I didn't.
Are we coming soon?
I'm not a prophet.
I hope I'm not the only one who'll be there.
Are you mad about that?
I'm divorced.
I don't expect Tom to be here today.
This is why I'm so uncomfortable.
The cost will rise soon.
Was I really so happy?
Tom might be the one who did it.
That sounds familiar.
I'll go to the sea tomorrow if it's nice.
Tom's gonna call.
I had dinner with her.
You see everything in black.
My car wasn't good enough.
Do they doubt me?
What are you supposed to do?
Tom likes to drive.
They couldn't travel because there was a problem.
The winter's over.
It's really so simple.
Since these papers were written about that no farmer wants to work as a shopkeeper in Westfold, interest grew rapidly.
I'm being punished.
I need to get inside.
We're a little busy here.
Get on board.
It's really amazing.
Have you ever seen the UFO?
You're standing on my way.
It's getting dark.
What's the big secret?
The police are after me.
I took the first step.
I hope Tom remembers this.
We ask questions to teachers every day.
What kind of food do you usually cook?
If the world wasn't in the state it's in right now, I could trust everyone.
Three wounded, who are currently unclear in their condition, were evacuated to the American Polish hospital.
I prayed for you.
Eterium and bitcoin are encrypted.
Hey, can you hear me?
We live on the sixth floor.
I'm not afraid of you at all.
Whenever I see you, my heart tells me I'm in love.
Are you all right, folks?
Will you help me?
It didn't get so bad.
Tom took the chairs to the next room.
I'm ruined.
I respect people like that.
Did you see him working?
Is that yes or no?
Don't laugh.
I'm not a bad student.
We're done for today.
He's a complete monarch.
Since the consequences are potentially serious, general precautions should be taken to avoid infection with this type of patient.
I'm a free man.
I don't like sweaty people.
The room was dark.
He's going home.
That could be weapons.
I can't fix the car myself.
I'd better go with Tom.
I was talking to Tom yesterday.
Shouldn't you be getting ready for school?
I want to feel important.
A second later, his lips turned into an evil smile.
My mother was an alcoholic.
Mary's enthusiasm for the course fell when her favorite lecturer moved away.
I don't want to be rude.
I guess you already know the answer to that.
Tom was nervous when he started a new job.
Help me.
The United States dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima in 1945.
Are you reading something interesting?
Smoking is not allowed here.
I assumed you were busy.
Tom's always very nice.
I barely closed my eyes.
Was Tom here when we got here?
Was I really so happy?
I took off my wig.
Tom won't be happy when he hears that.
Tom was named after his father.
Did he really commit suicide?
I'm gonna go get some sleep.
What was I supposed to do?
Don't come near my wife.
They'll know what to do.
Do you have a copy?
I wasn't really a friend.
Did I miss it?
I just want to get out of here.
Why do you think that?
Little kids like to touch everything.
She's got the hair on the papillotines.
He's released from military service.
My blood is on my right.
I'm motivated.
Knowledge frees us and makes us better people.
I didn't mean to drag you.
Are we safe now?
Which one of your friends will come?
Can you pass them on to me?
I've seen Tom play a lot of times.
You tried.
I'm taking you to the dance.
Tom might try to convince Mary to do it.
She's made of an elephant mosquito.
You told me not to lie.
He was formerly a member of the social elite, but a representative of the broad masses.
I'm scared.
Help us reach our goal.
You're sad.
I'm not a rich man.
I'm glad you found the money you lost.
Don't rush.
Give me the pen.
Just tell Tom I called.
There is no answer to the question of what is best, because it is always individual and dependent on the situation.
Tom thought Mary was cute.
Be careful.
You look like a very smart person.
I have the same desire to go abroad for a year to improve.
The house burned down to the ground before the firemen arrived.
The most rainy months are May, June, July and August.
Do I usually seem happy?
I've already written part of the report.
I was ready for that.
Show me the paper.
It has to do with what...
It can be hard about passion, maybe it's just sex.
Did you finish washing the dishes?
The only thing I can do here.
Tom's gonna pay.
The hunting season is over.
I love cable kitchen.
I'll start with a beer.
Thank God.
That gives me an idea.
Is Tom near?
I'm motivated.
What a tragedy!
We're here.
Knowledge makes us free and better people.
Don't talk.
All future meetings will be held in this room.
I've almost never been home during the day.
The best parents of all are those who allow their children to follow their native talents.
I'd go.
You're very uneducated.
You let me down.
There's snow all year round on this mountain.
I don't think you should rush into anything these days.
What's in nature forever, when everything's so past?
The engine's overheating.
I'll see you later!
Without you, I feel lost.
I have to plan everything.
This may not be enough.
That's what you made pretty.
All you have one day will have you.
No matter how busy Tom is, he never forgets to email his shirt at least once a week.
The dog's dead.
This is life.
Do we have one like that?
Is this your suitcase?
Tom stopped for a second.
Because of bad weather, the plane's late.
Investigate them.
I'm in a better shape than you.
I'm not so worried.
Come on, get up, Tom.
I think it's possible to do that.
I'll go to sleep for about an hour.
I'm pretty happy now.
He first did a preliminary test with a new electronic alcohol test before being sent to a laboratory test.
We walked in the park.
I'm sure you're very busy.
I'm glad you found the money you lost.
Look around.
It was a stressful day.
Is it clear?
Are these your bags?
I don't know who they are.
Tom was looking close.
Let us help you.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom didn't know French.
What's your job?
Let's continue our discussion.
How much am I gonna get?
I want to be with you.
This was refined and distinguished in a person so strange, cruel and stubborn that a little one dared to cooperate closely with him.
She's pregnant.

Tom often came here as a student.
We'll take the next one.
Did you do your homework?
Check everyone.
Tell us a ghost story.
Check everyone.
The session is closed.
I've got a lot of things planned for tomorrow.
We need to follow Tom.
Tom saved $300.
What does she look like?
I'm poor.
I can't wait till Monday.
Come with us.
Tom's on his way here.
Tom wasn't fat.
That's crystal clear.
I'm trapped.
Cut the cheese into thin pieces or small cubes.
Have you ever had a car accident?
I'd like to start.
I didn't wear any wearable clothes.
I'm fascinated.
Just serious questions, please.
Man, the sentence caused a real disturbance.
Give food to the homeless.
I translated the song as best I could.
He came out a few minutes ago.
I believe you're honest.
Tom wanted a bigger house than his neighbor.
Tom has an eye infection.
I'm glad we were there.
Although I was sick, I did my best.
Big boys don't cry.
I could go there now.
I need to write ten pages for the next Monday.
The situation was extremely dangerous; it was a matter of life and death.
I've never noticed that before.
I have to sleep.
Tom usually comes to school before any other student from the department.
I'm touched.
And if I were rich, I wouldn't give him money.
Why?
"Where should I sit?" "Anywhere."
Wisdom is needed to understand wisdom: music does not exist for the deaf audience.
I don't want to play this game.
I knew you wouldn't be able to do that.
I'm sure I'll get that tennis match.
Troubled children are often without any guilt.
I feel bad because I lied.
I invited him.
Maybe they gave up.
That's why I liked Tom.
Tom got red.
Tell him.
How do you get rid of the mole in the garden?
It's Saturn.
My aunt gave me flowers.
I hope that's not true.
Don't stop.
I don't like it when you work at home.
Of course, Tom loves his children.

It's only five in the morning, and it's already light out.
I hate math.
What's your aunt doing?
If there is, crossover with that will happen sometime.
Tom's a good Frenchman.
I can't help Tom do that.
I know this is weird.

She always wears shitty clothes.
Will that almost solve the matter?

It'll last forever.
The top of that mountain is flat.
She's smiling.

Tom would like to know if you'd like to come to this party.
You've grown.
I completely lost my mind.
I've never regretted what I did.
I'm convinced.
Are you speaking Romanian?
Tom came to see me yesterday at noon.
Hey, buddy!
Tom's still at work.
Did you get enough sleep last night?
This must be the place.
If you're not a good girl, you won't get a birthday present.

Get everything.
Are these your bags?
I refused Tom.
I'm not 100% sure.
I'll probably never use this again.
I'd buy that.
This goes beyond all the boundaries.
Tell me where you live.
Are we safe now?
Obviously, I was a little shocked.
Don't talk.
It wasn't too hot.
I almost forgot my passport.
Tom's reading a lot.
I hope you don't talk about me.
You're good to everyone.
I'm usually not that busy on Monday.
My sisters are both teachers.
Looks like he's working.

Tom, I need your help.

I called him.
How many calories does that sandwich have?
Are you ready to take responsibility?
I like to watch you while you work.
I hope we visit Beijing, too.
You're my inspiration.
This time I abstained from commenting on my beloved friend.
I agree.
Be careful.
Did anyone call me?
We'll have lunch together at half an hour.
I'm still a little tired.
To insist that it maximizes its own interest, happiness or security seems very natural to one human being.
I can do it like a joke.
I don't sing.
It's weird no one knows the victim.
We're five minutes from here.
I'm sorry I'm late.
Translation is not as easy as many people think.
Tom would never admit it.
It was just the beginning.
Did you finish your homework?
Is everything okay between us?
I've never camped.
I thought the food was great.
I have to plan everything.
Let's change the subject.
We counted the years on the tree we planted and found it was thirty years old.
I'll see you later, Tom.

Let's schedule a meeting.
I pissed him off.
Why can't you get it?
You can't sit next to me.
Did you expect anything else to happen?
Tom's still working out.
Boston is a great city.
We hope people will like it.
Maybe they'll leave tomorrow.
I want to show you something.

That's interesting.
I'm scared.
I was happy yesterday.

How long have you lived here?
Get help.
I didn't ask you not to do that.

She came alone.
I can't believe you didn't recognize your brother.
Tom lost his feeling.
I'm sure Tom had something to do with it.
Tom will look.
I wonder if anyone could help me.
I'm surprised.
They all laughed.
I played golf with Tom a lot of times.
You underestimate me.

We're close friends.
My friend can speak Hindi fluently.
Yeah, isn't it great?

Don't you want another glass of milk?
Have a good time!
The odds are against me.
I'll quit.
She expects us to help her.
Did I get fired?
I'm afraid you misunderstood me.
That's good.
I don't want to get you drunk.
Tell me what's going to happen.
Tom's seen enough.
Are we going soon?
They're selling sugar at the store.
Tom and Mary were watching the sunset together.
You did a great job.
Tom does it sometimes.
Thank Tom for his help.
What did you both do?
Happy birthday!
The photographs of nature and animals, photographed in complete silence and calm, are real masterpieces.
My mother died the day I got married.
I'll never mention this again.

We have two children.
I think Tom's careful.
The white family will come to Tokyo in half an eleven.
What did you do to me?
Enjoy.
Let me write you a few steps.
Tom's probably still hiding.
Mary looks cute whatever she wears.
Watch out!
Tom failed to produce any evidence to support his statement.

I bought this yesterday.
I had a really bad day.

Leave the book on the top shelf.
We could be happy here.
Tom made it himself.
Do you agree with what Tom wrote in his report?
Is that what it takes?

You tried.
I wouldn't hurt him.
Could you do that?
I just saw Ambassador Saudi Arabia resign.
Be careful.
Maybe something's wrong with you.
I'll drive.
Don't open that.
I had a problem solving that problem.
I don't want Tom to see me naked.
You're the most boring person I know.
Get in touch with Tom.
We've been here all day.
You know I can't give you that kind of information.
I didn't do it.
I'll check.
Tom was shocked.
Wait a minute, please.
We'll get you one.
Tom's still looking upset.
That's what the doctor ordered.
Tom knows what's coming.
I'm impressed.
"If P, then Q" is logically equivalent to "(No P) and/or Q."

I'm writing a message to Tom right now.
That's an exception.
Tom came a little early today than usual.

What's easier?
Tom asked for an increase.
I've never seen that before.
This is supposed to work.
I've always liked Tom.
Where was Tom hiding?
What can't you tell me?
Tom bought the papers and read them on the train on his way to work.
I've got the ghosts.
Look at that.
We'll save this piece of cake for Tom.

Let me try another one.
Take it easy.
I didn't do that either.
The stories of Snoria Sturluson tell us beside the others that Christianity in Norway has grown violent.

It's great for me.
Did you expect anything else to happen?

Give me another case.
Tom's still got some time.
The baseball is boring.
Tom was more than generous.
I'm just slowing down.
I'm sure it wasn't intentional.
What are you gonna do with all that money?
We're lost, aren't we?
We won't let you die.
Did you go see Tom?
This is the beginning of a new era.
I don't have a card.
Nothing happened.
I baked apple pie.
He's got a good reputation.
You can't sit next to me.

Look what it is!
We have to go shopping.

Are they still there?
Tom hasn't written Mary for a long time.
"Yes, orange juice, please," said Mike.
I'm not going with you.
Be careful.

It's a good idea.
I've been thinking about it before.
Stop trying to make me guilty.
I'll live.

You're opening the door.
That's good.
Who's Tom?
Get dressed.
When did you start writing songs?
I don't know why Tom went to Boston.
Why did you do that?
I hope you don't talk about me.
How did I miss this?
I'm relaxed.
Have you seen my dog?
Tom told me he'd do it.
Look again.

How many books do you have?
I'll do it myself.
You're sad.
All three boys were laughing.
We're all tired of this.
I need something to drink.
I'm sure Tom had something to do with it.
I don't fully agree with you.
Do you keep this place for someone?
How are you these days?

Can you go, Tom?
That man is a soldier.
Do you have Facebook?
Tom works about nine hours uninterrupted.
I hope I can do it.
I told you Tom was busy.
Go ahead.
They couldn't all hear what Tom said.
I'll take a shower.
We have four French hours every week.
Let's start right now.
I can't imagine doing that.

I know what you're probably thinking.
It's our only hope.
I got up on my left foot today.
I didn't know you were so rich.
It was a presentation that was published every year.
Let me show you why you shouldn't do that.
Tom didn't practice.
Thank you so much!
Hold on.
It's fifteen to two.
I think you should do the test again.
Why would Tom give up?
Europeans took precedence over other civilizations 500 years ago.
I'll pray for your family.
I can't remember what I ate yesterday.
It's never here in the morning.

Don't make a fool of yourself!
That makes me so angry.
Is it still light outside?
I'm not hiding from anyone.
There's a lot of birds on the line.
I don't have a cell phone anymore.

I saw the sword.
I saw the sword.
Paris is snowing.
I hope Tom gets back safe.
Can you smile at Tom?
I'd better clean it up now.
You tried.
Don't leave me alone.
Wow!
I'm sure Tom won't do it.
Tom's strict or fair.
Are you free this afternoon?

I'm bald.
You need one of these.
Can you cook?

I learned French myself.
I think I'm a pretty good writer.
Tom's thinking the same way.
That's his weak point.
You're one of us.
One leg is in the grave
Tom just told me the other way around.
Louder!
I'm compassionate.
Tom's unhappy.
That would be fun.
He's crazy as a power.
What do you know about me?
I'm reformed.
All the songs I sang to you today I wrote.
That doesn't scare me.
How old are you?
Tom asked me if I even slept last night.
Why is love so complicated?
What if I'm wrong?

Come see us.
He lied to us.
That's a pretty good problem.
I'm watching you.
Tom told me not to talk to Mary.
That's very rare.
What did I just do?
It's best to solve things in the walk.
This one's really cool.
I really enjoyed it.
I bought a lot of things.
Would you like another glass of water?
My wife's from Ked.
I'm not the only one who doesn't like Tom.

I'm cold.
Please wait a minute.
I won't do it!
I'm tired of arguing.
How was your day?
What am I looking for here?
She's a singer.
I like watching you play.
I was definitely lucky.
What first song have you ever written?
Tom could fit in.
I just want to get away.
Don't let that chance get you out of your way.
Be careful.
It's the first year of college.
I've been looking for grape juice.
I was thinking about my family.
Can you smile at Tom?
My fluid knowledge of language is enough for many situations, but not for expressing my often contradictory emotions.
Turn around for a second, will you?
The book's on the police.
I often feel a heartbeat.
Tom's on a secret mission.
I don't blame you.
They wanted to punish me.
I'm afraid of snakes.
I know that girl from somewhere.
I climbed once.
I'm sorry I'm always interrupting you.
He's a man of power.
It's wonderful!
I'm greedy.
Can you pick us up?
Can you make it in time?
It's weird the mailman hasn't come yet.
How can we prevent that from happening?
I hope Tom will remember this.
Was I really so happy?
I'll buy a boat soon.
Tom said he wouldn't be waiting for us.
Close your eyes, Tom.
Have you ever been punished for a quick drive?
I'll be right up.
We have to go.
Tom's a very good boy.
Tom's upstairs.
There's no girl on the Internet.
She tried.

The results were incredible.

The brakes are stuck.
Have you completely recovered?
I'll listen.
Tom spoke very loud.
Don't move!

The living truth.
You're very uneducated.

Now is a great time to buy that.
He knows the names of all his customers.
Tom got out of it.
Tom got involved with people he never should've gotten involved with.
Tom is visiting us from time to time.
Tell me what to write and I'll write.
Tom was half right.
Tom ran down the street.
That's the problem you have to solve for yourself.
I was exaggerating.
I take vitamins every day.
Tom dropped the book.
This is supposed to work.
There's no need to judge a man according to his appearance.
That's unconnected.
Am I in love?
Do you think I missed something?
Thanks for the e-mail!
I thought I didn't know what was going on.
They'll hold talks tomorrow.
My hands are full.
Tom had no idea I was gonna be there.
Tom told me he wouldn't tell Mary what happened.
Don't talk.
The team is as strong as his weakest member.
I've been there before.
It's different than what I expected.
Don't lie.
What are your plans then?
The kids are sleeping.
You need a temporary bridge.
I talked to Tom yesterday.
Tom closed the door.
It wasn't fun for me, so I went home early.
Now it's time for the kids to go to bed.

I don't like socializing.
He lived a simple life.
We offered help.
It was a dark and stormy night.
Phase one's over.
You'll be known.
He's got plenty of money, even higher.
We're glad to have you here.

Tell her.
I volunteered.
I don't see the difference.
Don't trust me.
I used to not like anyone.
The brakes are shrinking.
Find Tom.
You really made me proud.
You see everything in black.
Now I'm a little worried.
Do you have a stable relationship with the boy?
Tom still knows he's quoting a song he wrote when he was thirteen years old.
Did you see Tom left?
Be careful.
How would you translate that?
I'm willing to pay you well to do that.
That was a tough decision.
This is from Australia.
I thought you were gonna be busy.
He's very impressed.
I hope tomorrow will be a good time.
Let's sit down.
Come and look.
Tom really seems familiar.
Do your children have their own rooms?
Tom kept all the letters Mary sent to him.
Go swim with Tom.
It's safe.

A female chiffoner isn't completely without a little black dress.
Finish this.
Tom helped me save some money by telling me about a cheaper place to buy it.
There's nothing you can do but admire his courage.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Tom worked his whole life.
Maybe you shouldn't have told Tom.
Tom will live.
You won!
That's a bad sign.
I got it wrong.
Did you just meet her?
I'm nervous.
My mother died the same day I got married.
Isn't that what you wanted?
Was I really so happy?
I'm good with kids.
I'll be late.
You can't buy apples anymore!
There's a lot of traffic on the highway.
You should leave a message to Tom.
You're always lying to me.
Just in time!
Tom now has a family.
That doesn't surprise me.
Sweet dreams!
Someone needs to hire Tom.
Where'd you find the keys?
You'll see her.
You're very rude.
Can I call you in 20 minutes?
As little as we know about her origin, at least we can be sure that the plane is Evangelon.
I'm a terrible writer.
Tom got on the bus.
Jelen is faster than stronger.
People used to write books with typewriters.
I reacted instinctively.
It's a toilet.
Tom doesn't see anything wrong with letting Maria learn to drive.
Are you coming back now?
I hope not.
How could I hate Tom?
You're wearing this.
How barbaric!
I've always known that.
Tom thought I was you.
I'm happy with your letter.
When the cats are gone, the mouse circles the water.

In this phase of world history, in America there is no such thing as an independent press. You know it and I know it. There is no one among you who dares to write his honest opinion, and if you would write it, but you would know in advance that it will never appear in the press. If I had allowed my true opinion to appear in one edition of the newspaper for which I work, I would have kept my honest opinion out of the paper. Many of you have also been similarly paid for similar things, and the work of the journalist is that of writing what he thinks would be on the street, in search of some other work. If I had allowed my true opinion to appear only in one edition of the newspaper for which I work, I would have been fired with my own work with less than 24 hours.

Tom and Mary agree.
When can Tom come home?
In the window glass, I see the reflection of my face.
Go talk to Tom.
I was thinking about my family.
You could have spared me my arrival just because you told me I shouldn't have been here today.
This will make it much easier for us.
I haven't been there for too long.
Is it true you're going to study in Boston?
Tell me where you live.
Let's go over it again.
Whatever you do, don't leave the board on the toilet.

This is pretty cool.
How did you find out where Tom is?
Tom's probably still gonna be mad.
They can't recognize each other anymore.
I don't fall for it.
He's a liar, isn't he?
I'd agree.
The price doesn't matter.
You deserve a reward.
She's very patient.
I'd like to know what's going on here.
Will we see Tom again?
Just try to stay calm.

I'm ruined.
I assumed you were busy.
It's clear.
Keep digging.
Why are we in this mess?
Tom's self-confidence was shattered when his boss took him off in front of his colleagues.
I'm not worried at all.
We have a problem.
Tom knew all that.
Will you do that to me?
I probably won't watch this.
Come on in.
Did I call you?

I'm the one who solved the problem.
Where are they going?
Does Tom know about this?
What can I tell them?
I can't sleep at all.
They haven't been able to keep going the same way in the second half.
Just give him some time.
How did I get here?
Learn hard.
It takes a lot of imagination to try and add a new sentence here.
Things might have turned out better if you hadn't gone there.
I checked.
Finish this.
He came to visit you yesterday.
Tom's got a bad day.
Don't answer.
Did she have a red rose?
I'd like to go.
Stop trying to make me guilty.
Pride tends to become overpowering, which is close to the generation of madness.
How long will Tom last?
The rainy season starts in June.
Who knows what's gonna happen tomorrow?
I changed my schedule.
I'd like to know how to paint like that.
Tom was waiting for me.
Shut up!
Tom says this is absurd.
I've never repented.
We're limiting the luggage to 10 kilograms per piece.
We'll never get back there.
It's been years.
They set up the Air Force Command where the chief and chief of staff were, respectively, from the Navy and the Army.
Tom took his uccules and started singing.
Will we see Tom again?
Let's consider the worst that can happen.
Take it easy.
Let's try.
There's chaos here.
My parents don't like my girlfriend, they don't think she's good enough for me.
Tell me what you wrote.
Tom left this morning without finishing his breakfast.
You don't even know his name, do you?
I'm sorry, Tom.
Such a state of affairs cannot be tolerated.
We've never played football before.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom didn't know French.
It's very light.
When's the meeting?
I could go there now.
I'm stubborn.
Because of a lie, he got into trouble when his boss found out the truth.
He looks good for his years.

We're in trouble now.
It looked so delicious.
I have a stone in my shoe.
Can you give me a sign?
Tell me what I missed.
He asked me to help him.
Tom has a younger sister, Mary.
I could have used that.
I was very excited.
Don't yell.
I didn't tell him you were here.
I saw Tom die.
You're in a better shape than I am.
How's that?
I'll try to find them.
I can lose my license.
Tom told me what to do.
I know exactly what to do.
Tom's on his way.
We'll let you know as soon as we find out.
She told me everything last night.
What can I do?
Was I really so happy?
He's overburning the security.
I can't resist anymore.
I could lose my pension.
Tom knows he's knocking very fast.

Do you have anything to report?
I've always hated to do that.

Welcome to your new home.
Tom must have known that Mary wouldn't want to do that.
Tom's gonna talk.
It wasn't easy for me.
He's speeding up.
Tom tried to help us.
Don't overdo it.
Look at that.
I'm used to doing it.
It's not the right choice.
Everything's in the report.
Do you really think I'm selfish?
I met some wonderful people.
I had lunch with him.
Are you coming, Tom?
Try it.
Think again.
How's Tom at work?
That's what the doctor needs.
I want to be a man one day again.

I think she's from Austria.
Please wait until I'm ready.
It's always like that.
I'm interested.
Louder, please.
Can you talk to Tom about me?
Get Tom out of here.
Sleep for a few hours.
What happened?
The intelligence satellite is a military satellite capable of overseeing many activities on earth, listening to communication lines, recording the operating frequency of radar systems...
I asked you last night.
You're very beautiful.

Why tell Tom anything?
I could have used that.
I hope I can write two or three songs during the weekend.
You don't know me.
How are Tom and Mary?
Doesn't mean something's a good idea just because it's possible.
He opened the door.
I hope Tom gets back safe.
I like what you wrote.
Don't be silly.

I can write very quickly.
Don't worry, I can do it.
Swimming makes your legs stronger.

How much am I gonna take?
She was the only one who understood me.
You can't just eat one.
Be careful.
Dogs are smart.
I'll give you what you want.

I'm going to leave early today.
How adventurous!
Tell me what that is.
Did you finish your homework?
Get out of here!
Who's knocking?
I'm really happy to be here.
Please don't yell.
Why are you acting childish?
We could have saved Tom just got here a few minutes earlier.

I want you a nice week!
Doping is not compatible with my ideological views of sport.
I'm coming to save you!
I'm wearing a flannel pajamas.
I'm scared of dying.
There was only one small problem.
I'm completely alone right now.
That was terrible.
I wasn't confident at all.
Never say anything.
I participated in the competition.
Did you eat anything?
France is in Western Europe.
I hope Tom stays here.
They're landing at the airport.
That's all your wisdom!
Tom was wearing a black hat.
You did what you had to do.
Tom always looks dissatisfactionful.
We're out of money.
I think everyone's overeating.
I'm very happy about that.
Tom turned to go.
I'll never mention this again.
Let me show you where to put that.
Why didn't you let Tommy talk to Maria?
Wake up at seven in the morning.
What would I do without you?
I think Tom will be able to help us control this.
I'm already paid.
They're all forgotten.
Did I call you?
Come on Tuesday, if possible.
We need to be realistic.
Don't look.
They accidentally heard some suspicious activity in the syringe indicating that the bear smelled their food.
I was everywhere in Europe.
Can I help you, sir?
Don't look.
You asked for it yourself.
How is this your fault?
You can't blame Tom for everything.
Come to my neighborhood.
I don't want to live with you.
I'm ruined.
Tom's in constant pain.
The other girls in Mary's department were laughing at her clothes.
Everybody's either gone or gone through it.
I'll throw myself at it right away.
I'm broke.
Tom and Mary enjoy walking along the hiking trails in France.
Tell Tom I'm innocent.
Can you help me translate these sentences into Chinese?
Did you watch?
Are you busy here?
I'm a choice between two options.
We have what we need.
Everything else is irrelevant.
Did you take a good look?
Tom asked me to wake him up at 7:00.
We didn't do that.
Did you wash the dishes?
Please, give it to me.
How's Tom doing?
Be careful.
Do you have any paper I can write on?
He was walking down the street.
Do you agree with that?
We just had dinner.
I'm sure they need you.
That's good.
You're one of us.
Do you have a dog?
I saw a cat.
I've been there before.
Tom's book is at the top of Christmas book sales, and it's hard to get some book out of position.
Tom's working for Mary now.
I'm armed.
Is it necessary to make such a mess?
Did you wash the dishes?
Give me another reason.
Let's have a drink!
I assumed you were busy.
Are you dyslexic?
If only I knew.
Get changed.
That's all I could find.
A large group of people gathered.
I'm working on my project.
Everything is well prepared in advance.
I don't count on that.
I don't expect Tom to be here today.
They gave water to their horses.
I'll give you everything you want.
The girls wore grass skirts and had flowers around the door.
I'm not feeling well.
Tom's the only nutrient in the family.
Maybe he's already gone.
You're cheating.
This could take weeks.
You can format and configure a table for cross budgets, insert and use normal tables, diagrams, formulas and functions.
I'll stay at the Hilton Hotel.
Which one of you will come with me?
Call me at any time, on my shoulder, you can always cry.
I'm reformed.
What's next?
Doctors are still trying to save Tom.
No one believed her.
Detectives are still investigating.
Tom was fine.
This sad story was written when Tom was in exile.
Tom's not like the other boys.
We'll take the stairs.
I'm sure I'll win that tennis game.
Do you have anything to say?
Get changed.
We should have brought another bottle of wine.
Men want to feel wanted.
She tried.
You don't mind, do you?
How would you feel if you left your wife?
Can you prove that?
A rat's ass.
It's easy to write with this pen.
Are you ready for more?
This pen doesn't work.
Did you see me playing?
I'd rather not be involved at this point.
Tom closed the fence.
I had dinner with him.
I really hope I'm wrong.
Are you busy here?
Tom used to play guitar.
I'm actually a nice guy.
That's what they both like.
It must have been awful.
I'll lend you a job bond if you promise me you won't write anything on it.
My friends live in the same house as I do.
There are a lot of bad people in the world.
Did Tom find it?
Are they in love?
Where can I meet you tomorrow?
Tom saved Mary.
Latin is the language of the future!
I think everyone's ready.
You'll see her.
Tom has a dark secret.
Did you eat anything?
Let's get this straight.
It's a very interesting bird.
The relationship between the person and the blood group has not been scientifically confirmed.
I thought you were married.
I'm singing.
It's Tom.
I checked some things.
I don't sing.
I'd like to kiss you.
The kids are playing outside.
Are you coming soon?
Did you manage to do that alone?
A working group on data transfer, led by Ben Manija, will hold a meeting on 14 January 1999.
Some say that if you walk on a rainy slope, it'll start raining.
At first, it's my end.
I just got here.
Stop trying to make me guilty.
What am I supposed to see?
Have you decided what you're gonna do?
Tom knows he's knocking very fast.
Are we all here?
I'll be right back with your order.
My sister's playing dolls.
Identify yourself.
Take the money.
I'm saving to buy a new saxophone.
Don't give yourself up like that.
I'll give you what you want.
Who did you write a letter to?
Maybe I'll need some help.
Does this mean you don't love me anymore?
I'm not a specialist.
I'm more greedy than I look.
Nobody's here.
Tom's youngest daughter is his lover.
Tom bought the papers and read them on the train.
I won't be home next week.
I'm trying to figure out how you did it.
That would be OK.
What do you call that?
How does Tom know French?
I like to watch you while you work.
Answer me right now.
There's no established policy.
Write down what I'm saying.
The rain's finally over.
I live in an old house.
Do you love your mother?
It was a big explosion.
Tom pointed.
I didn't step out today.
Did they tell you the reason?
Can you spell me your name?
Look at this.
She saved a living head.
I think we should call the doctor.
You're in a terrible hurry today.
We caught Tom at work.
We need to be realistic.
She took off her clothes.
Tom's house is for sale.
Tom wasn't satisfied with the results.
I hid under the table.
They're holding me hostage.
Maybe Tom wasn't hungry.
I've been there before.
Tom asked Mary how she liked her new job.
I'm a big fan of football.
What are you going to do with all this?
Mary earns a living by sewing.
Can you give me some water, please?
Where's your friend?
I don't know what to think about this.
I don't like it at all.
Tom's used to winning.
Elementary, my dear Watson.
Tom's not sure what he wants to do with his life.
We're here to pick you up.
I'm instigated.
What do you want?
Medicines should not be mixed with alcohol.
Did you see who it was?
When I woke up, the snow fell.
Some people, no matter how long they are, don't lose their beauty.
I played golf with Tom a lot of times.
Don't talk.
I'm sure I'll get that tennis match.
That's pretty extraordinary.
Bad things will happen.
Why would Tom come now?
I panicked.
Come on, try it now.
We'd better get inside.
Actually, I'm not sure.
Investigate her.
She was dressed in red.
What does the Soviets study?
It's all a big joke.
Tom was talking about music.
Have you completely recovered?
We had a lot of fights.
Tom's still hiding.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom didn't know French.
Keep working.
Hope loses when you experience a difficult situation and a pointless impatience, you have to be strong.
I was laughing.
The new constitution will not solve Egypt's problems.
Solar energy is pure energy.
I thought Tom wasn't doing what he was supposed to do.
I'm not lying to you.
Did you see me dancing?
Did you eat anything?
Tom's not in any danger.
It's too easy.
All men are the same.
Is it clean?
They haven't woken up yet.
Everything's free.
Welcome.
We don't have another choice.
I've never really been anywhere.
He keeps losing his cell phone.
I'm angry.
I'm thinking I'm going to Australia too.
I'm sure Tom will win.
Are Americans really so individual?
You can go play with your friends when you're done preparing the house.
That's my problem, not yours.
What's your specialization?
I'm twice as old as Tom.
You're the love of my life.
Tom couldn't talk to Mary, and he couldn't influence it.
And now that I remember everything I've experienced, I've really learned a lot.
I wasn't too surprised.
The team is as strong as his weakest member.
I've never camped.
There are a lot of dishonest people in the world.
Don't yell.
When was the last time you heard from Tom?
The Hungarian language is not easy, but it's wonderful.
That's what I think.
I prefer the shelter with the storm blanket, along with the cross-knocks for wind stability and snowflakes, and this must be a double tent.
Tell Tom to say hello.
I can't be something I'm not.
Where are we gonna meet?
Do you think what she said was a lie?
Tom didn't do it.
I'm touched.
Tom's fired.
Are you planning on going to Tom's and Mary's wedding?
This candidate is much better than his predecessor.
Don't call me while I'm in the office.
Thank you for loving me.
The doctor's investigating the patient.
Tom put his drink on.
This is a lark of justice.
I could lose my pension.
She's in a bad mood.
I've always known that.
Don't worry.
Every communication is a translation.
I'm trying to be careful.
I'm really happy about that.
I've never been camping.
They believe in God.
Everyone's boss in his house.
Let's hope you're right.
We grew up on a corner.
Are you angry about that?
I've burned my tongue.
You tried.
I thought I could trust Tom.
When there's no news, it's good news.
Do you really think I'm selfish?
Did it turn out to me?
Did you sleep?
They tried hard in court.
Is there a reason why you keep this old bottle?
We talked for a while.
Now I have to go.
Can I take your dictionary?
No one else was hurt.
We have to try.
That tissue isn't from India, is it?
I'll buy what I need tomorrow.
I may be antisocial, but that doesn't mean I don't talk to people.
I believe you're honest.
I didn't pick anything.
Let's try something.
Are you in Paris?
Don't leave me alone.
Tom started studying French last year.
Tom was sitting on a bench all day, writing postcards.
Aren't you going to eat anything?
It's abandoned.
Don't move!
I've already thought about it.
Money's talking.
I hope Tom will remember this.
Tom told me his father died.
We have to spend less!
I parked twice.
I've never seen that before.
Do you want to live in Mumbai?
Tom broke something again.
Tell me where you live.
You have to teach me these days.
I love this store.
I just didn't go looking for you.
He's leading a boring life.
I'm not a rich man.
I really like your music.
That's what I'm used to.
Tom has the right attitude.
Anatomical implants for the chest, however, can also lead to the deformation of the chest if they rotate on the side.
Where'd you find the keys?
I won't tell anyone you did it.
She tried.
Tom was a little confused.
I saw the bus.
Tom's smart enough not to do something like that.
I brought these reports to you to take a closer look at them.
I'm not as rich as we want.
Get on board.
Tom's still mad.
Why are you still awake?
Please don't make me eat that.
I think your work is very good.
Tom helped Maria put on her coat.
Have fun while you can.
The Internet is not your personal army.
I could go with you.
Unfortunately, he has passed over to become from Almighty God a powerless, dirty, small and insignificant man at the corner of a small province in a vast empire.
We should do better.
The weather forecast says tomorrow afternoon will rain.
Tom's a real gentleman.
I saw the snake.
It's useless.
Which planet are you from?
Are you listening?
Am I in love?
Wait, wait, don't go yet.
Did you eat anything?
Give me another reason.
What did you two do?
Is this your first exam?
Life's going on!
Tom's already here, but Mary's not here yet.
I'm sure Tom will come to the party.
Okay, we made a deal.
Let's not be emotional.
Tom is very patient.
Everything's changing.
Tom knows where the wind blows from.
Women are the best in a man's life.
When you get your phone, the battery is fully charged.
Tom knows that now.
I volunteered.
Shut up!
Tom loves it the most.
Tom's driving me crazy.
This famous actress was also a fashion icon.
I'm not moving to Boston.
I'm impatient.
Yesterday, I finished teaching a hopeant at Duoling.
Tom attacked Mary's sister.
Am I safe now?
We'll get to work right away.
I did what I could for him.
I'll just say, you're beautiful.
Are you allergic to any food?
Tom's listening because he's convincing.
My suitcase's not packed yet.
Did you sleep?
The readers were in pain, waiting at least three months before they got an answer.
Do you know anyone who passed last year's exam?
Mary took it freely for the trip.
They live on high feet.
Tom got out of the limo.
I'm sure I've seen that guy somewhere.
I'm surprised by Tom's answer.
I'm buying a lot of stuff in that store.
You don't really support me.
What's he drinking?
You'll see her.
He's all, he's just not fair.
I'll call her on the phone tonight.
The police asked the criminal to hand over his gun.
It's human to make a mistake, it's divine to forgive.
I passed all the tests.
It just took me a while.
I have to go.
Please be honest with me.
Tom knows it's hopeless.
What's that?
Man dreams, God determines.
Tom was wearing black farmers.
It must have been fun.
What do you have to say?
That gives me an idea.
Did you just meet them?
It's more art, not science.
Is this place busy?
That's exactly what it was.
Add more water.
Tom's counting the coussors.
All parking lots are full.
This is my brother, Tom.
You use the device until it alerts you to charge the battery and then fill it in for 5 hours to achieve maximum capacity.
Tom's still a bride.
You're becoming insensitive.
No, don't do that.
I had a house when I was a kid.
Tom was with the girl, but he couldn't see who he was.
I don't want to ask Tom to do that.
Everybody was standing.
I pretended I didn't understand.
Would you like to talk to Tom?
Can you give me a remote?
Why are you leaving?
Now's the time to enjoy.
Did he meet his goals?
I just want to go home.
Tom's upset about this.
Have you seen my house?
I have a book.
What do your children usually have for breakfast?
Am I so different?
We had a terrible fight.
And Tom's a salesman.
I'm twice as old as Tom.
That's exactly what I said would happen.
Testing a new engine will take place today.
Come and sit down.
Tell Tom I'm ready.
I'll apologize.
Tell Tom I'm ready.
Tom wants to repay the money he owes.
All things have to go through.
Come on in the truck.
I've never seen that before.
I don't want to do that.
I think Tom was great.
I have a headache.
Tom looks a little nasty.
I loved it when my wife knew she was cooking.
I'm proud of my family.
Men have about 7 to 8 times more testosterone than women.
I have to go.
It was a good hat.
The door's stuck for something.
Tom left right away.
I had lunch with her.
You've taught me so much.
What's bigger, the sun or the Earth?
We'll get you one.
No doubt!
Looks like you've lost ten pounds.
You disappointed me.
We'll get on it right away.
May I ask why?
I bought this yesterday.
You did a great job.
The security's overburning.
Are we safe now?
Tom says one day he'll do it.
Otherwise, what's your address?
This one's awkward.
She's wearing a gold chain around the door.
Electronics ensures multi-stage and simple adaptation of airflows.
Have you heard he finally came home?
During the rainy days, we see Mount Fudy in the distance.
It's your choice.
They're sitting at the table.
It's a multi-phase process.
I think you were very generous.
Tom could have something to do with it.
Are you dyslexic?
It doesn't work on me.
The assembly is disbanded.
Tell me what you wrote.
I never thought anyone would make up something like that.
Tom was friendly to me.
I can't agree with you.
My father fixed the broken chair.
Let's move the closet.
Tom threw me to the airport.
You know, don't you?
I'm trying.
I wrote a song about Tatoebi.
I need to catch the train.
I'm not in any hurry.
Do you have time to come tomorrow?
That's all I needed.
Let me try.
I paid for it.
I bought a new hat in the store.
I wouldn't hurt him.
I have complete confidence in you.
Have you ever heard such good music?
It's okay.
I think you'll be able to do that.
Stop it, will you?
He threw the ball into the goal!
It's a big day today, son!
We were filled with a joyful lookout.
It's just a personal attitude.
I'm really sorry, Tom.
Did you tell Tom this?
My older sister is very talented to sing.
I'll be sorry, but I won't forget.
I always thought it was weird.
Clear your lips with salvage.
The free Haskel and Opera House library is built on the border between Canada and the United States.
It's very important to rest properly.
You disappointed me.
You don't have to eat right before you go to bed.
Karin's an Austrian.
I think I understand you.
Tom's personal assistant has a personal assistant.
That's what I was sitting on.
You have to make a decision.
Whenever we talk, he makes me an adrenaline.
Tom's always very nice.
That takes courage.
I have no intention of answering all the questions.
Tom had a stabilizing pain.
Stop smoking.
Do you know what that thing is?
Just tell Tom I called.
I'll try to convince Tom to do it.
Did you tell Tom that Mary did this?
They gave water to their horses.
My father gave me a lot of money.
You can talk to Tom.
Is all this solved now?
Nothing's free.
Vladivostok is a city in Russia.

I wasn't too surprised.
I predicted this would happen months ago.
Did you write a report?
Tom turned on the heating.
I want to know why.
We'll get you.
I don't usually buy anything from the Internet.
Someone was here.
Did you write in the diary today?
That's the best thing I've ever heard.
Do you know anyone there who speaks Urdu?
Tom was shot three times.
Come pick me up.
Tom smiles in a stupor.
Are you sure this thing is safe?
Tom could have explained it.
Let me help you.
Are you a baseball fan?
Why are you mad at me?
I didn't see anything.
We have all received a blessing from the almighty grace of her.
No matter how much he's been thinking, I still don't understand.
Tom's thinking the same thing.
I never borrow anyone's books or CDs.
That was kind of weird.
I don't have much friends.
My kids rely on me.
I beg you to reconsider.
He can be treated.
Don't cedillate.
When they experienced the French Revolution, citizens became free people, freed traditions and churches, praised freedom, equality and brotherhood.
I thought it wasn't appropriate.
Tom offered to help when it seemed that everything was going completely wrong.
Translate or not a moral selection of translators, things sometimes sound better if they stay as they are in the language in which they were created.
Look what I grew up in!
I'm not sure when Tom will be back.
It's necessary.
What did you do now?
I'm poor.
How long have you been living here?
Do you think the situation will improve?
When he doesn't risk, he doesn't get.
Don't look.

Okay, I get it.
What are you looking for?
Are we all here?
Scientists believe the discovery always comes as a thunder from the sky.
Who's Tom?
The ship's stuck.
I agreed to buy it.
It came from nowhere.
They'll know you.
Let's go one by one.
Don't yell.
The ship disappeared without a trace.
It's precise.
I've never seen that before.
Did you enjoy watching the night game last night?
Their proximity was mysterious, since they only met three days ago.
That's what I've been doing.
What year has your car been made?
I tried to be nice.
Don't sing.
It would be good if I wore another layer.
What did I say, brother?
The keys are in the locker.
That's all we can do.
Are those your new shoes?
By what name?
Why don't you take off your coat?
Where the hell have you been?
She was smiling.
Tom just couldn't do it.
I thought you were married.
I'll go if you go.
Well, I have some news.
The odds were against me.
I want to be with her.
What I saw was discouraging.
Did you tell Tom that Mary did this?
You tried.
Thank you for loving me.
I'm a big football fan.
You make Tom nervous.
Keep working.
There are a lot of bad people in the world.
I thought you were happy here.
I'm natural.
I don't care about dancing.
Don't forget to send this letter.
Nothing happens if he doesn't have a dream.
I tried to be nice.
Tell him I'm innocent.
Tom is very good at imitating the way Mary speaks.
Can you solve this problem?
Some of my friends are smoking.
You're my princess.
You'll miss everything.
Come on, sit down.
Tom's gonna wait.
Looks like Tom thinks so.
Don't let Tommy sleep.
Come down here.
I'm sorry?
Everyone changes.
Would you like some more apple juice?
We can't lose hope.
Let's sit down.
Buy a litre of milk, and if they have eggs, buy twelve eggs.
Tom wants to know if you're planning on coming to his party.
Did you see me playing?
Why would Tom want that?
Tom helped us save a lot of money.
Tom's very idiotic.
I'm hurt.
Keep digging.
I don't want any evil.
I was the only man in a tourist group, and the rest of them were Arabs living in Istanbul.
Investigate it.
Tom's not the right person for the job.
We need to get better.
They asked for an increase in wages.
Let me see your prescription.
Tom came to help.
Sometimes they get confused among families spread through generations.
Everything's wrong with him.
Tom thinks fast.
The comments must be related to the subject.
Don't get kidnapped.
The programme sets out the conditions for the development and implementation of projects.
We should go again.
Do you feel okay today?
We won.
Give me the spoon.
Can I find you on Facebook?
I tried to be kind.
It would be confusing.
We're here.
You can sit next to me.
That's what he pulled his hand.
Tom was a great manager.
Everybody's turning.
All you have to do is practice.

Tom was a scout.
Why are we in this mess?
Tom counted the kusuri.
I learned hard when I was in school.
I refused to do it.
Should we tell anyone?
After five hours in the hot sand, he saw something on the horizon that looked like a desert fatamorgan.
When are you gonna get to the station?
Are you honest?
We'll try your way.
Are you a maniac?
I'll be better now.
And that's it!
I made an apple pie.
Are you a prisoner?
No one's been watching.
If you have to be somewhere right now, it's definitely here!
Tom could lie.
Good luck.
I've never repented of it.
Tom was as angry as the rice.
Tom could have a point.
Did I welcome you here?
What did you both do?
Don't fuck around.
What an experience!
Tom's learning to program.
Are we done?
Tom's a little eccentric.
Mary came back from school in tears because her friends were teasing her.
I trusted you with my secret and you betrayed me.
I'm writing very fast.
We all did it.
Maybe you're wrong.
I'm sure you'll understand.
I have to repay the debt.
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.
His speech was, well said, a disaster.
We need to save money to buy a new car.
Bad things will happen.
I thought you'd already taken care of it.
What year is your car?
You have to believe it's possible that it will change.
She translated her sentence.
Did you even ask Tom to serve?
I could go there now.
They're all cheering.
Tom said you were cool.
Tom is one of the most interesting guys I've ever met.
I'm glad you answered.
Drive carefully.
Let's see.
Do you have a perfume?
Don't play the monkey!
Mary's a little attractive.
It's such a grammatical thing that you want to hit him.
Be careful.
You understand me.
Tom wanted to know what we were doing.
When screaming doesn't help, yell louder!
I think you should talk to Tom about it.
Tom arrived in time despite the storm.
Something wasn't right.
Tom said I was unconsidered.
Tom wanted to take Mary's phone number, but she refused to give it to him.
I'm begging someone to do it for me.
You're still unsatisfied.
We're gonna have a great time.
It's not bad.
He asked me to help him.
It's hot here.
Have you completely recovered?
Tom was wearing black jeans and a white shirt.
The book cost five dollars.
Is it that simple?
Tom's not like the other guys.
Listen to this.
How much is that worth?
I was lucky to have survived the accident.
No one I know anymore is going there because it's a big crowd.
I'm learning Korean.
I'm losing.
I don't want to see him anymore.
I'm glad Tom left.
I'm buying a lot of stuff in that store.
You're driving slow.
Tom must have had the key.
Why is that interesting?
Are you involved in this?
I'm sure Tom didn't intend to hurt your feelings.
You're the reason I came here.
Tom probably hates me too.
You can sit with me.

Just give me a chance.

Bad things will happen.
Do you love your mother?
I'm really proud of that.
This is my third marriage.
What did you do here?
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
Tom's a little worried.
I totally disagree with that.
It's a routine thing.
He's trying.
Good evening.
Will anyone tell me what to do?

There's nothing going on with my hand today.
I'm responsible.
You're doing well.
That's what Tom tells me.
Tom pressed the switch.

Did you go see Tom?
I've been looking for you.
I'll go by car.
Tom likes to write.
Tom didn't know what question to ask.
I'm just doing my duty.

I thought you were going on a Boston bus.
Tom's still got some time.
Maybe I won't sleep tonight.
Just waste your time.
I'd like to know what's going on here.
How many pairs of socks do you have?
I've never had trouble sleeping.
It's locked.
I'll figure something out.
A fair man can't do that.
Take care!
I won't try to predict the future.
What are you doing at this time?
I'm early.
Are they all strong?
Is everything settled now?
Please send me the doctor's account.
What's this about?
I want you a nice day, Tom.
Are you going to Tom's and Mary's wedding?
I'm a little new in this.
I was improvising.
"Do you know what's going on?" "No. What's the matter?"
That's what they both like.
You and I should talk.
You've been spying on me.
The pen I write belongs to Tom.
Where'd you see Tom?
It's time.
What's this gonna buy me?
Wake up!
We help each other.
Tom and Mary are still good friends.
How did you do that?
I won't tell anyone else.
How do you know so much?
Tom's suffocated with a smile.
I'm scared.
What name?
Is Tom really a student here?
Tom is the one who wrote this story.
Everybody's coming.
I didn't spend anything.
It's an area with a lot of new houses.
Everyone knows I don't like Tom.
Tom seemed pretty nervous.
Tom likes sports.

I'm not angry at all.
Jumi's one of my friends.
It just took him a while.
I thought you wouldn't do that.
Sorry I'm so late.

I'm surprised by Tom's answer.
Everybody's laughing.
I loved going to the beach.
Where's your father?
I'd agree.
It's all over.
The book was sold out.
Tom almost died trying to save me.
That needs the truth.
I loved going to the beach.
At first glance, it looks easy.
It's time to say goodbye.
You were supposed to be my friend!
People should stop hating.
I don't doubt he'll make it.
I never advised you to do that.
I'm not going to change.
Tom started the car.
My dad's grandmother enjoys the tea ceremony.
She laughed.

We'll get you one.

Tom made up his mind about "the opposite."
I'm grateful.
I couldn't do this without your help.
Don't answer.
If you would do that for me, it would help a lot.
He was bare chest and bone.
Tom may be honest.
Can you explain to me how to get to the airport?
Look again.
The first step is always the hardest.
They have to drink water.
Now I'm a little worried.
What's in there, Tom?

Are these your bags?
What did you do to me?
Don't jump!
When he was six years old, he learned to knock on a writer's machine, and he told the teacher he shouldn't learn to write with his hand.
I've been practicing.
That doesn't sound very convincing, but I believe you.
I think I'm gonna go out and eat.
Can we talk outside?
You have good instincts.
I thought I was doing well.
Am I safe now?
Please write.
We didn't have this in our plan for you.
Tom sells the car.
He started screaming.

Do you believe in God?
We kissed last night.
Was I really so happy?

Cheers!

Did Tom believe you in the story?

He's not a doctor.
That's enough.
How many instruments can you play?
Employees can be motivated by good, fair wages, a chance to work on a good team or on exciting tasks, and with clear economic incentives such as bonuses and opportunities for progress.
I doubt I'm the only one who noticed.
That's encouraging news.
Give me some sugar, please.
I'm really sorry about this.
You're funny.
Merry Christmas!
Have you ever seen one?
We had a lot to drink.
It's too loud here for me.
I doubt it'll be hard for you to get driver's license.
Did you manage to do that alone?
Is everything settled now?
How can mathematics, which is still only a product of human thought independent of experience, be so amazingly adapted to objects in reality?
Look at that.
Looks like Tom's an honest person.
I didn't know you were so rich.
Look at this.
The code is Muriel.
I had lunch at the speed.
That's what he risked.
His wife put on his shirt.
Someone told me about it.
Swallow your pride!
To change the red meat, I cooked chicken breasts in the sauce from mushrooms for tonight.
I'm always hungry.
Tom's fighting like crazy.
I've always liked horror movies.
Something just came up.
I couldn't stop crying.
You grew up.
They're not mine.
I double the prices.
Could you do that?
A video of the interview was made and published on the Internet.
Tom was drunk and drowned his grief after that one night of drinking.
Why don't we just get some rest?
Go take a look.
Tom just wanted to say something.
It's over.
Is it true that Tom killed himself?
I'm here to play baseball.
Do you think so?
I didn't even do that.
Do you have anything to report?
I say it all the time.
Don't lie.
Will you take that?
It's just a rush.
Is Tom coming back?
You're smart.
How did I get here?
Why?
Tom dropped his breath.
There's a lot of work I need to do before I can go home.
By the way, where do you live?
Do you have any questions?
It's hard for me to understand French when it's quick to speak.
It'll be half three soon.

He's very rare.
Tom wanted to be good.
I'm just not in a hurry.
Don't look.
How desperate are you?
Let's not get dressed.
It's not getting any worse.
Answer me.
I'm still making mistakes.
Tom's got a hard job.
I'm glad we won.
You can't go into that room.
"Are you better?" "No, I'm worse."
It's all passing, but good memories are alive.
I was in the mountains.
It's hard.
What's easier?
Did you wash the dishes?
We had a lot of fights.
It was a drop that poured a glass.
He doesn't like us.
We'd save time if we got down through Park Street.
A cop arrested him for driving in a drunken state.
We're gonna be crazy.
That would be great.
The knife is not sharp.
We hope people will like it.
We all have a price.
That gave him an idea.
I got lucky.
No one knows me in Boston.
Tom thinks something's wrong with some politicians.
Where's Tehran?

Didn't I teach you anything?
Why are you asking?
It's big.
What's fast is a piece.
Come sit next to me.
I found his book.
I barely managed to hide my resentment for her stiffness.
Butter is made of milk.
There's nothing we can do about it.
Everything's better.
Do you want to see something?
I miss her.

Let us help you.
Be careful, the knife is very sharp.
Please don't yell.
Is there still a temperature?
Tom was crazy, you know.
Tom put the map on the table.
Who are you running from?
What did you do to me?
I'll talk to Tom about this.
I'm still a little tired.
We can't go back.
We'll visit you from time to time.
Tom didn't have the courage to do what he wanted.
His comment is easy to understand in the wrong way.
Are we meeting tonight?
