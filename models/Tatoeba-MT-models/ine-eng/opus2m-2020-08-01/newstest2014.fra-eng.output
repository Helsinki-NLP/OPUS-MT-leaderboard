Spectacular high in "wingsuit" above Bogotá
Sportsman Johann Florez jumped from a helicopter on Thursday over Bogota, the Colombian capital.
Equipped with a Wingsuit (a combination of wings), it passed to 160 km/h above the famous holy Monserrate, located over 3,000 metres high, where many Badads gathered to observe its operation.
A black box in your car?
While U.S. road network planners find it hard to find the money needed to repair the auto-road infrastructure in dedecryption, many are those who are interviewing a solution in the form of a small black box that is located above your car's board.
The devices, which record all the miles of traffic through a car driver and transmit the information to officials, are at the heart of a controversial attempt in Washington and in government planning offices to manage the obsolete system of financing major American roads.
The sector generally lacks interest in large-scale planning has suddenly led to a strong lively debate and moving alliances.
The liberators have joined environmentalist groups to press for the government to use small boxes to keep track of the miles you travel, and possibly of the road on which you travel, then use the information to write a bill.
The Tea Party is landed.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned and expresses its concern about the protection of privacy.
And while members of Congress are unable to agree on whether to continue, several States have not waited.
They are looking for ways, during the next decade, they will be able to move to a system that allows drivers to pay according to the number of miles of roads.
Thousands of drivers have already loaded these black boxes, sometimes equipped with a GPS monitoring system, for an experimental turn.
This is really necessary for our nation.
"It's not like we had the choice," said Hasan Ikhrata, Director General of the Southern California Association of Governments, which provides that the state begins to record the thousands of roads by every California driver by 2025.
There's going to be a change in how we pay these taxes.
The technology is here to do it.
The pressure comes from the fact that the country's Highway Trust Fund, financed by taxes paid by Americans at the pump, is financially dry.
Americans don't buy as much fuel as they used to.
Cars can travel more than a mile with a gallon.
The federal tax itself, which is 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased for 20 years.
Political men are reluctant to raise the tax, even at 1 cent, while fuel prices are high.
"The fuel tax is simply not tenacious," said Lee Munnich, a transport policy specialist at Minnesota University.
His State recently installed tractors over 500 cars to test a payout system for the mile.
"This would be the most logical option in the long term," he said.
Wonks calls this the cost of using the kilometer.
It is not surprising that the idea misleads citizens' liberals, as taxes could be used to modify behavioural habits so as to reduce gas fillings and emissions, for example.
California planners are interested in the system as they develop strategies to achieve the objectives set out in the State's ambitious climate heating laws.
But the representative Bill Shuster (R-Pa.), Chairman of the Committee on Transport of the House of Representatives, said that he also considered it the most viable option in the long term.
The free market participants of the Reason Foundation also appreciate the idea of making drivers pay a mile.
"It's not just a tax that's sinking into a big black hole," said Adrian Moore, Vice-President of the Policy at the Reason Foundation.
People pay more directly for the benefits they are provided.
The movement was also supported by two former US Secretarys for Transport, who, in a 2011 report, urged Congress to go on the road to payment to the Mile.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90M pilot project last year that would have covered about 10,000 cars.
But the President of the House killed the proposal, responding to the concerns of rural legislators representing voters who have to travel for thousands of days to go to work or to town.
Several States and major cities, however, are making progress on their side.
The most determined is Oregon, which has mobilized 5,000 drivers to conduct the country's most important experience.
These drivers will soon pay the State of Kilometric Costs instead of fuel taxes.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is considering one.
Illinois is trying a test on a limited number of trucks.
And coalition I-95, which includes 17 agencies involved in road transport in States off the coast, is American (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) studying how it could implement change.
The concept is not universal success.
In Nevada, where about 50 voluntary drivers had recently equipped their car with a device, drivers were concerned that the government could monitor their lesser facts and actions.
"The concerns about Big Brother and this kind of thing are a major problem," said Alauddin Khan, who runs the strategic management of performance in the Nevada Transportation Department.
It's not something people want.
From the start of the test, Nevada's ACLU warned on its site: "It would be relatively easy to turn these devices into full-scale location devices."
There is no need to build an enormous and comprehensive technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep records of people's daily departures and arrivals.
Nevada is part of a few States that are now moving to find an affordable technology that would allow the State to know how many miles a car travels, but without knowing the exact location or time.
If we can do this, Khan added, citizens will be more comfortable.
The research of this technology has led some state agencies to appeal to a small California startup named True Mileage.
Initially, the company is not intended to help drivers who pay taxes to States.
She was trying to find out in the emerging car insurance market, where drivers would pay according to their mileage.
But the devices it tests have more to the planners of the major axes because they do not use GPS and provide a limited amount of information, periodically downloaded by modem.
"People will be more inclined to do this if you don't record their speed and do not locate them," said Ryan Morrison, Director General of True Mileage.
Major errors have been made in the pilot programmes of certain States.
There are much less expensive and less intrusive ways to proceed.
In Oregon, planners try the experience by offering different choice motorists.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
They can still choose not to have any equipment at all, preferring to pay a flat fee based on the average number of miles of roads by all residents of the state.
Other States hope to sell the concept to unbelievers by allowing devices to do more, rather than enough.
In New York City, transport managers are seeking to develop a tax facility that would also be equipped to pay parking costs, provide a "conduct payment" insurance and create a set of real-time speed data from other drivers that drivers could use to avoid bottlenecks.
"Car drivers would be encouraged to participate because of the benefits the system offers them," said a paper on urban planning.
However, some transport planners wonder if the whole millennium payment debate is not just a huge diversion.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission of the San Francisco Bay Area, officials say Congress could simply manage the bankruptcy of the Highway Trust Fund by increasing taxes on fuel.
An additional single or annual tax could be imposed on drivers of hybrid vehicles and on others whose vehicles do not consume much fuel, so that each pays its own fair share.
"There is no need to resort to radical surgery when we simply need aspirin," said Randy Rentschler, the director of legislation and public affairs to the Commission.
If we do so, hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about protecting their privacy and a lot of other things.
David Bowie: four unpublished listening
The English musician has not been surprised this year.
From The Next Day, published in January, he launched a luxury edition scheduled for November 4, with several unpublished editions.
Four have already emerged on the Roof.
The announcement of the release of a new album by David Bowie had left the whole world pantois.
On the day of his 66th anniversary, on January 8, 2013, he stated that a new album would be released in March.
After ten years of silence (the last album, Reality, date of 2003) and too rare appearances in public, the English musician proved that it could still be relied on to make the pop scene more visible.
A party for his fans
Don't be surprised, David Bowie had more than one tour in his bag with The Next Day.
The Thin White Duke thus planned to re-edit this album on 4 November.
For the occasion, he staged a real party for his fans.
This edition, entitled The Next Day Extra, will be presented in the form of three disks: the original album, unpublished studio sessions and remixes, as well as a DVD containing the four clips already revealed.
The Next Day Extra will contain a total of ten additional songs compared to the original album: the three pieces of the Deluxe edition, five songs especially revealed for the occasion, and two remixes.
David Bowie also made presentations of this beautiful box in a video.
It introduces both of the disks, but also the accessories provided with: exclusive photos and pockets, a book to share its own impressions, a book with words...
And, above all, it gives a taste of its new title Atomica, typically in the vein of The Next Day, with guitars far ahead and a naturally controlled rock electricity.
You've already heard of it.
But Atomica is not the only title to reveal her charms.
The Informer, Like A Rocket Man, Born In A UFO are also available on the screen.
The Informer is double-faced: an alarming intro before a bright knight who gradually slows down to allow room for a pop ballad.
On Like A Rocket Man, did Bowie want to make a small reference to the Rocket Man of Elton John, even to Gravity?
With this title played, the singer seems anyway in his element when he no longer has his feet on earth.
Space Oddity, next to it, was much more serious.
On Born In A UFO, David Bowie makes a new reference to his wonder: would he come from another planet?
The guitar riffs, envying, give you a wish to leave the Earth.
In any case, Bowie has fun playing the chameleon with these titles: computer turn, man on board a rocket, potential martian...
He dissimulates and reveals both, plays to adopt different personalities, as he did throughout his career, especially with his characters Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane.
No wonder he has a mask in his hand in the photography of the campaign L'Invitation à Voyage, of the Louis Vuitton brand, whose new face he incarnates.
It will appear in one of their advertising spots, released from 10 November.
The Minister of Defence Rob Nicholson insisted that the wounded soldiers were not fully released from the Canadian Armed Forces, and stressed that a transitional process was followed by all soldiers before their return to civilian life.
Attacked by liberals and neo-democrats in the House of Commons, Mr. Nicholson assured that before their release, members of the army were following a transitional plan in collaboration with their superiors.
All wounded soldiers receive appropriate care for their return to civilian life and none of them is released before being ready, he said.
Detractors accuse the government of wanting to save money by not allowing wounded soldiers - who do not meet the "university of service" rule of the army demanding that staff be able to perform a variety of tasks - to reach the ten-year eligibility period required for retirement benefits.
In particular, they cited two cases reported by The Canadian Press, including one of the released soldiers last Friday.
Corporal David Hawkins, a London reservist in Ontario, was released from the army despite his request to stay another year in order to receive a fully indexed retirement.
His case occurred after the case of Corporal Glen Kirkland, who stated before a parliamentary committee last month that he had been pushed out before being ready because he did not respond to the universality rule of service.
Mr. Hawkins stressed that a soldier could be prepared from time to time, with plans and consultations, but that this was completely different from the fact that he wanted to leave the ranks.
"I told them I wasn't ready," he said during an interview with the Canadian Press on Wednesday.
I asked for months if there was any way I could stay, and they said no.
Since the beginning of the major struggles in Afghanistan, the army has been unable to determine what latitude it can give to wounded soldiers who want to remain in ranks but are not capable of fighting.
Under the current rules, the severely injured soldiers have up to three years to recover.
If they do not meet the criteria for deployment abroad, they may be forced to leave the army.
Data submitted last year to Parliament indicate that among the 1218 soldiers released for medical reasons, 199 had not reached the required service period for retirement benefits.
The Liberal spokesperson for former combatants, Jim Karygiannis, asked for the reintegration of Corporal Hawkins on Wednesday, while neo-democratic Jack Harris called for the immediate end of "this shameful practice".
Disney on the tablets to launch an animated series
The American media and entertainment group Disney has decided to give the tablets the privilege of their own television channels for the next release of a new series for children.
The first nine episodes of Sheriff Callie's Wild West will be available from November 24th on watchdisneyjunior.com or via its phone and tablet application.
Its global launch on Disney Group Chains is planned only in 2014, detailing its Disney Junior Division.
The animated drawing, designed for children aged 2-7 years, tells the adventures of Callie, the sheriff of a western American city where she rules the order with a magic lasso.
Each episode includes two 11-minute stories.
"Intertacting with smartphones and tablets is a second kind for children today," commented Albert Cheng, Vice-President of Disney/ABC Television Group, quoted in the Communication.
This type of experience comes within Disney's efforts to "extend the life span of its series and build new relationships with its audience through increasingly important digital platforms", he added.
A survey published at the beginning of the week by Common Sense Media showed an explosion in the use of mobile devices by young children in the United States: 38% of the less than 2 years have already been used on a tablet or on a phone, and 72% of the less than 8 years old, compared to 10% and 38% respectively two years ago.
Snowden is ready to "cooperate" with Germany on the issue of US surveillance
Edward Snowden, the denouncing U.S. Information Services, stated that he was willing to go to Berlin to witness to the German Parliament if the United States National Security Agency and its Director Keith Alexander did not provide any answers to their activities.
German Member Hans-Christian Ströbele met Mr Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was entitled to asylum, to discuss his testimony in Germany.
In a letter to the media in Berlin on Friday, Mr. Snowden said: "Although the result of my efforts has been positive, my government continues to treat the difference of opinion as a fugitive and seeks to penalise the political speech with accusations against which it is impossible to defend itself."
However, telling the truth is not a crime.
In his letter, Mr. Snowden wrote that he felt that the support of the international community could persuade the American government to abandon the criminal charges against him.
In the context of the complaint filed by the U.S. Ministry of Justice, he is accused of spying and stealing property of the State.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, German Interior Minister, said in Time Online: "If Mr. Snowden is willing to talk to the German authorities, we will make this possible."
The relationship between the United States and Germany was severely tested as a result of complaints that the NSA had been listening to the German Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone.
Thomas Oppermann, the MP who is leading the parliamentary group overseeing foreign secret services, said that if there was a chance to hear Mr Snowden as a witness "without endangering him and completely ruining relations with the United States", he had to take advantage of it.
Mr Ströbele, Member of Green Germany, posted a photo of him with Mr Snowden on his Twitter account.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Ströbele said that according to the former NSA consultant, Mr. Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Mr Snowden was testifying in Germany, he should be assured that he would be "safe" there, the Member said.
Mr. Snowden wrote in his letter that he had been the subject of a "severe and sustained" persecution campaign that had forced him to leave his country.
However, he said that he had been encouraged by the global response to "my political expression."
The world's citizens, as well as the top leaders, including the United States, felt that the revelation of an inexplicable system of permanent surveillance was of public benefit.
The letter advances an offer of cooperation with the German authorities "when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been solved".
Cogeco Cable could soon offer interactive TV
Cogeco Cable subscribers may well have access to applications such as Facebook, Twitter and the latest video service on demand from Netflix via their television in a future that doesn't seem so far away.
Cogeco's subsidiary indicated on Thursday that it was currently conducting preliminary testing of the beta version of this platform with some of its users.
"This will enable us to develop more friendly interfaces as well as more options," explained the President and Head of the Cogeco Directorate, Louis Audet, in an interview.
Cogeco Cable is thus taking the step to its competitors, such as Bell, even though the Cogeco branch has no specific date yet with regard to this new platform.
"It is necessary to adapt and change or resist change and failure," said Mr. Audet.
The ultimate goal remains to offer tools that our customers do not currently have access to.
The Rogers telecommunications giant has already indicated that it could offer Netflix if certain technical details, which have not been mentioned, could be resolved.
In the United States, the popular video service says to be in discussions with some major cable distributors to make its service available through their broadcast platforms.
Cogeco and Cogeco Cable's father also welcomed the announcement made by the Harper government during his Speech of the Throne on 16 October.
Ottawa wants to force cable and satellite television providers to offer customers the opportunity to pay for services on the map.
"It's been almost two and a half years since we said that the idea of forcing consumers to buy important chain envelopes is not working," said Mr. Audet.
However, he hoped that the consultations of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council (CTC) would lead to interesting recommendations.
"It will have to emerge from these discussions a kind of new reference framework to define our new Canadian cultural policy on television," said Cogeco's father.
The CRTC has been consulting the public since last week and should continue with the industry in the coming spring.
On the basis of the results, Cogeco indicated that it had recorded a net profit of 43.8 million in the fourth quarter, or 82¢ by action.
This is a decrease compared to the net profit of 44.9 million, or 83¢ by action, of the same period last year.
The company established in Montréal explains this decline due to costs of amortizations related to new acquisitions.
In 2012, Cogeco acquired the Atlantic Broadband cable distributor, established in the United States, for 1.36 billion.
This was the first major acquisition of the company after its failure in Portugal.
Last December, the Vietnamese company also purchased Peer 1 Network Entrepreneurs, an Internet supplier established in Vancouver, for the amount of 526 million.
With regard to Cogeco's income, they had an increase of 41.5 per cent in the fourth quarter to reach 504.7 million.
They amount to 1.8 billion for the current financial year.
The net profit of its main subsidiary, Cogeco Cable, was 43.9 million, or 90¢ per share, in decline compared to 45.7 million, or 93¢ per share, in the same period last year.
However, Cogeco Cable's revenues rose by 45% to 470.4 million.
The company lost 15,237 customers during the fourth quarter.
However, for the financial year 2013, the number of Cogeco Cable customers is increasing 5546.
Mr. Audet is not concerned about the number of customers fluctuating.
For me, it's not the indication of a change of trend, did he notice?
It varies from quarter to quarter with a very lively competition.
From horse in beef products
From horse meat was detected in beef-based storage boxes, sold by two small British low-price distribution teachers, the food hygiene agency announced today.
Routine tests revealed that products, developed in January in Romania and sold by the Home Bargains and Quality Save channels, contained horse DNA from 1 to 5%.
"As horse meat is not mentioned in the list of ingredients, it should not have been present in the product," the British agency explained.
A scandal over the presence of horse meat in cooked meals broke out in Europe at the beginning of the year, following tests in Ireland.
According to the European Commission's reviews, France was the country most affected by the presence of such meat in products intended to contain only beef.
A collision between two vehicles took place four wounded early Friday on the 131st road in Lanaudière.
Just before 4 hrs ago, a motorist who was driving north in Saint-Félix-de-Valois lost control of his vehicle and lost a car that arrived in the other direction.
The four occupants of the two vehicles were injured, but they were not afraid of their lives.
The traffic was returned to normal at 6:00 p.m. on Friday.
Frontier Airlines Plans to Make Handbags Pay
Frontier Airlines plans to pay up to $100 to passengers who carry hand baggage on their flights.
Frontier Airlines plans to start paying up to $100 for a hand baggage and $2 for a coffee or soda, although in its Wednesday announcement, it indicated that passengers could carry the unopened cannet with them down the plane.
The new hand baggage costs relate to bags arranged in the upper compartment, so small bags installed under the seat will always be free of charge.
Frontier stated that it would pay $25 if the costs were paid in advance and $100 if the passengers paid only once at the port of boarding.
Frontier's spokesperson, Kate O'Malley said that the $100 was intended to encourage travellers to pay the costs in advance.
"We don't want to pay this price," she explained.
Air carriers began to pay the first and second bags recorded in 2008.
Passengers who tried to avoid these costs put as much stuff as they could in handbags in the upper compartments, so there was often no place in these compartments.
These costs are a means of ensuring that passengers carry less than the items on board.
O'Malley said that these new charges will not really be used to collect money.
This is to make it clear to the most faithful Frontier customers that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find a place in the upper rooms.
Passengers who buy their ticket on the airline site will not have to pay.
Thus, a passenger making the queue at a Frontier port could carry a bag free of charge, while the next person in the queue might have to pay $100 for a similar bag.
O'Malley explained that Frontier's website and registration procedures are changing to ensure that passengers know the existence of these charges before they arrive at the door.
Frontier's baggage costs will not be applied before summer, although no date has been set.
Passengers often respect baggage and other charges, but airlines love them.
They believe that baggage maintenance costs are important and that passengers who want this service should pay.
Many people in Wall Street view the addition of baggage costs as a sign that the airlines make enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
However, many of them did not touch the baggage costs.
Spirit Airlines Inc. had applied the first baggage charges three years ago, and the low-cost company Allegiant followed a little later.
The only other company that imposes such charges is the Hungarian company Wizz Air, said the consultant to air carriers Jay Sorensen, who follows the additional charges.
In a December 2011 report, he estimated that the cost of Spirit baggage was $50 million a year.
Sorensen, an old Midwest Airlines framework, recently traveled on Spirit and asked what he was going to find at the port of boarding when passengers would discover the costs of unusual hand baggage imposed by the company.
"I've never seen a shipping procedure so fluid in my entire professional career," he said.
I was expecting to see some teeth scratches and a trunk burst at the door.
The plane was full, he added, "the passengers are on board at the speed of light".
Frontier also makes like Spirit and applies $2 for coffee, tea, soda or fruit juice.
Frontier indicated that passengers who take a soda or fruit juice can carry the unopened cant with them, and those who take coffee can be reserved free of charge.
It will always distribute water for free.
US Airways briefly tried to pay for drinks in 2008 but came back seven months later after the passengers complained and no other large airline had followed.
Frontier's decision to pay baggage costs by hand when passengers do not buy their ticket directly from the airline is his last effort to encourage customers to go to his site.
Air carriers pay online travel sellers like Orbitz $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This has encouraged all airlines to encourage passengers to buy directly from them instead of addressing an online travel agency.
However, Frontier has gone further in this area.
In September, she began offering only half a thousand loyalty to customers who bought their ticket via an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, she reduced the premiums by 25 per cent on a trip.
Thus, a 1 000-mile border trip purchased from an online travel agency would make it 250-mile.
It also allows passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they buy their ticket directly on the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal clientele in her hometown, Denver, but her business is falling back and she loses money.
Revenue fell by 9 per cent and its flight capacity decreased by almost 13 per cent during the first quarter, according to financial results published on Wednesday by its parent, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
The Republic tried to re-establish Frontier's finances by selling the airline.
NSA calls into question an "internal error" rather than computer pirates for its site panel
The National Security Agency working in the shadows said on Friday that it was a bug that had caused the panic of its public site for a few hours, and not of hackers like some had claimed it online.
"NSA.gov remained inaccessible for a few hours this evening due to an internal error that occurred during a planned update," said the spy agency in an email statement.
The problem will be solved tonight.
The claims that the panel was due to a deplorable attack of distributed service [DSD] are false.
Earlier this evening, on-line server trackers noted that the NSA site had been offline for at least 6 hours, and some users still cannot access the site.
Earlier, an NSA spokesperson told ABC News that the agency's sensitive internal network was not "at all" compromise.
No classified information is in danger, the spokesperson explained.
At least one online activist group claimed to be responsible for the NSA's site panel by a DSD attack.
DSD attacks aim to flood a targeted site until servers are overloaded and the site collapses.
Cyber-tactics is not very sophisticated and attacks are not intended to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The NSA has once been extremely secret, a time called "No Search Agency", which has been under the fire of the projectors and has been severely criticized in recent months following a wave of revelations about its extensive national and foreign communications monitoring programs – which are part of NSA secret files stolen from the agency and disclosed by the former NSA consultant Edward Snowden.
This growing controversy around the agency caused many speculations that the incident this evening was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
Delta Centre-City now closed
The Delta Centre-Ville hotel closed its doors on Thursday in Montreal, after 36 years of existence.
The investment fund that owned the building sold it to promoters who would turn it into student residences.
Three hundred and fifty people worked at the hotel.
Among them, 200 have not yet found a new job.
Delta promises not to let his employees fall.
Employers came to meet directly on-site employees, and they were met individually to assess their needs.
"This support will continue for the next six months," explains the Regional Director of Working Relations of the Delta Hotels, Félix Bisson.
Delta's closure takes place in a very competitive hotel market.
The investment fund that owned this building had options to make.
Whether he reinvested in the building to continue operating it, so there were tens of millions of investments while the competition is very ferocious, there are many new hotels that appeared in Montreal.
"Or he sold it to someone else, and that's what happened," explains Paul Arsenault, who holds the Chair of Tourism Translat to UQAM School of Science Management.
Other hotels in Montreal will also be converted in the coming months, such as the Crown Plaza, which will become a residence for elderly people.
Meanwhile, four hotel projects totaling nearly 600 rooms will be up to two years.
For Titan's PDG, "the Goodyear Amiens purchase project starts with zero employees"
After throwing out the sponge with failures in January for partial resumption of Amiens-Nord's Goodyear website promised to close, Maurice Taylor, the U.S. tyre PD.T.P.P.T.P., today is ready to save 333 jobs on 1,137 jobs in the factory.
Arnaud Montebourg, Minister of Productive Rehabilitation, had already announced it on Monday 21 October.
After giving up the factory purchase project in January, you come back today.
You had spoken of violent attacks and insults, speaking of "so-called workers", who "working three hours" per day, of "false" unions, targeting the CGT.
We don't understand this face.
Is it to please Mr. Montebourg?
I'm not trying to please anyone.
Except my wife.
Mr. Montebourg is a charming young man who tries to save industrial jobs among the best paid.
If I hurt someone by my words, I'm sorry.
But France also has a high level of tax and unemployment.
Does the truth hurt you?
Working seven hours a day when working in other countries eight hours of disabled France.
In India, China and many other countries, ten to twelve hours a day are employed.
But I don't have any prejudices about France.
What I see is a plant that manufactures good agricultural tyres, has good equipment, is well located and has spaces to expand.
Why does Titan need this plant so much?
Titan doesn't need to buy this plant.
But with the right price and competent workers, this is worth a try.
What kind of deal do you expect between CGT and Goodyear?
If, since the closure announcement, Goodyear had offered the employees a good starting compensation, I think 100% of the employees would have accepted it.
Now, let's imagine that Titan buys Goodyear's closed factory.
As a result, Titan could move the machines to Poland or to any other European Union country that still has its own currency.
I think Mr. Montebourg knows that.
However, he wants to keep the Amiens plant with at least 333 well-paid jobs.
Titan agrees to recruit them among some 1,200 current Goodyear employees.
Mr. Montebourg also needs Titan's commitment before trying to get the CGT to sit at the table with Goodyear.
The first step is that the CGT and Goodyear sign an agreement on departure allowances for all employees.
As a result, there will be no more employees in the plant.
Mr. Montebourg said that you were ready to guarantee 333 jobs for four years.
Can you confirm that?
The only number I mentioned to the Minister is 333.
I know he'd want a four-year guarantee.
But, as I told you, the CGT and Goodyear must first agree on the benefits of departure.
If all employees accept them, the plant purchase project starts with zero employees.
How can we provide long-term employment guarantees when there are no more employees on the site?
If Mr. Montebourg finds that the CGT and Goodyear agree and that Titan buys the plant, we have a good plan to stay in Amiens-Nord for more than four years.
The benefits of Bombardier are down, while deliveries and aircraft orders are down.
Bombardier Inc, a Canadian aircraft and rail manufacturer, reported a 15 per cent drop in its net profit on Thursday, under the pressure of lower command and delivery of aircraft during the third quarter and contractual problems in its Trains division.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, no longer provided flight test data for his new CSeries plane or information to determine whether the aircraft will comply with its ambitious commercial service schedule before next September.
After the inaugural flight of the test plane about a month and a half ago, the pilot only stole three times, and the question then became known whether the test phase was in the right direction.
The results were not expected and the stock exchange declined by 8 per cent to the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at the National Financial Bank, reduced his rating on Thursday, from "superperformance" to "sector performance" due to the low stock exchange growth potential in the next quarter or next two quarters.
"Although the drop in air deliveries has been largely anticipated, we are really disappointed by the margin in the Transport Division," Cameron Doerksen said in a note to the customers.
We believe Bombardier will record new commands for its CSeries aircraft as the flight test program will advance.
However, if no new order is announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more sceptical about the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft family will be able to catapult it in the lower segment of today's market dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was released in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delay.
However, the number of firm orders for CSeries aircraft is modest to date up to 177. It seems that potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests to validate the company's claims regarding energy efficiency and the potential savings of the new line plane.
Currently, the company has recorded a total of 403 purchase orders and commitments from 15 customers and operators.
Pierre Beaudoin, president and head of management, is convinced that Bombardier will achieve its goal of 300 firm commands prior to the commercial service of the first plane.
The leaders also reassured analysts and the media on Thursday, indicating that the program was progressing according to the timetable.
"The test plane did not remain on the ground longer than expected," said Mr. Beaudoin at a telephone conference, adding that tests on the ground and software updates were planned during the flight's stop time.
Each manufacturer plans differently.
We decided to take the first flight and plan an update period, and that is what we did.
This will take place throughout the flight program.
The second of the five test planes should fly in the coming weeks, the others will follow shortly thereafter, the company said.
However, analysts are skeptical that the first client can fly a CSeries plane only 12 months after his inaugural flight.
Bombardier indicated that it was under evaluation of the entry schedule and will provide new information in the coming months.
"This slowness of flight tests – although it appears to be in line with Bombardier's internal timetable – strengthens our view that entry into service will be postponed in the first quarter of 2015," said Doerksen.
At the third quarter closes on September 30, Bombardier's net profit fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, compared to $172 million, or 9 cents per share, one year earlier.
The result by adjusted action remained unchanged to 9 cents.
Revenues have slightly decreased from $4.2 to $4.1 Md.
Analysts expected 10 cents per action and $4.56 Md income, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The fourth aircraft manufacturer in the world reported that he had delivered 45 aircraft during the quarter, compared with 57 a year earlier.
Net commands are dropped to 26 aircraft, compared to 83 previously.
The delay in the Aeronautics Division was $32.9 Md as at 30 September, an unchanged figure compared to 31 December of the previous year.
"In Aeronautics, the results were consistent with our forecasts, but the low number of orders and the general conditions of the market were disappointing," said Mr. Beaudoin.
Aeronautic revenues fell by 13 per cent to $2M.
Bombardier, the world's largest railway manufacturer, said that revenues from this division had increased from nearly 11% to $2.1 MD.
The Transport Division's order book totaled $32.6 Md as at 30 September, a slight increase compared to 31 December of the previous year.
The margins of the Transport Division have suffered execution problems for some major contracts.
The leaders announced that new indications would be provided during the fourth quarter.
The Bombardier Action Course, which also announced that Patrick Pichette, head of the Google Inc Financial Management, was in the board of directors, fell from 8.5% to 4.83 Canadian dollars in the afternoon of Thursday.
The Brazilian company Embraer SA, the third aircraft builder in the world and competing with Bombardier, reported a 10% reduction in its quarterly profit on Thursday.
Two 23- and 27-year-olds had been carried away in a honfer under the Dent de Crolles since Thursday evening, learned Friday with the Speleo rescue of Isère.
They were located this Friday-after afternoon.
The two men, one aguri to practice and the other not, were on the ground Thursday at 9:30 p.m. to perform a crossing of the Dent de Crolles, located on the municipality of Saint-Pierre-de-Chartreuse.
We've been out of news since then, he said the same source.
"Spelegologists should have gone around 5 a.m.," said Thierry Larribe, technical advisor to the Speleo relief organization.
Tens of persons on site
Twenty escorts, ten French Speleo soldiers, as well as gendarmeries, CRS and firemen were on the scene.
At the end of the afternoon this Friday, the two specologists were located.
"It is another group of specologists who, after having found them exhausted but in good health in the cavite, have transmitted information to one of the rescue teams engaged in the network," explains Le Dauphiné.
The two soldiers at the 13th Battalion of the Chambéry Alpine Hunters were found "expunged but not injured".
They lost themselves in the network, returned on their steps waiting for the rescue, the prefecture stated.
Realized, they should emerge from the cavitation with the help of the escorts in the evening.
German journalists invited to escape Google and Yahoo
The union of German journalists invited its adherents on Thursday to stop using Google and Yahoo's online services in the wake of new revelations about the activities of the United States and British information services.
"The German Federation of Journalists recommends that journalists avoid the use of search engines and Google and Yahoo messages," she said in a communiqué.
She considers Washington Post 's scandalous' information, according to which the National Security Agency (NSA) and the British Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) have collected mass of information by infiltrating international networks that allow both firms to synchronize their servers.
"The research done by journalists is as confidential as the coordinates of their sources and the nature of their communications with them," added Michael Konken, president of the union who claims 38,000 adherents.
Fires of resurgence: a Member requests the resignation of Brigitte Grouwels
The project by Minister Brigitte Grouwels of "reliefing" of the flagship lights in Brussels does not please everyone.
To remind us, the Brussels Minister of Public Works and Transport launched this Thursday at the centre of Brussels a project to re-establish 16 light-signalling posts in the region in the yellow and blue colours of Brussels.
The aim is both "to increase security" and "Brussels identity".
The idea is, in the end, to repeat all the Brussels signaling lights for an estimated cost of about EUR 1 million.
But the blue chosen by the minister is "too dark", according to Brussels Member Emmanuel De Bock, who speaks of "flaming" the capital and demands Brigitte Grouwels' "demission".
"I am not happy to spend the money of Brussels in lifting the signposts to the colors of the Brussels Region, Brigitte Grouwels continues his flamenization operations of the Capital," said Mr. De Bock in a communiqué.
After her black-and-white taxis, she finally repeated herself in black-and-black-black.
According to the honourable Member, "there is no longer any difference in visual continuity between Flanders and Brussels".
The Brusselsers deserve better than to see their money spent by a CD&V minister who does the NVA program itself.
It's a long time to stop Troie de la Flandre's horse.
"For the record, Brigitte Grouwels was elected only with 2 245 votes or 0.5% of the Brussels!" concluded Mr De Bock.
the Portique de Pont-de-Bus disassembled
The Portique ecotaxe of Pont-de-Buis, which took place on Saturday a violent demonstration of opponents to this tax, was dismantled on Thursday morning.
Grapes arrived on site shortly after 10 hours, and traffic on the country was diverted into the crowd.
The decision to dismantle, announced by the Prefecture of the Finistère on Wednesday, was taken by Ecomouv, Portico Manager.
This is the last of the three ecotax ports in the department of Finistère, the other two that have been dismantled or sabotaged.
Launching an accessory store for Google Glass
An online store, offering multiple accessories dedicated to Google Glass, has just been made available to thousands of developers with a prototype of Google signed connected glasses.
They can thus acquire a listener, a charger or even a rowing machine.
This shop, strictly reserved for developers already with Google Glass, offers some accessories such as a charger and its USB cable, for $50.
For the same price, it is also possible to acquire a protective case made of micro-fibres or an earphone.
Although Google is currently working on a Google Glass model equipped with corrective glass, no large-scale marketing date has yet been confirmed.
Five years ago my father disappeared from the world of the living.
At the beginning I denied his death, I was talking about him now,
I was so afraid to forget it, or I didn't know how to keep going on with it.
There is no recipe, no mode of employment for passing the wall of the invisible and finding its own.
Then there were signs.
The first time this was the very strong feeling of his presence on the passenger seat while I was driving.
Another time, a gentle awakening in the middle of the night to watch his watch that no longer leaves me, placed on the table at night.
It's the image of my smiling father who's with me in my daily gestures.
Our mother left us after her exhausting fight against cancer.
That's at least what I thought the day I found his body empty, crisscrossed this hospital bed on the frozen drapes.
Similarly, his funerals were an ice-creamed adieu focused around the soft light of the candles that would frame his circle.
I thought she was gone.
Little by little, by little day or night appearances, a little shy, a little confused, she came back into my mind quickly, evolving in the fur and as she took her place in the landscape of my thought that thought herself in mourning.
And then she showed up all the while revealing to me my own faces that I had not yet perceived, masked by my relationship with her.
So I learned and understood that I had not lost my mother's person at all but just a woman I didn't really know, a woman who incarnates this person during her stay in life.
By dying, this woman had perfect her life and freed the person I loved, and here I found her full and complete.
This distance from the path of my life remains the most unexpected and most beautiful.
It's a privilege to know that loved ones never leave us.
I look like my father, "in the inside like outside" he seemed.
I've always been told.
I never believed it at the time.
I've had difficult relationships with him until he gets old, sick.
There, I was no longer afraid of him, and I could love him.
One day, he's dead.
For a long time, he accompanied me: when I stopped smoking, when I was afraid, when I was sick...
He was talking to me, he was always encouraging me, he was living my body.
I saw his hands looking at my hands, I lent him my body.
But it was never indiscreet.
I could have had a personal life.
He left me alone.
It took a long time then one day he left.
Finally, it was comfortable and reassuring to be able to understand, encourage and advise.
I don't know who said that the dead are not forgotten but invisible.
My parents are no longer, but I feel them constantly close to me.
Every event, every moment of my life makes me feel their presence because I always refer to it: what would they say? what would they think? what would they do?
I always dream about them, maybe not all the nights, but several times a week it's certain.
I often dream of the last moments that I have to share with them before it's too late, but there's always something that keeps me from fulfilling this moment.
I often wake up worried when that happens to me and I deeply feel their absence.
Sometimes some dreams lead me to the opposite of them and they register in my story and actually they continue to live and share my life.
The watch of my echoography where I had to know my baby's sex, I dreamed I'd wake up, get out of bed, my father was waiting for me on the floor and he was going to take care of me, and I was glad I was waiting for a little boy.
The next day, I had the feeling that he had visited me in my sleep to tell me that he shared with joy what was happening to me.
And of course, it was a little boy in my belly.
I loved sharing this moment with him and I'm glad to tell you this shared memory after his death.
Just five years ago, my grandmother died of cancer.
A year ago, she was traveling with my family to Cuba.
It's the shock that his disappearance caused the young bachelor I was at the time.
I have done everything I can to make my grief come true quite quickly.
But it continues to affect my life, especially when I find myself in trouble, or when I have to make important decisions.
Learning Arabic and interested in the Middle East, at the point of mastering it in a large school, were not, with backward, anodinian choices.
In fact, I often heard him speak Arabic in my childhood, and talk about Morocco, where she had lived for decades - before returning to France at the time of independence.
The values she has instilled in me are always present, so I can think about how she would like me to act at a given time.
The same goes for my attitudes: I try to be at the height of generosity and the right of mind of the one who was a strong believer.
Now, I feel like a daily presence, a benevolent soul, a saving spirit.
I can see her looking at me.
My mother died 18 years ago now.
He died after he talked to me on the phone.
I have gone through all phases: misunderstandings, anger, pain, tears that start alone, no matter where, in unusual places, there are incongruent moments.
Then time has eased the pain.
It was only that the lack, the lack of answers, the need for her, the need to trust me, the need to reassure me of her mildness.
Yet, she's here, silent presence, she's there and she's looking at me.
Every morning, I see her anxious eyes looking at me, I see the eyelids that aflame her eyes, the smiles around the lips that cross cigarettes, the most that mark the front of the days of anxiety.
My mother took possession of my face and she looks at me every morning in my mirror.
And every morning, I turn my eyes away.
My wife and mother of three children died of cancer at 43 years of age.
We always feel his protection, nothing serious can happen to us.
It was his promise on his bed of pain, so we had little to laugh at, and to pronounce his name is no longer taboo but a comfort.
Of course, I'm talking to her in the middle of the night when the absence is too bad, she's invited into my dreams when morale is a little touched.
We feel worn out and protected in difficult times, the recuperation of time makes us realize how much she was the head of the orchestra and we try to stay in the path she had drawn us.
If a person loves you very much, the absence can not take you away from your heart and memories.
In a way, being loved becomes your inner energy.
I lost my father on August 22, 2008 from the suites of asbestos cancer.
I was very close to him, I always acted on what he thought or what he liked.
I couldn't attend his inhumanation and three weeks after his death, I gave birth to a little boy.
If I have my beliefs sometimes different from hers, I still wonder if my actions are consistent with her vision of things.
I have also had problems in my work for these beliefs.
For me, it's impossible to go in a different way, I don't feel like it, and I always wonder what he'll think of it.
I don't know if I've adopted his way of being or if I'm just like him: is it genetic?
In any case, it will always be my reference.
It was a bit like an alternate ego, there was no need to talk to each other.
In short, he's here every day.
I feel his presence and that makes me happy.
I was about thirty years old when my husband died at the age of 33.
I was 28 years old and our son was 6 years old.
The huge punishment that then invaded me has certainly softened, but it is always close to me.
Very often he "screws" in my dreams so precisely, so vivid that in the wake I'm even more sad to find that it was just a dream.
The other night, he asked me if I was going well, I told him no, he answered me "I'm coming down" but with such a real voice that I woke up suddenly, anxious and I lit the headlight looking everywhere, convinced that he was coming.
I always live in the same house, and often, I feel noticed and I come back to see if he's not there, I know it's him and I'm talking to him.
In all parts I feel his presence and that makes me happy.
For nothing in the world, I would not leave this house where we were happy and his spirit lives with me.
I am 58 years old, I have always lived alone since he left, he is and will remain the love of my life.
I want to clarify that I am sociable with a responsible profession, I laugh and I sing, I go out, I am my grandmother, I am full of friends, but my heart and soul belong to him and I never talk about him except with my son, and I never go to the cemetery.
Iraq: October has been the most bloody month since 2008
October was the most murderous month in Iraq since April 2008.
Baghdad published official figures this Friday: 964 people died last month: 855 civilians, 65 policemen and 44 soldiers.
This publication takes place on the day when the Prime Minister of Iraq was received by the US President.
Noury al-Maliki wants help from the United States.
"We do not tell the world to be on our side and to support us, we have the right to request it to the world because we are part of it," Al-Maliki said this Thursday in Washington.
And also because if what is happening in Iraq is not regulated, it will extend, and what is happening in Syria will extend as well.
And what happens when a terrorist virus lives?
Noury al-Maliki spoke at the United States Institute for Peace, an independent institution established by Congress.
Outside the building, protesters protested against the Iraqi leader.
Among other things, they called on him to be a murderer and called on the United States to refuse to provide him with help.
The cocaine lawyer who informed a drug sponsor of a police investigation was imprisoned
Basharat Ditta, 42 years old, gave information to the master of the crime Neil Scarbrough
The lawyer was afraid his secret drug addiction would not be revealed on the big day.
He was sentenced to three years imprisonment by the Liverpool Court of Sitting
A major defense lawyer, who had informed a drug sponsor of an important police investigation because he was afraid his secret drug addiction was not revealed, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Bashart Ditta, 42 years old, gave sensitive information to the crime lord Neil Scarbrough about his drug-trafficking activities after being compromised because of his habit of consuming cocaine.
The lawyer, who was referred to as "Bash" and considered by the criminals as a "first priority file", was arrested at his home in 2011 as a result of police listen operations directed to Scarborough, which he had been involved in a previous drug trafficking trial.
Police officers reported Sarborough, 32 years old, depositing three cocaine bags at the lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he attended a dinner at the Bar with brothers.
Investigations revealed that Ditta was a "regular consumer" of this class A drug after tests showed traces of cocaine in her hair, on her wallet and credit cards.
In a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he sought information unlawfully on the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his associates.
The four suspects were then monitored by the police in an important investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in the counties of Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
With 32 other men, they were subsequently imprisoned after the police seized heroin and cocaine for an amount of £1.5 million, as well as more than £200,000 in cash during a series of raids.
Ditta, 42 years old, provided information to criminals because he feared that his addiction would be revealed on the big day.
Today, at Liverpool's court of law, Ditta, who works in the Forbes Applicants' Office in Blackburn, was dismissed after he was found guilty of two officers' arrest after a trial of three weeks.
He had admitted possession of cocaine during a previous hearing.
The drop of the lawyer occurred after the police, investigating Scarborough, found that he had been regularly in telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and found him arriving at Ditta's home and placing drugs, just 60 per cent under the lawyer's bubbles in a black golf course.
Shortly after the deposit, Scarborough was regularly in contact with Ditta who was at a dinner at the foot stage of Ewood Park, the club's Blackburn Rovers.
The lawyer came back to him, discovered the drugs, and they phoned nine times.
The court heard that Ditta was a "regular consumer" of cocaine after tests showed traces of this class A drug in her hair, on her wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was arrested later but refused to use cocaine. He said he had spoken to the alleged drug dealer because it was his client and claimed that their discussions were subject to a "legal privilege".
During his arrest, Ditta collected his wallet and tried to withdraw several credit cards, but they were all arrested and a sample of hair was taken.
During an interrogation, he stated that he had an office at his home, as well as at his place of work, and that it was possible for customers to call him at his home for legal matters.
But the court heard evidence that he called major actors in the drug trade, some of which he had represented, after key arrests to tell them which investigators were aware of.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said, "If someone needs to know that there is no violation of the law, it is a criminalist lawyer."
Mr. Ditta was accused of abuse of his position as a criminal lawyer and of being too involved with private clients.
The relationship we are talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer providing drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his communications will undoubtedly be legitimate communications because he was his lawyer.
But this went well beyond the normal limits of a relationship between a lawyer and his client.
He blocked the police investigation as far as he could to enable him to continue his criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta didn't honor his profession, but he dishonored him.
He got too close to some customers, especially Scarborough, and he let himself be compromised.
Ditta denied any illegal action and said, "If I was a corrupt lawyer, what I am not, and if I wanted to provide information to Mr. Scarborough, I wouldn't have waited 3 hours, I would have done it immediately."
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of the Lancashire Police said: "Mr. Ditta has been a criminal criminal lawyer himself since he began to seek drugs from criminal organizations."
Its addiction to cocaine has never compromised it and has made it vulnerable to the back-thinking of the leaders of organized criminal groups who have commissioned it to obtain valuable information on police investigations.
Lawyers should observe the strictest rules of integrity and establish a climate of trust with the public.
Mr. Ditta betrayed this trust and tried to hide behind his profession.
The Lancashire Crime Unit conducted the investigation on Mr. Ditta, who was found guilty of the three leaders of the charge of possession of cocaine and is now in violation of justice, testifying to his commitment to prosecute the criminals.
That this case serves as a warning to criminals that they know that no one is above the law.
We'll find you and translate you into court.
Scarborough himself was imprisoned for 14 years after claiming guilty of complicit trafficking in heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other persons involved in trafficking were sentenced to a total of 153 years in prison for drug trafficking.
On his site, Ditta organized a meeting of questions/answers on herself during which he said that his dream job would be a lawyer to represent clients in the corridor of death in America, his last dinner guest would be Mohammed Ali and the inequality would motivate him to work.
Aretha Franklin will be on stage in December
The Detroit News newspaper reports that the soul queen will take place on December 21 at the Sound Board Hall of the Hotel MotorCity Casino.
Ms. Franklin spoke about recording an album for Clive Davis and Sony Music, produced by Don Was and Kenny "Babyface" Edmonds in November.
Without specifying the disease she suffered, the famous respected interpreter had told the media on 16 October that the side effects of a treatment she received were "hard".
She says she's "happy to be back."
Menton reduces the cost of its Christmas lighting
420 motifs, 2.2 kilometers of seaboard covered with a light coat: the heat blow could be broken in Menton with the lighting invoice.
In contrast to many commons, invoices are more regulated by taxpayers, not by associations of traders.
To ease its costs, the city used LEDs.
But also a different management of the public lighting and Christmas decoration network.
Los Angeles Airport evacuated after a shooting
A shooting took place at Los Angeles International Airport.
It was 10:00 in the morning at the local time when a man opened the fire.
According to the local police, there would be at least 2 injured.
This would be an employee working for the United States Transport Safety Administration (TSA) and the author of the firefights.
The incident would have occurred in Terminal 3, causing a panic wave.
Travelers and staff headed for the exits or on the tarmac.
Very soon the police force intervened and a man suspected of being the shooter was arrested on the roof of an airport parking lot.
The airport is under evacuation and air traffic is interrupted.
Of classical song for adolescents
Each time, it is the school clientele that will be targeted, an initiative that had been very successful during the previous season.
Through five sentences imagined and interpreted by artists in the region, vineyards with a high dose of humor, teenagers are allowed to enjoy classical singing.
In addition to this show, the Society of lyrical Art of the Kingdom will return with its Lyrical Destinations, a formula that now makes room for Chikutim's Pupperie.
Two other concerts will take place in the summer of 2014, which gives artists in the region the chance to show what they are capable of.
The lyrical Appéro was added to these activities, the award-winning concert held last August, with the competition of the soprano coloration Marie-Éve Munger.
It was a beneficial activity, in parallel with the artistic dimension, and it helped the non-profit organization to produce a financial balance that is as soft to the ears as an air from the cold.
Without providing precise figures, the president of the board of directors, Yves Bergeron, took advantage of the press meeting held yesterday in Chikutimi to show himself reassuring.
Despite the precarity that is the lot of so many cultural institutions, the future is well-designed, even in the long term.
We have stronger and more consistent support.
"The finances are floating and we hope to last until the 50th anniversary of the opera, a step we take in seven years," said the administrator.
"I would say even beyond," said the Director General, Hélène Gaudreault, smiling.
The 37-year-old man who took a child hostage at the Gabrielle Roy School in Surrey faces six accused heads, according to the Royal Canadian Gendarmerie.
Omar Moustapha Hassan was accused of taking hostage, kidnapping, threatening, carrying weapons in a dangerous design, kidnapping, and failing to comply with an order.
"The rapid responses of police officers involved and their ability to decompose the situation immediately were essential to the safe conclusion of this incident," said Corporal Bert Packet through communication.
Omar Hassan is still in custody and will have to appear in court on Friday.
New application for collective appeal against the Saint-Croix brothers
A new collective appeal was filed against the Saint-Croix brothers regarding sexual assaults that would occur this time at the oratory of Saint-Joseph as well as in several orphanages, colleges and schools.
The application is based on the testimony of the applicant, identified as "J. J.", who would have been masturbated in the 1950s, first in Our Lady-des-Neiges by his professor the Somis brother, then by his confessor, Father Bernard, at the oratory Saint Joseph, where he was a minister and where his father worked as a painter.
The first appeal was aimed at only three institutions, and when the regulation was announced, many people told us: "I was in such a place, can I register?", says lawyer Alain Arsenault, who defends the victims in both appeals.
The collective appeal that has just been filed has particular implications for the addition of complainants to any institution where abuses could have been committed by members of the congregation of Saint-Croix.
At present, the appeal brings together the complaints of 25 people who claim to have been attacked by the St. Croix brothers.
The alleged facts are generally older than those mentioned in the first appeal, as several of the institutions concerned closed their doors in the 1960s.
The appeal also points out that the congregation of Saint-Croix and the oratory of Saint-Joseph, who is a separate entity, "allowed sexual abuse against children", that they "exercise moral, religious and psychological pressure on the victims", that they "were aware of and yet were subjected to sexual abuse", and that they "stupidly and deliberately chose to ignore the problem".
These recent accusations are based, among other things, on letters written by the lawyer of the Saint-Croix brothers, Me Emile Perrin, in the 1990s, but also on research in the archives in this regard by Brother Wilson Kennedy, an old brother of Saint-Croix, who publicly denounced the abuses.
The collective appeal must first pass the stage of admissibility in the Supreme Court.
Once the Court has accepted the admissibility, the second step is to be taken, i.e. hearings on the basis.
In the case of the first appeal, the congregation of St. Croix had agreed to settle with the friendly before hearings were held on the ground.
An important fire in a trade
A fire seriously damaged a trade in LaSale's surroundings in Montreal on Thursday night to Friday.
The reliefs were called at 1:00 p.m. on Friday, due to a fire that had been declared on the ground floor of an Indian cuisine restaurant on the Dollar Avenue, near the intersection with the Réjane Street.
The 30 firemen who were sent to the sites spent almost an hour in controlling the brasier.
The fire "caused significant damage to the structure of the building", said the head of operations of the Fire Safety Service in Montreal, Richard Bordeaux.
The cause of the fire was unknown, but there was no one at the restaurant when the firemen arrived on the scene.
There were no injured persons, but almost twenty dwellings, located on the first and second floors of this range of commercial premises, had to be evacuated.
The Red Cross was requested, as residents of one of the apartments might have to be temporarily accommodated, the SIM said.
Many opposition to medical help to die at the Congress of Palliative Care
The Canadian Congress of Palliative Care, which is taking place this week in Ottawa, takes place a few days after the vote in favour of the principle of the Bill on Medical Assistance to Die in Quebec.
This is an opportunity for several palliative care associations to reaffirm their disagreement.
If all patients had access to effective care to alleviate their suffering, in addition to being able to stay at home, very few of them would want to end their days, according to a spokesman of the Canadian Palliative Care Association, Maryse Bouvette.
If we focus on palliative care in Canada, the euthanasia approach would become minimal.
The President of the Québec Palliative Care Network also rejects the bill on medical assistance to die.
If adopted, Alberte Déry is concerned about the consequences of the next generation.
"What is the meaning of life," she laments.
The majority of palliative care homes will refuse to help patients die, according to the Vice-President of the Palliative Care Alliance, Suzanne Fitzback.
Ms. Fitzback, also director of the Mathieu-Froment-Savoie house in Gatineau, believes that the service would be unnecessary.
We're never asked, "I want to die, give me an injection."
The director of the Ontario Association of Palliative Care, Rick Firth, believes that the Quebec Bill detracts the population from the vocation of palliative care.
He doesn't think Ontario will take the step.
On the other hand, the Liberal Member of Gatineau, Stéphanie Vallée, said that the concept of the end of life should be clarified before the bill was adopted.
Kenyan press announces controversial media law
"It is a defiant country and it is legitimate to ask the following question: what will prevent Parliament from valuing the independence of the judicial system tomorrow?" said the newspaper in opposition to the bill and asking it to be declared unconstitutional.
"This law is draconian and very punitive, and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, Director General of Capital Group, owner of CapitalFM, one of the most respected independent news Internet stations and websites in Kenya.
He said that the new media court "will always be partial because it is an extension of the government" and that restrictions on content and advertising would harm Kenya in the global economy.
"I hope the President will listen to us, and we ask him to reject this bill and to refer it back to the parliamentarians," he added.
According to The Star, the new bill will allow the government to "run the media". The Standard stated, as far as it is concerned, that democracy and freedom of opinion in Kenya had "suddenly suffered a blow" and speeded up the bill as a "draconian".
The adoption of the bill takes place at the same time as a train of measures to strengthen national security in the silviage of the attack by armed Islamists at the Westgate shopping centre last September.
The Kenyans media have aroused the anger of the authorities by spreading video surveillance camera images on which the troops deployed on the scene of the attack were disrupting the luxury shopping centre.
The chief of police, David Kimaiyo, responded by summoning two journalists and a media officer to interrogate them, although the summons was withdrawn as a result of a raise in the media.
Under the new bill, the media may be subject to fines of up to 20 million shillings kyans and journalists up to 1 million with the additional risk of being "radiated" or no longer being able to receive official press accreditation.
The court also has the power to seize the property of an offender if he has not paid his fine.
According to the Daily Nation, "even one fine is enough to paralyze most FM stations".
He also said that measures could have a devastating effect on what he described as Kenya's "animal blogosphere".
By reducing the media to silence, political men know that they can do what they want without impunity.
"No one will ever know," wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist at The Nation, describing Kenyan media as a key source of control in public life.
"Booked to themselves, political men would make the country fail and bring us back to hunting and collecting."
The Kenyan legislators were the target of the people's anger in the past.
In May, they took a stand against the cuts ordered by the National Wages Commission and restored their Mirobollant Wages of approximately 532,000 shillings per tax-free month – which are among the highest in the world.
A tough year for pharmacists
The departure of nearly 10 pharmacists at the Laval Health and Social Services Centre (CSSS) caused a whole smile at the direction of the Hospital de la Cité-la-Santé, which took place in 2012-2013.
Due to multiple departures to retirement, maternity leave or short departures, the pharmaceutical department has found itself very weak in staff.
Almost 30% of the necessary staff were missing, making this financial year "very difficult", according to Department Chief Gillian Beaudet.
However, the CSSS decided not to engage in independent work, which can cost up to three times as much as a full-time pharmacist.
We didn't use the police, Mrs. Beaudet explained.
We have rationalized or reduced some of our activities within the flooring facility, the time that things are being replaced.
Of course, we have worked hard to interest our young [pharmaceutical residents] so that they come and stay here.
There was a competition of circumstances that made us in a bad situation last year.
Improved situation
After this hard period, the year 2013-2014 is much easier announced for the Department of Pharmacy of the CSSS.
Already, three pharmacists have returned to work after their maternity leave and three other pharmacists have been hired in the last few months.
In addition, the Department's efforts to retain fruit have been successful, as the four students currently residing in Laval have also decided to remain in the employment of the CSSS.
Now it's much better, the pharmacist said.
By the end of the financial year, we will have seven new pharmacists and three maternity returns.
This will therefore complete our departures last year.
ever-increasing needs
However, the situation remains delicate.
Several factors, such as the shortage of hospital pharmacists or the prevalence of young women in the profession, make it difficult to predict situations such as her life in 2012.
For us [the number of staff] is always careful, because we have a young environment and we employ a lot of young women, so with the bridesmaids, we almost always roll on three maternity leave when it's okay, has she added.
Last year, there was much more and there were no pharmacists available to make replacements, so it was more difficult.
The top 22-year-old model does not start her career in the cinema through the small door.
The director Lars von Trier chose him to incarner Charlotte Gainsbourg young in Nymphomaniac, his next film.
This original porn drama, in eight chapters that will come out in two parts (January 1 and 8, 2014), is the erotic memories of a four-year-old adult from her adolescence.
Stacy Martin's look with his age is striking: a brothel silhouette, a diaphane tent and Franco-English origins.
Without forgetting a certain taste of risk: the one who had not hesitated to put a nude on the ice paper will appear in much more sulphurous situations on the large screen.
An extract of Nymphomaniac caused the temperature to rise on the screen: Stacy Martin appears in the bed and in full ecstasy with Shia LaBeouf.
If the provocative filmmaker asked his actors to put their powder on the plate, he used X professionals for the most ossier sex scenes before merging all the bodies digitally: above the belt, it is the star; below, the double.
From Björk to Charlotte Gainsbourg, passing through Nicole Kidman, Lars von Trier is used to pushing his actresses in their last retreats, always for the best.
Stacy Martin hasn't finished talking about her.
A CGR room in Narbonne evacuated Thursday night
On Thursday evening, the first session of a film was interrupted in the Mega CGR of Narbonne, as a precaution, as a result of punctuations on the throat felt by the spectators.
Immediately, the head of the facility had the room evacuated and the firefighters were prevented for a suspicious smell.
About 70 people left the meeting.
The persons were examined and full recognition of the room gave nothing.
Bad joke on the bottom of a lacremogenic jet?
Or an involuntary incident?
Still, the film management has played the precautionary and security principle of its clients.
The room was aired and everything was back in order.
The cinema was able to resume its rights and the customers found the pleasure of the images.
On screen only.
It tries to import 2 kg of cocaine into lemons
On Halloween, a woman tried to get two kilos of cocaine dissimilated into the country in citricles, Thursday morning, at Montréal-Trudeau airport.
It was during the examination of the passenger's luggage that the drug could be detected.
Cocaine had been divided into three lemons that had been previously emptied.
The drug was then transported to the office of the Royal Canadian Gendarmerie (RCC) who took the lead in this investigation.
The Canadian Border Services Agency (ASFC) did not reveal where the woman arrived when she was intercepted.
This is part of the investigation, said Jacqueline Roby, CBSA spokesperson.
What I can tell you is that she arrived in the country.
Since the beginning of 2013, border services at the airport of Montreal-Trudeau have carried out 173 drug seizures, including 10 cocaine seizures for a total of 44 kilograms.
In 2012, border services officers in the Quebec region carried out a total of 1653 drug arrests.
Air raid on military facilities in Syria
According to the Lebanese army, Israeli aircraft entered Lebanese airspace on Wednesday afternoon, but the strikes took place in the evening.
A fleet of short-range SA-8 short-air missiles would have been targeted and destroyed.
This new raid on Tsahal's aviation in Syrian territory (the sixth since the beginning of the year, according to the Israeli daily Haaretz) has not been confirmed by Israel or Syria.
The raid took place in circumstances close to the one that had taken place on July 5th: at that time it was also an anonymous U.S. officer who had confirmed to CNN an Israeli attack, aimed this time at the Sol-Mar Yakhont missiles delivered by Russia to Damascus.
Israeli officials did not hide their irritation to see Washington reveal the attack, at the risk of forcing President Assad to react.
Ukraine approaches failure
The Standard & Poor's rating agency has reduced Ukraine's solvency rating on Friday, questioning the ability of the former Soviet Republic, in recession for more than a year, to meet its financial obligations.
The country's public debt rating goes to "B-", falling into the category of speculative investments.
It is accompanied by a negative perspective, the S&P seeing at least one chance of three that it will be reduced again by one year.
"It is less and less likely that the government strategy will ensure enough foreign currency to meet its high external funding needs," explains the US agency.
The Agency notes that Ukraine's exchange reserves fell by 26 per cent between September 2012 and September 2013 and foresees that the trend will continue.
This complicates the reimbursement of credits received abroad.
These reserves, to which the authorities have repeatedly relied to support the local currency, Hryvnia, sinking, the Agency is increasingly considering an evaluation, which would inflame its external debt.
Kiev also needs liquidity to settle its gas imports to Russia, which accuses him of not paying an invoice of $882 million.
This announcement is a bad news for Ukraine's power in a period of intense tensions with its Russian neighbour, angry with Kiev's willingness to sign an association agreement with the EU at the end of November.
It was made public at the time of publication of official statistics showing that the country's economy had reached its fifth quarter between July and September as a result of the contract.
Its relatively modest end-up over the past few years, and S&P estimated at 33.5% of GDP, compared with less than 10% before the 2008-2009 crisis.
The country, in its budget deficit, has been calling for months for the assistance of the International Monetary Fund, which had given it $15.3 billion in 2010 and has now only disbursed $3.4 billion.
However, the Fund refuses to pay any new instalment until the country has adopted non-popular reforms to reduce its deficit, including by increasing gas prices to the population.
As a result of a new infertile mission in the country, the IMF found this week that "the important external financing needs" constituted "vulnerability", while the relevant "signs of economic improvement".
However, for economist Oleksandr Joloud of the Centre for Political Studies, "a short-term improvement cannot be expected".
"There is little hope that unpopular reforms will be launched in a pre-election year," the 2015 presidential elections are scheduled, according to the expert, who was questioned by the AFP.
The only hope is an improvement in the international economy.
S&P also refers to the "insecurity" associated with the possible signing of an association agreement between Ukraine and the EU, which Brussels conditionals on the release of the opponent Ioulia Timochenko.
"Signing the agreement would be positive for long-term trade, but there could be negative consequences in short and medium-term terms related to Russia's reaction," explained S&P, who is afraid of Moscow's "commercial restrictions".
Russia, which represents the fourth of Ukrainian exports, has provided that in the event of the establishment of a free trade zone between the EU and Kiev, it should strengthen its border controls on imported goods.
Green fire from the United States to the Publicis-Omnicom merger
Publicis and Omnicom said on Friday that they had received no objection from the US authorities to their merger, thus drawing closer to the creation of the first global advertising agency.
The merger is approaching the second world agency, Omnicom, and the third, Publicis.
"Omnicom Group and Publicis Group today announced the expiry of the period of review of the merger previously announced by Publicis Group and Omnicom, provided by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended", both groups announce in a communiqué.
They state that they have also received the necessary authorizations in Canada, India and Turkey, after South Africa and South Korea.
The expiry of the review period provided for by the HRR in the United States and the authorisation decisions issued in other jurisdictions meet several of the conditions required for the execution of the operation.
"The merger is also conditional on the acquisition of other regulatory authorities and the approval of shareholders of the two groups," they add.
The Congolese Army persecutes the M23 rebels
The Congolese Army (FARDC) announced on Thursday that its units were going to prosecute the M23 rebels to their bases in the forests and mountains of North Kivu border of Rwanda and Uganda.
The M23 appears at the point of being beaten after being chased out of the northeastern parts of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) that he had been in control of the insurrection since the beginning, 20 months ago.
"We're going to continue the M23 and we're going to bury it wherever it's hidden because it's criminals," Colonel Olivier Hamuli, spokesperson for FARDC, told Reuters.
We must not allow them to be reorganized because they have been martyring the Congolese people for too long.
Time has come to restore peace.
M23 officials explained that they had evacuated the premises under diplomatic pressure and Bertrand Bissimwa, the political leader of the rebellion, said on RFI that these military coups would not alter his claims in anything to peace talks.
The latter, according to Ugandan mediators, resumed Wednesday in Kampala between the government of Kinshasa and M23.
Crochets are reported in the hills that dominate Bunagana, the last location at the hands of the insurgents to be fallen this week, as well as around Runyoni, a hill where the M23 rebellion saw the day in 2012.
At their insurgent in November, the insurgents occupied Goma, the head of the province of North Kivu, taking advantage of the escape from the Government Garrison and the passivity of the blue helmets of Monusco.
The fall of Goma has led the United Nations Mission to RDC, the world's most important in terms of staff, to strengthen its mandate and to form a rapid intervention brigade composed of South African, Malawian and Tanzanian soldiers.
On the other hand, the FARDC's major state of affairs has been remanded and the army has turned to the offensive against the M23, changing the course of the war.
The pace of progress of government troops is unprecedented today.
"The M23 seems to reach its end," predicts a Congolese business expert, Jason Stearns, on his blog Congo Siasa.
This would be historical - this would be the first time the Kinshasa government managed to defeat a major insurrection.
And it would also be the first time since 1996 that no armed group in Rwanda would be present in the east of the DRC.
United Nations experts accuse Rwanda, which strongly refuses to support the M23 military, which is the departure of Mutiny Congolese former Congolese military personnel.
The head of British diplomacy, William Hague, invited Rwandan President Paul Kagame to give evidence of detention, announced a spokesman for the Foreign Office.
Last week, Kigali had mentioned the possibility of military reprisals as a result of obscura in Rwandan territory.
On Wednesday, the inhabitants of Bunagana invaded the streets of the bourgeoisie to welcome the entry of the FARDC soldiers.
"We lived with the M23 for one year and it seemed unimaginable to us to be one day released by the army," says a resident of this border town of Uganda.
"We lived in terror (from M23), we were traumatized," he added.
The tests carried out by the Pasteur Institute on a patient suspected of being coronavirus infected were negative, the Ministry of Health announced.
It states that "the two cases identified in May 2013 therefore remain the only two cases confirmed in France to date".
On Tuesday, this 43-year-old patient was suspected of being reached, after returning from Saudi Arabia, a country where the disease had already caused 50 deaths.
Chevron, the second US oil company, reported a fall in its quarterly profit on Friday as a result of the decline in its refining margins, while its oil and gas production increased while still withdrawing from the group's objectives.
Its net profit for the third quarter decreased to $4.95 billion, or $2.57 per action, compared with $5.25 billion, or $2.69 per action, a year ago.
Reuters respondents averaged $2.71 in profit.
The group produced 2.59 million barrels of oil equivalent per day during the quarter, rising from 2.52 million bpj produced a year ago.
The company targets 2.65 million bpj for this year, with a 25% increase in production expected by 2017.
Most of the growth in the coming years will come from its natural gas projects liquefied in Australia.
Because of the cost of these projects, annual investment expenditures have increased by $7 billion in two years and should reach $36.7 billion in 2013.
The benefits of production activities decreased slightly in the third quarter, while the profits of downstream activities (including refining and chemical production) fell from $45% to $380 million.
This decline in refining margins affects the entire sector.
Thus Chevron's main competitor, Exxon Mobil reported a net down profit on Thursday, despite the increase in its gas and oil production.
School transport: the complaint deemed admissible
The Sherbrooke School Commission (CSRS) has been demanding from the beginning of the school year the cost of $150 per student (up to a maximum of $300 per family) for students in two-resident school transport, a service provided by the organization when it is able to do so.
Before the last budget changes, no financial contribution was claimed.
"There is a mediation service that is proposed by the committee and I was interested," explains Mrs. Lefèvre.
According to her, CSR was invited to a mediation and she asked for an additional time to reflect on it.
"It's always better to talk about it, concert and find solutions," says Mrs. Lefèvre.
The Sherbrooke School Commission (CSRS) did not wish to comment.
The organization only meant that mediation was part of the process in a complaint.
Imbroglio around the closure of the emergency of the Hotel-Dieu
Faced with the background of several months by a number of staff and several trade unions, including the CGT, the Minister of Health Marisol Touraine, decided on 10 July to "decelerate the implementation schedule of the project, and in particular the date of closure of the emergencies that will not occur on 4 November".
An official application was made "to avoid risking the emergency in Paris at the beginning of the winter" but also aimed not to generate the PS campaign within a few months of the municipalities.
Despite the departmental instructions, the closure should still be effective at that date.
Even if APHP prefers to use the term "transformation" or "change in continuity".
As of 4 November, firefighters who would provide about a quarter of the 40,000 annual crossings at the Hotel-God emergency will all have received to report 30 serious cases per day to the emergency of other Parisian hospitals.
This date of 4 November also corresponds to the renewal of the hospital.
At the Hotel-Dieu, emergency specialties will be placed on Monday to five general medical services.
With regard to the transfer of internal medical beds, it is programmed for the current of the month.
"The hotel-God's emergency reception service must be closed as soon as possible, and for us, it is November 4th," says Loïc Capron, president of the APHP Medical Commission, who supports the project of management.
"On November 4, there will be no more patients brought by firemen, only those who come by their own means," says Professor Jean-Yves Fagon, the medical officer of the new Hotel-God.
"But we will continue to welcome patients in an emergency," he said, using the permanent presence of SMUR vehicles on site to transfer serious cases.
Senior emergency doctors will remain in place, as well.
But it is for the ARS to decide on the closure of the emergency reception service.
"The things are going on gradually," answers Nicolas Peju, spokesman for the ARS for which, on 4 November, "there will be no change in terms of service made."
"The Minister lied to us or we lied to him," laments the urgent physician Gerald Kierzek.
Permission from its SMUR Chief's post at the beginning of July to have led the front against the reorganization project is defined as a "warning launcher" against a "cynic" decision made by "the medical-administrative technology".
"They're emptying and asphyxiating the emergencies that were renewed less than five years ago," he says.
For him, "if other Parisian emergency services could absorb the surplus, there would be no problem."
However, they are regularly consumed.
For example, there are sometimes nine hours of waiting for the Lariboisière emergencies.
At ARS, it is stated that thirty "disposed" patients on several sites are not at risk of representing an "avalanche" in other emergency services, whose human resources will have been strengthened.
At ARS as well as APHP, the "new hospital model" has already been launched since 7 October and should continue to host 30,000 to 35,000 patients per year.
By the end of the year, liberal generalist physicians should also participate in the establishment of an "permanence of ambulatory care".
"Where do we go if people are asked to self-diagnosis?"Gérald Kierzek asks why "the concept of non-serious emergency" is "dangerous" and marks a "medical regression".
This will happen as for Level 3 maternity.
People aren't crazy, they're going where there's the best care offer.
If the Minister does not take action by Monday, we will change our arm, Christophe Prudhomme, an emergency doctor and a member of the CGT Health.
We will be even more present as part of the municipal campaign and we will consider presenting a list.
In the Nathalie Koscisko-Morizet team, Vincent Roger, Paris' UMP adviser and elected 4th roundabout, clearly announces that "even though the Parisian UMP was for the maintenance of the emergencies at the Hotel-God, it would be technically and financially impossible to reopen them if we returned to our responsibilities".
Anne Hidalgo, the PS candidate, recalled again Monday morning on France Inter that she had spoken in favour of a moratorium so that there was no closure on 4 November.
If that were the case, she would mark her net disagreement, points out Bruno Julliard, her spokesperson.
Although the restructuring of the Hotel-God has its legitimacy on the ground, we cannot accept it without an acceptable plan of transfer to the other hospitals.
Obama stops listening to the IMF and the World Bank
Barack Obama ordered the National Security Agency (NSA) to put an end to its hearings on the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank as part of its information activities, says an American manager, Thursday.
This decision is part of the White House's attempt to resume hand in the NSA's hearings after the revelations made by former analyst Edward Snowden, who fled to Russia.
This is the first time the IMF and the World Bank monitoring has been mentioned by the Information Agency since the start of the scandal.
Inquired about this, a U.S. government official replied: "The United States does not conduct electronic surveillance at the headquarters of the World Bank and the IMF in Washington."
Expressing itself under the cover of the anonymity, this responsibility did not specify whether such monitoring had been carried out in the past.
Another official indicated that Barack Obama had ordered that these practices be stopped in the past weeks.
This instruction was given at almost the same time as ending the United Nations headquarters in New York.
In this context, the Senate Information Commission approved on Thursday a strengthening of controls on government monitoring programmes but allowed them to continue.
The Commission has introduced new restrictions on the data that information agencies are authorized to collect and has imposed a five-year limit for the retention of this information.
The United Nations welcomes the new goals for the fight against poverty
The United Nations is currently working on a new set of goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which had been put in place 12 years ago to combat poverty in the world.
Australian diplomats have played a key role in the development of “sustainable development goals” to replace MDGs, which will expire in 2015, before the United Nations Summit on Sustainable Development, which began to monitor Rio de Janeiro.
They were included in the final draft document, which will be adopted by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on the watch of the summit that it was now time to "exceed national interests".
"I am happy that the Member States have agreed to launch and adapt the process to set universal sustainable development goals (SDGs)," he added.
The MDGs will build on the progress made under the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will do my utmost to fulfil the mandate given to me by the Member States to achieve our vision of the sustainable development goals based on the success of the MDGs.
The concern about security in Mozambique grows at the same time as conflicts erupt among powerful personalities
At the feet of the statue of Samora Machel, the founder president of Mozambique, while touching them, thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo to scan peaceful slogans during a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace back; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, Director-General of an investment company.
Concerned about the future of her country, she exchanged her work clothes against a tea-shirt with the mention of "we want security" in Portuguese before joining the crowd gathered at the site of the Independence of Thursday capital.
For two weeks, there have been almost every day of reports of conflicts between government forces and Renamo, the worst attachments since the peace agreement that was signed more than 20 years ago.
The Renamo was once a famous rebel movement, supported at the start by the white-controlled Rhodesia and then the South African apartheid government as part of its efforts to destabilize the independent government of the country.
After a peace agreement signed in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country should not fall into an open conflict, but recent events have shaken foreign investors and the local population.
The issue is considerable for the growing economy as the discovery of huge reserves of offshore gas and carbon deposits in the northwest could attract more than $50 billion of investments in the coming years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale du Brazil, Eni d'Italia and Anadarko of the United States.
Frelimo, the party to power and the main political force since 1975, and Renamo, each other, have been held accountable for the tensions.
Renamo states that the government is at the origin of recent confrontations and that it launched an attack on its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional base of Renamo, on 17 October.
The attacks on the former rebels then degenerate when government forces attacked the bases of Renamo and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, and Fernando Mazanga, the spokesman of the Renamo, according to the Financial Times.
The Government makes Renamo responsible for triggering the conflicts, and the charge of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has sought to minimize the concerns about instability.
Mr. Guebuza said on Wednesday to AFP, the French press agency, that Mr. Dhlakama considered himself a "lost" who wanted to use "all the strength he had left to try to prove that he could impose his decisions on the government".
Frelimo and Renamo insist that they both want to avoid war.
But the concern grew after Mr. Mazanga said that Renamo had abandoned the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the FT that he meant that the agreement was no longer respected by Frelimo.
"We want to resume negotiations, but with the greatest seriousness," said Mr. Mazanga.
The previous discussions between the parties have failed to reconcile the tensions fuelled by a series of conflicts this year.
"These are two big men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who don't stop arguing," explained Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the open and specialist university in Mozambique.
None of them know how to negotiate and none of them are ready to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, who is in favour of electoral reforms, had already said that she would boycott the municipal elections due to take place in November.
Presidential and legislative elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted its use of force as an attempt by a sick movement to obtain concessions and a war treasure on the part of the government.
The share of the fundraisings collected by Renamo has continued to decline since 1992, while a new party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), which was created by a former member of Renamo, is expected to receive a greater number of fundraisings to the elections.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Guebuza – who should withdraw at the end of his second term next year – wanted to destroy democracy in the country.
"He doesn't want a multi-party democracy, he doesn't want transparent elections, he doesn't want peace because he doesn't want to leave the presidency," Mr. Mazanga said.
We do not know exactly what the capacity of Renamo is, but it has led to alarming light attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major north-south motorway.
Most of the hangings took place in the province of Sofala, which is located hundreds of kilometres north of Maputo, but where Beira is located, the port where mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, export coal.
In June, Rio was no longer able to use the railway for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the railway line.
Mr. Mazanga was wrongly shy when he was asked if Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted to "warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique," said Mr. Mazanga.
The instability has strengthened the frustrations of the government, says Fernando Lima, director of Mediacoop, an independent media company, many people are also concerned about corruption, slow development and the recent wave of kidnappings.
"People think that the country's future leaders are the government and the president, and it's the latter to find solutions to the problems," he explained.
Omar Sultuane, a protestant, said that people only wanted stability.
"No one cares about Renamo or Frelimo, they just want to find peace, they want free access to the streets," he added.
Myths and legends should be taught to children as "life-style models", says the author.
The Legend of Thor could show that "the brutal force does not make the weight of subtle Russia," while the Arthur legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
Saying that many myths would be "very violent, very scandalous and in some cases too obscenous to be taught at school", Crossley-Holland recommended a "minimum selection" of works adapted to age.
"I find it amazing that myths and folklore are already part of education in America," he said.
I've been complaining about this project for 20 years.
He added that the fact that the authors and teachers are "openly teaching" makes children "decouple completely", the messages being "sublimated" in pleasant stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from the Anglo-Saxon and wrote The Penguin Book of Norse Myths and British Folk Tales, said: "You may have good intentions, but you will prefer to keep them out of sight."
Perhaps the great difference between an adult author who writes for adults and an adult author who writes for children is the need to offer hope.
Not that everything must be simplified or finished well, but there is an innate sense of good and evil.
And it must be highlighted; revealed through a story rather than declared.
The known basis of what we show and what we don't say.
One of Hamas' army fighters was killed tonight and another wounded by an Israeli car shot in the Gaza Strip, learned from medical and security sources in Gaza.
According to these sources, these activists carried out a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian territory and Israel when they had been exposed to an Israeli shield.
NSA espionage: the United States is "going too far", admits Kerry
The United States has sometimes gone "too far" in the field of espionage, acknowledged the Secretary of State John Kerry, in this first Washington-wide debate with Europe on the massive data collection by the National Security Agency (NSA).
After ten days of scandal, revelation and slander between the United States and their European allies, it is the first time that an American government official explicitly admits the practices disputed in the perception of communications and data by the NSA in Europe.
"In some cases, I grant it to you, as the President has done, some of these actions have gone too far and we will make sure that this will not happen any more in the future," said John Kerry at a conference in London which he has been participating since Thursday, October 31, by video.
In his re-transmitted intervention, in the presence of British counterpart William Hague, the head of the American diplomacy has long justified information and information collection practices through the necessary counter-terrorism and the prevention of possible attacks.
Referring to the attacks of 11 September 2001, the attacks of Madrid in March 2004 and those of London in July 2005, John Kerry assured the American authorities that many attacks had been committed, thanks to the interception of communications and the collection of information.
"We have actually prevented planes from falling down, buildings from exploding and people being killed, because we were able to be aware of these projects," the American diplomat argued.
And, John Kerry said at the address of the Europeans, "I assure you that innocent people have not been misled in this process."
But we are trying to collect information.
"And yes, in some cases, it went too far in an inappropriate way," said the Secretary of State, who had already expressed himself on this international scandal during a tour last week in Paris, London and Rome.
He assured Thursday night that President Obama was "resolved to try to clarify and that he was conducting a review of these practices so that no one would feel wrong".
But the controversy between Americans and Europeans has continued this week with new revelations in the press.
According to Washington Post, the NSA intercepted hundreds of millions of Google and Yahoo users.
The paper, which cites the documents obtained from the former NSA consultant Edward Snowden, states that the program "MUSCULAR", and conducted with the British counterpart of the NSA, GCHQ, allows these two agencies to recover data from the optical fibers used by Internet giants.
One of the documents believed that some 181 million items had been collected during the last month of January alone - ranging from metadata on e-mails, text items or audio or video documents.
These interceptions would take place outside the United States.
But Yahoo and Google have refused any connection to these practices.
For ten days, several major newspapers in France, Germany, Spain or Italy have revealed that the NSA would have received massive interception of data and communications from allies of the United States and their leaders, including the German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Faced with the anger of European states and while leaks in the American press claimed that the American President was not aware of such hearings, Barack Obama refused to express himself on this subject, calling for national security.
On the other hand, the patron of the powerful NSA, General Keith Alexander, has denied him that his intelligence agency has captured tens of millions of communications from European citizens.
He even referred the ball to European information services that would have seized these communications before providing them to the NSA.
This would be "military operations" in countries where these Otan allies cooperated with the United States and this would not mean Europe at all, General Alexander said.
And the debate extended to Asia on Friday.
Indonesia has convened the Ambassador of Australia, whose mission is accused of being used by the Americans as part of a vast international spying network that has also caused China to suffer.
The Paris Saint-Germain will receive Lorient on Friday without his master's attachment, the Swedish Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who is injured, announces the League 1 club in a communiqué.
The PSG, the leader of the championship in front of Monaco in contrast to the targets, has circulated the list of players held for this 12th day match, with no 32-year-old attacker.
The communiqué simply indicates that he is "damaged", without specifying the nature of the injury.
However, he suffered from a left knee inflammation when he returned from his selection, at the beginning of months.
A memorial ceremony of the cremated dead
At 11 a.m., Father Lachaise's crematorium organizes a lay ceremony, in memory of all those who have been cremated in his institution during the year.
Anne Hidalgo, a socialist candidate at the Paris mayor's office, must attend and then explain his funeral proposals at a press conference.
To follow the ceremony, click above.
For their own sakes, more and more French choose cremation, rather than inhalation: 53%, according to a study by Ipsos on 6 and 7 September with 1009 people, instead of 47%.
The opposite is the case for neighboring obsessions: the French prefer inhalation (53% vs. 47%).
If they have the misfortune of losing a child, they are only 15% to choose the cremation.
In his book La Mort en cedres, Damien Le Guay, philosopher and vice-president of the National Ethics Committee of the Funeral, emphasizes the "violent" which constitutes cremation for survivors.
There is, with the cremation, "a violence committed to the loved body", which will be "reduced to a heap of ashes" in very little time, and not after a process of decomposition, which would "comfort the phases of mourning".
There is also "a symbolic violence", which holds to the "cleaning of singularity and distinctive signs" reduced to the "anonymity" of ashes.
Why is what is accepted without penalty in some Nordic and Protestant countries still poorly lived in France?
"Because the cremation is a new fact," answers Marie-Frédérique Bacqué, president of the Society of Heatology and author of the book Approve death.
It has only been tolerated by the Catholic Church since 1963, which has limited its attempts to improvise it.
It is for François Michaud-Nérard, Director General of the Funeral Services of the City of Paris, to arrange for the deceased a ceremony as dignified as the one he would be entitled to with an inhumanation.
The annual survey of Ipsos shows a very strong commitment to the organization of the ceremony.
77% of French people want to be religious (53%) or civil (24%) for their relatives.
Now 73% of those who have chosen a cremation want to organize a ceremony.
66% of atheists or non-believers also want it.
The crematoriums have adapted to this evolution of society.
"For a decade, they've been trying to avoid violence from their families, without doing anything, for an hour and a half, immediately followed by the return of ashes," observes Michaud-Nérard.
70 per cent of the institutions are now offering ceremony masters, who, in the presence of the body, perform the following ritual: host the assembly, appoint the deceased, link him to others, bring him up, make sense to his death, organize the adjudication.
This has been the case in the crematorium of Father Lachaise since 1998.
The ceremony masters are often people who have converted.
There are also former Catholic priests.
In this context, the Crématorium of Father Lashaise has organized, since 2010, the day of La Toussaint, several commemorative, secular and non-religious ceremonies, to which he invites the families of people who have been cremated this year.
For the second consecutive year, one of these ceremonies is retransmission in line, with the attention of those who could not make the move.
The crematorium has allowed us to relax.
In La Seyne, the relogation due to rats turns to controversy
At the beginning of the week, a family left their apartment on the ground floor of the Fructador D2 building because of the presence of rats.
In view of the urgency of the situation, the Director of the South Habitat Land Office proposed, in an exceptional and provisional manner, that the couple and their three children be re-logged in a new T4.
However, the family refuses "for financial reasons" and the situation is blocked.
The case took excessive proportions, according to Joël Canapa, the director of the office.
There have always been rats in the cities.
The deratization company carries out two shifts a year, and in addition, we intervene, at our own expense, at every request of the inhabitants.
We have thus made 64 interventions since the end of last winter.
The neighborhood is not abandoned, and rats do not pulverize in the city.
For reasons of environmental protection and public health, deratization products are four times less effective than in the past, certainly, but for two rats, a cat will not be killed.
"We didn't invite rats at our house," says the family father who left his home to settle in the hotel.
We are soon without the floor and we expect a new apartment, at the same rate as the old one.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange is down by 0.88%, News
The Tokyo Stock Exchange ended on Friday despite good Chinese manufacturing statistics.
The rating was due to the decline of the dollar against the yen, which was detrimental to export values and to the warning of its annual result launched by Sony on Thursday.
Nikkei lost 126.37 points (0.88%) to 14 201.57 and Topix gave 11.23 points (0.94%) to 1,183.33.
Sony dropped from over 11% to 1,668 yen.
A house of the flame-flaming in the Vieux-Québec
A fire that started on Friday afternoon in Vieux-Quebec was quickly controlled.
More than 30 firemen were sent to 9 on Hebert Street.
The flames were reported in a three-storey house on four floors behind the Québec Seminary Court.
All the tenants were absent during the fire.
The fire was controlled one hour after the fires arrived, which were many to intervene.
As soon as our first firemen arrived, they really saw smoke.
"Then the alarms happened because it took strength to attack the building, because there are buildings collected here," explained France Loiselle, spokesperson for the Québec firemen.
An investigation is under way to find the cause of the fire.
Ben Greenman : Tenth anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival : The New Yorker
It could be said that the city of New York is the place where the stand-up was born in America: almost 100 years ago, the actor of the Vaudville Frank Fay, who held the role of ceremony master at the Palace Theatre, on Broadway, began to tell jokes directly before the public, about the tone of the conversation.
Fay's innovation lasted over the years, until it was resumed more recently by the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and supervised by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the standing-up club Carolines, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than 60 shows presented in small clubs and major theatres.
"Most of the showheads emerged in Carolina, and they had a great success, until they became too famous to play in a club," said Hirsch.
We created this festival in order to be able to continue working with them.
The event this year will see the participation of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher and the presentation of "Stand Up for Heroes", a comedy and music evening for the benefit of former fighters, organized in Madison Square Garden, to which Bruce Springstein, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby will be present.
The festival took on a wide range, as did the comedy world.
Several comedians participating in this year's festival were held through non-traditional circuits, such as small TV shows such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll made his appearance on the front of the scene in a sitcom on a cable chain ("The League") on the theme of the fancy football happily lascife of the FXX chain) and now has his own show of sketches on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate participated in the "Saturday Night Live" show and was part of the casting of the series "parks and Recreation", but she is still more known for her viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On".
Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comedians with a single voice (the surrealist pessimist Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic defender of racial justice W. Kamau Bell), are pure products from the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the main attraction factors of the festival this year will be an interview: David Steinberg discussing with Larry David.
Steinberg started as a stand-up comedian, but he became a film and television director, as well as an official comedy historian.
Between 2005 and 2007, he hosted a TV show on Land called Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg.
The meeting is held at the Hotel de Ville, downtown Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in the comical DNA of Larry's entire work," said Steinberg.
He told me that when he was here, sometimes he went down a street between two buildings and said, "Eh well, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll come live here.
The oil price continues to drop and approaches $96 per barrel
The price of oil continued to decline on Friday, while concerns about the importance of stocks were compounded by a report showing that the Chinese Gourman manufacturing industry in electricity is increasing.
The US gross reference price for delivery in December dropped from $14.24 to $96.24 per barrel at the end of the morning in Europe during electronic exchanges on New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).
The contract lost 39 cents on Thursday, leaving it at a drop of 5.8% for the month of October.
The abundant supply of crude oil has weighed on the price over the last few weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy reported on Wednesday that US supplies had increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over five weeks, supplies increased by over 25 million barrels.
But two reports on the Chinese manufacturing sector arrived on Friday, which showed an increase in activity, suggested an increase in demand.
This suggests that China's economic recovery could continue to grow after growth rose to 7.8% in the third quarter, after a decline that had not been known for two decades in the previous quarter.
Gross Brent, a reference to the international gross already used by American refineries, has lost 26 cents to $108.58 the barrel on the Inter-Continental Exchange (ICE) in London.
Withdrawal of the right to abortion in Texas
A federal court of appeal restored some restrictions on the right of voluntary abortion in Texas that had been blocked by a judge of first instance this week.
This judgment means that a legislative text adopted in July in that State and widely challenged the right to abortion will enter into force.
The court's ruling means that doctors who will practise IVG will have a "admission privilege" at local hospitals.
The privilege of admission is the right of a doctor, by virtue of his status as a member of a hospital, to admit a patient to a hospital or medical centre in order to issue a diagnosis or treatment.
Defenders of the GIV argue that the content of the law may result in an immediate closure of a third of the state's clinics because these clinics have failed to obtain this "admission privilege" for their practitioners.
In total, it would be nearly 22,000 women who would be deprived of access to these facilities.
On Monday, a court judge had considered on the eve of the entry into force of the law that the provisions dealing with the privilege of admission were anti-constitutional.
But the Attorney General of Texas, Republican Greg Abbott, who is in charge of the governor's office, asked the court of appeal to cancel the judgment of the first instance that blocked the application of the law.
A plenary hearing on this issue is scheduled for January.
The New Star has succeeded in a strong return, alongside hearings, with 1.3 million viewers behind their TV station, or 5.6% of the audience.
But was the show on your rendezvous?
Some 10,000 candidates were present at the hearings of this 10th season to face the jury: Maurane, the wicked Sinclair, the Perché André Manoukian and Olivier Bas.
On Twitter, viewers shared their comments.
After the excitement of finding their favorite program, many were disappointed.
But why so much disappointment?
No candidate seems to have really marked at this first prize.
Like every year, the first auditions deliver a wide selection of grass singers, for the best and sometimes for the worst.
But on Twitter, we want the show, the emotion, the originality, the music...
Fortunately, some found their account.
They are many who have tried the New Star, and sometimes even gone to the end.
Behind TV screens, successful singer vocations are always there, season after season.
Others have just the ambition to make a laugh.
The Court blocks a decision on NYPD's control and investigation policy
A federal court of appeal blocked the decision of a judge requiring changes in the New York Police Department's control and investigation program on Thursday and deposed the case.
The U.S. Court of Appeal (second circuit) indicated that the decision of Judge Shira Scheindlin was suspended until the outcome of the appeal by the city.
The judge had decided in August that the city had violated the Constitution following the implementation of its programme to monitor and question citizens.
The city appealed to its findings and corrective orders, including a decision to assign a controller to help the police department modify its associated training policy and programme.
The Court of Appeal heard the arguments on the application for suspension on Tuesday.
The Court of Appeal stated that the judge had to be deposed of the case because it had violated the code of conduct of the judges by compromising the need for a judge to avoid any appearance of bias, in part due to a series of speeches given to the media and public statements in which it responded publicly to the criticisms of the court.
The judge had found that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by targeting the harm of black men and of Hispanic origin as part of their control and investigation program.
She appointed an external controller to monitor changes, including policy reform, training and supervision, and ordered the establishment of a pilot program to test cameras on the body in areas where the largest number of controls are taking place.
In August, the City of New York agreed to put an end to the practice of preserving the names and addresses of persons whose case is rejected after police check.
The hearing of the city's appeal should take place after March 14, 2014.
The strategy of control and investigation has been criticized by many civil rights defenders.
This control and exploration system has existed for decades in some form, but the number of recorded controls has increased dramatically under the administration of the independent mayor, Michael Bloomberg, to reach its highest historical level in 2011 with 684,330 controls mainly concerning black men and hispanic origin.
A judicial action was introduced in 2004 by four men, all from minorities, and turned into collective action.
Participants proposing changes in the NYPD's monitoring and investigation programme say they will end the wrong practices, make it more effective and reliable police forces, and can change how police departments use the policy.
The opponents say that these changes would undermine police morality without reducing crime, constitute a waste of money, and would not solve the wider problem of police forces under pressure after police officers have been severely reduced over the past decade.
The judge pointed out that it did not put an end to the practices of control and investigation, which are constitutional, but that it reformed the way NYPD implemented its controls.
The tenants have to vote, as each of them pays an average of $100 per month on the price of the accommodation that goes into taxes in the City.
When the owner pays $5,000 in municipal taxes, he divides this amount between each accommodation.
We have to increase rents to help us pay the new taxes.
When we go to vote, we send a clear message.
We need to change things in the City.
All the candidates told us that they would attack the scandalous debt.
We no longer have the means to pay us artificial lights at $100,000, land of $4 to $5 million for where...
Go vote, that's the best way to express yourself and say that's enough.
End of service for the chef of the Elysée
Entered into 500 m2 of the elysene cuisine as a performer after working in embassies, the cook recorded all the steps until he became chief, nine years ago.
He served six French presidents, from Georges Pompidou to François Hollande, passing through Nicolas Sarkozy, including on their vacation places, and fed an incalculable number of people in this world in a quasi-anonymat that he only breaks today, at the time of retirement, at 60 years.
The man with his face opens, skull degarni and intellectual glasses, born 24 October 1953 in Ferté-Saint-Aubin, is the holder of a Pasteurry CAP.
Her mother was herself a cook in a castle of Sologne.
"I have passed from one castle to the other!" irony Bernard Vaussion, who knows not only the hands of the six presidents for whom he has served, but also their wives and some of their illustrative guests.
"It's always the head of the state or his partner or wife who chooses the menus," he recalls.
"Mrs. Chirac was a little more involved, she came directly into the kitchen," to the point that she had forbidden women in the kitchens of Elyssa!
It does not move to Heads of State who were showing a relative indifference to terrestrial food, "they are all gourmets", explains kindly Bernard Vaussion.
Jacques Chirac had certain "a slightly more developed appetite."
But with Nicolas Sarkozy, who had removed the cheese, the dishes came empty!
As for François Hollande, who restored cheese, "there's someone who likes to eat" and "there's no big deal he doesn't like."
The current head of state, who returned the lost kilos before the presidential campaign, has "no request for a specific regime".
Bernard Vaussion also remembers the pressure that weighed on his shoulders, especially at the state dinners at the Elysée: "between 200 and 250 people must be served in about an hour".
The previous night is almost white.
These people wouldn't understand that there were errors.
The former chef of Elysée's kitchens, who took a glass Tuesday night with his team, his family and friends, went with a pint in his heart."François Hollande came to greet me."
He said praise.
"His human side has emerged," he says.
The head will be replaced by his deputy, Guillaume Gomez, 35 years old, who has been for his part for seventeen years at Elysée.
Fire in a house built in 1850 in Quebec
A historic house built in 1850 was the lead of flames in the Vieux-Quebec on Friday afternoon.
The four-bedroom building, located on the 15th Street of Hebert, was alarmed by three fire services.
The fire declared itself in advance, but rose on the three floors of the building.
France Voiselle, spokesperson for the Québec Fire Protection Service, stated that the rapid intervention of firefighters has prevented the spread of fires to adjacent buildings, a large challenge for this area of the city where buildings are built in close proximity.
The burned house sheltered four dwellings, but no tenant was on the spot at the time of the fire.
The damage was all limited, even if the water caused damage.
An investigation will be conducted to determine its origin, but the tastes have deviated from the thesis of a criminal act.
The Wall Street Loup: Out of the second trailer
Martin Scorsese lets out some images of his next film whose title, that of an ambitious New York courtier, is incarcerated by Leonardo DiCaprio.
Forget to be reasonable and get your tickets out.
Leonardo DiCaprio is going to decoy you in his role of trading decoy.
Martin Scorsese tells us the true story of a "long Island Stock Exchange broker who refuses to cooperate with the authorities in a large corruption case in Wall Street".
In the 1980s, Jordan Belfort then ascends a ladder that will make him a rich, very rich man.
The opportunity to follow its incredible ascent, but also the vertigo that will follow.
Without limits, man's having parties, women, drugs.
Decadence and excess in all kinds are the master words of this crazy story.
The Scorsese-DiCaprio couple seems to have found the magic that united them in Shutter Island.
The exit of the new Scorsese was delayed due to its installation too long.
It would seem that the film lasts at 2:45.
In the room on December 25, he will be able to participate in the course of the Oscar race.
Coulson used phone piracy to check a tube
The former editor-in-chief of News of the World Andy Coulson would have used "telephonic piracy, surveillance and confrontation" to try to confirm a twin tube on a connection involving the Minister of the Interior then in practice, Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC stated before the Old Bailey Court that News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with Hannah Pawlby, her "pretty special adviser".
It was reported to the court that the newspaper had commissioned Glenn Mulcaire, a private detective, to hack Pawlby's voice box and to "plant in front of her door," but Coulson also called her and left her voice messages.
"The accusation suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor-in-chief of NotW, is not the kind of man to stay in front of the people's house hoping to surprise them, is the kind of man to love to present the story to people to see what they say," said Edis.
He stated that NotW used three means to investigate topics: telephone piracy, surveillance and confrontation.
The editor-in-chief is personally involved in the third.
It is obvious that he is aware of the second, surveillance, he cannot be otherwise.
But what's the first?
Does he know about phone piracy?
He claims otherwise, but we say, “Yes, of course. ”
The rumors about a connection involving Clarke were taken first by the NotW editorial office when a source, proving a sexual attraction to Ms. Pawlby, said that she had been told: "Don't waste your time with her, she's with Charles."
A band, on which voice messages were recorded on his phone at least three times, was arrested at Mulcaire's home in August 2006.
The investigators also found arrests on the private detective's computer concerning Ms. Pawlby and her sister listed in a "Projects" file.
During the period during which the detective investigated her, Ms. Pawlby's grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about her, Mr. Edis added.
Meanwhile, former head reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former head reporter James Weatherup supervised the monitoring of Ms. Pawlby's lesser facts and actions.
In a voice message he left on June 18, 2005, Coulson said: "I have a story that we plan to publish tomorrow that I would really like to talk to Charles."
Mr. Edis explained that Coulson's involvement in history followed the same pattern as with other important men, such as former Interior Minister David Blancett.
The jury heard Thursday that Coulson had confronted Mr. Blunkett about a relationship with a married woman while he himself attended the co-defender Rebecca Brooks, who was also married at that time.
Coulson and Brooks refused to cooperate with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted to phone piracy.
Barack Obama receives Iraqi Prime Minister, full of violence
The US President was due to receive on Friday, November 1, 2013, Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki, seeking United States aid to combat the strongest wave of violence for five years.
Iraq met in October its most murder month in five and a half years, according to figures published by the Iraqi authorities on Friday, November 1.
964 people were killed in the violence in October, of which 855 civilians, 65 policemen and 44 soldiers, and 1,600 were injured.
The United Nations provides an even higher balance with 979 dead and 1,902 injured.
These violence is increasingly killing despite enhanced security measures and major military operations launched by the Government of Nouri Al Maliki, dominated by Shiite.
The total number of deaths in October has been the highest since April 2008, when 1,073 people were killed.
About two years after the withdrawal of the American troops, the level of violence scares a new embrace while neighbouring Syria is at the forefront of a civil war.
Bombs hit markets, mosques, marriages and funerals.
Men have been beaten in the street or even at home, and security forces are also the target of frequent attacks.
The growing dissatisfaction of the Sunni minority under Saddam Hussein, who claims to be politically marginalized and to be the target of unjust arrests, has favored this flame of violence.
On Friday, new violence killed four people in northern Iraq, following the death of at least 26 people in a series of attacks, including the explosion of five cars trapped in northern Baghdad.
A large part of the violence has been attributed to the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (EIIL), a group affiliated to Al-Qaida (Sunite extremists), also involved in the civil war in Syria.
Nouri Al Maliki wants a "world war" against Al-Qaida.
The violence is at the centre of interviews with Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki in the United States, which will be received on Friday by President Barack Obama, two years after their previous meeting, on December 12, 2011.
At the time, the US President, elected on the promise to put an end to military engagement in that country, had drawn up an optimistic picture of the situation.
Since his arrival in Washington on Wednesday, Nouri Al Maliki has multiplied meetings with the executive, and Congressional elections.
On Thursday, he appealed to the international community to wage a "third world war" against Al-Qaida.
The principle of increased security assistance in Iraq is supported by the influence of republican and democratic senators.
But the latter also criticized Nouri Al Maliki, a Shiite, for giving him part responsibility for the resumption of violence through his "sectoral and authoritarian policy".
They also demanded from Barack Obama that he make Nouri Al Maliki understand that "the pernicious influence of Iran within the Iraqi government is a serious problem in our bilateral relationship".
Beijing accuses a Uighur group of the Tiananmen attack
The Chinese Homeland Security Chief accused a group of Xinjiang origor separatists on Friday of being behind the attack on the captured car that killed five dead on Tiananmen Square in the center of Beijing on Monday.
The vehicle, a SUV, sank on the crowd that was on the famous spot of the Chinese capital, symbol of the massacre in 1989, and took fire to kill its three passengers and two passengers.
Meng Jianzhu, a member of the Political Office for Internal Security Affairs, accused the Islamic movement of being the initiator of this attack.
Many oighours, a Turcophone minority located in Xinjiang, call this Chinese province East Turkmenistan.
For the Chinese government, this movement is responsible for the frequent outbreaks of violence that are animated by independent claims.
"The violent terrorist incident that occurred in Beijing was organized and premeditated," Meng said at the Hong Kong TV Phoenix channel.
"The group that was held in coulsive was the Islamic movement of eastern Turkmenistan," he added, his remarks being repeated by the new Chinese agency.
The Chinese police identified the driver of the vehicle whose name suggests that he was of the Uighur and specified that his wife and mother were with him in the car.
The latter also contained fuel-filled containers and a flag with Orthodox religious inscriptions.
The incident caused 42 injuries.
The Islamic movement of East Turkmenistan is considered a terrorist organization by the United States and the United Nations.
The Vatican investigates on contraception, divorce and homosexuality
The Vatican has undertaken a major survey around the world on how parishes manage sensitive files such as contraception, divorce and couples of the same sex.
The survey asks participants how priests deal with gay couples and their children, and how they treat men and women who live together without being united by marriage.
The survey was sent in mid-October to each national conference of the bishops, with the aim of obtaining as many answers as possible.
The information will serve as an important meeting on the family that Pope François plans to organize next year.
The news was reported on Thursday by the National Catholic Reporter, an independent Catholic newspaper in the United States.
A spokesman for the Conference of the Catholic Bishops of the United States confirmed that the document was authentic and that each bishop would decide in an appropriate manner to examine the parishioners.
In the United Kingdom, bishops published the survey on the Internet by asking Catholics to participate.
RDC: the army attacks the last fief of the rebels
The Irredibles of the M23, a few hundred combatants, were reduced to nearly 2,000 metres above the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and Jomba, two locations about 80 km north of Goma, the capital of the province of North Kivu.
"It hasn't stopped since this morning, the fights continue despite the night," the AFP told a Jomba resident, attached by phone at 12.30 p.m., and according to which a girl was injured by a dance in the morning.
"The intensity of the clashes has decreased a little," he added, "it seems that the FARDC Armed Forces of the DRC have slightly rejected the rebels."
According to this witness who wanted to remain anonymous, the soldiers had "overnighted" in Jomba before going up to the front for a "ratisation operation".
There was a very clear message behind him of the feeding of small arms.
From Bunagana, political fief and last strong place of the fall of the rebellion Wednesday, an AFP journalist could hear heavy weapons detonation.
According to a source to the United Nations Mission for the Stabilisation of the DRC, the fights entered "in a final phase", the FARDCs who had "engaged the positions of the M23 residuals to decompose them".
Since the resumption, Friday, of clashes between the 23rd March Movement (M23) and the army, Monusco has not been directly involved in the fight, but has provided government troops with decisive support in the area of information, observation and planning.
At the end of the afternoon, several dozen soldiers, well supplied in ammunition, mounted in the front line.
They were armed with kalachnikov and rocket launchers.
A little earlier, on the road leading to Bunagana, a border position with Uganda, soldiers assisted by civilians loaded a multi-scene rocket mounted on a new FARDC flaming truck, to ensure the lifting of another machine digging M23 positions on the hills.
Congolese President Joseph Kabila once again called on rebels on Wednesday night to "demobilize themselves voluntarily" under the penalty of being "forced" but left open the Kampala process, where Kinshasa and M23 have been discussing since December without results for the moment.
On the spot, M23 political leaders are hoping to reach an agreement.
"We have finished the talks, there is no longer more than the Ugandan mediation to organize the signature," said Roger Lumbala, Vice-President of the M23 delegation, without this information being confirmed immediately on the government side.
M23 was born in April 2012 of former rebels, mainly Tutsi, integrated into the army in 2009 after a peace agreement.
The United Nations and Kinshasa regularly accuse Uganda and Rwanda of supporting the M23, which rejects Kigali and Kampala.
North Kivu is one of the most densely populated regions of the DRC, and its sub-soil is filled with coveted mineral resources.
In Bunagana, on the Ugandan side of the border, where about 5,000 people had fled between Monday and Wednesday, according to the United Nations, the return movement to the DRC that had taken place in the morning was reversed at noon.
"This morning we went back to our fields, but the soldiers told us to return," Imelda Nyirankusi, surrounded by her nine children, said AFP, including a baby on her back.
We feel that the flames are approaching people.
At the beginning of the evening, dozens of residents crossed the border, some with a mattress on their heads, to spend the night in Uganda.
The musical comedy, this stage beast
Classical, sophisticated, popular, in English or French, productions sung and danced take over.
After Broadway and London, Paris finally finds its voice.
It is a revolution: the musical in French asserts itself as a kind of success.
For a long time, from Notre-Dame de Paris to Mozart the opera rock, most of the attempts would get stuck in the ridicule.
And the successes such as Cabaret or the Miserables were the aureole of the mystery.
The arrival of Jean-Luc Choplin at the Châtelet and the Internship in Mogador changed the bride.
Today, these two scenes act as successful pipes.
The first one, this Christmas, is an excellent My Fair Lady and announces after the creation of "An American in Paris".
In Mogador, "The Beauty and the Beast" could well be one of the success of the season.
On other scenes, musical performances such as "1789", "Bastile's lovers" and small musical comedies such as "Disco" or "Life and Times" are at the forefront of success and quality.
Patrick Niedo, author of the reference book "History of Musical Comedy" and lecturer at the Theatre of the Châtelet, analyzes the reasons for success so hardly conquered.
How do French musical comedies evolve?
The offer has doubled.
There are first the "musical performances" that evolve according to producers...
Some use beautiful projections of images and a true story as in 1789, the Lovers of the Bastille.
Others make a 15-year-old bond under the pretext that we can serve almost anything when we have Matt Pokora in our head.
Then we have musical comedies with the sumptuous productions of the Châtelet that bring us back to life the golden age of Broadway and discover the universe of Stephen Sondheim, the greatest living composer.
Internship Entertainment popularizes Anglo-Saxon musical comedies of variety by adapting them in French.
The independent French producers are trying to make a breakthrough.
But ongoing projects such as "Rent", "Le Baiser de la woman araignée" or "L'Eveil du Spring" have a bad time to be funded.
Do we have enough artists capable of singing, playing and dancing on Broadway?
In Paris, when there are eight musical shows in a season, it's a big year.
We have 200 talent artists who turn projects into projects.
In the United States, the musical comedy is very different.
Young people are trained in these professions in many schools.
The jobs are many among the regional theatres, tournaments, Broadway, off-Broadway...
As a result, talent is also the number of positions to be held.
Why are provincial tours so successful?
With the exception of the opera, the province remains the poor parent of culture in France.
Few plays of the theatre go on tour and it is often the boulevard theater for adults and not young adults.
Music shows fill this gap.
It's these same young people who love the reality and what it produces as ephemeral stars...
Offering beautiful young men (often talented) at the head of a musical show is the assurance of the engagement of these young girls and often their entire family.
The Facebook pages of these shows are certainly held by professionals who answer questions.
These shows are very welcome when they arrive in a Zenith province.
The Mayonnaise is built in Paris and tasted by the provincials.
The show is designed to enter all the big rooms of France in the same form as in Paris.
A serious injury in an accident with a ghost driver on the Brussels ring
An accident on the road caused a serious injury, Friday morning at 5:30 p.m., on the Brussels inner ring at the height of Hoeilaart, in the direction of Waterloo.
A driver's car was beaten by a ghost driver, who is indemnified.
The ring was closed at 9 a.m. at the location of the accident, the time when the road was derailed and an expert determined the circumstances of the accident.
This situation, however, did not cause much bottlenecks because the accident occurred at the height of the Hoeilaart exit.
As a result, the traffic could be diverted by this exit/entry of the ring.
A child badly injured in an attraction in Disneyland Paris
A five-year-old child was severely injured as a result of an accident on an attraction in Disneyland Paris.
Its vital prognosis is no longer engaged, but it is always hospitalized.
At the time of the fall, the boy was with his father on a boat of the attraction "The Pirates of the Caribbean".
It has been closed to a new order.
RDC: Army prepares a new attack
Children play on a carbonized armor belonging to M23 rebels in Kibumba on October 31, 2013, in the East of the DRC.
The Congolese army was preparing for a new attack on the last bases of the M23 rebels near Bunagana in the East of the DRC on Friday.
The aim is to decompose the M23 from the hills that surmount Bunagana.
Yesterday, we took the hill of Bugina, which surpasses that of Mbuzi.
Today, Mbuzi should fall from her.
There will be no more than Runyonyi's hill.
"That of Chanzu is not very strategic," AFP told North Kivu Governor Julien Paluku.
Mr. Paluku intends to go to Bunagana on Saturday.
Five political and last strong place of the rebellion, this locality is located at the Ugandan border, about 80 km north of Goma.
It was resumed on Wednesday by the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo on Wednesday.
Since then, a few hundred M23 irreductibles have been reduced to nearly 2,000 metres above the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and the nearby town of Jomba.
In Jomba, a resident who had been fighting all over Thursday all day indicated that the situation was "calm since this morning".
According to him, a woman and her child were killed by the battles of the guard and were buried.
One girl was injured by a bullet, and three others were injured, including a scratch, evacuated by the FARDC, added this witness quoted by the AFP.
Since the resumption of the fight between FARDC and the rebels on October 25, the two combatants have not provided an assessment of the loss of human life.
NSA findings increase the company's paranoia with regard to State surveillance
A German police helicopter flew over the British Consulate of Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital.
On behalf of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the national information agency of Germany, its mission was to photograph the roof of the US post, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
The German media explained that the BfV was hoping to identify the presence of listening antennas and that the operation had resulted in an exchange between the United States and the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin.
James Clamper, Director of American Information Services, once again stressed in September that the United States did not use its foreign information capabilities to "stolen the industrial secrets of foreign companies on behalf of American companies in order to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits".
But since Edward Snowden, the consultant became denouncing, has begun to reveal his inexhaustible treasure of information about the secrets of U.S. surveillance, European governments and business leaders no longer know whether to believe the director in words.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency has been spying on the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and has had access to data held by U.S. cloud storage service providers, including Google and Yahoo, have more than ever caused the company's paranoia with regard to State surveillance.
The revelation that the phone of the German chancellor Angela Merkel had been hacked, perhaps even for a decade, was the drop of water that had the vessel landed.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then business leaders are certainly also potential targets.
Snowden has made intensive collaboration between American information services and businesses transparent.
I believe that it is conceivable that these data are used in their mutual interest.
"Germany must wake up," says Oliver Grün, president of BITMI, who represents German SMEs in the IT sector.
German companies believe that the United States poses as important a risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to an investigation published in July by the EY Advisory Office.
However, in all the documents revealed by Mr. Snowden, nothing to date indicates that the United States has transmitted industrial secrets from foreign companies to American companies.
Political men have expressed concern that the EU does not have sufficient IT and the Internet and believe that it should try to reduce its dependence on the United States.
Business leaders are skeptical about this.
A German Parliament Member said that we should create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and open them slowly...
"It's not the right way to do it," says Hasso Plattner, president of the German company's software company, SAP.
If we wanted a strong European IT industry, then we didn't have to let it die 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany, from coal to cars, passing through farmers.
Everything except the IT industry.
However, the extent and sophistication of American spying agencies exposed by Snowden's revelations was a shock to some companies that up until then thought that China was at the greatest risk in terms of monitoring.
A major change is taking place in cloud computing as European officials have become aware that the data retained in the United States are governed by the laws of this jurisdiction and thus potentially vulnerable.
According to a survey carried out by the Cloud Security Alliance, a professional agency, about 10% of non-American members have given up their plans to use an American cloud storage service provider after revelations about the US data exploration program Prism.
Jim Snabe, co-director of SAP, says: "Our clients are asking us today a question they didn't ask us a year ago: where are my data stored and can you assure me that they will remain physically in this jurisdiction?"
Many German leaders indicate that the latest reports are only a confirmation of what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most precious secrets and that these data should therefore be kept at all prices.
It is not surprising that there is economic espionage.
There's always been.
"It has been a recurring topic for many years and nothing has changed fundamentally in the context of the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, Director General of the BASF Chemicals Production Company.
The Americans are spying on us commercially and industrially, just as we are spying on them, because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses.
Business leaders are generally less inclined to reveal the prevention measures they have put in place, if this would allow the advantage to an opponent.
Large companies have long had the message that it is least unwise to recover a free USB key in a professional living room or to leave a laptop unattended in a hotel room.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of Audi’s car manufacturer’s board of directors, says that the collection of mobile phones before the council’s meetings, so that they cannot be used as remote hearing aids, has been a common practice for years.
The BfV of Germany advises its leaders to consider using simple mobile phones prepaid on their travel abroad due to the risk of contact with the integrity of smartphones.
The prepaid mobile phones are then discarded.
However, it is feared that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to piracy and surveillance.
In Germany, many SMEs are global leaders in their particular niche.
"SMEs often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect their industrial secrets from unauthorized access," the BfV warned in a report.
The United States warns its own companies about the economic espionage activities carried out by other countries.
The National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) carried out by the United States in February cited France, as well as Russia and Israel, as responsible for having committed acts of piracy of economic information, behind China, according to The Washington Post.
A member of the board of directors of a renowned German company believed that when it comes to economic espionage, "the French are the worst".
Bernard Squarcini, former director of French interior information, DCRI, said in an interview this month: "The services know perfectly well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies."
Parents of a teenager in Georgia, who died in unusual circumstances, think their son was murdered
The parents of a teenager in Georgia, whose body was found in a wheelchair in his high school gymnasium, thought their son was murdered, said the lawyer of the family Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from Valdosta in Georgia, was found on January 11th in a carpet supported behind the degrees of his high school.
The investigators of the Sheriff of the County of Lowndes concluded that Johnson was dead under unusual circumstances, but the family of the 17-year-old boy contests these conclusions.
"They are absolutely certain that their son has been murdered," said Benjamin Crump, the lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, on FoxNews.com.
They never thought he was dead as indicated in the sheriff's conclusions.
“They think it challenges all logic, the laws of physics and the common sense,” Crump added.
They are convinced that these conclusions were delivered in the sole purpose of covering the death of their son.
"They sent their son to school with a cartible and brought him into a mortuary bag," he added.
The U.S. Attorney Michael Moore stated on Thursday that he was conducting an official investigation into Johnson's death, stressing that several important questions remained unanswered.
What is the cause of death?
Is his death the result of a criminal act?
Moore expressed himself at a press conference Thursday afternoon.
I'll follow up on the facts wherever they go.
My goal is to discover the truth.
"I consider that there is a sufficient basis" to open an official investigation, he said.
Moore told reporters that the first autopsy indicated that Johnson was killed by "positional asphyxia".
However, a second autopsy identified another cause of death, according to Moore.
"Several questions still deserve an answer or confirmation," he said.
Moore added that if he updates natural elements to justify a civilian or criminal investigation into Johnson's death, he will ask the FBI to conduct it.
The representative of the Sheriff's office in the County of Lowndes was not available to give us his opinion when we contacted him on Thursday.
A South Georgia judge ordered the authorities on Wednesday to return all the video surveillance records that the investigators had examined.
The parents of the adolescent said they hoped that the video images contained clues about the circumstances of his death.
CDC publishes advice on allergies in children at school
On Wednesday, the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention published a series of guidelines on how to manage child food allergies at school.
This is the first series of guidelines published by the U.S. government, as the number of children of school age with food allergies has increased greatly.
One child in 20 in the United States today suffers from a food allergy.
The CDC found that the prevalence of food allergies in children increased by 18 per cent between 1997 and 2007.
The guide contains information for schools on how to sensitize the teaching body and staff to food allergies in the child and how to treat them in case of allergic reaction.
It also recommends that schools have an epinephrine stock – the EpiPen self-injector – in order to react quickly to potentially fatal anaphylaxis.
The State Legislative Assembly recently updated the regulations to enable schools to have more easily than epinephrine in stock.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms reported by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children can say, "I have the impression that something bites my tongue," "I have the impression of having a hair on my tongue" or "I have bites on my tongue".
The NSA case highlights the total lack of debate on information
How do you explain the contradictory attitude of the French government, which on the one hand goes public by summoning the US ambassador on 21 October, and on the other, bans the overflight of the territory by the Bolivian presidential plane, on the basis of the noise of the presence on its board by Edward Snowden?
I think there are two levels of response from the French government.
When François Hollande telephoned Barack Obama or when the Minister of Foreign Affairs Laurent Fabius summons the US ambassador, they respond to a real discovery, which is the extent of American surveillance over all communications in France.
Is it not surprising to read in the columns of the World at a few weeks' intervals of the reproduction of American diplomatic correspondence and, on the other hand, a condemnation of the NSA's Quai d'Orsay hearings?
Wouldn't there be a vague hypocrisy on your part?
The journalistic approach is not a moral position, but a search for the interest and relevance of information that enables every citizen to fend off an opinion.
When WikiLeaks raises the veil on the analysis by the American diplomacy of political or other issues around the world, we consider that, in view of the American power, this is an important enlightenment.
When we describe American interception systems against French diplomacy in the United States, it is not at all to offend us with this practice, it is to describe the world as it is.
Has France received information from the NSA regarding terrorist operations aimed at our interests?
Can we get rid of American collaboration?
The establishment of very powerful technological interception tools by the United States, but also by France, has been officially justified by the fight against terrorism.
In this area, France and the United States have, in particular, put in place procedures for cooperation and exchange of almost daily information, which are described as essential on the one hand and essential on the other.
For example, Mohammed Merah's presence in the tribal areas in Miranshah was reported to the French through the NSA.
France can be led, for example, to transmit whole blocks of data on the Sahel region to American services, and, on the contrary - it has already been said - Americans can provide information to the French about other regions of the world.
Thus, the fundamental issue behind this NSA case is not so much the ability or right of countries to have intervention tools, but the question of the total absence of prior debate, particularly in Parliaments, on the justification of such systems, the perimeter that must be theirs, and, finally, the issue of violations of freedoms.
What is the real risk for the United States of America? a degradation of their image?
It's nice to tell them, I don't see how they'll be punished.
The risk posed by the Americans can be double.
The first is when their allies - and this has been the case recently - learn that their leaders, sometimes the highest of their state, have been monitored.
This is the case in Brazil and Germany, two countries where diplomatic relations with the United States have tended.
Another effect can be more economical: more and more European or South American companies refuse, in the light of the revelations, to provide their confidential data to US suppliers subject to US law, and thus to the NSA.
Last but not least: the vast movement of revelations undertaken by the media around the world, which contributes to the initiation of a debate on the monitoring practices of information services until then almost non-existent, could lead legislators, including Americans, to reconsider their powers to their information services.
Parents of intersexed children can choose "unspecified sex"
Germany has become the first European nation to recognize a third sex for infants born with ambiguous sexual organs.
The male or female gender of new babies will no longer be assigned to them, in a rigid manner, at birth.
Under the new law, parents will no longer be required to declare the sex of their child, allowing them to register an "unspecified" or "unspecified" sex on their birth certificate.
The purpose of the law was to remove the pressure that weighed on the shoulders of parents who could make hasty decisions regarding a sexual re-allocation surgery for their child and to combat discrimination against the intersexedients.
According to the BBC, an intersex person would have said years later, "I am neither a man nor a woman."
I will remain the patchwork created by the doctors, excited and blaring.
It is estimated that a child over 2,000 born every year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersexed, intersexuality forming part of the group of sixty diseases diagnosed as sexual development disorder, a generic term that designates people with atypical chromosomes or gonads (ovaries or testicles) or abnormally developed sexual organs.
Wallis Simpson could have been intersexed.
Sexual identification is still not well understood, but most specialists in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined, it is better to use the best available information to attribute it, then wait and follow the child's psychological and physical development before considering a surgical act, if necessary.
Dr. Jack Drescher, a psychiatrist in New York and a specialist in sexual identification, said that the new German law "seems to be a good idea".
Intersexual children have an ethical dilemma.
"Some people suffer from extremely serious diseases that require surgery, but this is not the case with most children," he added.
It is possible to make a sexual assignment without operation, and see how identity develops.
The science that consists of knowing how a child will develop a sexual identity is not very precise.
No one can answer the question of why this is happening.
It's like the mystery that surrounds homosexuals.
A report submitted to the European Commission in 2011 described persons who were intersexed as different from those who were transgender or transgender, since their status is not related to sex but rather to their biological constitution, which is not only that of a man or exclusively that of a woman, but is generally both at the same time and not clearly defined as one or the other.
These characteristics can manifest themselves in secondary sexual characteristics (such as muscle mass, Pilotity, chest and thigh), primary sexual characteristics (such as reproductive organs and sexual organs) or the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provided an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender persons in the field of employment, as well as the extent of acts of harassment and violence and crimes motivated by prejudice.
Young boys of non-conformity now have camps that are specifically intended for them.
Australia and Nepal already authorize adults to register male, female or "third sex" on their official documents.
In June, a 52-year-old Australian, Norrie May-Wellby, became the first person in the world to be recognized as "neutral" after receiving his trial in appeal that allows him to keep a "unspecified" sex alive.
German passports will include a third designation next to M or F – X for intersex, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighbouring France, such issues are always the subject of controversy, according to a report published on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of lawmakers from this land-based Catholic country signed a petition for the "gener theory" to be removed from school books.
The American Catholic Online website also opposed German law, writing that "since the world is drawn into a new realm where sex is a choice but where sexual activity is not one, two other pillars of civilization are reversed."
In Maryland, the mother of a baby also stated on Baby Zone that she would prefer that a sex be attributed to babies at birth.
"The role of parent is sufficiently stressful without additional restrictions, especially if you don't know your child's sex," she said on the website for young parents.
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born without male or female sexual organs were called hermaphrodites, according to the name of the magnificent Greek god who had double sex.
And almost a decade ago, the medical community considered the genre as an ardois, which can be erased and on which to be rediscovered.
But now, many are those who challenge the ethical foundation of surgery, knowing that sexual identity is complex and that sometimes doctors can cheat, not knowing how a child will feel his or her sexual reassignment when he or she grows up.
“ In the middle of the 20th century, this was called a psychiatric emergency, ” Drescher said.
When these children were born, we didn't call the psychiatrist, we called the surgeon.
The dominant theory of how to treat children with ambiguous sexual organs was launched by Dr. John Money of Johns-Hopkins University, who considered the gender to be malignable.
He devoted the term "sexual identity" and supported that social and environmental signals – the way parents raise a child – interact with the genes and hormones of a child to shape it so that it would be identified as male or female.
But in a 1966 case known as "John/John", his theories led to controversy.
He had advised the parents of a young boy whose penis had been cut when he was circumcised to make him castrated completely, also removing the testicles, and raising him as a girl.
"Money presented this as a successful transition case, but that was not the case," Drescher said.
When he was about 15 years old, he returned a boy and married a woman.
But at 38 years of age, he committed suicide.
Drescher said that some doctors “repeat this model all the time. ”
But in the 1990s, with the arrival of the Internet, those who have survived these gender-change operations say "they are not satisfied with the result".
This is the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with XY male chromosomes but with ambiguous sexual organs.
Doctors could not really say whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never have a "satisfying life" as a man.
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce suffered a surgical ablation from the external body and testicles and was raised as a daughter.
He was given female hormones when he was 12 years old.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he said on ABCNews.com.
I wasn't happy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At 18 years of age, he was diagnosed with vaginoplasty.
But depressed and realizing that something wasn't going on, he asked for his medical records.
What he found horrified him.
I was sterilized at birth – and nobody ever told me.
Bruce was born with a sexual development disorder (DDS) that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone so that his sexual organs could develop.
After learning the truth, a man came back after a testosterone treatment and had his chest removed.
The surgery made her sterile.
Today, he defends the cause of others in an organization called Interface Project, which tries to normalize the perception of intersexed persons.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, director-general of the non-profit organization based in California Lawyers for Informed Choice, is afraid that the German law "is inviting labelling and stigmatization".
"Many activists are concerned that the German law encourages parents to make quick decisions and gives their children an "undetermined" sex," she said.
We are afraid that it will encourage interventions.
We think it would be better to assign a male or female sex, and wait.
But we didn't see what the law was going to give, so we can only advance assumptions.
Tamar-Mattis stated that her organization supported Australian law because "it allows adults to choose to be recognized under the third sex name".
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about a legal kind," she added.
The German law concerns the attribute of sex to birth.
It is not a battle that young children should lead to that age.
When they grow up, they will be able to make decisions about their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a specialist radiologist in mammography in Pittsburgh, whose daughter is affected by a sexual development disorder and who helps thousands of people in a support group, said that the German law would "responsible" parents and children.
The daughter of Dr. Baratz, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but suffered from a DDS called a complete androgenic insensitivity syndrome.
Because of the failure of its androgen receptors, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but not uterine or ovaries.
Today 29 years old, Katie is married and internal in childhood psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she is sterile, she hopes to have children through adoption services or portable mothers.
"The law leaves some latitude to parents so they don't have to make urgent decisions," Baratz said.
This leaves them time to do some tests and understand them, and a time before entering "male" or "female".
So everything is fine – you can raise your child and love him.
You have a beautiful baby and enjoy being a parent.
You don't have to rush for a surgical intervention that is irreversible.
"This puts children at the heart of the decision and reduces the feeling of anxiety that motivates parents because they are afraid of not doing what they need to do," she said.
Finally, the child will decide with what sex he/she feels the most comfortable – and it is something great.
This allows the child to make the decision for himself.
Letta trusting in the longevity of her government
Italian Council President Enrico Letta believes that his government will hold until 2015 despite the strong tensions between the left and right within the coalition in power to approach the Senate's vote to withdraw Silvio Berlusconi's mandate.
In an interview with the newspaper La Stampa, the left-center leader said he had "strongly intention" to continue to rule with his coalition until the next legislative elections in 2015.
The High House of the Italian Parliament will meet in the course of the month to decide on the fate of the former President of the Council convicted of tax fraud in August.
Silvio Berlusconi threatens to withdraw his support from the government if the Senate, where he has more opponents than partisans, pronounces his resignation.
But part of his camp, gathered around the National Secretary of the People of Freedom (PDL) Angelino Alfano, continues to support the government, as demonstrated last October his refusal to surrender to the indictees of Berlusconi who had already wanted to bring down the cabinet.
L.A. Times reports that an agent of the United States Transportation Security Agency, TSA, and a suspect were injured during the firefighting.
Firefighters called on the scene said they had responded to a call of "multi-injurious."
"The forces of the order are in place," says the airport on its Twitter account, while television images showed people evacuated in ambulances.
"There was a gunshot," said a spokesperson for the U.S. Transportation Safety Agency (TSA) to the AFP.
The local antenna of ABC showed a person evacuated on a branch card, and a second transport on a wheelchair.
The incident took place at 9:30 a.m. (12:30 p.m. in Montréal) at terminal 3 of the airport, also specified the airport.
The Los Angeles Times states that Terminals 2 and 3 are being evacuated.
The TSA spokesperson was unable to confirm immediately if one of its employees was injured.
All flights to and from the airport have been suspended.
The Israeli army kills a member of the Hamas in Gaza-Scess
Israeli car shots killed an Islamic Palestinian militant from Hamas on Thursday and severely injured another in the southern Gaza Strip, learned from health services.
A source from Hamas explained that fighting broke out in that region, because Israeli tanks crossed the border and were targeted by your shoots of Palestinian mortars.
The Israeli army was pleased to mention a "targeted action" in the area near a tunnel called "terrorist" by the Jewish state, crossed the border and whose discovery was announced in mid-October.
Report: Obama's campaign considered to be allowing Biden to fall for Hillary Clinton
The closest advisors to President Barack Obama have considered replacing Vice-President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 list, according to the New York Times.
This revelation is the most remarkable event that appears in the very expected book of the 2012 campaign by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann, "Double Down: Game Change 2012".
The Times received a copy of the book to appear and told Thursday night that the president's close collaborators had carried out "deep work in groups and surveys at the end of 2011" to see if Biden's escape could help Obama in his re-election while his hopes waned.
According to the political correspondent of the Times Jonathan Martin, the book offers a detailed analysis of the work of the senior campaign and the White House, namely the former Secretary-General of the White House Bill Daley, to measure the effect that the replacement of the former vice-president of Clinton could have on the vote.
The possibility of an exchange is a secret that has been far-reachingly kept within the Chicago Campaign QG and within the oval Bureau.
Only half a dozen close advisors from the president – including Daley, the former campaign leader of Obama Jim Messina and former advisors at the White House David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew that the change was under study.
"Double Down" indicates that Daley was responsible for replacing Biden, despite their "close personal ties", before finally deciding against the change when the figures showed that having Clinton on the presidential list "would not greatly improve Obama's chances of success".
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration had actually planned to replace Biden with Clinton.
"I said I had examined a whole series of questions, and it was one of them," said Daley in the paper.
Remember that at that time, the president was not in shape, and so we were told, "Lord, what can we do?"
While Daley qualified as a "concerned" review, Martin told Anderson Cooper of CNN that the re-election campaign had a lot of investment to find out if the change would benefit from the vote.
"The campaigns don't spend much money on polls and discussion groups unless they seriously consider taking action," Martin said on AC360.
However, we do not know if Obama was aware that his team was examining the replacement.
Martin said about CNN that he had asked Daley if his boss was aware of the possible change.
Although Daley said he did not think that the president "has been aware" of any change, the former secretary-general admitted that it was "possible" that Obama had known.
Martin added that "Double Down" did not ultimately answer the question of whether political surveys had arrived at Obama's office.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama didn't know that Biden's escape from the presidential list was being examined.
"Perhaps," Martin replied.
Would you like some ice cream?
A British contractor created the first fluorescent ice in the world based on medusa.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of this marine animal to develop a luminous breakfast.
He had the idea after reading a study on the meds and convinced Chinese scientists to recreate the brilliant protein chemically.
Ice cream reacts with the tongue by increasing protein pH to make it shine.
Chris explains that since the ice cream starts to glow when it reacts to the heat of the mouth, the more we lick it, the more it becomes bright.
Charlie, the founder of the ice company "Lick Me I'm Delicious", said: "It's something incredible, but we're just beginning in terms of production, and 2 g of this thing costs about £200."
The protein we use in the ice reacts with the language to neutral pH.
So when your mouth warms up the protein, the pH level increases and the ice becomes brighter.
We have tested it in the last few months and it seemed appropriate to share it with everyone at the time of Halloween because it gives a brilliant effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice I've ever created because the light of the meds is worth four times more expensive than gold.
So every ball costs me about £ 140.
But she's got a good taste!
Charlie's experimental approach society, based in Bristol, is known for its unusual ice fragrances such as beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But his next creation is even more ambitious.
He added, "I would really like to develop an invisible ice cream."
It is intrinsically impossible because of the refraction caused by ice crystals that constitute ice cream, but I think I will find a way to get there.
The ice uses the fluorescent properties of the medusa synthesized by Chinese scientists.
Lou Reed died during a Thai chi session
The singer Lou Reed died while he was doing chi exercises, revealed his wife Laurie Anderson on Thursday in a letter published by the regional newspaper "East Hampton Star" to the inhabitants of the town of Springs, where the couple had a house.
The artist died last Sunday at the age of 71.
"He died on Sunday morning, while he was looking at the trees and was performing the famous 21st Thai chi movement, with his hands as a musician who blew the air," wrote Laurie Anderson.
Lou Reed was the master of chi, a Chinese martial art.
The singer's wife also explained that she had promised her husband a week before his death to get him out of the hospital and take him to their house in Springs (Long Island).
Lou and I have spent a lot of time here in recent years.
And even if we're citizens, it's our spiritual home.
"He was a prince and a fighter, and I know that his songs on the pain and beauty of the world will convey to many people the tremendous joy of living that he had," she adds.
Lou Reed had a liver strike last May.
Halloween 2013 : In figures
When I was a kid, Halloween was magic.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, go to bed late and try to go to the neighborhood.
Today, I've become more pinger.
In the last two years, I haven't distributed a single bonus and I'm sure I won't do it this year.
But the states show that I'm the gay sheep when we talk about Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million of them in fact – will celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion in bonuses, decorations and decorations, according to the National Retail Federation.
What I look forward to every Halloween party is the trend.
The disbursements should amount to $1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, sexy inanimate objects rage.
Women no longer need to be sexy professionals; they can also be sexy foods such as pizzas, burgers and carrots.
As for men, I expect to see a lot of zombies, thanks to the television series The Walking Dead, and I bet that the men of the Daft Punk space will be among our Instagram photos this year.
According to Google, the most sought after decorations are zombies, Batmans, pirates and witches.
I guess there's nothing wrong with staying traditional.
We desecrated our dogs last year and, to my great surprise, they were not alone.
In fact, Americans are going to spend $330 million in animal decorations this year, according to the NRF.
It makes a lot of curious dogs tasted in hotdogs.
When it comes to candy, we don't clean up.
The Americans will spend $1.9 billion in bonuses this year, according to the Nielsen cabinet.
This represents approximately 272 million kg of Hershey bars, sucets, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and Clark bars.
It's a great news for the 41 million children who go hunting for candy in their neighborhood, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.
In fact, we're going to buy, and we're not going to tell stories, consume 41 million kg of chocolate during Halloween.
Maize beans are the only thing we don't want to eat; yet almost 16 million kg are sold for Halloween, according to the National Confectioners Association.
This represents about 9 billion corn grains.
It's a mystery that I haven't come to elucidate yet.
Nothing is more representative of Halloween than the haunted houses.
They bear the best names, such as "Terror Behind the Walls" (which is actually a real prison), "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock".
In fact, there are 1,200 houses officially recognized in the United States, which generate about $500 million of revenue, according to the Americana Haunts, and this includes these great photos of you by pissing you on top of what your friends put on Facebook and that you can't remove and on which a guy you like well leaves a comment in the style "pretty head".
Finally, let's talk about lemons.
Charlie Brown introduced us to La Grosse Ciruille when we were playing, and sculpting a lemon in the form of a lantern, it's like decorating a Christmas tree – it's something we've done since we've been small.
Fortunately for us, the "child-ciruille trend" began only last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us have sculpted these potions and had no to sit in.
This year, the Americans will spend about $106 million in lemons, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
The latent lemons that flaunted gently on the porch of your house probably came from Illinois, where 542 million lemons were cultivated this year.
If you're trying to make you notice more, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California, and try to sculpt their 922 kg lemon.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will create an internal decommissioning structure ("bad bank") comprising 38 billion books (EUR 45 billion) of the most risky assets, a measure to relax its relations with London and accelerate its privatisation.
The bank wants to reduce the proportion of doubtable assets in its balance sheet in the next two years and hopes that it will have completely cleared it in the next three years.
RBS also said that it would include a provision for the depreciation of additional suspicious claims of four to 4.5 billion books per quarter, a writing related to the constitution of the cantoning structure.
RBS also stated that this internal restructuring would free up from 10 to 11 billion capital books, thus strengthening its lending capacity.
The Bank and London pointed out that the "bad bank" would make it possible to draw a deal on the past, and the government, in particular, was accused of becoming involved in the management of RBS.
"We can now move forward, worry about the future and 90% of the assets that are a really good bank and build a large bank for the customer and for the UK," said the new Director General Ross McEwan in the press.
Land Rover announces his sponsorship of a series of rallyes
The interior has 6-point trunk seats and seat belts, as well as an Intercom system.
Among the options are improved brakes, a service providing access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistics support and storage of the vehicle between two events.
Drew Bowler, Director General of Bowler Motorsport, said: "The rally lovers joining Bowler have changed."
Not all of them are experienced, some are looking for excitement and adventure and a realistic access to international events.
We are very happy to offer such an approach in partnership with Land Rover and MSA, and we are convinced that this will be a new way to try different forms of rallying in the UK and the international world, and to prepare for the rigours and realities of raiding rallying.
We were very pleased to develop the Defender Challenge vehicle – the championship will really be palpating.”
In addition, the Defender Challenge will propose a day of training and testing in February and the possibility of participating in events in the deserts of North Africa and the Middle East.
The firefighters were called to rescue a lost cock after being stuck 15 m above the ground on an unstable frame in a career
Ruby, a gambler, escaped after an accident on the road without gravity
It was detected three days later by a person who walked his dog stuck in the career
The firefighters came down in memory along the cliff to retrieve the dog and save her from a certain death
One shot had the chance to escape to the worst after the firemen were called to recover it safely while it was lost 15 metres above the ground on the unstable sand of a cliff.
Ruby, a 9-month-old gambler, escaped after an accident on Sunday afternoon and survived for three days alone before being saved in a Wednesday career.
His owners, Scott Alderson, aged 25, and his little friend Becky Hall, aged 20, went to the career of Flappit in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to meet Ruby and thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Relief Service.
They had desperately searched for their lost dog and called on social networking sites after she disappeared in her career after an accident with no seriousness.
About 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday, a man with a sharp look who walked his dog found Ruby on a corner in his career, 15 metres above the ground.
A technical rescue team from the Cleckheaton firehouse went to the places and came down with a reminder to save Ruby by using an animal caviar to transport it to the top of the cliff.
Technical Support Specialist Andy Clayton said, "She was in a precarious situation."
It was in the middle of the cliff, 15 m from the top and 15 m from the ground.
She did not move at all during the rescue – she was frozen.
But she's fine now.
She ate cookies after.
It was a very unusual call.
It's amazing that someone noticed the dog.
The technical rescue specialist Peter Lau said: "Ruby had a lot of chance to get out of it."
She could have been badly injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the veterinarian for a check; his general condition was satisfactory, except for dehydration and dehydration.
Ms. Hall, from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said, "I was terrified by watching the rescue."
I didn't think she was up there at first.
It was surprising to have it back in my arms.
The veterinarian said that if she had been too exhausted and had been exhausted, she would probably have fallen.
The firefighters were hot.
What they did was really brave.
We are so grateful to them, each of them has been absolutely formidable.
Mr. Alderson, from Keighley, added: "We were afraid that she would fall, but she didn't move."
The firefighters were great.
I can't believe she was up there.
Mick Jagger said he never loved Katy Perry when she was 18.
During an interview with an Australian radio broadcast this week, the pop star said she was choristic about Jagger's song "Old Habits Die Hard" in 2004.
Perry said she had dinner with the rock veteran and explained, "He killed me when I was 18 years old."
She added, "It was a long time ago, and it was very nice."
In a statement on Thursday, a 70-year-old representative of Jagger said that he "did not categorically make progress in Katy Perry".
The representative added, "Maybe she's confused with someone else."
Perry was one of the singers to make an appearance during the Rolling Stones tour this year.
His new album, "Prism", landed at the top of the charts this week.
Beijing called for an Islamic Turkmen movement
"Turkey support for the attack came from the Islamic Movement of Central and West Asia-based East Turkmenistan," said the Chinese security authorities' patron to a Hong Kong television channel, according to a video posted on a website on Thursday night.
Meng Jianzhu, who is a member of the Chinese Communist Party's (PCC) Political Office, spoke at Tachkent on an official visit to Uzbekistan.
This is the first time a Chinese official designates a special organization after the attack on Monday.
According to the Chinese police, three Uighours of the same family of the Muslim-dominated region of Xinjiang, the border of several Central Asian countries, rushed their fuelled car against the city's banned entry into Beijing, in a suicide attack that killed two and 40 injured.
The driver of the car, his wife and his mother died in the car fire.
Etim, who claims to fight for the independence of East Turkmenistan, former name of Chinese Xinjiang, was ranked by the United Nations in 2002 among the organizations affiliated to Al-Qaida.
This movement is often designated by the Chinese authorities as responsible for sporadic disturbances in Xinjiang, but its real influence is questioned by several experts.
George Kerevan: The outbreak of Europe gives the Scottish choice
Another day, another worrying story of independence.
This time, we are expected that an independent Scotland would have to join the European Free Movement Area in order to be able to join the EU.
And that's what we hear about passport control stories in Berwick and a border of barbeled wires along the Hadrian wall.
If it is true that Strathclyde's newspaper reported the possible economic consequences of a greater freedom of movement with the rest of Europe, this was not in the big headlines (and this was to be expected).
No one has said that EU Member States spend a great deal of their time circumventing their formal rules when they do so.
Since Scotland is not part of the Schengen area for the time being, a continuing non-compliance with the rules would be a small concession that Brussels could offer in return for everything it wants to get from the Scottish people.
So it's a story that's not one.
And a story so old that it is now fixed: I first heard the bobard that "independence means control of passports" more than 40 years ago.
However, an interesting point has been forgotten in this interpretation of an old dusty account.
Why should an independent Scotland follow the instructions of Europe, in fact?
Why exchange London's yoke against Brussels, especially now?
Here's the real news about Europe: the great post-war plan to unify Europe is definitely at the point of death.
With the euro crisis, the European Project is officially dead.
Throughout Europe, the parties that oppose the EU or fight for the abandonment of the euro as a common currency win the ground.
Even in Germany, the Alternative Eurosceptic Party for Germany, founded only this year and came from nowhere, gathered almost five million votes in the federal elections in September and left the Liberal Democratic Party (equivalent to our Liberal Democrats) of the Bundestag.
There has always been a national opposition to the project to create a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has marked a turning point.
The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, associated with the carcan weighing on national economies through accession to the single currency, has led many people to think that the European project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has nothing to do with national governments that record excessive budgetary deficits – this was only true for Greece.
Instead, the European system has put pressure on its members on German exporters' exchange rates – what German politicians want to preserve.
Without the possibility of assessing the national currency, the countries of southern Europe face an intrinsic productivity problem with regard to Germany.
The only remedy is to make dark cuts in public salaries and expenses – encouraged by Berlin.
In addition to the current budgetary and monetary problems, there is a deeper problem of productivity in Europe.
Following the 'green' energy policies imposed by Brussels – which are a reason for subsidising French and German energy companies at consumer costs – the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times more for gas than the United States.
This is a reduction in costs, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
All wages freezes around the world will not prevent the European petrochemical industry from being penalized by a cheap American skisty gas.
As a result, the Great Revolution, in particular in France, is one of the major leaders of the EU.
After the war, the French political elite considered the EU a means of controlling Germany and putting Paris on an equal footing with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport of its political legitimacy and has imposed its own economic policy in Europe, allowing the French economy to deteriorate.
Result: the extreme right party of Marine Le Pen, the Anti-European National Front, has just won a crucial partial election, sending the Socialists back to power in the third place.
The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the suffrage – a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it cannot depart from the principle that a division of the right will automatically favor the left.
What does Marine Le Pen do with its new popularity with the French white working class?
It wants to use European elections next year to create a single and anti-European anti-monetary bloc within the European Parliament.
If anti-European parties do well in these elections, which is very possible, such a block could control the European Parliament for the first time.
That is what I think: very soon, the anti-European and single anti-money sentiment in Europe will unite and end up killing the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will return to something more similar to "Europe of the Nations (Sovereign)" freely privileged by the General of Gaulle.
Germany and some of its satellite economies could preserve the euro, but France and South Europe will find their own currency.
I expect the United Kingdom to take its distance from this project, and I hope that it will take a gentle look at the United States.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left to the Atlantic.
What about Scotland, in all this?
We can decide to be a region of small England (mainly).
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which includes sending out Berlin and Brussels.
I believe that Scotland could be provided with a more free European agreement, provided that we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other countries would be easier in a non-federal Europe.
Otherwise, we should imitate Norway and preserve our economic independence.
The Scottish SNP government is – and it is to be noted – the most successful anti-austerity political movement in Europe, as it won a spectacular majority in 2011 based on its opposition to the dark cuts proposed (and implemented) by the Chancellor of the labour force, Alistair Darling, and the conservative/liberal-democrat coalition that followed.
It would now be ridiculous for Scotland to vote for independence if it were to accept the austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty : Age earlier
Studies show that young African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach the age of puberty earlier than young white girls.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is imminent
Nothing proves that hormones or other chemicals are responsible.
Experts believe that the epidemic of obesity could be a trigger for early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is not as pronounced in boys
The former correspondent of CNN Pat Etheridge is a specialist in family and health issues in the child.
Should a mother worry if her daughter's pubic breasts and hair start to grow to 7 or 8 years?
At the annual American Academy of Pediatrics conference held this week in Orlando, Florida, Dr. Paul Kaplowitz, pedo-endocrinologist, explained that these early physical changes are quite common among young Americans and represent a new standard.
"I spend a lot of time reassuring my parents – in general, this does not indicate a rapid evolution towards full puberty," Kaplowitz said.
The obvious signs of development, such as chest piercing, hair under the arms and in the pubic area and body odors, appear earlier in girls.
But there has only been a slight advance in the age of the first rules in the last four decades.
In the United States, the average age was 12 and a half years, while it was 12 and three quarters in 1970.
“ Once the breast has begun to develop, it takes at least two or three years before the first rules appear,” said Kaplowitz, also the author of “Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem”.
Time is the most accurate test to know how puberty will evolve.
There is a debate about what constitutes the real appearance of puberty, but it is considered "early" when breast development is accompanied by sudden growth before the age of 8.
In most cases, development slows or stops – something a pediatrician can closely follow.
A faster evolution can justify tests carried out by an endocrinologist to avoid serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are treatments to delay the appearance of the first rules and prevent other consequences: premature aging of the bones that can slow growth and a small size in adult age.
The recommendations on drug and hormonal treatment are based on the age of the child, development rate, growth rate and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is careful with medicines but recognizes that "the control of puberty can alleviate some behavioral problems and the feeling for young girls to be different from others".
The other major problem is understandable: Parents simply do not want their very young girls to have their rules.
"They fear the risk of pregnancy or even how they will manage hygiene," Kaplowitz said.
"It was a shock," recalls a woman whose daughter had her first ten-year rules.
Although there were signs and we talked about the rules, she was not prepared emotionally.
She came back from school frustrated and upset to be the first of her friends.
There are many theories of public knowledge about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no consistent theory that hormones contained in milk or other foods, chemicals present in the environment or sexual messages carried by the media are responsible.
Boys, like girls, get their puberty sooner.
Kaplowitz claims that the most credible hypothesis is the epidemic of obesity.
He participated in a study conducted on girls aged 6 to 9 years who linked the percentage of fat to the onset of puberty.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other influential factors.
In this country, young African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach the age of puberty earlier than young white girls.
There are several explanations.
At the global level, early puberty mechanisms seem to be influenced by everything, economic conditions to the climate, passing through genes.
Another problem: Although boys have hair on their face and in the younger pubic area, the trend towards early true puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors participating in the AAP conference stressed the complexity of the subject.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common, even in infants and young children.
"We must be careful about how we identify the true appearance of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, an endocrinologist working at the Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to ask their pediatrician for advice on how to talk to their child.
"This may mean having a conversation earlier than planned," Kaplowitz explained.
If you stay calm, your child will generally react well.
Girls whose puberty is early must be assured that, even if this happens earlier than planned, the process is part of life.
Respect for the people of the Coen brothers
"Inside Llewyn Davis" by the Coen brothers, the Grand Prix of the last Cannes Festival, is a nostalgic and funny film on the Greenwich village of 1961 and the folk music that began to resonate before Bob Dylan arrived.
Joel and Ethan Coen, whose filmography was just the subject of a retrospective to the French Cinematics, had picked up the Golden Palm in Cannes in 1991 for Barton Fink.
Without being able to hire Dylan or the Trio Peter, Paul and Mary, Joel and Ethan Coen threw their veil on the star amount of American cinema, Oscar Isaac, 33 years old, but also on the planetary pop star Justin Timberlake.
In this humorous film where music is a central character and the songs interpreted live, Oscar Isaac reveals himself to a musician and singer of accomplished people, while Timberlake, his friend in the film, leaves the pop for folk music with a contagious retirement.
As for Carey Muligan, she left Daisy Muligan's rich fans in "Gatsby's magnificent" for less relaxing clothes, a soft voice when she sings, but the jury owes it to the machine gun when she speaks.
"Inside Llewyn Davis" tells about one week of the tribulations of a folk singer who doesn't get through and gets angry with the whole earth.
He accepts the upholstered replacements in the studios.
Without housing, he makes the tour of his friends' sofas who still want to receive it.
Documentary air
"His relationship with success is tortured, that's what we were interested in: a mixture of evil, a man who is not there at the right time, who is not a careerist but integrated, with self-destructive behavior," Ethan Coen, coroned with his brother Joel at several Oscars and prices in Cannes.
If Lewyn Davis did not exist, the two folk music fans built their history on real personalities of the time like folk musician Dave Von Ronk.
The idea was to show the time before the Greenwich Village event, this New York district called to become "the epicenter of the rise of folk music that would generate international stars", as journalist Elijah Wald, a friend of Van Ronk, wrote.
The film then takes documentaries, dusty 33T-invented music label, inhabited by an old impeccable secretary, to the musical choices of the studios of the time and to the cafes where the singers were produced.
The magic of the Coen brothers is still working by integrating a funny character that is constantly going through the film: a beautiful red cat with a dazzling look, lucky companion of Llewyn Davis.
Questioned about how he composed his character, the actor and singer Justin Timberlake had recalled having "great in Tennessee, bathed in blues and country".
"My first musical lessons were given to me by my grandfather who taught me how to play guitar," he added.
For Justin Timberlake, if the work is necessary to "be considered as good", "the chance can also launch someone's career", and "from now on."
As Llewyn Davis, who refuses any compromise on his music, the pop star explains that in a career, "the most important thing is not to get caught up in everything that can prevent us from expressing ourselves."
Gérard de Villiers, the author of "SAS", died.
He'll never know the word retired.
The phenomenon of the French edition, Gérard de Villiers, died on Thursday at 83 years of age, was just published by his 200th SAS, "La Vengeance du Kremlin".
In February, the New York Times devoted it to "the author of espionage novels who knew too much about it".
He had just spent ten days in Afghanistan, the 198th and 199th works of the famous series of espionage novels.
Physically reduced by a very serious heart attack in December 2010, he moved on this trip with a walker.
Before Afghanistan, he was also assigned to Libya, Russia, Lebanon and Mali.
With four SAS published each year, Gérard de Villiers, born December 8, 1929 in Paris, would make sure to ignore the exact number of books sold since 1965 and the publication of "SAS in Istanbul", the first of the series, almost half a century ago.
"Probably between 120 million and 150 million all confused countries," he moved on last March.
His Burmese chat on his knees, in the living room of his huge apartment of an apartment on the Foch Avenue two steps from the Arc de Triomphe, the evil eye under his white hair, he cited some of the languages in which the adventures of SAS were translated: Italian, German, Russian, Greek, Japanese or Korean.
"Not counting the pirate editions," he added, designing a pile of books on the low table between the bronzes or reported ivores of the 130 countries arpented to place their novels there.
For the price of a pack of cigarettes, the reader has the right to the traditional cover with the photo of a young woman with an advantageous breast, carrying a gun or a gun.
Inside, his Serene Highness (SAS) Prince Malko Linge, a disgruntled Austrian aristocrat and CIA contractual agent to pay for the family castle repairs, launches himself at the gates of all the earth's wicked, communists of the 70s and 80s, then jihadists from the 1990s.
At each book, the same recipe: a large dose of geopolitics and exoticism, a few scenes of hard sex, a gesture of violence and torture.
"I never claimed to be a literary author," explained Gérard de Villiers.
I view myself as a counter that writes to distract people to whom I do not send a message.
He worked "like the great pre-war reporters, of Albert London, who went on site and came back with real and long investigations".
SAS' father said "make a kind of geopolitical sheet."
"I am constantly my files (Afghanistan, Syria, ...) before leaving," Gérard de Villiers added.
Instead, I meet journalists, including AFPs, diplomats, people I've known for some 20 or thirty years.
Suddenly, many of his SASs are often predominant: thus, a month before the attack of a command center of the Syrian regime that had killed several senior leaders, he had told the story in "The Road of Damascus".
In "The Fous of Benghazi", he was the first to reveal the existence of a CIA secret command centre in this city, the stronghold of the Libyan revolt.
In 1980, he staged the assassination of Egyptian President Anouar El-Sadate in "The Cairo Plot", a year before the attack.
In October 2012, in "Panique à Bamako", he reported on the columns of 4X4 jihadists based on Malaysian capital.
I'm not a coward, Gerard de Villiers was defending himself, I'm just making assumptions from countries I know well and, from time to time, some of my assumptions come true.
After these trips to frequently disturbed areas, he set up for a month behind his machine to write IBM to marguerite from 1976 "where all the pieces were changed".
300 pages later, he wrote the word "FIN" and corrected each page in style.
The walls of his office include AK-47 firearms, erotic photos and copyright photos with African warlords.
Regularly cornered for machining by feminist leagues and racism by human rights organizations, Gérard de Villiers dismissed these accusations in two sentences.
Some women are sexual objects in my books but others are beautiful, intelligent and courageous women.
I am always welcome in Africa where I count on a lot of readers.
Gérard de Villiers said, "Malko Linge, like all heroes, is not old."
He won't die and he won't retire.
No more than me.
Airplanes are wondering about the width of seats while major commands are in play
The dispute rages among the major aircraft manufacturers about the width of the tourist class seats on long-term flights, opening the way for a bitter confrontation at Dubai's airport which takes place months ago.
The conflict covers the width of the seats proposed for long-term flights to economic class passengers – which are not always the most shortest by airlines, but to which the space allocated is essential to increase efficiency gains in the last aircraft presented by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
This week, Airbus called on the aircraft industry to set up a standard imposing a seat size of at least 18 inches (45.72 cm) in economic classes, but its major American rival Boeing states that it should be for airlines to decide.
The dispute erupted as aircraft seek to sell even bigger versions of their long-range bi-motor aircraft, possibly waiting for a record of commands during the event that will take place from 17 to 21 November.
The way seats will be available at the rear of the plane – in particular, there will be 9 or 10 front seats – is essential for the economic performance of the "mini-jumbo" segment.
Boeing states that its remodeled "777X" will be able to accommodate 406 people in seats over 17 inches wide in economic class, and will be configured with 10 seats per row.
Airbus indicates that the competitive version of its A350 will carry 350 people in economic class in seats of 18 inches wide configured in rows of 9.
Aeronautic giants often exchange punches on technical issues by advertising in the professional press.
Today, Airbus calls directly to the public before the Dubai Air Station, where 777X should take the step on its competitors with more than 100 commands.
We recently realized what could be the beginning of a new advertising war with the presentation to the finance of a photo showing three people against each other at the restaurant, entitled "Would you accept this?".
"Boeing offers long-distance flights in tighter seats than in regional turbopropellers," said John Leahy, commercial director of Airbus.
As food habits change, people grow, but the seats in the planes have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when Boeing's jumbo 747 defined the modern long-term journey, and the turn of the century, the average American weight of 40 to 49 years increased by 10 per cent, according to data from the American Department of Health.
The average American tour of the 21st century is 39.7 inches, according to American health statistics.
Airbus states that its rival is attached to a seating concept that dates back to the 1950s, when the circuit assembly of the newly baptized "jet set" device was more narrow.
Airbus adds that it commissioned a study that indicates that an additional one at the width of the seats would improve the quality of sleep by 53 per cent.
Boeing contests Airbus figures regarding the width of seats and claims that it is not for manufacturers to decide how airlines balance ticket prices and equipment.
He also said that the study showed that cabin experience does not depend solely on the width of seats.
"It is really about providing flexibility to airlines and allowing them to do what they think they should do in order to carry out their activities," said Kent Craver, in charge of the satisfaction of passengers at Boeing.
They don't want to be told what will allow them to be profitable.
They know their business better than anyone.
For passengers, there is more freedom of movement, but for suppliers, it is increasingly a question that could affect their results.
Behind the dispute is a race for aircraft orders for an estimated amount of at least $700 Md at the market price in the coming decades, enough to balance US and European exports.
As Reuters indicated for the first time in July, the configuration of seats is exactly what feeds the battle between the last devices.
Airbus and Boeing both claim one per seat performance in their latest models of long-term bus drivers 20% higher than the market leader in this segment, the Boeing 777-300ER of 365 seats.
The performance announced by Boeing depends in part on the comparison between the 777X configured with 10 seats per row and a 777 original model configured in rows of 9.
The unit cost gain is low compared to the device configured with 10 seats per row currently in service.
"Boeing does this in order to be able to take more seats and make its aircraft more competitive by relation to our products," said Kevin Keniston, Director of Comfort Passenger at European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say that the cabins configured with 10 seats per row in the 777 existing ones suggest that many passengers speak for a more dense configuration, which can be paired with less expensive tariffs.
"An 18-inch seat width would be perfect for passengers, but the reality is that, from a commercial point of view, the Airbus proposal is motivated by the 777 threat," said the interior expert Mary Kirby, founder and editor-in-chief of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not provide seats, but they offer a supplier catalogue, including the choice of airlines.
The aircraft salesmen who tour the world even carry with them a meter to check the competing configurations.
While offering comfortable equipment, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with high-density configurations for low-cost airlines and for regional travel.
Airbus offers an A350 configured with 10 seats per row but indicates that it hasn't sold it yet.
Until recently, Airbus stressed the need for greater cabin customization by offering wider seats on some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only major manufacturer of large modern devices, experts say that it is unlikely that his call to the aircraft industry will be made to establish a standard of size for seats that ends but could cause him to forget the 777X sales gap.
The shareholders of Oracle angry with Ellison's salary
A majority of Oracle shareholders voted on Thursday against the proposal for remuneration for the founder and director general Larry Ellison, given the financial performance of his group.
The vote is not binding, but it only detracts from Larry Ellison's image, the third world victory, just as the victory of his ship at the U.S. Cup.
The billionaire still holds 25% of the capital of the software group co-founded 40 years ago.
Last year, Ellison voted negatively on his remuneration.
The Oracle pattern gave up a $1.2 million bonus for the 2013 fiscal year closed in May because of the group's poor performance, which lacked its growth goals, but it saw about $77 million related to stock options.
His fixed salary is just a symbolic dollar.
Over the entire period of 2013 Oracle's net profit rose by 3.5%, while the bond exchange rate of 27.5%, exceeding the S&P-500 index, which took 24% at the same time.
The new anti-nicotinic vaccine could eliminate the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotinic vaccine that could eliminate the pleasure of smoking a cigarette.
One single dose of the vaccine was able to protect the mice from nicotine dependence.
Other tests are needed before testing on the human being begins, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Weill Cornell Medical College of New York stated that the first signs were encouraging.
"We really hope that this kind of vaccine strategy will help millions of smokers who have tried to stop, exhausting all the methods available on the market today, but discover that their addiction is strong enough to overcome these different approaches," said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains an harmless virus that has been modified to carry the genetic information needed to design anti-nicotinic antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the cells of the liver, which then begins to produce a regular flow of antibodies.
The antibodies trace all nicotine molecules present in the blood system and neutralize them before they reach the brain, preventing the smoker from having his nicotine dose.
During tests, the mice vaccinated to which nicotine was subsequently given continued their normal activity.
But the mice that had not been vaccinated "were calmed", said researchers, indicating that nicotine had reached their brain.
Experiences are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
The previous tobacco vaccines were ineffective because they contained antibodies.
Injections should be repeated so often that antibody levels remain high that they were too expensive and not practical.
But the cost of the new vaccine should be much lower as it transforms liver cells into antibodies.
Professor Crystal said that if the future human-use vaccine was completely safe, it could be administered to children before they are tempted to try a cigarette, which would prevent all nicotine addiction.
But it is more likely to be used by smokers who want to stop smoking.
"They will know that if they start smoking again, they will not enjoy it because of the anti-nicotinic vaccine, and this will help them to lose their bad habit," he added.
British scientists reported that the results were interesting but reported that much more extensive research was needed.
The leader of the Pakistani Taliban killed by a drone
The leader of the Pakistani Taliban movement, Hakimullah Mehsud, was killed in a hit by an American drone in Pakistan on Friday, learned from security services.
The death of Hakimullah Mehsud has been announced several times in the past.
But information, army, and activist movement officials said this time that he had lost his life in this attack, which was carried out in the North-Waziristan region.
"We can confirm that Hakimullah Mehsud was killed in a drone shot," said a senior security officer.
The guard, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, moving to London, had informed the British government that discussions had been held with the Taliban-Tahrik and Pakistan (TTP), the Pakistani Taliban movement.
Tripodi do not be influenced by Obeid
The former New Wales South Labour Minister Joe Tripodi will be investigated by the State Anti-Corruption Regulator.
The former Minister of New Wales of the South Joe Tripodi refused to change the policy of trade bubbles at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three property located in the government-controlled area.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its investigation to find out if Mr. Obeid had pressured several State ministers to renew their bowls in Circular Quay, where the Obeids have two restaurants and a coffee, after their expiry in August 2005, without any call for tender.
She now investigates the allegations that Mr. Tripodi was aware of Mr. Obeid's secret interest in these properties, following the testimony of Mr. Tripodi's former deputy secretary-general, Lynne Ashpole, Thursday.
During the years of discussions started in 2005, the government pressured the balls to make an offer.
The tenants were opposed and also wanted longer periods.
In 2009, the rounds for Circular Quay companies, which related to Obeid approximately $2.5 million a year, were renewed without any call for tenders.
Mr. Tripodi, who was Minister of the Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was at the start of the call for tenders.
But he refused to change his policy at the request of Mr. Obeid, who, as Mr. Tripodi acknowledged, demanded a change in government policy in the field of bullets.
The transcription of telephone conversations presented to ICA showed calls made in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obeid, Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had arrived at the Ports Department after working under the orders of M. Obeid in the Department of Fisheries.
"The topic discussed during these telephone conversations was the development of the trade fair policy?" said Deputy Commissioner Anthony Wheely to Mr. Tripodi.
"No," replied Mr. Tripodi.
I don't remember what we discussed, but anyway, it wasn't.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli warplanes targeting Syria, an officer states
Israeli warplanes reached a target in the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday night, confirming a military officer in Fox News.
The manager did not specify the target, but said that there was at least one target.
The Associated Press reports that the target was Russian production missiles SA-125.
At least twice this year, Israel has launched air strikes against missile shipments in Syria.
Foreign workers in the possession of a visa 457 may have to pass an "authenticity" test
The Government is currently examining the possibility of introducing a "authenticity" test for foreign workers in possession of a visa 457 while considering extending the repression measures.
The test, if adopted, would be applied according to a criterion to prevent 457 visas from being used to occupy unqualified posts or as a way of making his family and friends in Australia.
A government working paper was released today, while Labour MP Maxine McKew denounced the government's speech on foreign workers, saying he might offend the neighbors of Australia.
"Failure statements on "foreigners returning to the end of the line" and "employment for the Australians first" are a distasteful return at the time when trade unions asked for a protected labour market," she said to the Australian India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that the work of the Whites should be protected – and I would not be surprised that some countries in the region see it as an echo to this historical artefact.
The working paper describes the 12 measures previously envisaged by the former Minister of Immigration Chris Bowen.
The Minister of Immigration Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka to meet with senior officials to discuss trafficking in human beings, implemented five of the recommended changes, while the others were under review.
If the "authenticity" criterion was adopted, a visa applicant could be checked to know "if the offer of employment is genuine in the case of a personal relationship or associate of the owner or person concerned within the sponsorship company".
Companies could also be required to declare the number of visa holders 457 after some of them, with the intention of sponsoring a small number of workers, actually employed hundreds of them.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker would have died of a heart attack after arriving on a boat carrying asylum seekers to Christmas Island this week.
The dead son of the man, 9 years old, went to Australia with him and found some comfort since the death of his father on Wednesday at an adult cousin who was also on board.
The man was urgently transferred by the Australian authorities to the hospital on Christmas Island, where he died.
A study aimed at multiplying the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland was launched by the British government.
The work done by HS2 Ltd suggests that high-speed services to Scotland and the north of England will begin as soon as Phase 1 is opened in 2026.
Minister of Transport Baroness Kramer said the project "would assemble the United Kingdom".
Scottish Minister of Transport Keith Brown said he was "excited" to work with the British government on the project.
Phase 1 will be on a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.
When Phase 2 is completed, the lines will serve Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government revised the estimated cost of building the high-speed link between London and the north of England, ranging from £32.7 million to £42.6 million.
The British government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has asked HS2 Ltd to study the strengthening of railway capacity and the improvement of the length of routes to the north of England and Scotland.
This should include the possibility of travelling time between Glasgow and Edinburgh for a maximum of three hours.
Baron Kramer said: "Our objective for HS2 is to reach a truly national network that will bring the United Kingdom and its cities closer together."
We push the HS2 project because its benefits are enormous.
Without it, we are facing a capacity problem in our rail network.
But it is also about developing connectivity between the 18 major British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, so that the links between them are better thanks to HS2.
British Secretary of State for Scotland Alistair Carmichael added: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Mr. Carmichael to support the inclusion of Scotland in the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: "The high-speed train has the potential to offer considerable economic benefits to Scotland, but it also brings Scotland's economic weight in the overall high-speed rail network project across Great Britain.
"We are therefore excited about working in partnership with the British government to examine the options to bring the high-speed train network to Scotland, creating an advantage for all and supplementing the Glasgow-Edibourg line that the Scottish government is already planning.
"I am eager to read the review report with the British ministers next year and we will then decide together on the next steps."
Rules on the use of electronic on-board devices remain in force for the moment in Australia
Australian air passengers will need to continue to expand their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing despite the United States gesture to ease regulation on electronic devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has left the door open to U.S. carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read electronic books, watch videos or play games on their devices during critical flight phases provided they are in "airplane" mode.
Passengers can already do so during most of the flight, but many find it painful that they cannot access their electronic books during take-off and landing.
Australian carriers are considering the decision that obliges American carriers to do an important job to meet the requirements, but have indicated that they do not intend to change their procedures immediately.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also stated that it was considering the announcement but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical flight phases were still in force in Australia.
"The CASA does not have specific regulations governing the use of electronic aircraft devices," she said.
The issue is governed by regulations that require aircraft operators to ensure the maintenance of permanent safety and passengers to comply with the safety signals provided by crew members.
Virgin, who had already told CASA of her intention to extend her use of on-board entertainment using Wi-Fi technology, was open to a change, but said she would follow the regulator.
"We would welcome a revision of the CASA that would allow the use of electronic devices because we really think that this would improve the customer experience now that we have (from the on-board entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology) on our planes," said a spokesperson.
Quantas stated that she was in compliance with the current rules for the time being.
"In accordance with our current policy, electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing, and we do not intend to change this immediately," she said.
FAA's decision applies to US airlines.
However, we are still interested in regulatory developments that could benefit passengers, and we will examine closely the decision of the FAA and its reasons.
For American carriers, the impact of the decision will vary from one airline to another and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will have to demonstrate that their aeroplanes can tolerate radio interference from electronic devices, as well as reviewing manuals, training equipment, hand baggage programs and passenger signs.
"As soon as an airline has verified the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use light portable electronic devices, such as tablets, electronic book readers and smartphones at all altitudes," said FAA.
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew will ask passengers to extend their devices during landing.
The group also recommended that heavier equipment be safely arranged under the seats or in the upper compartments during take-off and landing.
Pia: at least four wounded in a violent gang
The small town of Pia had an unusual excess of fever on Thursday night.
Three gendarmerie vehicles, two ambulances and a cluster of thirty people according to the evidence collected...
On this day of Halloween, the evening was shaken on the side of Pia, where a riot involving several people broke out on the side of the Post.
At least four minor injured people would be sorry.
Alerts, the gendarmeries went on site to separate the belligerents and to ensure that the wounded were taken care of.
Singapore Gage Loans Take advantage of the average classes forced to close the belt
At a bank loan from Bendemeer shopping centre in Singapore, Janani Amithalinga deposits a bracelet, a ring and a pair of earrings in gold to pay the tuition fees of his daughters.
"My husband and I just bought a house, so all my money went into it," says Amithalinga.
Although she earns $3,000 from Singapore ($2,400) per month as an administrator and her husband also works, monthly family income is not enough, she says.
In fact, the application is such in some parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt increases – that ValueMax, where it has done its transaction, became the third loan company on bail this week to be introduced to the Singapore Stock Exchange.
Making jewelry is not only a quick way to obtain cash – $1,300 from Singapore in the case of Ms. Amithalinga – but it is almost as good a market as non-guaranteed bank loans.
In general, Singapore’s GHG lenders receive an effective annual interest rate of 17%, just above the 15.4% offered by the United Overseas Bank, a local fund-payer with a branch in the same business centre.
However, on-the-spot lenders have the advantage of not requesting a solvency check or proof of salary, and can unlock loans faster than banks.
As a result, millions of people across the region turn to bankers while families feel the pressure to increase the cost of living and over-indebted households and consumers.
After five years of strong growth since the global financial crisis, and the good market credit fueled by a monetary policy that is too lexistic in advanced economies, low and medium-income families turn to bank lenders to fill the difference while their economies are slowing down.
This week, the Standard & Poor rating agency quoted the increasing debt of households, mainly due to the increase in mortgage loans, as a risk factor for the solvency of Asian banks.
She said that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore recorded the ratio of households/highest gross domestic product in Asia.
Malaysia ranks at 80% of GDP, while this rate rose to 60% in 2008.
Economists are also afraid of the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which has recently emerged from a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, data showed a continued weakness in exports and a slowdown in consumer demand.
"The balance sheet is that with the increase in costs, people in the middle or bottom [of the salary scale] are trying to complete their income as they can," says Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
The historically high prices of gold over the last two years have forced people to exert their personal effects to touch the value of cash in their jewelry.
In Singapore, about 70% of the items put in stock in the 200 loan shops on stock of the city are in gold.
People say, "The price of gold is high, let's put on the gold chain of grandmother and we'll get it back next month."
In Thailand, easyMoney, the largest retailer, has recorded an increase of 20% of customers using its stores over the past few months.
The increase is such in the gage loan sector that ValueMax, a shop operator in Bendemeer and 15 other shops like this in Singapore, plans to develop not only in neighbouring Malaysia – where it already has four shops – but also outside Asia, says Yes Lee Ching, its director-general.
The company will finance them using 60% of Singapore's $66 million that it raised this week at its introduction to the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some low-rate lenders have been criticizing the exorbitant interest rates that they practice, Ms. Yeah points out that the launch offers not only higher rates than other lenders, but also does not directly increase the debt.
"Customers mortgage property that they already own, and the fact that money is their personal property does not increase the debt of households," she said.
The implementation is better and more socially accepted as a means of obtaining short-term guaranteed funding.
The people who go to Gage Loans are not only those who have financial problems.
The easy people from Singapore also go to the ValueMax Gage Loan Shops to get gold lingots or Rolex watches, which can account for up to 60% of their cash purchase prices.
We see customers from all levels of society.
"It may be easy people who need to borrow in the short term for business or investment, or small businesses who have cash needs to pass a difficult cap," says Ms.Yes.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Pastor accused of juvenile pornography in Nova Scotia
A pastor who took care of young people in the Halifax region of Nova Scotia is accused of juvenile pornography.
Aaron Hudgins, aged 30, was arrested on Friday morning following searches at his home and at the National Research Council's office.
The Baptist Church of Timberlay, where the pastor was serving, is deeply attracted to this news.
In a communiqué, church officials indicated that Mr. Hudgins had resigned from his position.
The pasteur was released under conditions.
In particular, it must not communicate with persons under 18 years of age and not access the Internet.
It will be compared in provincial court in Halifax in December.
He becomes a Nazi uniform at the supermarket, before being chased away
A man dressed in a Nazi uniform mixed with a brewed cross was asked to leave an English supermarket, with clients complaining to the management of the facility that called the police, said the store Friday.
"We received several customer complaints, so we asked him to leave the store," explained a spokesperson from the Asda supermarket chain.
The store called the police at the rescue, but "the time she arrived was already gone without sparking," she added.
I was making the queue when I saw a woman who seemed upset.
People were good at mouth.
"You don't go out in the street like this unless you want to draw attention," said a client, Rosa Rusin, 60 years old, in Cambridge News.
This incident took place on Thursday, the day of Halloween's festival, where it's customary to sneak into a monster, but it was difficult to know if it was a canal.
A Cambridge man claimed responsibility for this act on his Twitter account, where he posted pictures of Adolf Hitler.
"I've been wearing a black SS bracelet twice a week for three years at Asda's house," said Paul Dutton, explaining suffering from "mental problems."
325 M$ salvation plan for the Tasmanian health system
The federal government maintains that the 325 million-dollar health plan for the vacillation system is subject to strict conditions to ensure that the government of the State will not waste the funds.
The Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek announced that Commonwealth is currently taking "emerging measures" to end a crisis caused by the ageing of the island population, the high rate of chronic diseases and the constraints of the system.
Funding, planned for four years, was decided after government consultations with the independent Member of Tasmania, Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has proposed an emergency rescue plan that we believe will solve the unique difficulties facing the state," said Plibersek today.
The $325M plan includes a $31M campaign for non-emergency surgery.
2 600 additional operations, including orthopedic surgery and cataract, will help catch up with the delay.
Funding is also provided for clinics without meeting in Hobart and Lanceston, with better external care, the training of medical authorities, mental health services and the deployment of electronic medical records systems in local hospitals.
"These investments are in line with the idea that, according to first-line clinicians, this is the best way to care for the Tasmanian health system," said Ms. Plibersek.
The Minister said that the Government of Tasmania would be confronted with a strict reporting and accountability regime.
The State will have to maintain current funding levels to receive Commonwealth money and prepare monthly reports on the sectors where it spends additional funds.
A three-person commission will be established to ensure that the State provides services in the most efficient and efficient way possible.
Mr. Wilkie said today that the $325 million will not count for much "unless they are followed by a real reform that will strengthen the public health system in Tasmania."
However, he congratulated the Government for responding to the urgent request for assistance made to the Prime Minister in early May.
"I hope that the federal aid plan will greatly contribute to removing Tasmania's public health system from the black list," said Wilkie.
According to the government of the State, these non-emergency extra procedures will in large part reverse the recent coups.
But Peter Dutton's health opposition spokesman thinks today's announcement is "a solution of fortune".
"The reason we are here is that the state labourer government has withdrawn $430 million from its health system," he said on ABC TV.
There can be no government of the state that pulls almost half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth that sets $300 million, and claims to be a fast day.
Mr. Dutton visited Ms. Plibersek to ensure that no dollar of the rescue plan would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
The adaptation by Guillaume Nickloux of the novel by Denis Diderot is marked by a remarkable artistic direction and a detailed reconstruction of the time, but it is also more laborious than it should be.
She was born in France in the 1760s. She told the dark story of Suzanne, a young aristocrat sent to a convent by her family.
When she rebels, she faces the cruelness of a deliberately sad Superior Mother and becomes an object of erotic fascination for another.
The film never translates into lubricationism or sensationalism, and that's the problem.
Awareness of the depth of the narrative could also become a penance for the public.
Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons production capacity, says the monitoring body
Syria destroyed essential equipment for the production of chemical weapons and ammunition filled with toxic gas, said the International Chemical Weapons Monitoring Agency on Thursday, while violent clashes raged in the north of the country, near one of the sites where toxic agents are supposed to be stockpiled.
A group of Syrian militants also stated on Thursday that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the beginning of the civil war in the country nearly three years ago.
The announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OIAC) arrived with a day in advance on the deadline for the
On 1 November, the Hague-based organization ordered Damascus to destroy or "make useless" all chemical weapons production units and machinery for mixing toxic gases and filling ammunition.
The completion of what is essentially the initial phase of destruction is an important step in the ambitious timetable to destroy the chemical weapons of Damascus by mid-2014.
With the destruction of equipment, Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus must still begin the destruction of existing weapons and reserves.
It is believed that the country has approximately 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and products, including measles gas and measles neurotoxic agents.
The announcement was made when the fighting took place on Thursday in the city of Safira, which, according to experts, covers a chemical weapons production unit as well as storage sites, reported the Syrian Human Rights Observatory based in Britain.
The group of militants, following the evolution of the human balance through a network of Syrian-based militants, said on Thursday that 120,296 people were killed.
Among them, it is estimated that there were 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government's side, it is estimated that 29,954 members of President Bachar el-Assad's armed forces were killed, 18 678 of whom were pro-government fighters and 187 of the Lebanese Hezbollah militants.
Among the dead, it is also estimated that 2,202 were deserters and some 5,375 of the opposition fighters, many of whom were foreigners.
On 25 July, the United Nations estimated that 100,000 people were killed in the conflict since March 2011.
She hasn't updated this number since.
Some 2 million people had to flee the country because of the conflict.
El-Assad's troops have been fighting the rebels, many of whom are linked to groups of the Al-Qaida network in Safira for weeks.
The Observatory stated on Thursday that there were losses on both sides, but it did not provide any clarification.
The fights highlighted the importance of the dangers faced by chemical weapons inspectors when they are due to complete their mission, which is to rid Syria of its toxic arsenal in the midst of a long-lasting civil war.
A statement by the OIAC, working in close collaboration with the United Nations, indicated that his team was "now satisfied to have controlled – and seen destroyed – all the declared critical production and machines for mixing and filling".
She added that "no other inspection activity was planned for the time being".
Earlier this week, the inspectors reported that they had completed the first stage of the verification work, visiting 21 of the 23 sites reported by Damascus.
They were unable to visit the last two sites due to concerns about their safety, the inspectors indicated.
On Thursday, the OIAC said that both sites were, according to Syria, "refused and... that the elements of the chemical weapons programme they contained had been moved to other reported sites, which were inspected".
It was difficult to know at first sight whether the Safira unit was one of the two sites that the IAEA inspectors could not visit.
Syria submitted a comprehensive plan for the destruction of its chemical weapons, which was approved by the OICA Executive Committee the following month.
"I welcome the moral strength and courage that you all have shown in the most difficult mission ever undertaken by this organization," said the Director General of Ahmet Uzumcu, in a comment published by the OIAC.
Now in its third year, the civil war mainly opposes the Sunni Muslim rebels to the government of El Assad and its security forces, which are supported by members of the Alauite sect, a branch of Shiite Islam.
On the other hand, the Director of the Syrian Human Rights Observatory stated that there was a strong explosion on Wednesday in an air defence base in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion remains unknown, he added.
Anger caused by the punishment pronounced against one of Bali's bombers
The survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the 2002 Bali attacks reacted with anger to the sentence against the last of the conspirators to be put to trial, saying Umar Patek should be shot by an execution squad.
Patek, who spent almost 10 years running away as one of the most wanted men in Southeast Asia, was sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in the manufacture of explosive devices used in the attacks yesterday.
It could be released at the end of 15 years under conditional release.
The 45-year-old man was found guilty of mass murder for the two night raids in Kuta's popular tourist district, which killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, and caused many injuries.
It was also found guilty of many other leaders of terrorism-related charges, including a wave of attacks against churches throughout Indonesia at the Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecutors asked for a life sentence, but they could have asked that a man named "Demolition Man" for his reputation as an expert in the manufacture of bombs be sentenced to death.
The decision revealed painful memories for June Corteen, a mother of Perth who lost her twins 39 years old, Jane and Jenny, in the destruction of Patek and the other conspirators nearly 10 years ago.
On board the tears, she stated that Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should have followed the same path as the other men.
"He should be dragged to the execution platoon," said Ms. Corteen to the AAP.
I have to live every day without having any other kids or seeing my daughters.
The Sari Club was completely destroyed when an enormous bomb, loaded in an outdoor van, exploded just after 23.00 on 12 October 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's Bar when a kamikaze had a back bag loaded with explosives about 20 seconds earlier.
He slipped into the coma the next day of the attack and remained unconscious for a month, and he was "dead" three times while he was under respiratory assistance.
Mr. Hughes said that Patek should have known the same as the other three members of Jemaah Islamiyah's terrorist cell responsible for the carnage – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were executed four years ago.
In fact, this man should have been sentenced to death before the others.
Keep him alive, so there's no reason to keep him alive.
Spend 20 years in prison after killing 202 people and hurting hundreds of others, that's not much.
Patek is the last of Bali's bombers to be translated into justice.
He had managed to avoid being captured for almost 10 years but was finally arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where the American forces will kill the former leader of Al-Qaida, Ossama Ben Laden, less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI officer stated that information services reports had revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet Ben Laden in order to restore links between the terrorist groups in Southeast Asia and Al-Qaida.
"He didn't leave," Mrs. Corteen added.
Until recently, he was horrified by the sorrow he could have caused to others.
The verdict was held on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the attacks that will be held later this year and marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
"There will be a lot of tears this year," said Ms. Corteen.
Patek may, however, appeal his conviction.
FAA: Air passengers can now use aircraft gadgets (but do not call with their mobile phone)
Passengers of airlines will be able to use their electronic door-to-door devices to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music – but not to talk about their mobile phone – according to the new very expected directives published on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.
But passengers should not expect immediate changes.
The speed with which the change will be put in place will vary from one airline to another, said FAA administrator Michael Huerta at a press conference.
Air carriers will have to prove to the FAA that their aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated the training manuals for crew members and the rules on the sorting of equipment for compliance.
The FAA stated that it had already received plans from certain airlines to expand the use of electronic devices on their aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue are among the companies that have already submitted plans.
"In accordance with the plan, we could approve an extended use of electronic devices very soon," the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers must spread their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the doors of the aircraft are closed.
They are not supposed to be lit before the plane reaches a height of 10,000 feet and the commander gives his green light.
Passengers are supposed to spread their devices on the plane's landing before landing and do not light them up until the plane has landed.
Under the new directives, air carriers whose aircraft are properly protected from electronic interference will be able to allow passengers to use their equipment during take-off, landing and ground operation, the FAA said.
Most of the new liners and other aircraft that have been modified to allow passengers to use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Flight Expectants, said happy about these changes.
"When the new policy is implemented safely – and we will work closely with transporters for this – it will benefit everyone," Glading explained in a statement.
We are quite tired of being "room overseers" when it comes to this issue.
But it will always be prohibited to connect to the Internet to browse, exchange emails and SMS or download data below 10,000 feet, the agency said.
Passengers will have to put their smartphones, tablets and other aircraft devices.
So not always from Words With Friends, the Scrabble style online game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when he was kicked out loud by an American Airlines plane after refusing to extend his device while the device was locked at the door.
And the heavier devices like laptops will always have to be sorted because they could hurt someone if they flew through the cabin.
The mobile phones on board will also continue to be banned.
The regulatory authority for mobile phones belongs to the Federal Communications Commission and not the FAA.
FAA can remove the ban on certain electronic devices during take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, a national safety expert on CBS News, said that mobile phones were always considered at risk.
"The mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they could possibly create interference with the navigation instruments, but because we know, according to the FCC, that they could disrupt mobile phone antennas if they were used on board," Rosenker said.
An Industrial Advisory Committee established by FAA to address the problem recommended last month that the government authorise the wider use of personal electronic devices.
The pressure on FAA has increased over the last few years to ease restrictions on their use.
Detractors such as Senator Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., argue that there is no valid security reason for these prohibitions.
Restrictions are also becoming increasingly difficult to apply because the use of devices has become omnipresent.
Some studies indicate that at least one third of passengers forget to extend their devices, or deliberately do so.
The FAA began to limit the use of electronic devices in 1996 following reports on interference with navigation and communication instruments when passengers transported FM radios, the high-tech gadget at that time.
New line planes depend much more on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed to resist electronic interference and approved by the FAA.
Air carriers have been allowing their passengers to use Wi-Fi at cruise altitudes for several years.
The modified aircraft to host Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of online aircraft should allow wider use of electronic devices under the new directives, Huerta said.
Today's electronic devices generally emit much lower power radio transmissions than previous generations of devices.
Electronic book readers, for example, only emit minimum transmissions when you turn a page.
But the transmissions are stronger when the devices download or send data.
Amazon.com is part of those who are pressured to impose restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers.
In 2011, the company's leaders carried an electronic book reader plane Kindle and made it fly to see if there were any problems, but there was no.
This has inspired the members of the FAA Advisory Committee on milder feelings about whether or not the use of the devices presents a risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airlines Passengers said he thought interferences from devices were real, even though the risk was minimal.
Other committee members stated that there are only anecdotic reports from pilots that indicate that aircraft can interfere with aircraft systems, and that most of them are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that FAA authorize pilots to ask passengers to extend their equipment during landings to instruments under low visibility conditions.
A group of the travel industry welcomed changes, calling them sound arrangements for technology-equipped travellers.
"We are happy that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not incompatible with security," said Roger Dow, President and Director of the U.S. Travel Association.
A helicopter of a North Sea platform has been released in nature
A bird, helicoptered after being found exhausted on an oil platform in the North Sea, was released in nature.
A helicopter headed by Aberdeen was mounted on board the last month before being set up by the Scottish SPCA in its Alloa Rescue Center.
Center director Colin Seddon said: "This water stream was probably a winter migrant who came from northern Europe and was caught in the midst of violent winds in the North Sea."
It seems that the exhausted bird would have managed to find refuge on the oil platform.
He added: "He was unable to fly again, so we were contacted to provide our help."
The water stream was in good health when it was released.
Is the European elite ready to deal with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the promise to bring businesses together and to define what rich and job-creators want to see in our relationship with the EU.
To do this, we have ordered the largest and most comprehensive investigation of British business leaders and asked them what they thought of Britain, businesses and the EU.
YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 business leaders, representing globally all sizes of businesses, sectors and regions of Britain.
The findings of the investigation will be a surprise for many.
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now looking for export outside Europe, focusing on countries that are modernising and developing while the EU states are stagnant.
They want to see the government give priority to new trade relations with countries such as China, India and Brazil rather than to join the long and hard process of reforming European institutional arches.
When asked for advice on specific policy issues – ranging from monopolies to product laws – the majority of business leaders believe that controlling these key competences should return to Westminster's hands.
The single market has caused general discontent, companies saying that the cost of the Brussels Regulation is disproportionate to the benefits of the European area of trade – 40% of the major companies, traditionally the most pro-European ones, are even in agreement.
Finally, and more specifically, our investigation with business leaders revealed that an important majority wanted to see Britain pursue initiatives to change the Treaty and develop a trade-based relationship with the EU and not politics.
This conclusion, which is found in all major groups and businesses of all sizes, shows that the business world is insisting on a "significant change" that gives power to the United Kingdom.
The issues are high – to change the treaty and better represent Britain's interests would allow for a 16% ballot vote in favour of the country's maintenance in the EU during a referendum.
The Prime Minister should not doubt one moment: this survey shows that British companies support this plan to renegotiate the terms of Britain's accession to the EU.
It also shows that companies expect renegotiation to be a significant change in the current balance of power to return to the United Kingdom.
It is possible, and increasingly necessary, to better represent the interests of British companies, since the euro area is committed to the path of closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be employment and growth in Britain and, as the conclusions of our survey show, this means that for companies this means refocusing on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels regulatory approach.
United States of America in Halloween
In the United States, President Obama did not derogate from the Halloween tradition.
With his wife, last night, he distributed friends to hundreds of children invited to the gardens of the White House in Washington.
Last year, Halloween festivals on the east coast of the United States had been canceled because of the passing of Hurricane Sandy.
So this year, the holidays have come to an end.
In New York, thousands of ordinary people participated in the parade organized in the "Greenwich Village" district.
Everyone is excited, tells one of the participants, Andrea.
I was finally able to put on the suit I planned last year.
We have fun like fools, add Rhonda.
People are happy.
He's a good kid, he's cool.
We really need that.
Halloween is a pagan festival celebrated at Toussaint's Eve, mainly in the Anglo-Saxon countries.
Alexei Miller de Gazprom says Bulgaria's gas pipeline opens a new era of gas
The start of the construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of Europe's largest energy projects, said Gazprom Director.
"A historic event took place today: The construction began in the Bulgarian part of the South Stream pipeline, Europe's most important large-scale project," Alexei Miller, Director General of Gazprom, explained in a statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element of energy security throughout the European continent.
South Stream should diversify Russia's export routes to Europe.
A contractual dispute between Gazprom and its counterpart from Ukraine, through which most of the Russian gas destined for Europe transits, increases the level of risk compared with conventional routes, the Director adds.
Miller added that direct accession to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are eliminated "forever".
Bulgarian consumers will receive South Stream gas at a reduced rate as soon as the entire project is operational in 2015.
Gazprom indicated that construction should begin in other countries below the end of the year.
The pipeline was designed for an annual capacity of 63 billion cubic metres of natural gas.
Pitcairn wants to create the largest marine reserve in the world
The island of Pitcairn wants to create the largest marine reserve in the world, announced on Thursday the daily Les Nouvelles de Tahiti, which receives information from Radio Australia.
This island, east of the Archipelago of the Gambier (French Polynesia), is the last British territory of the South Pacific, halfway between New Zealand and Chile.
This territory measures 47 km2, if there are three other small islands nearby.
It has been British since its occupation in 1790 by the Mutinies of Bounty, an episode of the history of the English Navy that led to three Hollywood adaptations.
A few decades of residents, mostly descendants of the Mutinites of Bounty, still live in Pitcairn, and their income depends on 95% of London's generosity.
The Council of the Island voted unanimously in favour of the creation of a marine reserve around the small archipelago, namely 836,000 km2 corresponding to its exclusive economic area.
An assistant to the mayor of the island went to London to ask Britain to validate this request.
Mike Warren, Mayor of Pitcairn, believes that the creation of such a protected area would be a first step towards greater financial autonomy for his island.
The project must be accepted by the English governor of Pitcairn, who lives in New Zealand, and by the British government.
The creation of such a marine reserve would allow the United Kingdom to sanctify these 836,000 km2, provided that it has the means to ensure its monitoring, which is not the case.
There is no airport in Pitcairn, which makes it impossible to base one or more aircraft dedicated to zone surveillance, and there is no port where to place military surveillance ships.
As for France, it must already carry out very expensive air and maritime surveillance of the five million km2 of the French Polynesian ZEE, near Pitcairn.

Life prison for a former Chinese deputy governor
A former deputy governor of the province of Jilin in northeastern China was sentenced to life imprisonment for corruption on Friday.
Excluding the Communist Party in July 2012, Tian Xueren was accused of touching more than 19 million pot-wine yuans, reports the Chinese official media.
Between 1995 and 2001, the Deputy Governor, who was also the president of the Bank of Jilin, a public institution, helped companies and the authorities to obtain contracts, loans or promotions in exchange for money or gifts, declared Beijing's first interim court on its microblog.
President Xi Jinping, who took up his duties last March, made the fight against corruption a national priority, believing that the phenomenon was a threat to the very existence of the Communist Party.
If the head of state had promised that justice would be as intrusive with the powerful "tigs" as with the "muts" - the subordinate officials - only a handful of senior officials were sentenced, including former leaders of the Petrochina oil giant.
The most spectacular case was that of the former head of the PCC in Chongqing, Bo Xilai, sentenced to life in September for corruption and abuse of power after having targeted the highest functions in the state.
But the government has not shown any intention of reforming the anti-corruption system by creating, for example, an independent party body.
Two YMCA employees accused of sexual assault following allegations made against Jonathan Lord at a hearing of the Royal Commission.
Two employees of the New South Wales YMCA were charged with sexual assault on children following allegations made against the educator of Caringbah, Jonathan Lord, in 2011, at a hearing of the Royal Commission on Sexual Abuse on Children.
But in his opening statement to the Commission, YMCA stated that he had "never had to deal with a problem of sexual assault on children within his organization".
Director General Phillip Hare was questioned about two cases: an employee of YMCA was charged with child pornography offences and a physical education monitor of YMCA Caringbah Hall was found guilty of sexual assault on children in the centre where he worked in 1991.
Mr. Hare said to Gail Furness, a counsel at the Commission, that he had been aware of the first case but was not aware of the second.
He also admitted that the opening statement of the YMCA was inaccurate by stressing that "external controls of the YMCA were carried out and indicated that the safety of children was an absolute priority for the organization."
It was demonstrated to the Commission that YMCA had been informed that it had received the worst second reviews on four institutions during a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities carried out in August of this year.
Mr. Hare, who started working at YMCA at the age of 21, admitted that staff management was a failure with the recruitment of Lord and that he had failed to verify that employees knew that they had to report any violations of child security policy.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual assault on 12 boys during the two years he worked at YMCA.
He was sentenced to a minimum sentence of 6 years.
But Mr. Hare rejected the idea that the YMCA would have a cultural problem preventing staff from reporting Lord's shortcomings in children's safety.
Staff members testified that they had noticed some shortcomings, including the fact that Lord was alone with the children, that he kept them in private, that he had them sitting on his knees, that he loved them and that he had them play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was chaired by Lord and who had asked for training in child protection because she was concerned about her behavior, said that she was responsible for the services in the children of YMCA Caringbah, Jacqui Barnat, who would address Lord "very intimidating and difficult to approach most of the time".
The Director General said he rejected the testimony of the staff that they were reluctant to report these deficiencies to their superior hierarchy.
Instead, he said that the friendly relations they had with Lord had clouded their judgment, which led them to fail to report their actions.
Mr. Hare stated that he had expressed his view before the Council of the New Wales Council of the South, saying that for the organization the lesson learned from "the incident Jonathan Lord" should not be "signalling" by staff, and the Council agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said that the decision to sign the confidentiality agreement staff, shortly after the allegations were raised, was taken by the Director General of the Child Services YMCA Liam Whitley.
He stated that this decision was intended to avoid any contamination of evidence but that it was a "zealous excess" and that it had been misused.
The New South Wales YMCA was not a safe organization for children at the time when Jonathan Lord was employed there, between 2009 and 2011, said the expert on sexual violence against children, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University in front of the Commission.
He indicated that there were "serious problems" in recruitment, control, initiation, training and supervision of staff.
The hearing was postponed until 20 December.
Tony Blair said he would seize the opportunity to return Prime Minister, but he admits that his return is unlikely.
In an interview last night marking the 5th anniversary of his departure at the end of his term of office, the 59-year-old made his opinion known on various national policies.
Since its departure in June 2007 after a decade at the head of the country, Mr. Blair has avoided much discussion of British policy, limiting his comments to foreign affairs and his special mission to the Middle East for the Middle East peace process.
When asked if he would like to find the position of Prime Minister, Mr. Blair would have replied, according to the London Standard Evening: "Yes, of course, but it is likely that this will happen, so..."
When many experts gathered at Cardiff to face and win the horse's trophies of the year, they knew that the competition would be tough.
But no one expected to win Fenton Kirkland, a three-year-old.
Not yet at school and only a few months after making his first weapons, the little one and his pony Shetland Toffee broke through the three tours with great ease and won the first prize, leaving behind 30 other adult competitors.
The two inseparable – which are the same size – were greeted for the presentation, attitude and style of the annual competition that took place at the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
Presenting himself against men and women in elegant melon hats, he wore his helmet a little bit on the side uncontracted to show his two-year-old Toffee pony around the track.
Fenton was greeted by the judges for his natural qualities of little common training for a child of his age.
And Toffee received very good grades for his presentation and personality.
Fenton had Toffee as a gift for his 3rd anniversary last March and he's been dating Shetland since every day.
His mother Donna, 30 years old, said: “Fenton and Toffee make an excellent duo. ”
They presented themselves against and against everyone, but they both picked up the piece of gold and rosette.
It was only the second time he competed with Toffee and we were crazy for joy that he won.
On the track, people who didn't know him thought it was so phenomenal that they wanted to photograph with him.
This young boy, from Nantyglo village near Ebbw Vale, south of Wales, follows the tracks of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been participating in equestrian competitions for more than 10 years.
Ms. Howells said, "There was electricity in the air and everyone encouraged and applauded it."
He traveled all the length of the track running and even though he seemed to be small, he did a wonderful job.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and the rural world and has two chickens he takes care of.
From the way he began, he will certainly soon participate in the manifestation of the Year's Horse – and I am sure he will make a fine performance.
A spokesman for the annual squad show said: "Fenton is only 3 years old, but he knows how to drive his pony."
They're forming a good team.
The judges noted that Fenton and Toffee presented well and the way they showed up on the track.
They are looking for an effective team work between the pony and the trainer – Fenton and Toffee were the best on the track.
I'm sure his beautiful clothes helped Fenton, he was really proud of it.
A Chinese newspaper that launched a call "will be replaced"
A Chinese newspaper that has launched a first-page appeal for the release of an alleged defamation journalist will be remanded, says a press regulator.
The New Express based in Guangzhou published a rare public appeal for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Mr. Chen subsequently admitted to television that he had accepted pot wine to make stories about a semi-public society.
New Express is currently going to undergo a "full replacement," said the regulator.
The "reform" order comes from Guangdon's administration for the Press and Edition, Radio, Film and Television.
A preliminary investigation showed that the New Express, belonging to the Yangcheng Evening News group, had published several wrong articles on the company quoted Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
"New Express's editorial was disorganized," the regulator said in a statement.
He stated that he had decided to "impose an administrative sanction to Chen Yongzhou by withdrawing his press card".
He also "ordered the Yangcheng Evening News group to undertake a complete replacement of New Express, and recommended that he conduct an investigation into the persons responsible for New Express and immediately maintain the management team of the newspaper".
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for the New Express on the alleged financial irregularities of a manufacturer of engineering tools called Zoomlion.
After his arrest, his newspaper twice published a first-page appeal for his release, writing that he supported his journalism.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on a public television channel where he admitted to publishing false stories against money.
"In this case, I have damaged Zoomlion as well as the media industry and its ability to gain public confidence," he said to the CCTV public television network.
I did it mainly because I ran after money and fame.
I realized my mistake.
Following Mr. Chen's apologies, New Express issued his apologies on the first page, writing that he had not correctly verified his articles.
Several important suspects have recently made television avalanches.
Experts say that people are systematically forced to do their own will, despite a change in the law that was voted earlier in the year banning the authorities from forcing anyone to commit themselves.
Charles-de-Gaulle Airport in "unavailability"
In Toulon, the airport is in a hurry.
The escape of radioactive vapour detected on one of Charles-de-Gaulle's two nuclear heaters in mid-October and while the ship was in the sea was "safe for the marines", but it is not without consequences for the Marine.
The Royale has just confirmed the "inaccessibility" of the ship to "the mid-November", "the time to take corrective action" on the reactor.
On the other hand, the DNCS, a defence ship specialist, ensures that its teams and those of Areva, shipped in the Var for the occasion, "are currently on the port."
It is for them, among other things, to change a pump on the failure heater.
"All is implemented so that Charles-de-Gaulle can carry out its planned deployment at the end of 2013," however, DNCS explains.
And the National Navy ensures that "it does not cause any damage to the ship's activity program" to nuclear propulsion.
Let us remember that the Charles-de-Gaulle carrier is lucky for a six-month intermediate maintenance period.
He had set up Toulon in mid-October for training.
This is particularly so as to qualify young hunting pilots.
A "few" circumscribed to the reactor's boundary space was then produced on the French fleet's Admiralship.
According to the National Navy, the crew had not been exposed to possible radioactive contamination.
For more than a year, everywhere, I have been able to find a lot of discontent on the part of the people I meet: monstrous reassessment of their properties, tax flow, the cost of permits of all kinds, administrative costs to end.
Brief, unlimited syphony of our pockets.
Millions of dilapidated dollars could be saved in order to provide a highly respectable tax on those who pay.
Any money taken away from taxpayers reduces their freedom of consumption and contributes to their deterioration.
In Shawinigan, despite the closure of all major companies, there is no doubt about the sumptuous spending and the maintenance of boxing canards: deficit cultural centre, strong subsidies to the City of Energy, etc.
If these facilities are not profitable, either they are sold to the private company or demolished.
It is also necessary to note the expropriation of several properties in order to host a major industry that has never come.
However, I give an honourable mention of the transformation of the former Wabasso into an industrial incubator, but at what cost for taxpayers?
It is not at public level to invest in such companies, but in the private sector, based on consumer demand.
Citizens were happy to learn that lakes in the Fish and Piles will continue to supply the city with drinking water.
As a result of the departure of all industries (large water consumers) and the large decline of the population, the use of water has decreased considerably throughout the country.
Without meaning to waste it, the city will never lack water and the severe regulation regarding its use could be heavily absorbed.
In summary, it is very easy to achieve great things with the money of others.
I'd be ashamed to defend such a balance.
With a gross debt of more than $200 million, this city is no longer able to buy a style without going through a loan settlement.
We have been managed for more than 40 years by ties with beautiful diplomas for most people and I don't think a sheep raiser is getting worse.
Discovery of a drug tunnel between the United States and Mexico with its own railway
One of the most sophisticated tunnels used for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico, with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail systems, has been discovered.
The American authorities described the 4 foot tunnel by 3 as one of the most sophisticated secret passages they have ever seen.
The tunnel, zigzagan at an equivalent length of nearly six long football pitches, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, San Diego, to the United States.
The area has indefinable warehouses, which makes it easy to decouple the trucks in charge of drugs.
The tunnel was closed before the drugs were removed by going unnoticed, the authorities said.
The authorities seized 8.5 tonnes of marijuana and 148 kg of cocaine after the discovery of the tunnel, according to the judicial records.
Three men who, according to the authorities, worked as drivers, were accused of possession of marijuana and cocaine for sale.
They are sentenced to 10 years in prison to life imprisonment if they are sentenced.
In Nogales, Arizona, traders operate large underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels have been discovered following the harvest of marijuana in the center of Mexico in October, thus challenging drug cartels that must quickly deliver their products to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a passage of approximately 700 yards equipped with railways that belonged to the kitchen of a house in Tijuana and went to two San Diego warehouses.
British police issue an extradition warrant against Assange
The British police today issued an extradition warrant against the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assange, who fled to the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and sought political asylum.
Scotland Yard stated that she had issued a "remission notice" against 40-year-old Australia, asking him to present himself to a police station, adding that if he did not, he would be liable to be arrested.
Assange could be extradited in Sweden following allegations of sexual crime, after having exhausted all possible routes under British law after the Supreme Court had invalidated the appeal he appealed against his extradition at the beginning of the month.
Fearing that Stockholm would allow its transfer to the United States, he found refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on June 19th, asking this South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard "issued a notice of resignation against a 40-year-old man who asked him to present himself to a police station, the date and time of his choice," said a spokesperson.
It continues to breach the conditions for its release.
The Embassy refused to comment on the issue of the opinion by the police.
Fear of being extradited from Sweden to the United States where he could be accused of espionage, after exposing more than 250,000 American diplomatic cables on WikiLeaks fighting against secret information.
How biometry invaded our lives
Finish the password to tap to access your smartphone or pay for your purchases?
American, French or Japanese researchers predict a future where we will be recognized by biometric sensors of phones and computers.
Bernard Didier, Deputy Director General of Morpho, even believes that "the century will be biometric".
Only biometrics will ensure the identity of a person performing transactions in a world as transverse and transnational as the Internet .
Private life protection organizations confirm this commitment to biometrics, but are concerned.
In 2011 and in France, the National Commission on Computer Science and Freedoms authorized 774 systems for the recognition of prints, hand-shaped or hand-based networks in companies, administrations, canteens...
"Everyone will soon be able to be identified, wherever and whenever," says Justin Brookman, who is responsible for consumer privacy in the Center for Democracy and Technology, Washington.
The reasons for such optimism, among others, and pessimism, among others?
Biometrics will be based on new techniques, which will allow new services to be provided to citizens and consumers.
Today, in France, the most widely used biometric data is the digital prints, the round of the hand and the poisoned network of the palm or finger.
But each of these techniques has its own constraints.
"For example, some people who work concrete have very thin fingers and their prints are impossible," says Philippe Robin, technical director of the field of identity at Thales Communications & Security.
And the collection, as well as the verification of the adjacent network and the contour of the hand, is a voluntary and precise gesture of people.
It is both a security - we cannot capture this data on their own - and an inconvenience: the procedure must sometimes be repeated and therefore takes time.
As a result, research has been carried out for twenty years on other approaches, such as facial or iris recognition (the coloured part of the eye).
With the increased accuracy of sensors and the computer computing capacity required for data analysis, these techniques become operational.
The precision of facial recognition has been multiplied by ten over the last five years, calculated by Cyril Bataller, Director of Accenture R&D Laboratories in Europe.
With our help, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands have deployed automatic border posts using facial recognition.
It is now possible to identify a moving face or iris.
"Today, we are conducting research on the recognition of voice or how to walk with sound sensors, but we need a quiet environment," says Sridhar Iyengar, Director of Security Research at Intel Labs.
A unique and infallible marker, DNA is also a source of hope and concern.
"In the current state of knowledge, it can be considered as the ultimate biometric data," confirms Sophie Vulliet-Tavernier, Director of Studies, Innovation and Prospective to CNIL.
But DNA analysis is still very long and expensive.
NEC offers the judicial police services a suitcase costing 90,000 euros to analyse DNA samples at the scene of a crime and in an hour.
The use of biometrics is divided into two groups: identification (recognise one person among others) and authentication (to ensure that the person is the person that it claims to be).
The identification so far concerned the issue of identity papers: biometric elements (prints, photos, iris) must be compared with the information the state has on all citizens already posted.
This ensures that one person does not try to usurp the identity of another.
This principle of comparison may have other applications.
NEC thus offers VIP recognition at the entrance of a hotel or shop.
"We will recover the images of surveillance cameras and compare them to photos of celebrities who are freely circulating on the Internet," explains Danny Nassif, who is responsible for commercial development at NEC France for biometric identification solutions.
Other use: take a photo of someone who makes the queue in a store, follow his progress thanks to facial recognition and calculate the waiting time.
The authentication concerned the initial physical access (frontiers, protected premises, canteens...) or logical (opening of a computer).
More recently, the presence control has been added.
"A biometric point avoids the phenomenon of a friend who points for another," explains Cyrille Bataller, of Accenture.
However, more and more, authentication will also concern transactions, especially those made from Internet-connected devices.
In Japan, it is already possible to withdraw money from some distributors by introducing his card and putting his hand on a biometric reader: this gesture replaces the hit of the secret code.
A similar technique is tested in Villeneuve-d'Ascq and Angoulême by Natural Security in partnership with large distribution banks and teachers: when paying in store with its bank card, the customer does not type his code, but inserts his finger into a reader who scans the veins.
The experiment is planned for six months.
If it is conclusive, biometric readers could soon arrive at the French traders.
Tracks to secure users
There are three ways to make biometrics seductive to the eyes of the general public.
The first is to explain that she can make time.
"If, thanks to biometrics, a customer stays in a box for 30 seconds less, it is appreciated," explains the director of a large surface.
The second is to offer personalized services: in a few years, a voice server will be able to recognize your voice and offer you custom options.
Finally, reassure by putting in place the precautions taken to protect databases.
"The digital prints are stored on a first server; the identities of people are in a second base: the correlation between the two numbers is encrypted and stored in a highly secure box, which blocks if you try to move it," says Philippe Robin, of Thales.
However, due to the lack of detailed studies, it is impossible to know if these speeches really convince users.
Private life protection specialists, they, continue to worry.
"The progress of facial recognition, the multiplication of surveillance cameras and the enormous amount of photos available on Facebook, Flickr or Picasa scares me the worst: widespread surveillance," said Andrew Patrick, of the Privacy Commissioner's Office in Canada.
A driver running at 210 km/h with a hot drink between his legs was struck with an apple of £1,000
A car driver was charged with a fine of £1,000 for rolling at 210 km/h with a hot drink placed in balance between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35 years old, from Tiptree in Essex, was found driving his Mercedes Benz on A120 at the height of Braintree on May 27.
When the police arrested him, they discovered the drink to carry between their legs.
In the Colchester Court of First Instance, Howie admitted the offence of conduct without the necessary caution and attention.
The seven points withdrawn from his permit led to a six-month withdrawal.
Howie was also sentenced to pay costs up to £90 and an extra charge for a victim of £100.
A tax on foreign real estate owners to blow up London's bubble
The Treasury has provisionally calculated the measure of the capital gains tax but awaits a final decision by Mr. Osborne, who, in the 2012 budget, has entered a 7% stamp right for the properties with more than £2 million and annual costs for buyers who choose to hold property in a company rather than individually.
The stamp right already applies to the residential properties of the districts of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, and represents £708 over the fiscal year 2012/13, which exceeds the total amount of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, North-East, North-West and the United Yorkshire and Humber region.
Mr. Cook said: "As a result of the increase in stamping rights on high-value property and the introduction of the anti-avoidant law on property, it is very difficult to move forward that high-value property is subject to the effects of the obsolete housing tax system."
"But this change could make foreign investors reluctant to buy properties in London or current owners reluctant to sell," he added.
The prestigious real estate – the 5% to 10% of the highest prices in the real estate market – in the prosperous sector in southwest London, which extends from Fulham to Wimbledon, has increased by a record rate of 11.8% over the past year.
The prices in the centre of London show regular annual growth of 5.6 per cent per year but have been eclipsed by a "internal market" in full growth, the southwest of the city, the north (7.4 per cent) and the east (6.5 per cent) with a resumption, according to Savilles' studies.
Scientists have just highlighted how the movements of a dog's tail are linked to its humour.
Previous studies have revealed that happy dogs remove their tail more to the right (from the dog's point of view), while nervous dogs remove it more to the left.
But now scientists say dogs can detect and respond to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trente, said: "Everyone knows that, in man, the left side and the right side of the brain are involved differently in the stimuli that generate positive or negative emotions."
Here, we tried to see what it was like among other species.
He added that, as in the case of man, in the case of dogs the right side of the brain was responsible for the movement to the left and vice versa, and that both hemispheres played a different role in emotions.
To learn more about the way dogs react to the cavities of other dogs, researchers have followed animals by watching films containing other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the animals and analysed their behavior.
It will probably not take long before we understand why their tail sometimes goes on one side and sometimes on the other.
Professor Vallortigara explained: "We presented to dogs of the films where other dogs – either a naturalist version or a silhouette to avoid any other factor of confusion – and we were able to trade the tail movement and present it as going further to the left or to the right."
When animals saw a dog without expression remove the tail to the right (from the dog's point of view that removes the tail), they remained perfectly relaxed.
But when they found a tail turning mainly to the left (once again from the dog's point of view that removes the tail), their heart rate accelerated and they had the anxious air.
Professor Vallortigara said he didn't think dogs would communicate deliberately with each other because of these movements.
Rather, he thinks that dogs know by experience the movements that they should or should not worry about.
He added: "If you meet several other dogs and if you notice that, most of the time, the movement of their tail on one side is associated with a more friendly attitude and that the right side leads to a less friendly attitude, you will react on the basis of this experience."
Researchers indicate that the results could enable owners, veterinarians and trainers to better understand the emotions of their animals.
The canine behavior expert John Bradshaw, a professor invited to the School of Veterinary Sciences at Bristol University, said that this was not the first study to examine the importance of the left and right of the canine species.
Last year, a team at Lincoln University found that dogs were turning their heads left when they were looking at an aggressive dog and right when it was a happy dog.
And in another scientific study carried out by Victoria University in Canada, he said: "The dogs went more easily to a robot dog when his tail turned to the left rather than to the right, instead of becoming anxious – the reverse of what was in the Italian study."
He indicated that the differences could be due to the fact that dogs who participated in the various studies did not fully consider the animals of the movies or dogs robots as dogs.
A study on how dogs react to real dogs could be useful, he explained.
"Although many elements, identified by different mammals, indicate that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be specified – and dogs do not make an exception," he said.
However, given the ease with which their behavior can be recorded, it will certainly not take long before we understand why their tail sometimes moves on one side and sometimes on the other.
Arctic Monkeys reports a concert in Glasgow due to Alex Turner's disease
The Arctic Monkeys rock group reported a concert in Glasgow after a laryngitis was diagnosed to its singer.
The Sheffield group was scheduled to take place on Friday in The Hydro concert room in the city centre.
However, his laryngitis forced the singer Alex Turner to reprogram the show.
The announcement was made after the group was forced to report a concert to the LG Arena of Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official site, the Arctic Monkeys stated: "After the decision to postpone the concert to the LG Arena of Birmingham tonight and after requesting medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys must also postpone the show to the Glasgow Hydro on Friday 1 November."
"Alex Turner suffers from a laryngitis and regrets that he cannot happen in concert."
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will take place on 20 November and the show at the Glasgow Hydro will take place on 21 November.
All tickets remain valid for these concerts.
We wish to apologize to all ticket holders for any inconvenience caused.

Pope François will appoint new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22, the Vatican announced on Thursday.
The cardinals are the highest men of the church in the Catholic Church behind the pope, and those who elect him, so François will appoint his first group of men who will eventually choose his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, as soon as a cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the election of a pope – thus he becomes a group of 120 "cardinal electors".
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesperson for the Vatican, said that a meeting gathering all existing cardinals would take place before the ceremony during which some bishops would be raised to cardinal dignity, known as the Consistency.
"Pope François has decided to communicate his decision to convene the constitution of February in advance in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings requiring the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero des Voix catholiques said that by February, the number of cardinal electors would probably have decreased.
He said that a pope generally appointed as many cardinals as he needed to have the number of cardinal electors reach 120 and as many cardinals as he wanted to be over 80 years old.
The constitution of next year will be important because this will be the first since Pope François's election in March of this year, Valero said.
For the time being, there is a kind of tendency to favour Europe and in particular Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new pope will appoint cardinals of the rest of the world to restore the balance," he added.
40 per cent of Roman Catholics live in South America, but a small number of cardinals represent them.
The cardinals will also be the first to be chosen since François formed the council of cardinals, an eight cardinals from around the world responsible for examining ways to reform the church.
Before that, the pope decided on his own.
"Now, François has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," Valero explained.
He added that it was "all possible" that François asked for advice to the cardinals.
But we have never seen such a situation – it is completely new.
Valero indicated that the popes were generally representatives of large communities in the cardinal rank, but that François was “full of surprises – so we don’t know who he will name. ”
GM recalls some of its new pickups in the United States to repair the seat file
General Motors Co recalls nearly 19,000 of its new pickups Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra 2014 to resolve a problem with manually inclined files, according to a Friday statement by the US vehicle safety regulation body.
On some pickups, the previous seats could present a defect at the level of the inclination mechanism.
As a result, files do not comply with the federal vehicle safety standards for head restraints.
"If the vehicle is hit by the back, it may be that the head support does not properly protect passengers, thereby increasing the risk of injury," according to the statement on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).
The remembered models were built between 1 August and 10 September.
The deployment of GM pickups began in June and represents the most important vehicle launch for the first American car manufacturer since its failure and restructuring in 2009.
GM informed the default pickups owners during the first 15th of October.
NHTSA was unable to review the owner's information letter due to the 16-day end of government activities, which slowed the growth of vehicle sales in October.
The sales of Silverado and Sierra pickups, which were redissed for the 2014 model, increased by about 20% during the first 10 months of the year, GM said on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42 660 silverado pickups and 16,503 Sierra pickups.
The GM stock exchange increased by 1.4 per cent to $37.47 at the New York Stock Exchange on Friday afternoon.
A worker dies trapped under concrete blocks
A construction worker died under dozens of concrete blocks, Thursday before noon, in Montreal.
The drama took place at 11 a.m. on Marquette Street, near the intersection of Beaubien Street, in the vicinity of Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie.
It is likely that work on the foundations has been taking place in this area for some time.
A mythical foundation wall has just been erected in the last few days.
The accident occurred when the victim just arrived on the site to recover his tools.
I went by car and saw the wall crash with a big cloud of smoke, said Sylvain Jean, who lives near the building.
I got off and I was going to take off the big bricks that would cover it.
We only saw a part of his back, it's so unhappy.
According to the authorities, the victim was an old man in the 50s who worked for a boxing company.
Rehabilitation maneuvers have been tried by emergency services but unsuccessfully.
Man didn't survive his serious injuries.
An inspector of the Committee on Health and Work Safety was sent to the places to investigate the circumstances surrounding the drama.
The cry of despair of an Obama elector
I voted twice for President Obama, believing in the possibility of a change
He says Obama has made commendable efforts by the opposition of the Republican Party
Obstructionism does not excuse the difficulties of the Obamacare site, nor drone attacks
The 2008 Obama campaign memory is a sad reminder of what could have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris is a 2nd year medical student at Harvard Medical School.
I'm reading a very sad book these days.
It's a book that, I thought, would encourage me during the 2nd year of medicine and give me hope.
It is called "The Audacity to Win" and it is the memories of the 2008 Presidential Campaign of Barack Obama.
When I finished my patients' medical records at night and I'm asleep, this book brings me back to the time when politics inspired millions of people and when speeches could cut your breath.
The election ended with a smashing victory and the news reporters took time to reflect on the historical nature of the moment.
My friends cried joyfully and my parents kept all the newspapers they found.
A young visionary team headed toward the White House and the nation was ready for change.
During Obama's transitional period before its entry into force in 2008, it had 82% of favourable views.
And then I close the book.
The return to the present is a difficult wake, it's like getting out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember these days full of optimism, such as distant memories, a sad reminder of past opportunities.
The change really happened in the years that followed the first time I voted.
That had nothing to do with what I had imagined.
I put on Obama's credit for great accomplishments, from the passage of the Affordable Care Act (Affordable Care Act) to the departure of Iraq from our army, passing through the end of the "no seen or known" and the murder of Ussama ben Laden.
In addition, I believe that partial obstructionism has destroyed too many efforts to advance our nation in the areas of immigration reform, public health care and the closure of Guantanamo, among other things.
But after repeatedly defending Obama's administration against my peers and colleagues, I can no longer provide explanations.
I'm on the side of political despair.
Republican obstruction cannot explain the listening of foreign leaders, nor the attacks of innocent foreign children by drones.
It cannot explain that the National Security Agency collects data on the private life of Americans, nor can it explain the prosecution of complainants who reveal the government's shortcomings.
It cannot justify the murder of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without trial, nor the avoidance of public funding and the overrun of authorized expenditures during presidential campaigns.
It cannot justify the conclusions of a report that says that the efforts of the White House to reduce the media to silence are "more aggressive... since the administration of Nixon".
And, more recently, it cannot excuse the impossibility of designing a simple website for more than three years after the Affordable Care Act has been ratified.
I don't know if that's what I expected.
If, at the age of 18, I was supposed to understand that governance could contradict the previous political campaigns.
Of course, the electoral function is not predictable, because the opposition political party and the events that happen by chance, such as the Newton massacre, influence our public conversation.
However, all the examples I have listed above appear to be largely the choice of administration.
That's what bothers me the most.
I again voted for Obama in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confused and slightly refined alternative that did not seem to allow his policies or positions to be determined.
I felt that Obama, elected for a second term by freeing himself from the pressure of future elections, would keep the promises that had been meant to be spoken for so long.
However, while the favourable opinion index has sunk under 45% this week, it is even more difficult to get back to 2008 through this book.
He makes me want the many promises that have flown.
This week, I read the part of the book that describes how Obama has suffered enormous losses for Clinton's benefit to the Primarys of Pennsylvania.
At a follow-up campaign meeting, he told his team that they needed to return to the right path and remain faithful to their cause.
"I want us to focus on our talent," he said.
We need to remember who we are.
We are here five years later, Mr President, and I no longer agree with you.
The views expressed in this comment are only those of Nathaniel Morris.
On Friday, around 3 p.m., a violent collision between a motorcycle and a car took place on Retinne Street in Fléron.
The motorbike, Jonathan, 26 years old, of Fléron, was not wearing helmets.
Despite the rapid intervention of the relief, he died during this frontal collision.
Clive Palmer claims that MP Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in the parental leave system.
The billionaire MEP Clive Palmer advances that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in the parental leave system because his daughters could be pregnant and enjoy this system.
The mineral extraction magnet, which contests the payment of a 6 M$ carbon tax, argued this argument to try to avoid any conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be crucial when deciding whether carbon and mineral taxes should be removed.
But Mr. Palmer claimed that only ministers could have a conflict of interest and indicated that Mr. Abbott's daughters were willing to benefit personally from these policies.
"He will have an important conflict of interest when it comes to paying parental leave because if one of his daughters is pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether she gets a leave," said Mr. Palmer.
Two months after his election, the Electoral Committee officially declared that Mr. Palmer had won the seat of Sunshine Coast in Fairfax by 53 votes, after counting.
Mr. Palmer has advanced the idea of a change in the suffrage system to speed up the process.
The daughters of Tony Abbott, Frances and Bridget.
Should this election be decided two months after the vote has been concluded?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why can't we have a system where you can log in, get your coordinates into a computer, vote immediately and have the result at 6:30 in the morning?
Mr. Palmer also criticised the use of paper pencils to mark ballots.
Is it in order to delete the result if anyone disagrees?
Today, having a paper pencil seems amazing.
The Electoral Commission has examined possible options with regard to electronic voting and has recently published a joint reflection paper with New Zealand.
Mr. Palmer, 59, said that his political project included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new functions "very seriously".
The exercise of public functions is a matter of public service.
"We do not seek a reward except the reward of history because we must serve the community at a critical time," he added.
A team of biologists led by the Wildlife Conservation Society of New York identified a new species of forest dolphin along the northern coast of Australia.
Thibaut Bouveroux, a scientific mission to the Observatory for the Conservation and Study of Animals and Marines (OCEAMM) comes back to L'Express on this discovery and explains the long process of identifying new species.
Does the discovery of this new species of forest dolphin surprise you?
It's good news, but I'm not particularly surprised.
If, in the past, species have been described and identified on a morphological, anatomical and geographical basis, today, the development of new tools such as genetics enables us to improve our knowledge in species classification science.
Furthermore, it is not possible that these advances in genetics and molecular biology would cause the classification or belonging of a species to a species, a family, or even an order.
At the beginning of the 19th century, morphologists classified animals, based on the morphological differences between species.
Today, some of these classifications are called into question because of the progress of genetics.
Similarly, two very close species were morphologically distinguished by genetics.
This is the case of the new species that has just been identified.
A decade ago, the scientific community recognized two species belonging to this subfamily: the Pacific forest dolphins and the Atlantic forest whales.
The recent analyses made it possible to distinguish four species.
Why is this an important discovery as stated by the Wildlife Conservation Society?
From a conservation point of view, it is essential to know these genetic differences, in order to protect the species and therefore its genetic variability.
If this population had been known by researchers for a long time, they did not know that it was part of a new species, present only in this place.
Therefore, if a problem of massive mortality caused by a viral epidemic or accidental capture occurs in the region, we might have to deal with the extinction of a species, rather than with the local disappearance of a population of a more widespread species on Earth.
This loss of genetic heritage would be much more problematic.
A species is considered threatened or threatened by extinction depending on the number of individuals on Earth, i.e. stock, and the possibility it has to recover from neighbouring stocks.
As for the species Sousa chinensis, whose population of the new species discovered has grown, its stock has automatically become weaker, thus making it more vulnerable.
Why is it rare to discover new species of marine mammals?
Marine mammals are located at the top of the food chain.
They live in homogeneous, open habitats in which there are many genetic exchanges between populations and individuals.
This bridging of genes limits the creation of new species.
On the other hand, more closed ecosystems promote genetic isolation, which can eventually lead to the creation of new species.
It must be known that the marine environment is the least well-known environment.
We prefer to send robots to Mars, rather than know what lives in the Mariannes pit, just 11 kilometers from the surface of the sea.
More money is spent in the search for life on other planets than in marine research and it's a long time that this changes.
RBS suspends two traders on the foreign exchange market
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange market division according to two sources close to the file, which shows once again that the global survey of regulators on the suspicions of foreign exchange market manipulation begins to bear its fruit.
Some of the largest banks in the world, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they would cooperate with regulators in the most important financial market surveys in the world, where $5.3 billion are changing by hand every day.
Both traders are the first employees of RBS to be suspended in the context of the extension of the investigation, which leads to the scandal of manipulation of the libor interbank rate.
The bank, which refused to comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received requests for information from regulators.
"The ongoing investigation into this case continues and we cooperate fully with the FCA and the other regulators," said a bank representative two weeks ago.
Last month, sources close to the file reported that RBS had sent instant messages and e-mails to and from an old trader, the Financial Conduct Authority, to the UK regulator.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and would have been suspended from his position as European Trade Manager to the accountant for the currencies of JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, European currency exchange manager at Citi, was released this week, while Matt Gardiner, senior currency dealer at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders were charged.
Mr. Usher's file included instant messages sent to and by bankers working at Barclays and Citigroup, adding sources close to the file.
UBS explained this week that it had attempted to take action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator, Finma, stated that it was investigating suspicions of manipulation of the exchange market in a number of Swiss banks.
In the world, at least six authorities – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Competition Authority Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are examining allegations made regarding bankers that would have been heard to manipulate rates on the exchange market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Crédit Switzerland also launched internal investigations or received requests for information from regulators, reported close sources of the file.
Banks are exploding instant messages and e-mails sent for years to find cases of reprehensible acts.
News of these investigations has broken down traders in a sector that has been one of the biggest growth engines of investment banks trading units in recent years, but has been questioned this year because of the low volatility of currencies that limit opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to minimize the case by saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the vast market for highly liquid changes, but senior traders explain that this is not necessarily true.
A senior trader stated that despite the high volume of daily exchange transactions, the fragmentation of liquidity between trading management platforms and the increasing use by banks of their own internal platforms "explains that it is possible to start having an impact on the market at a low cost".
The new one came the very day when the Swiss Credit announced that it had sent a trader working in his office from the funds negotiated by the London Stock Exchange this week after he lost $6M at the end of last year.
The bank quickly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with the regulators.
"We are convinced that the trader acted alone and that the case was handled," said a representative of the Swiss Credit.
The investigation on Major Rob Ford has been underway, supporting a lawyer
After the police confirmed that they had put their hand on a copy of the video that would show Rob Ford smoking crack, Me Clayton Ruby has never supported having seen a "so bad" investigation.
I told Ruby to believe the Canadian press that the police had "ignored or minimized" evidence against the mayor.
This Thursday, the police arrested Rob Ford's occasional friend and driver Alexander Lisi, aged 35, and accused him of extortion regarding the video.
Alexander Lisi, previously accused of drug trafficking, was in frequent contact with the mayor.
The police said they had also observed this man delivering packages to Rob Ford, who reported new court documents.
Ruby described it as "inexplicable" because the police had never searched Rob Ford's vehicle or his home, or put on his phone, claiming that police chief Bill Blair had chosen to act against the mayor for a reason.
Under the law, the police, having witnessed suspicious transactions in their own hands, would have been very well able to intercept Rob Ford's vehicle, arrest the mayor, and carry out a search - even without a warrant.
It could also have demanded an instant search warrant, if deemed necessary.
The chief of police didn't comment, but his spokesman Mark Pugash qualified Me Ruby's "evident and desperate attempt" talk to the media in a case that does not concern him at all.
In a press conference on Thursday, Mr. Blair said that there was nothing in this video that could constitute "reasonable reasons" that could lead to the filing of a criminal charge against the mayor.
European Stock Exchanges at mid-session, with the exception of London
With the exception of London, the main European Stock Exchanges are going down on Friday to mid-session, led by some news from depressing companies, while Wall-Street is expected to rise.
In addition, investors remain cautious because they believe that the US Federal Reserve could decompose its quantitative relief policy sooner than planned.
On the contrary, after the announcement of a 0.7% inflation for the euro area as a whole, the idea is spread among market players that the European Central Bank (ECB) could slow down its monetary policy.
The futures of Wall Street presuppose an increase in US action after two consecutive response sessions.
In terms of values, Renault (-4.63%) recorded the strongest response of the CAC 40, led by the warning on the result of its partner Nissan Motor Friday.
The Royal Bank of Scotland (-6.26%) marks the worst performance of EuroFirst300, after also publishing results in the morning and announcing the creation within a deficit structure ("bad bank") of 38 billion books of the most at risk.
On the other hand, Vodafone (+2.45%) is at the head of EuroFirst300 in response to press information that wants AT&T to study a possible OPA.
On the foreign exchange market, speculation on the evolution of the ECB's monetary policy is going well, as John Hardy points out, a strategy at Saxo Bank.
The ECB's single mandate has always focused on inflation, so Mario Draghi and his team have more reasons to act at the next week's meeting.
We anticipate a strong potential for a fall in the euro.
In this context, the euro continues its mission against the US currency and has reached a lower meeting of two weeks at $1.3517.
The same assumptions support the euro area's mandatory market.
The Supreme Court validates the Obama Health System Reform Act
Great victory for Obama administration: The U.S. Supreme Court today declared that Obama's Health Reform Act was constitutional.
By 5 votes to 4, the judges validated the individual term of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – which requires citizens to subscribe to health insurance by 2014, under the penalty of having to pay a fine – and stated that it was constitutional under the government's taxation authority.
The President of the Supreme Court, John Roberts, joined the four most liberal members of the Court, while judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy expressed their disagreement.
The Court also validated the other sections of the Law of 2,700 pages and, moreover, considered that the provision of the Health Reform Act, which stipulates that Medicaid should be reduced if all the federal funding of the program was lost, was coercive in accordance with the Constitution.
The procedure for blocking the law was initiated by 26 States and the National Federation of Independent Business.
All the major Republican candidates for the high-ranking presidential election during the early days of 2012, including the nominated candidate Mitt Romney, have very much opposed the law.
Vibrant tribute to former fighters in Menton
At the heart of Trabuquet's cemetery, civil, religious and military authorities, as well as many patriotic associations, paid tribute this Friday afternoon to the soldiers and the deaths of all wars.
Gerbes were deposited in two of the three military squares of the cemetery by Mme. Jean-Claude Guibal and various personalities.
Approach between Palestinians and Israelis to the Gaza Strip
Four Hamas fighters were killed and five Israeli soldiers injured on Thursday, October 31, 2013 at night at a violent clash at the Gaza-Israel border, the most serious incident in the Palestinian territory for a year.
The only power station in the Gaza Strip ceased to operate on Friday 1 November after its fuel stock has been exhausted, the Palestinian enclave Energy Authority announced.
A local commander of the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, Khaled Abu Bakr, and another branch of Hamas' army, Rabieh Barikeh, were killed by a gunshot in an Israeli army raid to the east of Khan Younes, south of the Gaza Strip, according to local medical sources.
Two other local leaders of the Al-Qassam Brigades, Mohammed al-Qassas and Mohammed Daoud, found death when an Israeli helicopter opened fire in the same region.
Their bodies were discovered later.
According to Palestinian security sources, the four combatants conducted a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian enclave and Israel.
An attack on a tunnel crossed by Palestinians
According to the same sources and witnesses, an Israeli car and a gunned-up bulldozer made an incursion of a hundred metres inside the territory before withdrawing.
The trial lasted half an hour, according to the witnesses.
In a communiqué, a spokesperson for Hamas, Sami Abu Zouhri, paid tribute to the four "heros" and claimed that Israeli soldiers had found death during the confrontation.
Hamas congratulates the heroes of Al-Qassam who fell in defense of the territory during an invasion of the Zionist occupying power in Khan Younes.
Several enemies were killed and injured during the operation.
"Hamas assures that Gaza will be a hell for the occupying," the spokesperson threatened.
On the other hand, the Israeli army indicated that the target of its operation was initially a section of a large tunnel crossed in Israeli territory since the Palestinian enclave, discovered on 7 October and, according to the army, intended for "terrorist activities".
Hamas claimed the use of tunnels to fight Israel, stating that the aim was to remove Israeli soldiers to exchange them against Palestinian prisoners.
The operation was aimed at preventing future terrorist attacks using this tunnel, an Israeli military communiqué explained.
During the operation, Hamas launched an explosive device aimed at the forces of Tsahal (the Israeli army) and wounded 5 soldiers.
Israeli attack in northern Syria
"This mission was imperative because of the risk of the use of the terrorist tunnel for attacks on Israeli civilians," said Army spokesman Peter Lerner.
Israel also hit an air force base in north-west Syria, aimed at a shipment of missiles to the Lebanese Shiite movement Hezbollah, reported on Thursday, 31 October, the Al-Arabiya satellite channel.
An American officer confirmed an "Israeli strike" but did not give details about the target.
"In the past, the targets were missiles transferred to Hezbollah," if he was pleased to add.
Israeli government officials refused to confirm any information on such an attack.
Citing "exclusive sources" that she had not named, the Saudi capital chain indicated that "the bombing targeted a load of ground-earth missiles destined for Hezbollah in Lebanon", referring to the powerful Lebanese Shiite movement fighting rebels alongside the Syrian forces.
Earlier, a Syrian NGO, the Syrian Human Rights Observatory, had reported several explosions reported on the Syrian coast on Wednesday in an air defence base in Sonar Jablé.
This organization, based on a network of militants and medical sources, had not been able to identify the origin of the explosions.
Back in black and white for Marie Chuinard, who presents to Dance Dance her two new group choreographies: Henri Michaux's first inspiration of encres and poems, the second inflated by the famous piano solos Gymnopedies of Satie.
An evening that allows you to see the whole prism of Chuinard, the art to the ticks and the black ink to the white.
A white screen serves as a background wall.
On the carpet, as white, in the vast space that is the Maisonneuve Theatre, advance, profile, finish as a line and dressed in black, a body.
On the screen, a Henry Michaux encrement is designed.
The body, simply treats, takes its form.
And this form will be that of the whole room: an array of physical imitations of the drawings.
The dancers, fully dressed in black, only the hands and face discovered, wait on each side of the game area, rush when the next graph appears, incarnate it, emerge by current.
This black and white game by Henri Michaux is made in relays of soil, in group at unisson (a mass that makes soil), in large group of twelve soils where each executes its sign.
It is thought of "Glorie of the morning", where, on the ground, Chuinard performed a series of choreographical tasks written on posters, put on line at the front stage.
That's the same principle, giant PowerPoint version.
Here, music is strong, beatings and electric guitars.
The energy is high, the pace is always fast.
There will be a crash when Carol Prieur will take refuge under the dance carpet, to deliver, micro by hand, without sovereignty or restraint, part of the poem by Michaux, monocord and monotone in the cry, and will continue dancing.
And the music to share, and the sequence to resume.
This sound and energy discharge, long, if possible, ends by suffocating and suffocating.
As well as the regularity of the visual rhythm.
There are some beautiful flashes - the creation of images has always been a force in Chouinard - like these hairs that ebony or these black fabrics that lengthen the lines.
But the choreographic approach is lacking in composition.
It is felt that the choreographer, instead of going to the meeting of the work of Michaux, was forced, with his ticks.
Result: bodies appear flat in front of drawings.
Michaux' encres, like Gestalt's forms, open a wider and more gibby imagination than dancing, more porous.
Only the end, negatively, with its dancers made by a stroboscopic light and the white signs in a suddenly black theater, touches the magic.
The audience liked it. The reception was warm.
The Gymnopedies, after the contract, are richer.
The scene is partly gray flagged, the dancers and a piano are covered with fabrics, like furniture in an abandoned house.
On the piano, dancers rewind to play the scores.
Their musical illness, touching, gives real fragility.
On stage, the couples pass, in love duos, very sensual, even erotic.
Group work, small transitional soils, sets that move, colors, writing is less binary.
Chowinard's relatives also appear to be blushing the red nose, in very polarized male-female love parades.
Loves are carnage, runners or players.
The gestuele, laughter and small screams beautifully convey the archaic, grace and ridicule of the bodies in the coyte, of the beings that are found.
But the room takes its real envelope after the greeting.
A clown comes back on stage when the public leaves.
There, everything becomes allowed: the fourth wall falls, the explored universes surmount, the cabotin dancers descend among the spectators, glamorous, smoking, short-circuiting, playing codes of applause, tearing the sauce into a very calculated mess that remains sensual.
Joy and madness breathe, and it's Chuinard's art here to contaminate the public.
Google, Samsung and Huawei are being prosecuted for Nortel patents
The group that owns thousands of old Nortel patents has started an avalanche of court proceedings on Thursday's patents against mobile telephone manufacturers, including Google, the company that he stole from the pot when selling the patents that took place after Nortel's bankruptcy.
Rockstar, the consortium that acquired Nortel patents for $4.5 Md, filed a complaint against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement before the United States Court of Justice in Texas.
Rockstar is held jointly by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of having violated seven patents.
Patents contain technologies that show advertising in relation to Internet search terms, have indicated the conclusions of the trial, which is the heart of Google's business.
It was not possible to join the representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC make phones that work under the Google Android operating system, which provides fierce competition for Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial offer of $900 million for Nortel patents.
Google has increased its offer several times, to finally offer $4.4 Md.
After losing Nortel's patents against Rockstar, Google subsequently acquired Motorola Mobility for an amount of $12.5 MD, a market in part based on the Motorola Patent Library.
"Although it failed in its attempt to acquire the patents in question during the auctions, Google has violated and continues to violate those patents," the trial concluded.
Rockstar claims more damage and interests to Google because he claims that the violation of Google's patents is persistent, according to the complainant.
Explosion of a house in Gesves: a defective water heater at the origin of the explosion
The grandmother would have lit a cigarette during a gas leak.
The explosion of a residence in Gesves, which caused two serious injuries on Friday morning, a 52-year-old grandmother and her 5-year-old grandson, is due to a leak from a defective hot water, reported on Friday evening the replacement of the King's prosecutor.
The on-site expert at the parquet ensures that the origin of the explosion is purely accidental.
The grandmother lit a cigarette while there was a leak and a gas accumulation.
The vital prognosis of the two victims is always engaged.
The grandmother was designed by the explosion and is severely burned.
The little boy, who was staying with his grandfather and his companion, was next to him and was burned more slightly.
"The two victims were intubated and long-termly conditioned on site before being taken to the CHU de Liège, she was in helicopter, in ambulance," said Mayor José Paulet, who came down to the places.
Traumatized, the grandfather was on the floor at the time of the explosion.
He was able to join the ground floor by the stairs intact while the back wall of the house was completely destroyed.
The grandfather and tenant of the neighboring house, weakened by the explosion, were rehabilitated by the president of the CPAS.
The firemen of Andenne and Namur and the Arches police were involved.
The civil protection of Crisnee has stabilized both buildings.
Egypt asks the first freely elected president to lend an oath
Mohamed Morsi has lent the investment oath, but it is unlikely that his triumph day marks the end of political conflicts in Egypt.
Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised the emergence of a "new Egypt" when he lent the investment oath to the presidency, thus becoming the first freely elected president and next to Hosni Moubarak who was defeated 16 months earlier.
During his investment before the High Constitutional Court, Mr. Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamic President of the Arab world and the fifth head of State of Egypt since the overthrow of the monarchy 60 years ago.
He swore to the 18 black judges of the Court whose building on the banks of the Nile was built to look like an Egyptian temple.
"We are looking forward to a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic," said President Morsi during the live solemn ceremony on public television.
"Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundations of a new life – absolute freedom, true democracy and stability," explained Mr. Morsi, a 60-year-old engineer in the United States, from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group considered for more than 84 years since his formation as an illegal and hard-pressed organization by successive governments.
Hundreds of soldiers and policemen kept the building when Mr. Morsi arrived shortly after 11 a.m., local time, followed by a small convoy.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered before the Court to summon the new President and, as the Presidential Chair of the years of Moubarak, the movement was only briefly interrupted to allow the passage of his convoy into the very frequent streets linking the city centre to the southern suburbs.
Considered as the little charismatic "refuge wheel" of the Muslim Brotherhood, his personal prestige has been considerably strengthened since his victory and his speech on Friday, in which he tried to present himself as the candidate not only of the Islamists but of all those who wanted to finish the work initiated during the 2011 uprising against President Moubarak.
"Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," said Mohamed Morsi, in blue and red tie, addressing the judges present in the woodlanded chamber where he lent his oath.
Later, Mr. Morsi went to Cairo University where he gave his speech on investment.
He was officially welcomed by a military fan who played the national hymen while he was on guard.
Major Hussein Tantaoui attended the ceremony.
On his arrival, he was welcomed by the song "The People and the Army, Hand in Hand..." enchanted by thousands of people gathered in the great amphitheater of the university.
Founded in 1908 and the former foundation of secular education, Cairo University later became a fife of Islamic student groups in the 1970s.
Mr. Morsi made a symbolic oath on Friday at Tahrir Square, from which the uprising that ended the authoritarian regime of Moubarak last year, and swore to recover the presidential powers of which the military council, which replaced the defeated former president, had deposited it.
But by accepting to give an official oath before the Court, rather than before Parliament as it is used, he leans forward to the will of the army, showing that the struggle for power is not over.
Mr. Morsi's speech on Tahrir Square was accompanied by spectacular populist gestures.
Shutdown in the United States has slowed the rise in the car market
The closure for 16 days in most federal administrations has weighed on the growth of car sales in the United States in October, showing the figures published on Friday by the manufacturers, five of the main six that achieved less than expected performance.
The three major producers in Detroit show a two-digit growth compared to October 2012, but only General Motors did better than expected.
The analysts anticipated on average 15.4 million annual sales and adjusted seasonal changes, but the market was set up at 15.3 million according to Adam Jonas, an analyst by Morgan Stanley.
In a note to the bank's customers, he believes that this slight break of brake is primarily explained by "the "shutdown" government and its impact on the consumer's feelings during the first fifty months of the month".
However, GM reported an increase of nearly 16% of its sales last month to 226,402 vehicles, compared with 211,563 expected by consensus.
The group's four brands have seen their commercial performance improve compared to October 2012.
Ford, who continues to benefit from, among other things, the success of his pick-up, saw his sales progress from 14 per cent over a year to 191,985 vehicles, while consensus was expected to be 194,301.
On the other hand, Chrysler, controlled by Fiat, announced an increase of 11% of its sales to 140 083 vehicles, compared to 143 536 expected.
Toyota and Nissan also show lower sales than consensus, despite increases of 8.8% and 14.2%, respectively.
At the New York Stock Exchange, GM had 1.4% at 16:35 GMT while Ford had 1.1%.
Renault plumbed in Borse by the warning of Nissan
Renault charges Friday with the highest decrease in the SBF 120 index in Paris after his partner Nissan Motor announced that it had reduced its annual net profit forecast by almost 20%, according to traders.
Nissan, who had to carry out such a review, also announced a change of direction.
Several traders reported that the action of Renault was affected this morning by the "warning".
"It is clearly the profit of Nissan's warning," says one responsible for the trading of a Parisian broker.
As part of the Renault-Nissan alliance, Renault holds 43.4% of the capital of Nissan and the Japanese manufacturer 15% of the French, according to data from the website of Nissan.
Greece: two dead in a shooting near a location of the neo-Nazi party
Two people were killed and another was severely wounded on Friday night by shots fired by two people who were on board a motorcycle that was passing by a location of the golden neo-Nazi Aube party in the West Bank of Athens, learned from a police source.
The police were currently unable to provide information on the identity of the victims and their possible political affiliation.
Some Greek media reported that members of the golden Abube had supported that the victims were local guards.
The injured person was immediately hospitalized, according to the same source.
Police officers of the anti-terrorist service rushed to the central avenue of the Neo Iraklio Valley, where the incident took place and closed the neighborhood.
The incident takes place a few weeks after the indictment of six members of the Golden Aubé, including the leader and founder of the party, for participation in "a criminal organization" as part of an offensive against this party launched after the death of an anti-fascist musician by one of its members.
Scott Brown's call was rejected
Scott Brown, the Captain of Celtic Glasgow, has seen his call rejected and will be well suspended for the next two league matches of his club's champions, against Ajax and the Milan AC.
He was expelled from the Barça because he had hit Neymar, and the Scottish environment saw his suspension extended to three meetings by UEFA.
In a communiqué, his club was called "very disappointed", assuming that his call was fully justified.
Nearly 50,000 homes are deprived of electricity throughout the province, shortly after Friday afternoon, due to violent winds affecting many regions along the Saint Laurent River.
The most affected sectors are the Laurentides with 15 042 subscribers immersed in black, Monteregie with 13 464 and Outauois with 8642.
The large region of Montréal also knows its lot of pans with nearly 7,000 private power houses in the metropolis and in Laval.
Did you think the travel agencies belonged to the past because of the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to reverse the trend.
The company has revised its net profit forecast to increase and hopes for record results thanks to vacationers in Australia and the United Kingdom.
The travel agency is now expecting a underlying benefit for the entire fiscal year between $325 and $340 million, compared with a previous forecast of $305 to $315 million.
If the current forecasts are met, this will represent 12 to 17% of growth compared to the record profit of $290.4 M in 2011/12.
The Director General, Graham Turner, said that the Flight Centre had achieved 8 per cent of the benefits in the first half and that the second half had taken effect, in particular with regard to travel other than business travel in Australia and the United Kingdom.
"Since the beginning of the year, the 10 countries in which we are present are profitable, and several of them are well on track to achieve record results on the whole of the year before interest and taxes are deducted," he said.
This concerns Australia and the United Kingdom, which are generally the countries that generate the greatest profits.
In Australia, the leisure sector rebounded during the second half of the year, making it possible to compensate for a low domestic market for business travel.
Also in the United Kingdom, the Flight Centre leisure sector has recorded good results while business customers have spent less.
His U.S. subsidiary recovered its losses during the first half of the year, where the seasonal demand was lower and was expected to benefit the entire fiscal year for the third time thereafter.
Flight Centre shares increased by 3 cents to reach $38.20 yesterday.
Unknown people take a hotel near the pyramids of Cairo
Incapacitated strangers opened the fire this Friday at a hotel near the pyramids of Cairo in Egypt, without making victims, as a result of a appearing quarrell with licensed employees.
The kidnappers fled, as stated by the spokesperson of the Ministry of the Interior, police general Abdel Latif.
This attack occurs when Egypt no longer receives almost any tourists since the army deposed Islamic President Mohamed Morsi at the beginning of July and represses in the blood the demonstrations of his supporters.
Schools are encouraged to focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
As part of English literature courses, students will have to study at least one piece of Shakespeare, a 19th - century novel, a romantic poem and a work of contemporary British fiction from 1914 to our day.
The review will also present "new texts" to encourage a more diversified reading.
A course combining English literature and language will be deleted.
From 2015 onwards, students will have to pass an independent language GCSE and will be strongly encouraged to choose a separate qualification in English literature.
The Ministry of Education must publish its new English and math programs tomorrow – the first subjects to undergo a radical revision.
It will undergo changes in other essentials next year.
In addition, Ofqual, the Review Regulatory Office, will reveal a change in the GCSE structure, with a new rating system and less courses.
Speaking in summer, Michael Gove, Minister of Education, said that there was a "wide consensus on the need to reform our review system to restore public confidence", stressing that GCSEs would be "more stimulating, more ambitious and more stringent".
Studies show that English schools spend less time on maths (116 hours a year, or 3 hours a week during the school year) than most other countries.
In comparison, Australian schools offer an average of 143 hours a year, and Singapore students make about 138 hours.
Although there is no formal obligation to devote more hours of time to maths, close sources of coalition government have indicated that the GCSE of deeper maths – as well as the greater importance given to materials in international classifications – would probably encourage schools to provide more lessons.
The programme will focus more on the "real world problems", including financial mathematics.
This judgment means that a legislative text adopted in July in that State and widely challenged the right to abortion will enter into force.
An octogenary welcomes children with a gun in Muy for Halloween
The 9- and 13-year-olds made door-to-door calls for candy at Halloween's evening.
One of Muy's neighborhood rivals visited by children opened the door holding his hunting rifle.
The old man, 86 years old, explained to the gendarmeries that he was afraid.
His gun was arrested.
The former leader of the Gestapo buried in a Jewish cemetery
Müller, who disappeared at the end of World War II without ever finding his mark, was actually buried in a common grave of a Jewish cemetery in Berlin, says the leader of the Memorial of German Resistance, Professor Johannes Tuchel, in Bild.
Müller didn't survive the end of the war.
"His body was buried in a common grave of the Jewish cemetery in Berlin-Mitte in 1945," he assured the newspaper with a large drawing based on archive documents.
This revelation, 68 years after the end of the Nazi regime of Adolf Hitler, would respond to one of the great enigmas of the Postwar.
The German secret services, the BND, would also provide during the summer of 1949, Müller was in Karlovy Vary, then in Czechoslovakia, according to a document obtained by Bild.
Secret services were completely wrong.
"Since August 1945, Müller's body has been found in a temporary grave near the former Ministry of the Reich's Aviation by a commando," said Mr. Tuchel.
He was wearing "a general uniform."
"In the left-hand interior pocket were his service states with a photo," he continued.
Bild also publishes a document from the district district of Mitte in Berlin indicating that it was buried in the Jewish cemetery of the district.
The President of the Central Council of the Jews of Germany, Dieter Graumann, was shocked by this revelation.
One of the most brutal Nazi Sadducees is buried in a Jewish cemetery, it is an enormous taste.
"A massive crowd of victims' memories," he said in the newspaper.
Heinrich Müller is one of the important personalities of the Third Reich that have never been captured.
He participated in the Wansee conference in January 1942, which decided on the "final solution" and was, in particular, under his orders, Adolf Eichmann, responsible for the "logistic" of the extermination of the Jews, sentenced to death and executed in Israel in 1962.

Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free health care in the villages of Cameroon
Dr. Bwelle and his team spend almost all their weekends seeing hundreds of patients
There are not many doctors in this West African country, nearly 1 per 5,000 inhabitants.
Vote here or via your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 Heroes CNN of 2013.
You can vote for him, or one of the 10 other heroes, to elect "Heroes CNN of the Year".
This person will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years Georges Bwelle looked at his sick father to alter the periods of consciousness and unconsciousness and to go to hospitals that were not equipped to come to his aid.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he had only one broken arm, but he contracted an infection that spread to his brain, creating a hematoma that he was going to carry the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," said Georges Bwelle.
We'd have taken him abroad if we had enough money.
Instead, Dr. Bwelle spent years accompanying his father to hospitals and hospitals, so that he could get any treatment he could benefit from.
"It's not easy," adds Mr. Bwelle.
You can leave the house at 5:00, go to the hospital to be the first, and you're not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
People can die because they've been waiting too long.
The situation has not changed much since Dr. Bwelle's father died in 2002.
In Cameroon, there are only 1 doctor for 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.
As a comparison, the ratio in the United States is 1 doctor for 413 inhabitants.
And even if they could see a doctor, many Cameroonans could not pay for the consultation.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and almost three quarters of the country's health expenditure is achieved in the private sector.
"The only problem they have is poverty," explained Dr. Bwelle.
And because of poverty, they cannot enjoy life.
After seeing his father and so many of his compatriots suffered, Dr. Bwelle was determined to try to change the course of things.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers did more than 700 surgical acts for free last year.
He became a doctor himself, working as a vascular surgeon at Yaoundé Central Hospital.
And he created a non-profit humanitarian association, ASCOVIME, which went to rural areas during the weekend to provide free health care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, with 30 people, they get into vans after they have fixed the medical equipment on the roof and cross difficult terrain to go to villages that need the most help.
The chance doesn't always follow them.
They often had to drive vehicles to cross rivers or busy tracks.
But when they arrive, they are received as heroes: the community organizes a party, song and dance and offers them the best accommodations available.
In these villages, free health care is a good reason to celebrate, and Dr. Bwelle – with his big smile and energy – is more than happy to join the parties.
The following morning, the team begins to receive hundreds of patients.
"We receive 500 people on each visit," said Mr. Bwelle.
Sometimes they live 60 km from the village, and they come walking.
In this traveling hospital, various health care is provided.
Many people are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others can receive bedding, a pair of glasses collected or a free birth certificate – a document needed to go to school, but many poor families simply cannot afford to buy it.
In the evening, the practical team of simple surgical acts under local anesthesia.
The operations are generally performed in a school, a mayor or a house; after the intervention, the patient wakes up and goes into the wake room to leave his room to the next person.
Thanks to the lighting of the electrical group, the operating room and the sterilization of the equipment, Dr. Bwelle and his volunteers are working until the first hours of Sunday morning.
It is an exciting pace, but the musicians of the villages generally help the team to remain motivated.
"They hit drums all night to keep us awake so that we can continue working," said Mr. Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team returns to town, tired but proud of the work it has done.
The group, composed of Cameroonian doctors and medical students, has performed 700 surgical acts free of charge during the past year, and he knows that their presence can make a difference for those to whom they come for help.
One man explained that the free operation he had suffered to care for a hernie would allow him to work again.
"This will change my future and that of my family," said the man.
In addition to having this travelling hospital live and work as a surgeon at the hospital, Dr. Bwelle also works in private medical offices around Yaoundé.
This is the second job, he explains, which accounts for 60% of his association; the rest is covered by private donations.
"I don't know when he's asleep," said Katie O'Malley, a medical student in the second year of Drexel University in Philadelphia and volunteering within Dr. Bwelle's group.
He is still at the hospital or trying to find money for his association in order to be able to conduct these campaigns.
For medical students and nursing students such as Katie O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join Mr. Bwelle in his missions, this is an opportunity for learning on the ground that they do not have at their home.
"We were able to participate in operations to help shed blood or transfer the instruments to Dr. Bwelle," Ms. O'Malley explained.
It's not something you have the opportunity to do in America when you're studying medicine in the second year.
Voluntary students generally pay their trip to Cameroon, and often arrive with the medical equipment collected.
But once in Yaoundé, their pension, transport and education are taken care of by Dr. Bwelle.
"It's a hero, there's no doubt," said Katie O'Malley.
He gives his life for this association, and his desire to help the Cameroonese people is not close to expanding.
For Dr. Bwelle, the relatively constant workload is not a challenge.
Helping others to live happily by keeping his promise to his father is something that brings him great joy.
"I'm so happy when I do this job," Mr. Bwelle added.
And I think about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
Making people laugh and relieve the pain are the reasons that motivate me to do this.

The two Frances de Pierre Nora
Perplexes, university students have long been reluctant to define and place Pierre Nora.
Professor in the amphitheaters and classrooms?
No doubt, but by stressing his weakness for the crossing paths, Sciences-Po, the Higher Studies.
Arbitrator of other works in his Gaston-Gallimard Street office?
Indeed, but ignoring the hidden work and underground writing of the editor.
Inheritance of the fable that occupies Fontenelle at the French Academy?
Of course, but knowing that such a sacred could not replace the true holy oil, that of the thesis, which happened.
They volunteered to recognize in him a great wake-up, animator and a federator of their work, but noting that he would be less inclined to produce it himself.
In this uncertain image the monument of the "Memorial Places", to which he attached his name, also contributed.
The wicked languages were able to see a huge market in the pot, presented by an intelligent commentator, with a sharp eyebrows and a lack of education, but incorruptiblely diletting.
The two books published by Nora here for two years have already established that the one who passed to not write had much and well written.
The book here should definitely make him righteous.
Once again, however, there is the temptation of obesity, intellectual vagabonding, the retirement to jump as joint feet from one subject to another.
But we quickly understand that the missing objects gathered in this book so beautifully bring the broker back to one and the same passion: the discovery of the constituent node of the French identity.
Why are these dramatic calls to national unity?
Identity: it's a matter of time.
Little by little, we have been collectively invited to give a definition of this.
But in the peremptory spirit of our leaders at that time, French identity was a timeless essence.
It was only necessary to deploy accidents, and the case, compulsory jacobinism, was entrusted to prefects and subprefects, authorized interpreters.
The one who tracks Pierre Nora is everything else.
He does not inherit an eternal free will, he refuses to define it.
An anxious analyst of a family stranger, he is mistaken in a forest of symbols, arrested at each step by an object in the form of a receipt, tortured by annoying questions.
So this one, who is born of the company itself: why, in a country so long-termly established in its borders, so old-fashioned and solidly illustrated, do these dramatic calls be heard at the unit?
They are not so urgent, says Pierre Nora, but to conjure up the birth of the differences in French history.
Francs and Gaulois, Armagnacs and Burguignons, Catholics and Protestants: the forces of division, here, are very old.
And the most emblematic is of course the one that closes national history.
On the basis of the earthquake of the Revolution, the French have two stories and they have two nations, one monarchy, the other revolutionary.
The second wanted the death of the first, but did not succeed in denying it; concerned about finding its sacredness and more eagerness to unity and indivisibility that it had cut its head to the one who was its evident and powerful incarnation.
And from there, an invincibly binary nation shared between the left and the right, laity and Catholicism, worship and hatred of the revolution.
To feel this singularity of French identity, nothing is worth the four steps outside Hexagon, so that the American escape of Pierre Nora might well be the heart of his book.
Because America and France each made a revolution, drafted a declaration of rights, and wanted to establish a new society.
But the American cousinry only makes it better to highlight what's clean for us.
There were men who had left their Old Regime in England and no longer cared about it.
Here, men in charge of an ancient indigenous regime, and much more radical.
There's a consensual revolution when she's here sowing the drama and confiscating it.
There are still respected founding fathers, and here are former revolutionaries whose models are hard to make, and who are still intertwined.
There is an institutional consistency, and here is a collapse of constitutions, as well as errors to catch and trials to resume.
France, France, France, France, France
There was, however, a time when the French thought they could cut off the clothes they wanted from their history, and overcome the curse of number two.
At this IIIth Republic, central and creative moment, Pierre Nora showed great interest and even tenderness: welcoming those who were then used to repair the revolutionary fracture, teaching schoolchildren everything in ancient France prepared modern France and offering them a unified version of their history.
But this peaceful identity has only had a time.
The debate is again being debated, which is fuelled by the immigration of a new type, which is threatened by the rise of complainant minorities, which is absorbed in the European area.
The book therefore offers both the fascinating portrait of France that goes away and the scissor of France that comes.
With, first of all, the portrait of the historian, who should reserve some surprises.
It's found that the fireplace was a married man.
The man of the multiple curiositys turned, slightly obsessive, around the same idea.
It was located in the center of the city.
And the one who had filed, here's more than half a century, a subject on the idea of nation, but it was withdrawn from the initial exercise of the thesis, trusts us, cum grano salis, that he will have finished doing it.
Certain in a less sharp, more shiny and more subtle form.
But don't fool us, all equally binding.
Because much more than the figure imposed on the university course, this thesis says the inner need for a life.
An old hostage in Lebanon: "Return is quite complex to manage"
Taken to Beirut on 8 March 1986 with three members of his "Antenne 2" team came to film a demonstration of the Hezbollah, journalist Jean-Louis Normandin was released almost 21 months later on November 27, 1987.
Retired since 2008, he participated in the creation in 2004 of the Association for the Defence of the "Otage of the World" hostages, which he has presided over for several years.
Its main objective is to obtain the opportunity for hostages to complain and bring their hostages to the International Criminal Court.
Held for more than 1,000 days, the four hostages of Aqmi (Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb) Daniel Larribe, Thierry Dol, Pierre Legrand and Marc Féret were released on Tuesday.
After medical examinations at the military hospital of the Val-de-Gráce on Wednesday afternoon, they were able to find their families since.
And try to take the course of their lives slowly.
"The New Observer" questioned Jean-Louis Normandin, 62 years old, former great reporter, retired since 2008, president of the Association "Otages of the World".
From the night of your release, you were on the 20th floor of "Antenne 2".
What are your memories of your release today?
In particular, in Beirut.
When I'm released, I find myself in the trunk of a car where I meet - without seeing it because it makes me black - Roger Aique.
He says, "We're released," but I'm not sure, and he tells me we can still be killed.
We are very excited, but very inclined too.
It is war, and those who lead us are also very inclined.
They put us on the side of a sidewalk.
There are Syrian soldiers.
We then arrive at the hotel's summerland site where the press is present.
Frenchmen take us to the Embassy of France.
It's time for the first blow of wire to parents, family, friends, the press...
I remember taking a bath for an hour.
And had dinner in t-shirt at the Embassy of France.
I also remember a short night to discuss with Roger and Marchiani.
The tension is still there because we have no means to escape to Larnaca Airport in Cyprus.
When we arrived there in a helicopter, we took a private plane that takes us to France via Corfou and Solenzara, where Pasqua is boarding.
How did your arrival on the French soil take place?
We land in Orly.
Chirac, Prime Minister, is here.
It's a little brutal.
There's an incredible shell.
And a lot of media.
When I left, there were three television channels.
I'll be back and there's plenty.
The descent of the plane staircase, the encounters with my son and my parents, my friends, all of this is extremely intense in emotion.
Between the airport and my home, there are many motorcycles following our car that Roussin is driving.
The bikers take off to take pictures and follow me until I get home where I have to do some police to stop some of them from going up.
Media pressure is huge.
It doesn't stop, we're well placed to know...
But the state of emotion and fatigue is such that it is difficult to see clearly.
We get out of a hole and all of a sudden we're under the media fire.
It's a little complicated, a little violent, quite complex to manage.
But we've done the toughest thing.
The night itself, I'm at 8:00, and the next day I'm on TV.
Then start a kind of life-rehabilitation, very gently, for one or two months that are a bit like vacations.
How have medical examinations and DGSE debriefing taken place?
I had the right to a first medical check in Corse.
The rest was made in the Val-de-Grace the following days my return: radios, exams in all kinds and meet with a psychiatrist.
It is not a meeting that does everything but we know that we can rely on him, remind him so much, that we are not delivered to ourselves.
This is part of the procedure.
I also met the intelligence services.
They asked me questions about hostages.
It was logical.
It didn't fool me.
How do you react today to the release of the four hostages of Niger?
I'm listening to what they say.
The debate on the budgets, in particular.
Some things upset me, others less.
I try to share the issues between my past as a hostage and my presidential casket of the Association "Otages of the World" which allows me to distance, and I find it much more interesting to address.
For example, I wonder about the definition of resilience.
Above all, I fight with others for recognition of the legal status of the hostage.
I think there's a semantic problem.
The taking of hostages of "political" hostages - most of the time - and allowing hostages to have access to justice, to bring complaints and to bring their hostages to the International Criminal Court.
Today, once again, everyone is in compassion, in emotion, and rejoices in the release of these hostages.
But who says that these hostages might also have access to justice?
A court in The Hague is done for that.
Why not tell the hostages "you have violated the rules of war, like those of all the Geneva conventions, we will bring you to justice"?
However, it seems to me to be founded, legitimate, hit with the right sense.
This message is heard, but not listened, and that shocks me.
It's my main fight.
Egyptian Islamists in the street to denounce Morsi's trial
The anger rages in the ranks of the Egyptian Islamists.
Two days before the trial of President Deputy Mohamed Morsi, they went down the streets.
Mobilisation throughout Egypt to claim the restoration of the first democratically elected president of the country.
It is not a trial that emphasizes this Muslim Brotherhood militant.
Until now, no lawyer has been able to meet him and no volunteer has been able to take a copy of the case documents.
It's not a trial, it's a farce.
President Morsi's trial is a false trial instigated by a pro-Morsi, he is supposed to judge Sisi, not the contrary.
Morsi must judge Sisi for the Rabaa massacres, Nahda massacres, and the Republican Guard massacre.
Sisi is a liar and a traitor.
Faces broke up in Alexandria, the police used lactmogene gas, 60 demonstrators were arrested.
On Monday, 20,000 police officers will be deployed before the Cairo Police Academy, where Mohamed Morsi will be judged.
Hagel accuses 9 American States of violating homosexual rights
Since the federal state recognized homosexual marriage, "all military partners have the right to an identity card from the Department of Defence and the benefits that come with it," the Minister in New York recalled in a speech to the Anti-Defamation Anti-Semitism League.
"But some States refuse to issue these cards to partners of the same sex in the National Guard facilities" established on their territory, he denounced, accusing these States of violating the federal law and the principle of equality.
Without these cards, these persons cannot benefit from many social or health services provided in these bases, or access their stores.
The Secretary of Defence said he had ordered the head of the National Guard, General Frank Grass, to ensure the implementation of the federal law.
The front of the nine States began by Texas, which refused to implement these benefits on the texane National Guard's facilities, due to a conflict between the texane law and the Federal Law on Homosexual Marriage.
He was joined in his refusal by Indiana, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Carolina and West Virginia, according to a high-level defender of the Defence.
The Pentagon estimates the population concerned by the recognition of homosexual marriage to some 5,600 active persons, including the National Guard, Reserve and Retirement.
Sixth edition of the Play Skateboard this Saturday in Hyères
The sixth edition of the Play Skateboard takes place on Saturday 2 November at the skate park in Hyères.
Organized by SK8 Unity of the Bump Association, the competition should bring together the best skaters in the region.
Registrations are held on Saturday morning from 9 a.m. and the qualifying phases will begin at 10 a.m. before the scheduled end at 3 p.m. and the price will be returned at 4 p.m.
The public will be able to admire the technical advances of young people who, for some, already attend the highest level competitions, like the young prodigy Lorenzo Palumbo.
At only 10 years of age, he has already won his place this year for the European Championships in Copenhagen and he likes nothing more than to show off to competitors who are more than three heads.
The Mayor of Toronto chases journalists to ask him about a drug affair
In Canada, the Mayor of Toronto is suspected of drug use, according to several media.
A video released to justice seems to support these suspicions.
The interested person, Rob Ford, has always refused to use crack, while recognizing having a pen for cannabis.

A case of rabies detected in a cat in the Val-d'Oise
The authorities announced on Thursday, October 31, that a case of rabies had been detected in a caton in the Val-d'Oise, manifestly of foreign origin, while France has been free of indigenous cases since 2001.
The caton was found in Argentina on 25 October and died on 28 October.
The diagnosis of anger was confirmed by the Pasteur Institute.
"An epidemiological investigation has been initiated to identify and take care of persons who could have contacted this caton between 8 October and 28 October," states the Departments of Health and Agriculture.
"Five people who have been in contact with the cat have already been identified" and have received preventive treatment.
"To man, the preventive treatment of human anger, administered after contact with the carrier animal, but before symptoms appear, is very effective," the communiqué states.
The departments are now calling on persons who would have been bitten, bitten, scratched, or licked on a mucous membrane or on a skin injured by this cat or whose animal would have been in contact with that cat between 8 and 28 October to contact 08.11.00.06.95 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. from 1 November.
"Since France has been free of anger since 2001, this cat or mother has been imported from another country, not free," according to the communication.
The Ministry of Agriculture states that the last case of "autochtone" of the identified rage dates back to December 1998 on a kidney and that "France is officially declared free of this disease in November 2001 by the International Office of Epizootics (OIE)".
A case of rage on an illegally imported dog from Gambia had been recorded in 2008.
"The anger is a fatal disease if it is not treated on time," the departments recall and it is transmitable for nearly 15 days before the first symptoms of the disease appear.
Obama is walking backwards on his reform of the health system
Under an avalanche of criticism, President Obama came back yesterday on his unmistakable promise and often repeated that “if you are satisfied with your health care, you can keep it”.
After hundreds of thousands of people received notices of resignation from their claimants, the Republicans criticized the president during the last days by accusing him of misleading the American people.
Yesterday, Barack Obama adjusted his original promise.
"The vast majority of people with health insurance can keep it," he said in a speech in Boston.
Speaking of what he calls "a momentary effervescence" about the resolutions, President Obama urged Americans who received these opinions to seek new market insurance.
Most people will be able to obtain complete and better adapted health schemes at the same price, even for even less expensive than expected.
"You'll get out of it," he said.
The Administration announced that it should not be surprised if the 5 per cent of the population who are hiring insurance themselves were forced to change their regime because their coverage did not meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act.
"Let me address these Americans directly: you deserve better," Kathleen Sebelius said in his testimony to the Energy and Trade Commission in Washington.
Ms. Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said that the launch of the online market in October had failed "unfortunately".
"I am as frustrated and angry as anyone," she added.
I'm looking forward to restoring your confidence.
It was an exasperated Kathleen Sebelius who made this statement, while she believed her micro cut, by addressing an assistant sitting behind her at the Assembly meeting yesterday following an exchange of views with Billy Long, the Republican representative of Missouri, to know whether she should join Obama.
For more than three hours, Billy Long has repeatedly asked Ms. Sebelius why "the architect" of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily given up the government-sponsored insurance to subscribe to a regime via HealthCare.gov, which now belongs to millions of Americans.
Vettel extracts a special helmet in Abu Dhabi
The happy chosen Jake Vite Prekop combined the colors of the car brand and the German flag, while integrating the speed and heat concepts at the track level.
The German Sebastian Vettel, a four-time Formula 1 World Championship, was released for free trials at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on Friday a special helmet whose design was made by a 21-year-old Mexican fan.
Vettel chose from among the 1,500 drawings sent around the world, as part of a competition launched by one of the sponsors, a car brand, from its store.
He was invited to follow the GP of Abu Dhabi, with a friend, and can therefore see close to the German champion on the track and in his stand.
Vettel was supposed to take this helmet on Friday and Saturday, to the tests.
It is likely that he will have another special helmet on Sunday, for the race, intended to mark his fourth consecutive world title.
A resident of Aubervilliers launches his party of the banlieue
Don't be fooled.
In the spirit of Abdel-Malik Djermoune, his founder, the "Parti de la banlieue" is not only addressed to the banlieuards.
I chose a map of France as a logo, it justifies it.
When I speak of banlieu, I address all those who are excluded from the great national family.
It does not prevent its project, presented on Thursday in a press conference in its native community of Aubervilliers, from being born of the will to better defend multiculturalism, this great cultural pot cultivation that characterizes most of the districts.
My proposal No.1 is to create a Ministry of Multiculturalism, please indicate.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune, 50 years of territorial attachment, today claims to be "100% apolitic" even though he has not always been neutral.
Military in 2002 alongside Jean-Pierre Chevénement, he then locally supported Dominique de Villepin between 2010 and 2011.
I know that the values of equality that I propose in my program are linked to the left, but if the right-wing people are ready to support me, I will listen to them, too.
There are only extremist parties I'm not talking about.
In addition to multiculturalism, Abdel-Malik Djermoune has built its program - consulting on the Internet - from many topics intended to speak to the inhabitants of the suburbs and in particular to young people: the right to vote for foreigners, the legalization of cannabis, the civil majority at 16 years of age, the rehabilitation of the function of building guardian...
It remains to find candidates to form lists and defend their ideas on the political scene."For the 2014 municipal elections, this may be fair, he recognizes."
It's a matter of time and money.
The Banley Party should still be represented in Aubervilliers through my candidacy and I also hope in other cities.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune already has seven lists in metropolitan France and Martinique.
"And the support e-mails I have received since yesterday don't all come out of banlieu" he rejoices.
John Kerry admitted, without a prior mention, that American espionage "was too far away in an inappropriate way"
John Kerry indicated a rediscovery of the U.S.'s defensive attitude towards his monitoring programmes by admitting, without previous, that on several occasions, the espionage "had gone too far inappropriately".
The Secretary of State also admitted that he, like Barack Obama, had been governed by "automated pilot" when a series of incandescent revelations by denouncing Edward Snowden on NSA's spying activities was seen today.
Flights have put the U.S. government at the centre of a diplomatic storm with its allies.
Speaking at an intergovernmental conference in London by video link, Mr. Kerry said: "It is certain that the President, myself and other members of the government have been aware of certain things in an automatic pilot mode because we had the opportunity, from the Second World War and until the difficult years of the Cold War, then of course on 11 September."
He then became the first high-ranking member of the United States Government to admit that American espionage had exceeded the limits, but stressed that the rights of all had not been violated.
He said, "In some cases, it has gone too far inappropriately."
And the President is determined to try to clarify and clarify clearly to the people that he is now conducting a thorough review of these practices so that no one is mistaken.
I assure you that innocent people will not be victims of abuse in this process.
Mr. Kerry, however, insisted that the NSA was a force for good and that its monitoring operations had saved many lives.
He added: "We live in a new world where people are ready to jump."
There is radical extremism in the world that is determined to try to kill people, to blow them up and attack governments.
What if you could intercept their communications and stop them before they act?
We have carefully and well prevented planes from crashing, building to explode and people to be killed because we have been able to learn the facts in advance.
Meanwhile, US legislators will go to Europe to respond to concerns about the alleged American espionage case and convince Europeans of the need to continue their joint efforts to combat terrorism with the United States, the president of the Senate's Subcommittee on European Affairs explained on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy of the Connecticut stated that he had spoken before the members of the European Parliament and others this week and that he was concerned about the threats they had posed regarding the possible withdrawal of anti-terrorist organizations due to the feeling of frustration caused by the monitoring of the National Security Agency.
"It is really important for the protection of national security in the United States that Europeans remain alongside us in the mutual commitment to combating terrorism," said Murphy, a democrat serving his first term, and president of the European Senate Sub-Commission on European Affairs, during an interview with Washington.
And I will go to Europe to make them understand that we must continue to work together to fight terrorism, despite the anger caused by NSA programs.
The press reports that the NSA has captured millions of communications in Europe, which has undermined relations with certain United States allies, but the Agency's director stated this week that it was incorrect and that it was a misunderstanding because it was related to the metadata collected and shared by NATO allies with the United States.
Other revelations reported documents released by Snowden that the NSA had intercepted data and communications from the German office phone Angela Merkel and from 34 other heads of state.
The Director of Information Services, James Clapper, justified the Allies' spying by indicating that it was necessary and that it was a common practice on both sides.
In this turbulent atmosphere, Murphy indicated that his office was organizing a trip to Congress, which should take place this year, and that he hoped that the delegation would include members of both parties and of the two chambers.
The names of the other participating legislators should be disclosed in the coming days.
He indicated that the route remained to be defined.
Murphy stated that the purpose of this trip was to improve relations, but also to prove "intimidating closure".
He explained that the Heads of State of Europe should be honest with their citizens about the type of promotion programmes they have been applying for years.
"We can change our surveillance programs to better protect European rights, but they also need to understand that we are not the only ones in the world to make the espionage," Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry planned this weekend to go to the Middle East and Poland to manage the resentment generated by American strategies in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as by United States monitoring activities.
The London Stock Exchange closed down on Thursday, plumbed by Shell's bad results and after an announcement by the Federation of Maintenance in the state of its support for the economy, as planned.
An Australian calls for his prison sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old resident of Sydney, sentenced to 15 days imprisonment in Phuket for claiming wrong to have been attacked by a taxi driver, appealed to the trial and was released.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first found guilty by a Phuket Province Court on 15 June of false statements after telling the Thai police that a local taxi driver, accompanied by two other men who controlled her, had attacked her early Sunday, 10 June.
However, video surveillance records later revealed that she had returned to her hotel safely after separating from her little Australian friend.
Phuket's police interrogated Bamford for two days before she admitted to inventing the story of all the pieces.
She was detained in a local commissioner's cell before the court hearing.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days imprisonment in a low-security detention centre in Phuket's area rather than in a prison for women.
This is the daughter of the former Australian Rugby League player Peter Tunks, who called on Canberra's Department of Foreign Affairs to help her daughter.
Tunks told Sydney's Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was "extremely concerned" about her daughter's welfare and wanted her to return to Australia.
"We have obviously lived a worrying moment, but we hope to bring her home safely as soon as possible," Tunks said.
Bamford appealed for judgment and was released after the payment of a deposit of 50,000 bahts.
In Australia, the press said that while waiting, she was on vacation in the Krabi region, south of Thailand.
Thai judicial sources indicated that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer from Phuket, but prevented the appeal from leading to an extension of the sentence that could go up to two years in prison and imprisonment in an adult prison.
However, after the recent murder in Phuket of Michelle Smith, an Australian travel agent, Thailand could also seek to reduce its deterioration of the tourist image, which could lead to a return.
The French police will arrest Anderlecht supporters from other than RSCA cars
The French police decided to lay down strict rules regarding the meeting of the Royal Sporting Club of Anderlecht against the Paris Saint-Germain fixed Tuesday, Marie Verbeke, spokesperson for the Brussels-Middi police area on Friday.
Belgian RSCA supporters who want to go to this meeting of the Champions League will have to use the RSCA movement system.
"The bus convoy will be escorted by the police from a former Rekem border post to the PSG stage," the spokesperson said.
The procedure will be the same for the return.
"If other supporters had an intention to go to Paris by other means, the French police prefecture indicated that measures had been taken to allow arrests or to be carried out by guards," said Marie Verbeke.
Living together in French, the challenge of the Marguerite-Courgeoys School Commission
At the Marguerite-Bourgeoys School Committee, 62% of students have a mother tongue other than French.
That was what motivated, a year ago, a consultation with parents, students, teachers and members of education staff to reflect on ways to better integrate students who live on horseback among many cultures.
The school committee has just revealed its vision of living together in French.
The Vision of Diversity organization has been walking through schools for a year to help students of all origins discover common references that are not limited to French.
The discovery of neighborhoods, our architecture, our places are landmarks.
Great names of writers, artists, whether of origin or of origin.
Who are our builders?
"So, projects are created so that they identify themselves to all of this," explains Aïda Kamar, President of Vision of Diversity.
Michel Venne, of the Institute of the New World, identified several challenges for the school commission.
"On the transmission, for example, of what is Quebec culture, the feeling of belonging, support for staff in the transformations that we live in the student clientele," he listed.
The Marguerite-Bourgeoys School Commission has set up a research centre that will give teachers tools that sometimes come from elsewhere.
Rachida Azdouz, from the University of Montreal, will be the scientific director.
The preparation to manage a class in a North American, Quebec context.
"Various educational strategies, this is the real need," she said.
Research will focus on inclusion in all its angles: language, school, social and cultural.
