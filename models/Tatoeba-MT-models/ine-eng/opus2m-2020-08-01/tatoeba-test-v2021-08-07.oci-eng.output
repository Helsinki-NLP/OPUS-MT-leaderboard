You can choose whatever it is.
You can choose the freedom you will have.
You can choose what you want.
That's what's best for you, sir.
You need to get out of here.
I'll thank you.
It's gone to the rock.
The sauna sounds are real.
And the plague is too long.
That you seem to love the grout.
I'll keep you locked up.
It's time to stay in the elevator.
I'll tell you the truth.
It was too late for the tribe.
They've been hit by the tue.
That you'll need to study me hard the year I'm coming.
