You should not be allowed to do so.
Tom gives us good advice.
It's easy for me to drive.
I've changed my website.
I have eight brothers and sisters.
Were you busy?
Show it to me.
Why didn't you tell me?
Tom won't try to do that.
To start a fight with Tom was not such a good idea.
Tom proved he had Liverpool in his heart.
I licked the bed.
I kissed Tom yesterday.
Why did Tom kill Mary?
Tom said it wasn't.
Let's stop this empty discussion.
Tom cleaned the apple.
Tom didn't read the report you wrote.
Did you talk to Tom about it?
No one would help me do that.
You're Italian.
What's she like?
A pocket thief pulled Mark's passport.
I think you like it.
This magazine costs only two pounds, including delivery.
I'll miss you.
I sat on a bench next to Tom.
They love each other.
Come tomorrow.
What insects did you eat?
I saw Tom hit the car.
Tom can go.
Tell me where the wine is.
You can do it.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I know what the staple looks like.
I can't confirm that.
Mary guarantees that.
I wasn't on that bus.
I turned down this offer.
Mary already did what she was supposed to do.
I've been watching Tom.
Have you booked a table?
Where did the money go?
My grandfather was a hero.
I don't like this.
Use them all.
You were right.
I don't want you to die.
Turn off your cell phone, please.
I'm not rich.
I didn't think you'd understand.
Do you recognize this man?
It's like going to a picnic.
We couldn't buy tickets to the concert until we got the money from our friends.
Tom called Mary this morning.
Maybe another time.
Tom refused to let Mary into the house.

I'm a Palestinian.
I can't do it alone.
You need it here.

What do you think they want?
The people who live in the village cannot find satisfaction in their village.
Mary has beautiful eyes.
She gave me a book for Christmas.
I want a cheeseburger, a round and a potato frieze.
She stole the camera.
Welcome to your new home!
There's a problem with my account.
Tom gladly accepted.
I think Tom's wrong.
Are you all right?
Maybe you're the only one who can do it.
Who's wrong?
Your song forces professional singers to redneck with shame.
You know Tom's lying.
I thought you were Tom.
I don't need more than that.
Oh, my God!
Tom's naked.
He was big.
Tom knows what Mary didn't do.
Esther is a Jewish lesbian.
Last week, I was bitten by a dog.
You want me to ask him?
Tom and I are not afraid of Mary.
Try to get your hands on it!
You're lucky to have such a good job.
What are you holding in your hand?
We're busy.
It's time for dinner.
It's unlikely Tom will forget how he does it.
Are you drinking?
Will Tom do it with you?
You don't sleep?
The meeting started on the fifth day.
Mary said she likes to do this.
What do you want to see while you're here?
Tom knew Mary wasn't busy.
I was only in Tokyo once.
I got the electricity bill.
What color is its glow?
Last week I bought a new car.
I'm sure Tom will be fine.
He cut his hand with a knife.
I didn't know Tom hated Mary so much.
I wonder why Tom was planning to do this.
The presence of all members is mandatory.
Aren't you comfortable?
You underestimated them.
Your parents would be proud of you.
I was born in May.
I agree, too.
I'm happy.
A small cup of coffee costs two euros.
I wonder if I can do it again.
We have to decide today.
Who are you planning to do this with?
We are happy with the decision.
This ashtray is cheap.
I saw Tom kiss Mary.
He was standing at the door.
She cried bitterly.
Tom repented of his sins.
You always tell me that.
Is this Mary's husband?
I'll find out.
The witness who saw everything in his own eyes is worth more than ten witnesses who heard it.
Imagine who I am.
Tom went back to the hotel.

Tom's done.
When I went into the room, she played the piano.
You're very nice.
Where are your manners?
They have not lost hope.
Tom threw eggs in Mary.
When do you expect to come?
Tom was puking his fort.
Tom went to the library.
We need to call the police.
Tom decided to leave early.
Tom told you where the party is going?
Mary is tall.
Why are you so surprised?
It's a chair.
Tom didn't want to wait.
She filled this vase with water.
Tom doesn't hate Mary.
All right, I'll have some.
I don't want to.
Do you know what colors she likes?
I don't think Tom's gonna be here today.
Tom opened the restaurant.
I have to keep trying.
I'm glad you're happy.
I envy your good health.
Yes, with pleasure!
She started playing the old song.
Why do they speak French?
It's a lie.
There is no pyramid in Europe.
Almost spring.
She speaks two foreign languages.
It's too much.
Tom says I'm very naive.
Why are you telling me that?
Let's go back.
Tom's not crazy.
Don't even think about it.
Tom's very annoying.
Are you afraid?
You ruined my life.
We need to think of a secret language.
Are you planning on staying for a long time?
When are you planning to go to Japan?
My kids at school.
I put my suitcase on.
I got out of the car.
Tom has a younger brother named John.
Is there anything you want to buy?
I'm old.
I think about you.
I was just doing my job.
Where did all these cars come from?
I live in a giant cave.
Pour salt on the wound.
She refused to speak English.
Tom didn't know where to look.
We managed to cross the river.
He obviously loves you.
Why is Tom so popular?
Tom's younger than you.
I'm a French teacher.
Tom is very open.
I'm hungry because I didn't eat.
I don't blame anyone.
The plane flew at nine.
Tom is quite free to speak French.

Don't worry, I'll personally check it out.
Tom sucked off by a dry handkerchief.
What happened to Tom?
It's a bracelet.
I've got a lot of time.
Let yourself be happy.
She wants to wait for the wedding.
I'm a little late.
I need facts.
She couldn't protect herself.
Tom leaves Boston next month.
Careful, it'll be hot.
Let's kiss.
Each year, millions die of hunger.
I was wondering what Tom wanted.
There was a wrong address on the sheet.
It's the last train.
Who's gonna fight?
I found a meteorite.
I'm not happy at all.
Everything's in chocolate.
They have moved to another religion.
I need to be more careful.
I jumped them.
Mary sold the car.
Thank you for your hospitality.
What is he planning?
You're the best!
Are you ever gonna do that?
We were able to save them.
He's a strange person.
I've just got a hint.
Mary said she never studied French.
I think I'll buy a new car.
It's our fault.
You're so sweet.
It's going to cost about $15.
I knocked on the door.
His theory is worth the attention.
We're ashamed of Tom.
Help came too late.
It's not a new problem.
The pillow is very uncomfortable.
I wrote these books myself.
She's a tennis player.
So Tom became famous.
You had a good time, didn't you?
You sang.
I've done everything perfectly.
I like writing.
Kyoto is an exceptionally beautiful city.
The following month, I am 16 years old.
You think there's a chance that this will happen?

I like this dog.
I tried to contact her.
What does she have?
How's the exam?
Where was this book published?
Tom said he wasn't tired.
Tom and Mary are doing this.
We need to help him.
It's been raining all day.

You have to stop.
Tom's going to Boston.
Who said you could do this?
Why did you buy a flower?
The clock is ten minutes away.
Tom wants to be a doctor.
Speak quietly.
The sun shines on the day, and the night is the moon.
I got up on it.
You were right before.
I hope Tom will help us.
You have the right to be happy.
What's your rating?
I have problems with the boss.
It's banana.
Tom is probably punished for what he did.
Mary is your girlfriend?
London's been smelting the fog.
I'm so glad you're here, Tom.
Tom's weak.
I told him to come to Australia.
Do you usually travel abroad?
You're supposed to be flexible.
I believe you'll win.
She went to the airport to take him.
Get away from me.
He's in the kitchen.
Please don't be angry.
They won't tell us.
Be slow.

You deserve to rest.
These are the fresh ones.
Tom's got huge eyes.
It's seven colors for fun.
I don't think that's why we should do this.

I wish we could spend more time together.
Listen to him openly.
Aren't you on the run tonight?
Tom never had to learn much.
How's your wife doing, Tom?
I accept your offer.
Bill has a lot of friends.
That would be unfair.
It's either you or Jane.
If I were you, I'd ignore it.

It's mine.
How strange!
Do you know how to read a Cyrillic?
I know Tom pretty well.
I shouldn't have come here.
Tom's cute, isn't he?
I wish you weren't such an idiot.
Did Tom give you anything for me?
I would never have been able to do that without your help.
I always have coffee and snacks for breakfast.
I'm hungry because I didn't have breakfast.
I'm the best.

I wonder if Tom used to ask Mary why she didn't.
Patrick doesn't know how to write.
I was too ashamed.
I went into detail.

Do you know what's causing the problem?
Where's Boston?
I need your opinion.
Don't worry, she doesn't understand German.
Is she hiding something?
Tom said he was interested.
Today I have a good appetite.
We're still in our new house.
There are only two infinite things in the world, the universe and human stupidity, and I can't be sure about the first.
She said, "I'm very happy."
It's interesting to talk to Tom.

He signed the check.
Hey, how are you?
The password is "Muiriel".
Did you hear what Tom said?
Tom reads novels.
Move out of the trash.

Tomorrow's big day.
Is the job over?
Swallow some water.
It's funny, it's different.
Tom smiled at the officers.
You don't have to.
Tom, don't buy that car.
Even a child would be able to do that.
Do you have a copy of that report?
Tom will never wake up.
That's enough.
I was able to swim.
So you bought a dog?
Looks like everybody's busy.
I can't accept that.

When did it start?
I love fries potatoes.
He's almost always in the hospital.

I'll sue you.
Put her here.

He showed me his album.
Wouldn't you rather do it with Tom?
Who ran?
I hate my neighbors.
Who can explain that to me?
I'm in love with Tom's friend.
Am I early?
It's got a serious look.
Red's not your color.
I'm not sure Tom will do it or not.
Tom went first.
You mad at Tom?
Mary lacks a healthy sense of humor.
I'm not going to school on Sunday.
Tom's dog bit Mary by the hand.
Have you bought Christmas presents yet?

So I told the anecdote.
Can we come?
You're a doctor.
How do you like this town?
I like your coffee.
Tom woke up.
How many in one night?
I'm twice your age.
She's like a real daughter to me.

You're too nervous.
Have you ever seen this logo?
About the same time, Tom was in his room and learned.

I yelled.
This box's a little heavy.
They're from Sweden.
They sent me to save you.
Tom understands.
Tom's used to it.
Tom's been working all night.
She's not always happy.

I don't differ from any other mother.
I underestimated the power of my opponent.
What floor are we on?
Tom's getting nervous.
Tom can wait here.

We'll wait here.
I know Tom will tell you the truth.

You bastard.
Is that you?
Please call the doctor!
I'm too busy to go.
Find someone else.
Do you have a professional experience?

I'm sure you'll find a good job.
You're mean.
Tom doesn't trust the police.
Perhaps this world is a hell of a different planet.

I was just.
When did I tell the truth?
I think Tom's a friend.
We didn't have much time.
I like to draw cards.
He's a joke.
What's the computer?
I'm not illiterate.
You sing yourself?
What are you doing?
Tom decided to do it.
Your drugs are ready.
I thought you were interested.
Well, each one of them, huh?
I was so excited that I couldn’t sleep.
Tom's alive.
I was nervous.
Tom recently changed his job.
Tom refused to give Mary what she wanted.
Tom was sad.
She was a foreigner, and she was treated like a foreigner.
Karen went there alone.
Do I look nervous?
The girl we saw waiting for someone at Tom’s house was Mary.
Why don't you quit smoking?
We all make mistakes.
He wondered why his wife had left him.
I think I put too much sugar.
Do you know how to jump on the cocoons?
I know how to do this.
Tom's here?
I don't need dinner tonight.
I have something to say.
The hotel can accommodate 300 people.
That's why I blew the pie.
She can ask questions and answer them.
Tom said he had an alibi.
Tom has two friends.
What is Tom doing in Boston?
Tom didn't think Mary would want to do that.
Tom and Mary said they're not sick.
I've got a lot of time.
One more, please.
I'm a member of the team.
I had an stroke last year.
My mom's busy preparing dinner.
Horses are useful animals.
Come back soon.
He's incompetent.
Foma was training.
He's impatient.
He's sure he's taking the exam.
Tom voted in favour of the proposal.
Tom told you how long it took him to do this?
Let's get started!
Attention!
I'm totally exhausted.
The prospects are not too bright.
I don't believe in anything supernatural, but I'm fascinated by the literary song of the devil.
The bad thing is she doesn't have enough experience.
I spent some time in Boston.
You look great.
I was a teacher.
You like English, don't you?
Tom and Mary named their child John.
I wonder if Tom's actually going to Mary's concert.
Tom said he did that last weekend?
I used to have the same problem.
I love nature.
She taught us to sing.
Let's not do anything at all.
Tom wants his father buried next to his mother.
You think we wouldn't notice?
Your dinner was so delicious!
I just found a solution.
Tom promised me he wouldn't cry.
I'm D.J.
I hate Christmas.
Was the money enough?
Tom found my contact lenses.
It costs too much.
The child's lost.
I just wanted to give it to you.
I want to surprise him.
You need to learn to refrain.
We're fine.
My wallet was stolen.
He knows many.
You're not young.
The same is true of Japan.
We're losing.
The situation is getting worse and worse.
Speak.
The air balloon’s surface is an inexhaustible space, so it does not comply with Euclidean geometry.
Talks were successful.
I'm sorry about that.
Don't you want to come with us?
I was trying to call you.
I never killed anyone.
Be honest and straightforward.
Hope is always there.
I wanted to be Tom.
Tom and Mary will say no.
You're twice my age.
The journalist was robbed by terrorists.
I dropped the ball.
I hate this city.
Now he lives in Tokyo.
The programming language is his hobby.
I'm glad to hear that.
I don't know anything about him.
Tom is a teacher, and so am I.
How many do you have in the watchhouse?
Tom's deaf.
That's why she doesn't like eating fish.
I don't like any of them.
Follow us.
That's what you're saying.
Your doctor says you'll be fine.
You're a cop.
You want to know?
Tom needs to wash his clothes.
I need this money.
My tie is orange.
Tom's gonna cry?
That's why you should be taller.
I'm supposed to help Mom.
His book inspired me.
You're taking?
It's not my idea.
You have a plan, don't you?
He's playing.
Tom's not in town.
I wore my shoes.
The next year will be worse.
Mary in the yellow dress.
It's a bitter taste in love.
The meeting's over.
You had to do this last year.
I thought I couldn't do that.
I've got an old car.
We understand why.
I eat every year.
I felt helpless.
I like the teacher.
We're on the elevator.
Tom is a professional hockey player.
We went to the woods looking for insects.
These chairs are different.
I saw her a week ago.
A small cup of coffee costs two euros.
Motherly love is greater than anything else.
He was a thief.
I worked in a restaurant.
I'm not strong enough.
It won't be as boring as you think.
He accidentally put salt in his cup of coffee.
Tom forgot to tell you.
I'm interested in music.
I don't really want to eat right now.
The mirrors were scattered on the floor.
You're so weird.
The country is rich in natural resources.
I'm Tom's partner.
What a beautiful car!
She went to school.
Tom's sitting next to the window.
Tom is the same as the rest of them.
Tom, I don't think I should do that.
State debt is rising.
Why am I me, not you?
Tom will probably never do that.
It's a doll.
Save yourself!
Tom doesn't know where Mary is right now.
We all agreed with Tom.
I'm a widow.
I read this story in a book.
Tom still got a bike?
Speak briefly.
Tom's smarter.
It was a difficult night for him.
I want to complain.
Don't look at me like that!
I don't think Tom knows anyone who could.
I'm a teacher.
You had a good time, didn't you?
I was born in Osaka in 1997.
You have a good voice.
It's important that you understand.
Tom won't do it.
I hope Tom understands.
She spends too much time online.
You're adorable.
Tom said he'd complain.
Let's meet him.
Have you ever been to Brazil?
What happened to her?
I can't take it.
Tom's hiding under the bed.
Have you ever been to India?
Tom's leaving in thirty minutes.
I don't know who Tom sold his car to.
We can talk.
The computer can count very fast.
You don't have to.
Excuse me, can I open the window?
What's the weather?
I'm thirty years old.
Tom won't bother you anymore.
Would you like some more tea?
It's a Japanese doll.
What did you eat for lunch today?
You can't even change the bumpers.
Are people still using webcams?
I wonder if Tom used to ask Mary why she dropped out of school.
It is a word borrowed from Greek.
Am I going to die?
I'm dying, so I want to see them.
Brother is sick.
Don't rush.
The car is outside.
I was weak.
Please make me a cup of coffee.
Mary lost her money.
There are no rules.
Leila got pregnant very quickly.
He's not a liar.
Do you know how to make salads from raw fish?
Tom knew what Mary knew.
Tom's cooking breakfast.
There is no doubt that the rain will go away.
Tom didn't mention Australia.
Clearly, Tom and Mary are more than just friends.
We actually drove to Boston.
In Iceland, there are many volcanoes.
John's older than me for two years.
Better or worse, television has changed the world.
I'm a little thick.
He answered my questions easily.
What is the purpose of your journey?
Tom's looking for something.
He's probably innocent.
I love kids.
Who's left?
When is she coming?
It's not my style.
Try to focus.
I'm so glad I did this yesterday.
Tom's still living with you?
I wanted to impress Tom.
I just want to help you.
Don't throw stones.
Does she have a dog?
I was a wizard.
Don't beat me when I talk.
Tom asked Mary where the dog was.
Do you often meet him?
You'd like that.
Are you still hungry?
We're crazy.
She's got wine.
You're gonna stop.
She waited for him for hours.
Doctor, I'm sorry.
They made mistakes.
How did you know I grew up in Boston?
It's a very interesting story.
They have two sons and one daughter.
It was two thousand years ago.
Tom's probably gonna do this.
It's got to be the right color.
Tom's got a very strict mom.
After a short peace, the war was resolved again.
You'd better not trust him.
Just talk to Tom.
May I remind you of your promise?
The capital of the Netherlands is Amsterdam.
I don't understand your French.
What is this restaurant called?
Excuse me, couldn't you pass me sugar?
Where is Tom planning to build his house?
"Where's my laptop?" "On the table."
I don't think there'll be any problems.
Tom's broken?
You need to be careful.
Green suits you.
Success comes with education.
I don't like you anymore.
Mary's playing soccer.
How does this work?
You're very ugly.
Come on, guys.
I'm gonna fix this for a while.
When is his return expected?
I had a good time.
He's no less good than his sister.
Tom beats Mary.
I'm making too many mistakes.
He is not afraid of death.
It would be good if there were 28 hours in time, wouldn't it?
Kobe is the city where I was born.
He wants this disaster not to happen.
We don't expect victory.
I don't have any money.
I don't teach here anymore.
We didn't find the guy.
Get on the bus.
Why didn't you help him?
I need to make a phone call.
What advice can you give me?
I'm the only one you can trust.
He's a die-jay.
Soon Tom will learn how to swim.
What's wrong with how I did it?
They're capable of catching fish.
Tom got out of the room.
I'm still doing this every Monday.
I want you to eat something.
He got the first prize.
Tom is teaching French.
I tried to contact her.
Give me your phone.
You're not funny.
Tom said he thought he could do it.
I don't have a book.
The next story is true.
I just saw them together.
She watched him swim.
Tom thanked Mary for the gift card.
Can you remember when we first met?
My job is very boring.
He's, like, a workman.
How Would You Answer?
You need to go to the hospital.
I can't find any hints.
It's a fake.
That's not what Tom asked Mary to do.
He's got green eyes.
Yours was better.
Tom is often wrong.
He felt tired.
Did you vote for Tom or Mary?
I don't have any friends at all.
Did you see that?
I hope so.
I'm sorry, but it's true.
Is it true that Tom was never in Australia?
Now I understand.
I don't think about it anymore.
I think we're next.
I turned on the TV, where Gran Prie was broadcast.
Tom's a daughter.
Don't think about it.
I'm rich.
Have you considered the possibility of amputation?
I was surprised that Tom wanted to do this.
English is not my native language.
I had no friends in Australia.
You think I'm smooth?
I'm too rich.
What's this girl's name?
We shouldn't have let her go.
So don't do it again.
They live here for ten years.
Tom ran out on Mary.
Her neighbor will take care of her children while she's gone.
I'm cooking now.
Did you see Tom's passport?
You want to dance?
He's often late.
Do you remember that summer when Tom had his head down?
Why would Tom do that?
I know this girl's father.
This is my third marriage.
Tom can't go with us.
I got thirty points.
If I don't, Tom's gonna get mad.
Aren't you a psychologist?
Don't you write that down?
The big tree fell on the road, and when I was driving, it paved the way for me.
I like Tom's company.
Not all the gold that shines.
I don't have much friends.
Do you believe in the existence of God?
I live in Boston.
Tom is blind from birth.
He didn't answer my question.
Does anyone know him?
Aren't you getting bored?
What kind of men do you like?
Why do people still smoke?
I won't work for you.
I can do this for her, unlike you.
I'm a student, and he's not.
I was just trying to do that.
I wrote a book.
Quiet, please.
I bought my son new trunks.
I know Tom's wife.
She was born the same year that I was, and now she's preparing for exams.
I don't like either tea or coffee.
Did you do your homework?
Monday's probably gonna be a busy day.
I'm going to Tom's house.
I don't agree with him.
Maybe you should help so paint the park.
Why do people act like big monkeys, and on the contrary?
Can you help me?
Stupid.
I'm a physicist.
I think you should go to the doctor.
I put the papers on the visa.
Snow is coming today.
She kept working.
The rope broke when we went up.
Tom's driving.
If you ate less hamburgers, you would probably be healthier.
Tom helped Mary.
Good choice!
Don't you want ice?
Isn't Mary coming?
What's in the garage?
Don't you speak English?
Tom needs to be taken to the hospital.
I had to go personally.
Please show me how this is done.
Aren't you seeing anyone?
All the beds are busy.
I haven't decided yet.
What date is it today?
Where's Dad?
Close the door.
I'm not gonna talk to Tom French.
The apple doesn't fall far from the apple.
Be realistic.
Who were you talking to?
Grandpa is your father’s brother or mother.
Do you know whose parents they are?
She's got red eyes.
They won't come back.
I was in the gym.
I'll see you after the show.
I'd like to ask you a question.
It's my grandmother.
It's a whale.
This bag of mine.
You're ignoring me?
Tom joined the Church of Satan.
I still want to do this with you.
Tom has no money.
Aren't you surprised to see me here?
I'm careful.
You don't mind?
I haven't seen you forever.
You're obviously right.
Whose books are they?
You want to do this, huh?
You want to kill me.
See?
Tom plays the dog twice a day.
Let me take a look at this book, Tom.
The main islands of Japan are Hokkaido, Sycoca, Honsu, and Kusa.
You're probably very busy.
Tom doesn't have much money in the bank.
I think we should go now.
We didn't.
You think Tom's crazy?
I can do it right now.
How can you be so naive?
I'm not gonna help you.
Get out of here.
I'm not a monster.
She closed her eyes.
No one can compare with him in tennis.
Who asked you?
When did you get it?
She committed suicide.
We've got our office computers.
We have to pay in advance.
Are you sure?
You think Tom's gonna die?
Aren't you planning on staying?
I didn't do what you accused me of.
Please don't be late.
I know Tom's drunk.
Did you agree?
I came to get my book.
I'm still teaching French.
Tom will do it right away.
Let's sing the song together.
Tom has three more books than I do.
You missed a lot.
I'm wearing my shoes.
You can count on me.
His book became a subject of criticism.
It's going to be genius.
I'm really scared.
You have to help her, and quickly!
It's a lot worse.
I'm under a fly.
You didn't waste your time.
Who knows when Tom will do it?
Tom was a witness in Mary’s case.
I thought you were gone.
Tom won't catch Mary.
Can we ask what your name is?
I wrote you ten letters.
What can we do?
Aren't you going to vote?
You have to quit smoking.
I think Tom's cheating.
I know a lot of French teachers.
You don't look like her at all.
Do you know how to play the script?
Can you hand me the salt?
Just sit there with Tom.
I think Tom speaks French well.
I don't think Tom knows Mary's unhappy.
He was very popular with both students and teachers.
You can't help the mountain with your tears.
Tom's playing football and running.
You can go wherever you want.
We'll see Tom later.
I know how we can have a good time.
Did you know Tom doesn't speak French?
He always sings when he takes a shower.
You're not as young as Tom.
How are we doing?
Then Tom hung the earphone.
I'll be right back.
The church is located at the bottom of the mountains.
Where's your assistant?
Why did I do that to you?
I'll have some coffee, please.
Tom will try to convince Mary to do this.
He's calling you Tom.
You have to tell him to do it.
He's talking to the experimentor with a little French accent.
It's not yours.
Who lives in this house?
Tom didn't care.
She's got nice manners.
I wanted to sit down.
Why would Tom do that?
I hope Tom's coming to my party.
Tom told me he didn't like to speak French.
That sounds good, doesn't it?
When Tom was younger, he was a lady.
I'll deal with it.
Did you find any mistakes?
I'd like to see your mother.
Are you a witch?
Am I good?
Even a teacher can make mistakes.
Let's go.
So you're gonna let me turn you off?
You're a nice woman.
There is hope.
When I was a child, I was very shy.
Did Tom really move to Boston?
Tom extended Mary’s beer.
How did you know Tom wouldn't be here?
Children grow up so quickly.
Tom likes to talk.
I want to play cards.
He went back to the hotel.
When did you get back from London?
Aren't you still cold?
They deliberately follow the rules of their language, not even conscious of them.
Tom's on vacation.
What happens if I press this button?
The hunters aimed their gloves on the elephant.
Nobody's worried.
They tried.
Tom and Mary still here?
Tom’s wife is Canadian.
Do you have any allergies?
Don't go.
Tom and Mary could not help me.
I'd like to take the money off.
I'm holding Tom's hand.
They'll be fine.
Half of these apples are rotten.
Tom is no longer a member of this club.
You don't have to worry about tomorrow's exam.
Did Tom vote?
I'll be back.
Tom won't force Mary to do it.
Tom didn't even start.
Instead of going to school, he stayed at home.
I didn't know it was Tom that helped you paint the park.
It's on the eighth floor.
Tom's wife left him three months ago.
I'm sorry I went there.
You don't have to trust her.
Tom lost his best friend.
Tom still wants to come.
You don't run away.
I'm Japanese, but I don't live in Japan.
What do you want to talk about?
Where'd you go with the cannicles?
This year, did you receive a Christmas gift from Tom?
I'm still a little bored around the house, and so many things seem strange to me.
Sometimes I have memory problems.
Where's Mom?
He was blinded three hours after the accident.
You speak Macedonian?
You don't have to talk here.
Are you talking about us?
Tom's with me now.
Is Tom okay?
I thought you knew Tom.
Very good!
Do you know why?
Check the voice mail.
She speaks three foreign languages.
Tom's a little bit out of the chart.
Tom's not a hero.
Can we catch a cab here?
You'll be late.
It's gonna be hard.
Does Tom always act like that?
I like playing golf.
I have a sister and a brother.
Tom didn't want to talk so loud.
Our team needs your help.
You'll never miss.
Wait, did you say "girl" or "boy"?
It's all working, so you'll see.
She threw it away.
Tom's safe.
I finally got water rights.
I'm not a student.
That's why Mary was sorry.
I'm just looking at the news right now.
Tom keeps checking the phone.
How's your wife?
You're right.
Tom's not rich, Mary's rich.
I broke my glasses.
I lost my favorite handle.
Everybody's late, except me.
Let's stop!
It's a book.
I'm not planning on blowing up the boat.
Money doesn't smell.
Tom's got a lot of weird ideas.
Eat something.
I'm with the client.
I'm disappointed with your efficiency.
Didn't you have a car before?
Were you at work?
What are you learning?
I'm sorry I ate those oysters.
Good morning.
Please write your name in pen.
Tom wants to study medicine.
She's completely ignoring me.
Tom's going to the party tonight.
I was talking.
She went to the airport.
She is studying Portuguese in Brazil.
What will you tell them?
How did you know this was going to happen?
What's there?
If the natural language can be compared to a tree that develops over time, the experiment can be compared to a plastic tree that was made artificially.
They all wanted to sing.
What is the meaning of this phrase?
I think Tom's staying in Boston.
Do you know where we're going?
Tom doesn't know what to do.
Don't be so angry.
Tom has a beautiful garden.
I know when you miss.
I know you just did your job.
We'll walk.
Did Tom say it was the same thing?
I finally realized I wasn't in love with you.
You said 'cause I was kidding?
So it was awfully boring.
Tom said I was nice.
I'll be in the lab.
Please wait a minute.
I'm a little shy.
The prisoner died under torture.
It's impatient.
Today I have a lot to do.
Tom and Mary will both be there.
What do you understand?
They suspect me?
Tom was a little confused.
I want to talk to her.
Move out of the trash.
Aren't you coming back tonight?
I forgot your number.
Do you have a map of Boston?
Your sister is always great.
This will be very difficult.
The child was paralyzed with fear.
Do you like these perfumes?
How terrible!
Are you in a hurry?
I don't have two cats.
When you hire him for work, you should take into account his youth.
We're sure it wasn't a coincidence.
It's his insistent idea.
It's a matter of principle.
Tom was reluctant to leave the room.
He knows I love him.
I don't believe that.
I was wearing a white dress.
Check again.
Tom has a son-doctor.
I know it'll be impossible.
Do you have any major pain?
Children imitate their friends, not their parents.
Tom's falling.
Tom wants to play with friends outside.
Whatever happens, stay calm.
Tom sent Mary a message.
He's always happy.
When Mary arrived at the bus stop, the last bus had already left.
Tom's in the black coat today.
I'll wait till 2:30.
Tom is my child.
We used to speak French.
Bananas are delicious.
They're eating.
Tom can go.
Where are you living?
Now they're worthless.
Did you try to talk to them?
It was much harder to do that than it seemed.
Her friends laughed at her.
Let me talk to Tom.
Tom seemed to understand what I was saying.
I doubt Tom can win.
The Innoplanets are flying and taking our work away from us.
Don't worry.
Bell invented a phone in 1876.
Are you going on a train?
Tom said Mary was nice.
He can't go anymore.
Tom and Mary are still asleep, aren't they?
Is that why Boston still likes it?
Why would you do that?
This young man is a medical doctor.
He went abroad, and he didn't come back.
Gather your toys together.
It was much harder to do that than it seemed.
I think I've got a good time.
What does Tom want for Christmas?
Don't you want me to help you?
You have to do what Tom tells you to do.
I'm getting better.
Are these people crazy?
That's why it's interesting.
Are you done?
Three years ago, I was very rich.
It's hard to do that.
Tom died.
I like being alone.
We were both drunk.
I'm not as tall as my brother, but taller than my father.
Tom doesn't know what you did.
Did I ask you for help?
Tom took one of the butterboards.
I never lived in Boston.
It's important to me.
This box was heavy.
You can rest.
Are you ready to start?
I still wanted to sell it.
Tom said he didn't think Mary would.
You missed something.
I was on the phone right away.
You looked interested.
This will help.
I'll sleep.
I told Mary in French that I loved her.
We really don't have a choice.
I'm dead.
He worked hard to reach his goal.
Ken's got two cats.
I realized what was wrong.
I like the rides.
The phone's not working.
That's what we want.
Tom in the sunglasses.
Tom paints well.
All you have to do is press the red button.
You looked very sad.
Where can you get a suit for Halloween?
Tom's busy and he can't help you right now.
We don't have money.
He wants to see you as a student.
We want to vote.
Tom and Mary have tried.
I think I'm starting to feel hot.
Why don't you sleep?
Does Tom really think anyone's listening?
You don't have to!
Tom, you can say it's nice.
Anyway, I don't agree with you.
I had to go before.
I ran into him by accident.
Why do you like it?
The problem is that solar energy is too expensive.
I'm very old-fashioned.
Tom's in a fog.
You saved my life.
Did you call him?
Do you understand?
Tom wasn't rude to me.
How do you say "thank you" to Japanese?
She's sleeping.
Tom’s wife asked him to get out of work.
Can't you open the door?
Are you comfortable?
This chair is made of plastic.
Tom could and should have helped Mary.
Don't you know how?
He adopted the orphan.
I was playing baseball.
She deserves a better life.
I got a free ticket.
You're such an impatient person.
What's going on here?
Tom said you speak French.
I did everything I could.
No, sir, she's worthless.
I'm very interested in studying French.
It was good for the cat, please.
I don't have time to read.
Do you have a flashlight that I could borrow from you?
I'm going to the store.
Don't trust anyone.
I'm glad you're satisfied with your job.
Do you work around here?
You admit it, don't you?
I have things tomorrow.
I'm rude.
You're always wrong.
I didn't know it was possible.
I'm exhausted.
I was born in Osaka, but grew up in Tokyo.
You're very materialistic.
I don't understand, and I'm not used to not understand.
I share everything.
Variants are obvious.
The only person Tom is talking about is Mary.
I want you to stay here with Tom.
She was canceled.
My country is densely populated.
Mary said she was ready.
You have time.
I wonder if Tom's okay.
I don't sleep well.
Don't you buy that?
Women are beautiful.
Wouldn't it be great if Tom did it?
Did you do that?
I have problems with sleep.
Tom makes me nervous sometimes.
I dance pretty well.
You can ask Tom for help.
I'm just a teacher.
It's obvious you're going to have to spend more time with us.
He doesn't watch TV at all.
I never said no.
Rio already has a subway.

Everybody wants something.

Tea without ice.

Tell me 'cause I'm calling.
We'll try.
Tom shared Mary’s pain.
They're tired of playing.

I was tough at the time.
Here's your turn.

Tom knows how to drive.
I read novels of intent.
I was going to tell you why, but I forgot.
I'm a hero.
They love us.
I need your help.
Tom, I betrayed you.
I got up about six.
I don't want to brag, but I'm pretty smart.
Does that matter?
Can I have you for a minute?
Tom may not even be on the team.
I wonder if that's why you can trust me.
What happened to her?
Are you drinking?
I was angry.
When did he arrive?
Where's your pulmonary bear?
How's it going, Tom?
Perhaps this year we will finally win the Eurovision.
Where could Tom do that?
I think you're wrong.
I'm careful.
Do you have a passport?
I tried to forget my wallet.
Cats catch a mouse.
You can go.
Tom said not to do that for Mary.
Where's Tom going?
I'll call them myself.
I made Tom do it.
What wonder would Tom want to do that?
Birds can see the earth's magnetic field with their eyes.
Do you need a car?
It's Tom's signature.
What really happened here?
Oh, my God!
I'm naked.
Are you planning on doing this?
Am I clear?
Today I'm free.
Tom is probably punished for what he did.
Despite everything, Tom is happy.
There's no need to hurry.
Are you satisfied?

There's nothing to celebrate.
I like watching TV.

Mary said she's not sick.
If you want.
We have suppliers.
My unpredictable idea is that it's a terrible movie.

Whatever you want.
I could change.
It's important.
Are you trying to be funny again?

I hope you'll be back.
Tom wants to be a baseball player.
Love cannot be bought.
If you didn't want to come, you should have said something.
