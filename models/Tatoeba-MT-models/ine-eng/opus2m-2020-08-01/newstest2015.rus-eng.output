FANO Russia will hold the final expert session
The Federal Agency for Scientific Organizations (FANO Russia) will, together with RAN, conduct the third expert session on "Evaluation of the performance of scientific organizations".
The meeting will be final in a series of meetings held by the agency during the year, reported in the press release of the edition "Lenta.Ru".
The third meeting is scheduled to review the outcome of the Expert session for the year and to draw up a final list of indicators to assess the impact of scientific organizations.
Participants plan to discuss the rules for the formation of expert groups responsible for the evaluation of the work of the scientific groups and the evaluation criteria.
The third expert session will be the final event in the series of events to form a single approach for all three academics to the methodology for assessing the effectiveness of scientific organizations.
Over the past five months, we have succeeded in this, and the final version of the normative documents is in agreement.
As a result of the next session, we need to complete the process of scientific and expert analysis, agree on the phases and dates of evaluation," said the head of the expert-analytical management of Russian FANO Elena Axenova.
Representatives of more than one hundred Russian scientific institutions will participate in the event.
As a result, the resolution was expected to be adopted.
The meeting will begin at 10 a.m. to Moscow on 16 September 2014 at: Moscow City, Soljanka Street, house 14.
Scientists have found a way to find family stars
Astrophysics from the University of California in Santa Cruz have studied the turbulence and its impact on chemical uniformities in constellations.
It is expected that the opening of the professionals will allow the search for family members among the stars, that is, those from one cluster.
The results of their studies have been published in Nature magazine, and they can be accessed briefly on the university website.
The cause of the same chemical composition of the nearby stars is the turbulence in the clouds of gas that precedes the formation of the stars.
Even if the born star then leaves the star cluster, its chemical composition can determine the place of birth and the region of birth of the star family.
Previously, scientists had doubts that the evolution of a star outside the cluster could lead to differences in its chemical content from that of relatives in the cluster.
The modelling results of astrophysics show that such differences should not occur.
In their research, supercomputer specialists simulated two streams of interstellar gas that formed the cloud together.
This object has been transformed into a cluster that begins to form protostars for several million years under its own gravity.
Scientists have added adhesives to the original gas streams and have found that the rapid turbulence in the cloud achieves a high degree of chemical uniformity.
According to astrophysics, their research has shown that it is possible to search for chemical-based stars and to identify possible regions of education of such objects.
Carta Police arrested 20 years after the high-speed motorcycle was pursued
The motorcycle was confiscated after traveling 125 km/h in a speed limit zone of 70 km/h and through Bushland to hide from the police in Pilbara.
The transport police patrol in Carrate tried to stop a blue motorcycle this morning, finding that its speed reached 125 km/h when he left the service station at Batgate Road.
The police report that the motorcyclist did not stop and continued his march on the Bergess Road, then returned to Bushland, which resulted in police losing sight of him.
The motorcycle and the driver’s description were observed near the house at Walt Wey in Bulgaria.
The Carrata Police have accused a 20-year-old man of refusing to stop even dangerous leadership.
He must appear before the world court of Carrata on 23 September.
The motorcycle was confiscated and detained for three months.
Training year in the DNR will begin not earlier than October

Lavrov: Russia will not be "locking the door" due to new sanctions and will not leave the WTO
Russia will not "lock the door" due to new sanctions.
This is what the Head of MID RF Sergey Lavrov said today, speaking to students and teachers of the IGIMO.
In view of our response to the new wave of anti-Russian sanctions, I will not even argue, fantasize, because everything has to be taken into account specifically, he said.
And when we see what European and American partners will look like this time, then we will decide how to answer it.
This will not be related to the guy's door, some attempts that are falsely understood, the minister stressed.
We will, above all, refrain from our interests, from protecting our economy, the social sphere, our citizens, our business, and we will draw conclusions from the partners ' actions with a view to their adequacy, contractual capacity and reliability.
On the steps taken in the area of sanctions, it was very good to judge what partners were seeking - the chapter of the IDF continued.
If they say in all their voices, "they'll be sick for us, too, but we're forced to go to Russia to punish," that's probably not enough."
With regard to WTO, there is no response to possible new sanctions.
On the contrary, we want to develop more actively the WTO instrument, including when it comes to trade disputes, said Lavrov.
We have already used this tool to overcome, as we believe, the EU's discriminatory policy on anti-dumping procedures.
According to the Minister, Russia is being accused of dumping, and anti-dumping measures are being applied against the RF industry.
"We are ready to use WTO mechanisms and to defend our position on the inadmissibility of applying the EU's third energy package's rules retrospectively," Lavrov said.
How is it proper to use cheese in design now?
Questions were answered by Irina Okuneva:
Since the cheese loses its main appeal after flowering, it is desirable to be excavated with other artists.
It is beautifully combined with many cultures.
Close to cheese, both plants that are decorative at other times and that are colourful at the same time can and should be harvested.
Another addition to cheese is that it provides a lot of opportunities for creativity.
You can form its stem tree of different heights, improved art, wide-based art, and even a garden bunsai - a tree with a beautifully carved box.
Just choose the form that is more consistent with your design now.
The resident of Leningrad is convicted of trafficking in counterfeit money in the Caribbean
As reported in the Republican IMF, the man engaged in his criminal activity in the Olonecsk and Segage areas.
In addition to the Caribbean, he committed similar crimes in other regions of the country.
In particular, the accused had already succeeded in inheriting the Vologau area where he had been sentenced to two and a half years ' imprisonment this spring.
Later, the man was brought before the Oloneck District Court.
In order to complete the investigation of the crimes committed in our Republic, it was staged in Segage.
The investigation has shown that there are several episodes of trafficking in counterfeit money relating to the summer of 2013.
At the end of June of the current year, criminal proceedings were brought before the court.
On Friday, 29 August, the court decided to replace the term of imprisonment for four years with a general rule.
The sentence has not entered into force legally.
Remember, last week, two other counterfeit money users were convicted, who were paid for in Petroszawdska shops.
Azerbaijani citizens also came to the Caribbean from St. Petersburg.
One is deprived of liberty for five years, the other for four.
A fine of 500 thousand rubles each.
The sentence has not yet entered into force legally.
In Archangel observed the 73rd anniversary of the arrival of the first convoy, Dervis.
The meeting, which was held in the district centre, was devoted to the first Arctic convoy.
Dervis provided military assistance from the United States and the United Kingdom to the USSR.
In the Archangelic meeting of memory, the future monument to the northern convoys, which is located on the coast of Sedova in Solombale, was the cornerstone.
The event was attended by representatives of the Veteran organizations of Arkangelsk, children of the Cadets.
For the first time, we gathered twenty-three years ago when a stone was laid.
But at the same time today's event is not a holiday, but a day of remembrance of those who have not returned to the sea," said the president of the Board of Veterans of the North Sea Parade Boris Karpov.
The event was followed by a city spirit orchestra, and Cadets class educators gave the veterans flowers and marched with the flags of Russia and the name of Victory.
The meeting ended with the addition of colors to the stone.
The convoy itself consisted of five English ships and one Dutch transport loaded with strategically important raw materials (10,000 tons of rubber, 1,500 tons of formal boots, lead, width and many other equipment).
In addition, military equipment and weapons were on board, including 3,800 deep bombs and magnetic mines, 15 Harriet destroyers, in an unresolved state.
In this connection, the convoy was composed of 16 British WFP ships, of which two were aircraft.
The caravan of ships was not found by the opponent and was well reached at the destination of Arkangelska.
Of the 848 ships involved in vital caravan operations, 126 transport vessels and about 50 military vessels were killed.

Remembering the very American idea that labour rights are human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have proposed a bill on which the organization of trade unions is protected as civil law.
"Where trade unions, there and the middle-class jobs," says Ellison, a Minnesota Democrat, co-chair of the Congress of the Progressive Group.
That is why I am proud to represent the Act on increasing the rights of workers along with the symbol of the movement for civil rights by John Lewis.
This innovative bill will give workers the same legal opportunities in the event of discrimination against the organization of trade unions, as in other forms of discrimination, the remaining forces of trade union opponents.
Amendment of the Labour Relations Regulation Act in such a way as to enable workers who are discriminated against in the organization of trade unions to seek justice in civil courts - and to receive compensation for damages and fines - a reasonable and necessary initiative.
However, this is certainly not a radical initiative, at least according to American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and co-authors of the bill are to remember a very American thought.
Despite the attacks by trade unions in recent years, in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states across the country, Americans had once supported countries around the world to adopt, expand and respect labour rights.
It was a time for millions of Americans to remember when the country at the same time protected democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right to organization.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas McArtur and his assistants helped the country to adopt a constitution designed to ensure that the military autocracy of Hidecka Todzi was replaced by democracy.
Fully aware that workers and their trade unions play a role in the formation of a new Japan, they have included a text that directly recognized that “the right of workers to an organization, to negotiations and to collective action is guaranteed”.
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General David Eisenhower and his associates helped the Germans to write a constitution that ensured that the fascism of Adolf Hitler was replaced by a strong democracy.
Recognizing that workers would need to be organized and heard in the new State, the Germans included an article that openly stated: " The right to form associations in order to protect and improve working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every person and every profession or sphere of activity.
Agreements that restrict or attempt to undermine this right will not have legal force; the measures aimed at these purposes will be recognized as illegal.
When the former First Lady of Eleanor Roosevelt was chaired by the International Commission on Human Rights, which formed the World Declaration on Human Rights, which would be adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a global agreement, Roosevelt and its constituents included the guarantee that “everyone has the right to organize and join trade unions to protect his interests”.
The generations of Americans have taken the basic provision that labour rights are human rights.
When the country advised other countries on how to create civil and democratic societies, the Americans explained that the right to trade union organization - and that the trade union should participate as an equal partner in collective negotiations with corporations and government institutions - should be protected.
Now that these rights are being attacked in America, it is indeed wise to return to the American ideal that workers should have the right to an organization and that their voices should be heard in a free and open society.
As a wonderful Martin Luther King Younger said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the trade union movement did not undermine the strength of the nation but increased them.
By raising the standard of living of millions, trade unions have created a wonderful market for industry and have raised the whole nation to an unimaginable level of production.
Those who attack trade unions forget these simple truths, but history will remember them.
History remembers how we should.
The official recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the expansion of the protection of civil rights to prevent discrimination against the organization of trade unions - has long been obsolete.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis are reinvigorating ideals that have historically expanded America and made the promise of democracy a reality.
The judge temporarily blocks the law that could close all abortion clinics in Louisiana
In the United States, the federal judge temporarily blocked the entry into force of Louisiana's law, about which his supporters say he is likely to close all five abortion clinics in the state.
According to this, which was signed by Governor Louisiana Bobby Ginadal in June and was due to enter into force on 1 September, physicians who are pregnant would be required to have the powers of hospitalization in a radius of 30 miles from their practice.
However, the judge ' s decision means that doctors can continue to perform legal abortions by continuing to seek such powers.
“The complainants will be allowed to work legally, continuing to exercise their powers,” wrote Judge John deGreevells in his decision.
The hearing will be appointed during a month during which the judge will make a more permanent decision under this law.
The rights defenders of abortion have been happy to meet this decision, the last in line with decisions against similar measures, saying that it will give doctors more time to obtain hospital powers.
“Today’s decision ensures that Louisiana women will be protected from a fraudulent law that seeks to deprive them of their health and rights,” said Nancy Nortap, president and head of the Centre for Reproductive Rights, who filed a request for the suspension of the law from three out of five state clinics.
It was not immediately apparent whether the decision was made by doctors from two clinics who did not speak to the complainants in this case and also made a statement of acceptance.
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have adopted such laws, and the courts have recently recognized such measures as unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi.
The key parts of the Texas Act, which would have closed most of the remaining clinics in the state, were blocked by the federal judge on Friday.
Fighters for the right to abortion, along with the American College of Nurses and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, say that adoption laws impose restrictions on doctors that are not necessary from the point of view of medicine.
Obstacles to abortion argue that such measures are aimed at protecting women ' s health, although some have also noted their positive effect on the closure of clinics.
Only one doctor who is having abortions in Louisiana has a hospital admission authority, the Center for Reproductive Rights reported.
If all the other doctors in the state were forced to stop the procedure, the doctor, fearing for his safety, would stop the procedure, the group reported.
While criticizing this decision, Louisiana officials said that they would not punish abortion physicians until their statements of authority were pending.
What will lead to the introduction of quotas for domestic products
At least half of the products for each type of goods in the range of commercial networks must be Russian production, the deputy of Gosmunda from the Fair Russia Group, Oleg Nilov.
The Parliament has prepared a bill to introduce protective measures against domestic producers, writes the Newspaper.
The document will still be detailed to avoid possible discomfort to buyers.
This applies to products not produced in Russia. According to other groups of products produced in Russia, the riteeller will have to provide at least half of its number to domestic producers," Nil said.
Together with the amendments to the article “On the basis of State trade regulation in RF”, the bill provides for changes to the Tax Code, which set the lowest rate of NDS to 10 per cent in the implementation of products produced in Russia.
The idea of introducing a 50 per cent quota in trading networks is part of a package of incentives for Russian producers.
A few times more domestic goods will appear on the trailers.
However, the initiative can have both positive and negative effects, experts say.
According to a lawyer at Nlogovic, a member of the independent expert centre, Sergei Litvinenko, for the Russian economy, as well as for the domestic agricultural and food industries, will have a positive effect and will lead to growth.
In addition there will be farmers, farmers, small shops.
They'll be able to sell more, which means profit will grow.
In addition, they will be entitled to dictate their terms and prices to the knights, because they will be forced to buy their goods.
Russian producers will be able to increase their activities and sales, which will result in higher taxes than before.
This will increase budget revenues, create new jobs, some industries will start expanding, some more rapidly, and contribute to GDP growth.
Russia's dependence on foreign food will decline several times, indeed not immediately," the expert notes.
In the past, Russian companies had often been unable to reach local shops because of high competition from foreign analogues.
Now, after the embargo has been imposed, this nest has been released and can be lifted with relief.
But it should not be forgotten that after all the necessary agreements and health checks on the Russian market, food products from Latin America, Turkey and Serbia will be received.
In other words, the moment of silence is now when the former players have gone away and the new ones have not yet arrived.
Almost a month later, there was an increase in demand for domestic raw materials, as well as an increase in prices for finished products," said Aif.ru, the first Vice-President of the General Russian Public Organization, "Russian Financial Directors' Club", c.e. Tamar Kasianov.
Clearly, the idea of selling at least 50 per cent of Russian food products in each category will strengthen the sector by local producers.
In such a case, they would compete with each other rather than with goods that would be cheap from the subsidies of another State.
In other words, the struggle for the buyer will spread among companies working under the same laws of the industry.
On the other hand, Kasiyanova notes that Russian producers are able to meet 50 per cent of the domestic needs of their compatriots far beyond all articles.
And in this situation, trading networks will have to "stretch" the share of Russian goods up to half the range.
In this context, there is growing concern that unqualified goods will be caught.
It is possible that foreign products with broken labels will be supplied as produced in Russia," the expert adds.
The negative effect of the introduction of quotas is felt by large trading networks, especially those that would benefit from cooperation with importers.
It is logical that foreign suppliers themselves will be affected because demand for their products will decline.
Lithuania does not rule out that the law on quotas for domestic goods may also affect consumers.
The fact is that some Russian production products may be of the same quality as imports, while shops will be able to charge prices for the second as for the deficit.
In February of this year, the idea of replacing economists with economists had been re-interpreted because of the ongoing deterioration of rubles.
The issue of rejection of import products is now becoming even more relevant in the light of difficult relations with the West.
The law is designed to oblige retellers when making orders to suppliers to be considered as domestic producers.
Then we will go much faster and more confident on the way to import, and the production planning system for the necessary types of products will be set up in a shorter time," said Mr. Oleg Nilov.
Specially, the quota mechanism will be effective for those agricultural sectors where the potential is particularly high, for example in the dairy sector, where the proportion of imports was 25%.
Our farmers are really able to fully cover the catches of Russian shops.
In addition, strong impulses can also produce meat.
It is known that the largest proportion of imports remained in cattle, from 30% to 35%.
It is found that 65-70 per cent still belongs to Russian production," says Cassianova.
Experts believe that the introduction of quotas for domestic products will enable and can speed up the process.
However, this initiative will not, in itself, replace itself, because it requires a set of measures that Lithuania is convinced of.
In any case, 50 per cent of the goods sold under this initiative may still be imported from outside the border, which means that no full import will take place, but significant steps will be taken in this direction.
In addition, there are few quotas, and the production of domestic products still needs to be established in order to meet those quotas.
The quotas are such as to provide such guarantees," says the expert.
Untimely diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment mean that egg cancer in rural areas kills more
Angelina Jolie and her brother James published a video of their late mother who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women in rural Australia face a higher risk of death than in cities.
Researchers analyzed maps of more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005, finding that only 35 per cent lived five years after diagnosis.
The leading researcher Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Institute of Medical Studies reported that the probability of dying during the study was 20 per cent higher for those living in regions and remote areas than for those living in urban areas.
SURVEILLANCE: New medicines can slow the cancer of the ovaries and the cancer of the ovaries
Researchers have followed the women's medical course for seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of women at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, the availability of current diseases and socio-economic status also had an impact on the likelihood of survival.
Older women and those who had cancer at a later stage at the time of diagnosis had the lowest survival rates.
For those living in regions or remote locations, the probability of dying during the study was 20 per cent higher than for those living in urban areas.
Although the study was not intended to determine why women living outside the city were more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suggested that an early diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment were possible factors.
"This disease is best treated by surgeons who specialize in gynecological oncology, and they are mainly in large cities," she said.
Despite improving the quality of telemedicine services to reduce the impact of distance, she suggested that increasing the number of travel services that would enable professionals to treat women closer to home and support programmes for people who were treated far from home could help.
Dr. Jordan said that regardless of the geographical situation, the study found that the longevity of women with ovarian cancer was rare, stressing the need for more effective treatment and prevention strategies.
The study funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer cancer will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, at the age of 33, a young mother from the Gold Coast, Elise Niev, said she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
A new FAP will open in September in the Kužener region
The construction of a medical facility in the village of Toktybelak was started in April of this year and was carried out on a typical project.
The value of the work was over 10 million rubles.
According to the management of public communications and information, the construction of the facility was financed through the Republican budget in accordance with the targeted investment programme.
The total area of the treatment facility is nearly 230 square metres.
Here they will provide medical assistance to the inhabitants of eight human settlements: the village of Toktybelak and the village of Dementievo, Puncerumal, Tunya, Fomichi, Toraybelak, Shinur and Chaškail.
The new FAP will replace the existing FAP, whose building was built in 1918 and has long exhausted its resources and its premises do not meet health and hygiene requirements.
The new institution will be opened soon.
Killed four-month-old son in a state of unhappiness will appear before the court
The resident of the Watch Tower will appear on the scene of the murder of his own child.
Cheboxar has completed an investigation into a criminal case against a 31-year-old resident of Novocheboxarska who is accused of the death of negligence.
The consequence was that on 26 July this year, the accused, together with his four-month son, came to celebrate the birth of his cousin in Cheboxara.
After a long time, the New Yorker decided to stay in the guest room and put the child to bed.
When the child woke up and cried at night, a woman who was not looking for him lay down with him to feed his breast, but soon fell asleep.
During her sleep, a woman attacked her son, which led to his death.
The criminal case, reported by the S.U.S.R.C. Press Service on Guards, is sent to the court.
Inflation has gone out of its way.
Do Russians feel a sharp rise in prices?
As a result of the cross-border sanctions of RF and West inflation in Russia will be accelerated and will not be included in the government's projections, convinced by the analysis of VTB Capital.
Experts believe that the delayed impact of the sanctions will lead to an inflationary shock in the first quarter of 2015, writes RBC Daily.
According to the latest forecast for Mineconomy, inflation will be 6.5 to 7.5 per cent in 2014 and less than 6.5 per cent in the following year.
However, according to the Comoros newspaper, this week the MER is expected to make “small but principled” adjustments in the macroeconomic forecast by 2017.
According to the publication, the Authority could lower its inflation estimates for 2015, thus eliminating the expected increase in population income.
The forecast was that food sanctions for RFs would operate year-on-year until August 2015.
How could such a situation be expected to lead to so high inflation?
The current situation is a sudden shock, but the downward trend in inflation will not change," said Minfina's newspaper source.
Economists from TB Capital do not share the expectations of the Government's financial and economic bloc for inflation and predict price increases in 2014 at 8 per cent.
The main effect of product bans will be combined with the possible introduction of RF sales tax (NSP) in 2015, convinced experts.
The inflation rate will be 9 per cent on February, after which annual price increases will go down, experts believe.
By the way, last week, Rosstatt suffered the first inflation results after the F.R. introduced "accurative sanctions".
AIF.ru interviewed experts and identified their inflationary expectations.
Artem Deev, Head of Analysis Department FC AForex:
Price increases have already been observed in the main product segments.
Moreover, when products became socially valuable, the Government was forced to initiate systematic monitoring of price stability in order to prevent risks of unjustified price increases in the short term.
Suppliers and retellers are already reported on a daily basis before the regulators, so that the authorities know exactly who, when and for what reason initiates an increase in prices.
A key factor in the growth of the consumer price index remains the huge flow of capital, excessive refinancing of the banking sector by the Russian mega-gullator, internal conversion due to the refugee population into foreign currency, and the import embargo on food products from countries that have joined in sanctions against Russia.
If inflationary pressures were to remain under control, the value of the minimum set of products would not increase by 12 per cent per quarter.
The ban on the import of foodstuffs has led to shocks on the domestic market and has led to a logical increase in the final value.
Since we are not able to fully launch the import mechanism at the current stage, as well as to increase the adequacy of the Russian market through domestic production, response sanctions will continue to bear the risk of inflationary growth.
If we add here further fiscal reasons for lack of confidence in national currency, as well as poor prospects for economic growth, inflation may well exceed 8 per cent by the end of this year.
Aleksandr Razawaev, director of the Alpari Department of Analysis
In the 1990s, inflation sometimes reached 20-30 per cent per month, in zeros it was also above the current level, another case that was then offset by rapid economic growth.
I think inflation will be 8-8.5% after the year.
Platon Maguta, Managing the Fund of Maguta
The external factor associated with sanctions against Russia as long as it has been successfully suspended, but if there is further pressure on the financial sector, this can lead to certain difficulties and increase inflationary expectations of the population, which are typically in cash purchases in order to secure their savings.
It can be assumed that the Government, the CB RF and the Ministry of Finance will endeavour to mitigate the smooth weakening of their arms, both by market practices and by public regulation.
But price increases are traditionally starting after summer's silence, and it may be that this fall will be more sensitive.
The target level of consumer inflation in Russia is 7.5 per cent, most likely due to the fact that the RF still has financial stocks.
Gardening centres earn from the reduction in the number of landlords
Such a fall due to the exceptional reduction in the number of landowners under 35 years of age may lead to the loss of tens of millions of pounds a year by the planting centres when young consumers today reach “the basic age of gardening”, according to the HTA study reported by the Financial Times.
According to this report, the people who take the picture spend on average 55 per cent of the amount that the owners of their own homes spend on planting.
It refers to an increase in the number of people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popularity of asphalting courtyards in front of the parking lot and the reduction of sizes now as other factors threatening the industry, the annual sales of which are estimated to be £5 billion.
In Great London, where the number of landowners fell from 61 per cent to 43 per cent in six years, the lowest level of household expenditure in the United Kingdom.
HTA and the Royal Garden Society reported that renting housing and the lack of space for now did not mean that people could not grow plants.
Guy Barter, chief gardener at RHS, said, "The creation of plants in containers, for example, is particularly popular in tenants who can transport plants with them when they move."
The HTA report defined the period between 1997 and 2005 as the “golden age” of retail trade in agricultural products as a result of an increase in the number of households and economic prosperity from the end of the 1980s to the mid-1990s.
It also predicts that the market will improve this year due to better weather after adverse conditions in March and April last year.
The Ministry of Agriculture of Bulgaria has conducted mass cleaning at the Agricultural Fund
Three of the four heads of the Landscaping Fund were replaced on Friday.
In total, three of the four heads of the Agricultural Fund were replaced on Friday.
The official Ministry of Agriculture of Bulgaria has only reported the removal from office of Executive Director Atanas Dokwa.
His place was taken by Lozana Vasileva.
It turned out that two of the three Deputy Executive Directors of the Fund had been replaced on Friday.
The Deputy Executive Director Tatian Angelova, who had previously been responsible for the State aid and SAPARD programme, reported BGNES with reference to the Trud newspaper.
I did not attend the fund's board of directors because we were not members of the board by law, but I was told later that I had been released.
I can't tell you why my dismissal is not reported on the fund's website.
I'm on vacation.

Turkey challenges an American diplomat in connection with a report on espionage
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkey called for the country's highest-ranking American diplomat to explain the report on American and British espionage in Turkey.
The Deputy Prime Minister, Bilent, reported that the US case officer and Turkish officials had discussed the communication on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and The Intercept Internet reported that the documents provided by former analyst Edward Snowden of the United States National Security Agency showed that Turkey was a priority object of research for American and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkey's President, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has reduced the importance of this communication, said that all leading countries are spying on each other.
The information previously reported that the main intelligence agency in Germany had also made Ankara an object of inquiry led to a more angry response from the Turkish Government.
The largest Chinese companies united against Alibaba
Chinese companies, including the largest commercial real estate developer in China, Dalian Wanda Group and Internet giants Tencent Holdings (scsets, messengers, etc.) and Baidu (China's largest search engine), create a company that will compete in the online trade market with Alibaba.
However, the miracle of the Chinese Internet, which left even its American rivals - eBay and Amazon.com behind, will be difficult.
Union of the Largest
The companies plan to invest 5 billion yuan in the joint venture ($814 million), 70 per cent of which will belong to Wanda and 15 per cent of each of the Internet companies, says the Wanda Group.
The company is planned to register in Hong Kong.
The SP will combine Baidu's search services with the popular social platform WeChat (the largest neighbour in China, with around 438 million users), Tencent and Wanda infrastructure.
In addition to the network of 40 festive hotels, the Wanda Group manages at least 49 commercial real estate facilities across China and 40 commercial centres.
Last year, the company invested 50 billion yuan (more than $8 billion) in the construction of a cinema and a theme park in Cindao (a city east of China on the Yellow Sea coast).
The project is expected to attract more than 1 million visitors per year and make profits at $960 million.
In addition, Wanda belongs to the American film theater network AMC Entertainment Holdings, making it the largest movie theater operator in the world.
By 2015, Wanda was planning to equip all its shopping centres, hotels and places of entertainment with e-commerce services, with the development of an Alibaba competitor.
According to Dun Ce, which will lead the new company, the Wanda Association will be able to increase the number of users of its e-commerce services from the current 40 million to 100 million by next year.
The new site should become the largest online-to-off platform in the world, notes Dunc.
The essence of online-to-off-business (O2O) is to attract customers on the Internet so that they can come to regular offline stores or purchase other traditional services.
The classic example of O2O is Groupon or Vigoda.ru.
"O2O is the largest "prog" in online commerce," said leader Wanda Van Xianlin (the Bloomberg quote).
"Now the O2O site in China does not exist, and in this situation there is almost equal opportunities for all," he believes.
The Chinese Internet Trade market is the largest in the world, and it is estimated that McKinsey & Co. will increase more than three times by 2015 compared to 2011 to $395 billion.
The number of Chinese Internet users has increased to 632 million, resulting in Bloomberg's official statistics: this is more of the world's population than India.
And it is estimated that by 2015 this figure could grow to 850 million people.
The Union of the Richer
Tencent Ma Huaten was China's richest man until recently, but according to the Bloomberg millionaires' index, founder Alibaba Jack Ma has already got him $5.5 billion.
The status of Jack Ma is estimated at $21.8 billion, of which $11 billion comes to his share in Alibaba.
The leader of Baidu Robin Lee is now one of China's richest people, while Van Xianlin from Wanda is the fourth line of the rating.
"It is very interesting to observe this battle: the three richest people are united in their efforts to raise the challenge even more rich," Bloomberg said the director of the Chinese Center for Electronic Commerce in Hanzhou Cao Lai.
But he believes that a new company will hardly be able to compete with Alibaba immediately after its creation: "Rome cannot be built in one day."
The fact that Alibaba is not just competing not only with new companies but also with world-famous Internet Trade leaders shows the financial indicators of Alibaba for the last quarter.
Alibaba is often described as an average between eBay and Amazon.com, but from April to June, the Chinese company has earned more than the two American competitors taken together.
The net profit of Alibaba for almost twice exceeds the same total of competitors - it has grown almost three times a year and amounted to $1.99 billion.
"Alibaba still has enormous potential for money generation, much thanks to its mobile applications," Bloomberg commented on the report of the analyst from the Hong Kong Arete Research Service.
According to the updated Alibaba website of the United States Securities and Stock Exchange Commission, the number of active mobile users of the company's services in July was 188 million, significantly higher than the March (163 million).
However, 32.8 per cent of all Alibaba transactions in the last quarter were mobile.
Alibaba must call the value of its actions before the IPO.
According to an average estimate of 11 analysts questioned by Bloomberg, the company could be valued at $187 billion after the sale of shares.
According to Bloomberg sources, the opening of Alibaba at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) may take place on 16 September.
The road show, which preceded this event, starts on 3 September.
Alibaba's IPO output is expected to be recorded in NYSE history and will allow companies to attract about $20 billion.
So far, the US stock exchange record has been subject to Visa's payment system, which has made its primary stock placement in 2008 and has earned $17.9 billion.
At least half of the food products in the commercial networks must be Russian production, according to Mr. Gosmunda.
They have developed a bill on this subject.
This is an amendment to article 8 of the FZ “On the basis of State trade regulation in FR” and the Tax Code.
The purpose of the document is to introduce protective measures against Russian food producers.
An important clarification, according to the bill, of at least 50 per cent of domestic products in stores should be per type of goods.
However, the document will take into account that there are goods that are not produced in Russia, such as fruits and vegetables in winter, so they will have a “debt” to avoid possible discomfort to buyers.
At the same time, the draft law also amended the RF Tax Code, which set a 10 per cent reduction rate for NDS in all food products originating in Russia, reports the Newspaper.
On 27 August, the lower House of Parliament introduced a bill to amend the "Difference Markets" Act, which proposes to re-establish farm markets in Russia where small producers will be able to implement their products.
Police chief Magalufa charged with corruption
The complainants presented evidence of the claim by the police and the officials of the municipality of Calvia at the Office of the Public Prosecutor of Mallorca on Friday.
The chief of police in Calvia on the resort island of Malorca was arrested as a result of allegations of corruption by businessmen and bar owners in a scandalous center of uninvited drinking in Magaluffe.
Inspector-in-chief José Antonio Navarro was detained as a result of allegations of corruption brought against him by several businessmen from Ponta Ballen, a street where most of Magaluf ' s bars and nightclubs are located.
According to Mallorca Diario's daily online publication, the complainants presented evidence of a claim from police and police officers of the municipality of Calvia at the Office of the Prosecutor of Mallorca on Friday.
Two other local police officers have been arrested by the National Guard of Spain in connection with allegations of corruption and will be interrogated by a judge with Navarro.
The Spanish daily ABC reported that insufficient night club owners said that protectionism by the authorities was a serious reflection of their business.
"It's no longer about making money, it's about surviving," one of the businessmen told the court.
We cannot be threatened by our sources of existence.
There's nothing to lose.
Magaluf became the head of the international press this summer after a popular YouTube video show showing an 18-year-old British vacationer who took 24 men in a bar race.
Since then, the island authorities have been trying to stop the hooliganity in unhappiness among Magaluf's restless people, bringing to a minimum the number of scandalous alcoholic drinks on bars.
In addition, the Playhouse Club, where a mine incident occurred, was forced to close for a year, while the Carnage Bars and Playhouse organizers were jointly fined $55,000 ($73000).
The Magaluf tourist resort, mostly popular among young British vacationers, was also the site of numerous accidents in the state of alcohol abuse associated with foolish entertainment known as "balconing", when people come from one balcony to another or from the balcony to the hotel pool.
The first day of spring is marked by wet and wind conditions affecting flights to Adelaide Airport
VESSA prepared a cold surprise in South Australia, brought rains and strong winds that affected flights at Adelaide Airport.
Another 5 mm of rain fell on the city by 9 nights, followed by 6.6 mm, which fell on Sunday night.
The last rain was preceded by a couple of short breezes, including a thunderstorm, which began shortly before 8 evening and dropped almost 4 mm in about 10 minutes.
After winter gave up the early spring of last week, the temperature fell again on Monday to a maximum of 15.8C in the city.
Qualifying conditions were expected to serve as one of the reasons for the delay in the arrival of Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was to land on the schedule immediately after 7:30 p.m., but it fell into the area of the wind wave - a sudden change of speed or wind direction at a short distance - and was forced to rise.
Wind breaks reached 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport at the time.
The flight data showed that the plane had to be picked up during the second landing, and the plane finally landed about 8:40 at night.
The delay in the journey led to the subsequent delay of several other voyages, including the journey of Emirates from Dubai and the journey of Quantas from Sydney.
A maximum of 16C is projected in Adelaide on Tuesday with the probability of one or two bees.
The calculation of construction facilities in the RF will take place again
Price formation, construction management, as well as networking issues, the Federal Anti-Monopolitan Service has a special role to play.
In FAS, an expert board on competition development has been established in the field of construction.
At its meeting, the Head of Control of the CCC, Construction and Natural Resources, FAS Wadim Solovjev, stated that “the calculation of the construction site today is absolutely impracticable”.
The normative base makes price formation transparent and can lead to an unjustified cost of construction, considered in the FAS.
And they suggest that the cost of building sites at the design stage should be determined on the basis of market prices for constructive solutions instead of today ' s estimated standards and unit prices for technological operations.
These proposals have been put in a road map and are now under consideration in the minstre.
"The replacement of traditional estimates in construction of construction components should lead to less corruption in the industry," explained Wadim Soloviev.
For now the estimate includes every bolt and hook, and it is not always possible to check everything, so sometimes in the documentation, poor construction companies can bury the tractor's whole.
The FAS has agreed in the minstroy.
"The first adjustments for the changeover to the value of the construction elements are already in place: methods for calculating the cost of construction solutions, the calculation of estimates for these indicators have been developed," said the head of the construction department and the architecture of the monastery of Elena Zjukova.
As a pilot selected the road construction area.
However, experts believe that the problem is much more serious.
As stated by the head of the construction company "Profi-Invest", Anatolie Demayanko, the estimated standards have long been outdated, but another business mechanism has not yet been proposed.
"As far as the proposed calculations on the structural elements are concerned, this is difficult in practice, since different technologies are often used in building construction," he said.
It's not a secret that the building is developing much thanks to the decree.
In the opinion of the Chairman of the NP " Expert Community of Professionals of Gosza" Ekaterina Lesinina, today the State is the most affordable customer.
The Director of Engineering of the Industrial Capital Centre Rosatoma Vladimir Malachov pointed out that today the market is conditional on companies with access to the portfolio of contracts and companies with monopoly and non-competitorial powers.
He believed that the creation of a transparent market could be possible only if access to contracts would be most affected by any managerial influence.
The expert board was invited to form a system of command so that the same executive would not be entitled to receive more than one contract in excess of 1 billion rubles or several contracts in excess of 1 billion rubles.
They believe that this approach should be assessed in terms of the impact on business, as well as the efficiency of construction management.
As Elena Zukowa explained, in this case, the client would have to be assigned to the client as a geno-contractor, leading to an increase in the number of the client ' s staff and the budget expenditures on the client ' s content.
In doing so, the contracting authority should have knowledge to assess the quality and safety of the work carried out by the contracting organizations.
Often it will be necessary to determine who will be responsible for the safety of the facility as a whole.
In addition, this approach may involve the flow of highly qualified bidders due to the lack of interest in receiving a public order for part-time work and a small amount of contract.
The Chapters of the Expert and Advisory Centre of the Institute of Procurement, Alexander Evstaschenkov, believe that the procurement procedure has now become a business game to the attention of the contractor.
And he gave this example: "Participation when filling the application should indicate "specific indicators" without indicating the words "or equivalent", "should be", "ot", "more", "less", "analog", "or", "type", "analog", "not below", "top", "may", "may have", "can be", "before", "not before", "not above", "not allowed" etc.
In this way, clients often abuse their right to impose requirements on the content of an application submitted by contracting organizations.
Another problem of 44-FZ, according to Eustashenko, was the need to assess the quality of work at the time of the application through the participant ' s “papering” proposal.
When considering the participant ' s application, only the contractor ' s qualification can be really assessed, but not the quality of the work that has not even begun, the expert believes.
The quality of work can be assessed only when they are received.
The expert board was also invited to transfer the marginal income from the upper to the lower echelon to remove intermediate contractors.
The President of the Expert Council, the Stats Secretary, the locker of FAS Andrei Carikovski believes that it is not worth doing so, since it is up to a Geno-contractor to be responsible for the order.
Otherwise, it's going to be like, in a well-known repression of Arcadia Rajkin's "Atele" -- "Is there a claim for cowards?"
Israeli children return to school after the war in the Gaza Strip
Thousands of Israeli children in the territories near the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after summer in bomb shelters, when rockets and rains fell on their settlements during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, while schools in the Gaza Strip remained closed as the territory was restored after the war.
The beginning of school activities brought joy and excitement to the populations of southern Israel, but the consequences of the war remained fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, the children's now "Pašos", where the rocket hit, removed traces of cracks from the walls and children's tears before the students arrived.
"We're a little scared, but we're looking forward with joy," said Ronit Bart, a citizen of Kabul Saad and an English teacher at his school.
Many children in our area really need to return to a life of moderation.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said that she suddenly started going to school again.
"It was a difficult time, and we didn't leave our homes at all," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited a cyberspace that was located near the Gaza border to express his support.
Before the ceasefire agreement came to an end last week, thousands of border residents, such as Saad, had not left their homes or left their homes, moving farther away from the Gaza Strip in safer areas to save themselves from the missile and mining fire.
Many Nahal Oz residents, who live close to the Gaza border, where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a number of Palestinian mines, doubt that they should return.
The Ministry of Education reported that about a dozen families had not yet returned.
Their children were sent to other schools at that time.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderota, a town on the border with Gaza, which was very old for Palestinian fire.
He advised his children to study diligently, and he said: "We will do our utmost to give you knowledge and security."
Israel and Hamas agreed to an endless peace last Tuesday.
The ceasefire agreement was immediately put an end to the hostilities, but key issues remained unresolved, such as Hamas ' demand for the removal of the Israeli-Egypt blockade of Gaza and the opening of airports and seaports in the Gaza Strip.
Israel wants Hamas to put up arms and return the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the war.
A new phase of indirect negotiations is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
More than 2,100 Palestinians died in the war, three quarters of whom were civilians and at least 494 children, according to the Palestinian side and the UN.
Israel contests these figures and claims that at least half of those killed were fighters; however, it did not provide substantial evidence to support this claim.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including one Thai employee, were killed.
During the fighting, Hamas and other Gazan fighters launched 4591 rockets and mines in Israeli cities, mainly in the south.
In the meantime, the Israeli army carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
As a result of the Israeli attacks, thousands of homes in the Gaza Strip have been damaged and destroyed, and it is estimated that 250,000 people have found refuge in more than 100 schools that have been transformed into shelters.
Because tens of thousands of people were still in shelters and fighting continued, education officials postponed the beginning of the school year last week.
"I hope the school will soon open up so that we can finish our education as children of the world and Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who now lives in one of the schools of Gaza.
According to the popular criterion, real estate prices have shown the highest winter growth in seven years.
The price index of RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic for housing prices in the Australian capital increased by 1.1 per cent in August, reported RP data on Monday.
This increase has resulted in a total increase of 4.2 per cent in June, July and August, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 per cent, more than double the 12-month increase by August 2013, but the increase was not evenly distributed across the country.
The Director of RP Data Team Louless reported that Sydney and Melbourne were leading a two-level market.
RP Data shows that in Sydney housing prices have increased by 16.1 per cent over the past year, while in Melbourne, 11.7 per cent.
The next market power was Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices grew from five per cent to six per cent on average.
At the other end of the scale was Canberra, where government expenditures were reduced, with prices rising by only 1.4 per cent per year.
Mr. Lawless said that now that spring had begun, there would be an increase in the number of real estate items sold over the next few months, which would be a " present trial" for the market.
"In view of the current high rate of auction sales, the overall high rate of sales and the current low rate conditions, it is likely that the value of housing will increase in the next three months," he said.
How People Live in the Oldest House of Ufa
In the former house of gold industryers and miners Eudokim and his son Ivan Demidov on the street of October Revolution 57/1 (former Greater Kazan) 18 apartments.
The house of the 18th century has not changed since the building was built, unless it was considered a mass.
Foreigners come here as a tour, and the residents suffer more than they are happy with their privilege of living in the oldest Ufim home, whose walls are remembered by Colonel Alexander Sovorov.
The building date is incorrect, historians indicate two dates - 1730 and 1737.
But in any case, you get that building without a little 300 years.
Old court, always open door, screwing stairs.
The doors in the rooms are located close to each other, the walls have been smashed, and the streets have been seen in the light of the dazzling art.
Everything seems to be in the right place.
And the locals say, "You don't think so."
Living in a wooden house of the 18th century is very difficult, as told by Tatian Lukianov, resident of Apartment No. 3.
The facility is in storage, but the money for its content is not allocated for a decade, and we feel like the museum exhibits that the authorities have just forgotten.
The last repair was 40 years ago.
The walls still hold tight, but the foundation has swallowed them all.
Many residents still go to the toilet on the street and go to the public bathroom once a week.
How can you be happy under such circumstances?
The road goes straight under the windows, not even the pedestrian zone.
Tatiana's refusing the lockdown.
Now it's obvious that it was only a rumor before: there's a flow of cars under the windows.
You see, the windows are always small, we can't open the windows, but we're used to the noise.
But man is accustomed to all things, to all good and evil.
Our apartment is still exemplary, thanks to the husband, his hands are gold.
Besides, we have two rooms, we live with three sons.
And other families have much worse conditions, and on the second floor, they can hear more than half a foot [50 m] high.
For Tatyana’s contrast, she offers to visit a neighbor from Apartment No. 6 of Ludmile Oldostin.
A nice hospitable woman from the threshold offers a cup of coffee and with a sad smile:
We have a one-room apartment, 14.5 m2 per four people, and we live with our husband and daughter with our granddaughter.
I've been here since I was born, and there's never been another place.
Very close and slightly different from the usual domestic interior: only beautiful, "historic" ceilings.
But with a regular flow of water, the water system is nowhere to be found.
Ludmila talks about her apartment on a daily basis and at the same time as the Italian woman whose home is situated in Roman ruins.
That's one very old and recent, everyday and legendary:
The pipeline was completed about 40 years ago during the last repair.
Then they made us a small kitchen in the corner and a toilet from the former hearth.
We live just where Demidov and his family lived on the second floor.
Our apartment is not privatized, yes and why?
Ufa's real estate center says privatization doesn't matter.
Even if we only get a one-room apartment, we can't claim more.
Four months ago, we were promised to move, but the promised case did not go away.
I'm not used to complaining and I won't.
In this apartment (room!) lived a whole dynasty: my grandmother with grandpa, my mom with dad, my husband and my daughter with granddaughter.
It's been a while.
For example, healthy rats ran into the kitchen.
Look at the walls of the wing, they're a meter thick!
They say the solution was mixed with eggs, so it's been held for so long.
The house is basically built, thanks to Demidov!
Probably, that's why no one's killed by a broken roof or his own.
The building is still slowly dying in our eyes: boards and lattice houses are rotting, fields have repeatedly collapsed, we have sunk with cement, but everything is useless - the solution goes into the ground like a well.
They're saying it's like, under our secret bay room and going to the White River, which they've made especially once-in-a-life antiques here, so you can hide from the danger of what?
They were persecuted.
Manmila Oldestina tells them how some historian came to them, asked him to let him start in the dig.
Then he persuaded them to give up their home in exchange for their vacation in October.
The man of history refused:
Where are we on Thursday?
And here, there's a little hope that they'll give you more space.
If we agreed to exchange, we wouldn't win.
However, the Old Age's family won nothing.
Ludmila's biggest dream of moving them out, and her daughter with a 16-year-old granddaughter gave her a separate room.
That is, for two families, a two-room apartment was allocated instead of the most magnificent ruins in which two generations now live.
A nice, miniature girl, Olesa Karsakova, from apartment Nos. 11 and 12, shows the second floor of the house.
There are two close rooms with a total area of 23 m2 called apartments, her large family.
Seven of us, two of us.
See for yourself what the conditions are.
The stucco is washed by pieces, like window frames, in the walls of the kitchen and in the rooms through doors.
The water in the tap is cold all year round.
When you walk through the apartments of the oldest house in Ufa, you can be sure that more has been done to the wife of Laurentius from Apartment No. 4.
They occupy the most spacious rooms on the first floor.
You're right, places a lot!
The 75 square space is prescribed for three persons.
We live just once in the rooms where Sovorov remained by legend during his stay in Ufe, says family head Alexander Dmitrievic Lavrentiev.
So high, spacious.
One bad thing is, all around the neck, it's broken, it's broken.
The neighbors must have already told us!
Most of the torments we have with our sexes: the wooden boards have collapsed, the earth has literally disappeared from under our feet.
I've put the supports, the kitchen; there's nothing else in the room, and in the other room, we're going up the stairs, so much for nothing.
Eudokim Demidov Aleksandr Dmitrievic's house can tell better any guide.
The gold industry is regarded as a native, speaks of it with admiration.
In fact, the personality was indiscriminate: the owner of the Kagin and Uzan factories built a house, poured out guns and coals, held Ural mines.
The heirs of purchase property are proud of their ancestors, but they no longer want to live under one roof with history.
I settled here as a child in the 1940s, says Alexander Dmitrievic.
At that time there were wooden rooms for carriages, horseshoes and caravans, and later they were taken down.
In 1968, they wanted to take our home away, but there was something wrong...
The story was repeated in 2014: a new home was lost.
We, as a team, collected all the documents, covered the necessary cases, and suddenly found out that moving to the apartment was moving for 2015 or 2016.
There's something we don't believe in anymore...
Two years ago, Lavrentiev went to the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Bashcortostan to learn about the fate of the house.
The housekeepers did not accept.
They sent from one table to another, and then, as a smile, they put out a paper without signature and print: "The Ministry of Culture does not object to housing."
I even felt that our house was not in the city for a long time, because at first it was under number 57, and then it became 57 A, and now 57/1.
It's like he was taken away in the '70s.
The Russian Planet has called upon the industry to provide information and analysis on the land resources of Uf Vladimir Barabash.
The House on the Street of October Revolution 57/1 is included in the Wet Housing Program.
I cannot be responsible for the actions of the officers of the 1970s, but I know that there was a plan for all the old houses at the time, despite historical significance.
Fortunately, this did not happen, but the decision of the modern authorities to restore all the old houses on the streets of the October Revolution of architectural value is being successfully implemented.
The residents are soon scheduled to move to new apartments.
According to Barabasha, the Italian specialists who participated in the restoration of the buildings in Venice will be to restore the House of Demidov.
There is now an architectural biennale in Italy, and the Old Ufa project is presented there among others.
I hope that by 2016 the entire Old Kazan Street will be restored, says the officer.
The house will acquire the right kind of thing that was before, three centuries ago.
The house of Demidov is likely to be a museum open to all those who want to.
In addition, at the Government level, it was decided to make the street a starting point.
Unfortunately, there will not be enough road load in the city.
To disembark people from the future Vladimir Barabash Museum promises in 2015.
However, they will hardly be satisfied: their new apartments will be the same as the current ones.
Only from the second era.
Forest fire started in Primoria because of the threat
The drought was the cause of a forest fire in the territory of the Ochotnichi countryside in the Fire region of the Primordial Region.
There is an increase in the pooling of forces and funds at the site.
According to CCSBU, the Primordial Aviation Base, which has been established at the site of fire, requires the involvement of the air force.
Vasily Medvedev, Deputy Head of Aviation:
The fire that emerged in an inaccessible location found an observer on the side of an An-2 patrol aircraft at 3 hectares.
They're burning wood residue on the old burner.
The strong turbulence and tilting of the territory is more than 45 degrees, and the lack of suitable fire-fighting sites create significant difficulties in the tightness.
We need a Mi-8 helicopter.
The delivery of the available forces by Mi-2 helicopter and An-2 aircraft is very difficult.
After the detection of the fire at the site of the fire, four fire-fighting parachutes were quickly extinguished.
The main task of the specialists is to extinguish the fire and to prepare a space for the delivery of additional firepower and means.
In the lunch area, 3 firefighters have been delivered by helicopter to the village of Ochotnichi.
As soon as the helicopter is ready for landing in the fire area, the specialists will be transferred to the place of loading, reported on the Primordial Administration website.
Lenny Henry: My father never hugged me.
He never said, "I love you"
Henry was one of seven children born in the family of immigrants from Jamaica to Dodley in Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked at the factory, and their relationship was limited.
Henry repeats the comedy, “Red Rudi” which is partly based on imaginary conversations with his father and has grown from a series of radio broadcasts.
Soundtrack is a mixture of tails and tails, and the melody is unhappy.
However, Henry had to go through some difficult childhood memories.
After his mother died there was "a lot" of treatment, and Henry often thinks about his relationship with his father.
He was very inaccessible.
You never saw his face, you just heard his voice saying, "Stop the noise.
Stay away from your sister.
Move!
I want to watch the cricket.
My older brothers, Seymour and Hilton, who were adults when I was a child, went to the pub with him and talked about things like the shape of a beer bottle, the beauty of the cricket.
I never talked to him like that.
He was such a rude guy in the corner who read the paper most of my life.
Henry recently opened a Lithuanian mastermind in Dadley and, although conditions were better than in his father's days, he was able to look at what his life must have been like.
Now there's little better, but it's dark, smokey, deep labyrinth below with flames of fire and smoke and a dog's tail.
My father went into the bathroom and was just lying there, and you heard him slowly singing about himself because he wanted to wash away from the lithium master.
When I got there, I realized that he did this for years and years to earn us food, and I began to appreciate it more.
However, Henry left his childhood of parental love.
My father never hugged, never said, "I love you."
Only when Mom got bad at the very end of her life did we start saying, "I love you, I love you, I love you.
The birth of his own daughter, Billy, from Don French, allowed him to share the love he had not had in childhood.
Can you stop this "I love you"?
Just stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
Don French.
Why don't you hang out with her?
She's a great mom.
They're still great friends with French, where he's been married for 25 years.
Don's a good man.
Why don't you hang out with Don?
She's a great mom.
Henry's mother had diabetes.
He was one of those who killed her.
So when I was very, very well corrected and I had symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You need to take radical measures.
Then I started serious exercise with fitness, and I also had to sit on a strict diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It's very difficult.
And that's boring.
Nobody eats carrots.
The shift in Henry's career trajectory may be reflected in his glorious, short-circuited board.
Since he was recognized as a critic for his Otello, he was fully involved in the theater.
She followed the Comedy of Errors, and then August Wilson's Landings.
This work is different from the nets and comedies that were an integral attribute of his busy professional life.
He started his career when he was 16, and worked at the factory.
Didjei noticed how he was born on the stage and wrote about it in the New Faces.
His career on television began in the mid-70s: "I've been the only black paradist/comic on television for a long time."
He learned to work.
Not only did I have to grow up in the audience, but I had to learn to be an effective machine for delivering jokes between 1975 and 1985, being a star, working on television, and it was very difficult.
Lenny in New Persons in 1975
Since his manager had the right to the Black and White Arrow Show, an easy entertainment program in which people "blacked their faces", Henry found out what was going on in it for five years.
My family didn't like it very much.
I don't want it ever to be with me, but I don't regret what I did.
Although it was a strange, dignified position, I worked in large squares and learned to work with the crowd.
But what was “the award of a light entertainment classic on British television years and years” was also “grotesque parody on black people”.
By representing the characters who were also portrayed and admired by the black people in Britain, Henry was working on an alternative comedy project in the 1980s.
The first season of Show Lenny Henry was broadcast in 1984, and in the nineties he was known as, among other things, Chief Garrett Blacklock from the comedy series "Chef!".
The commercials, documentary films, television shows and films took the next ten years of his life, but after he was released on BBC in 2008 "LennyHenry.tv," he thought, "What are you going to do next, Len, because it doesn't seem like you're wasting your time or rest."
There was a series of documentary broadcasts on Radio 4 called "What's good at...?"
The first was about Shakespeare.
I had a real allergy to Shakespeare.
You can't say that I was so taught at school, and I thought it was, in many cases, the privilege of the middle class white people with their dolls and their caposite down front.
So I was very scared of him.
All the people we interviewed were Peter Hall, Trevor Nann, Adrian Lester, Judy Dench, and we said, "You have to try.
Don't touch it until you know what you're talking about.
Listen to some of those words, and you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry read 20 verses from the last monologue, Otello, for document transfer, and he's stuck.
I feel like I can do this.
Somehow my head was fixed.
"That's what it is, it's a serious matter, it's a serious matter, study your text, do a little research.
So, the rehearsal process was tough, and I read this piece for months and months before we put it.
And she was successful.
They said they were waiting for disasters, and it didn't happen.
We're about to start the Error Comedy.
Suddenly I was at the National Theatre, and I just couldn't believe it until the end.
There was one moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
There was a technical failure, and Henry felt instinctively that his work was to distract the public.
"The silent voice inside said to me, "You'll have to work for 10 minutes while they're doing a computer."
Instead, the assistant director announced that the presentation would be resumed as soon as the problem was resolved.
I left the scene and I said something in my mouth, "Oh, thank God."
It's not my duty.
I can let someone else deal with it.
"You play in play, stay in play."
Henry in "Zabrah" at the Dachess Theatre
It was difficult to study the text for the Chambers.
The panic's quite useful, it strengthens the muscle.
And they took it well, so it was like a sign that said, "That's what you have to do."
He said that, of course, by the voice of the Group.
So I'll hold on to it.
I really love it.
I like to be in the rehearsal room.
In fact, Henry's still thinking of a comedian -- our conversation all the way through, he's having a great sense of humor when he starts, he's going to end his paranoia.
I just decided not to work in the stand, because this thing with a instant payout from the whole strangers room, I think it's pretty dangerous.
If you're always trying to do that, it can get you into a hole.
Sometimes I work in the direct air in Apollo when I want, but mostly I don't get the pleasure as I used to.
I'm asking if he'll ever make a tour of the stand.
It's a pleasure to sit in a room with a director who helps give the form of the beginning, the middle and the end of the road - I don't think I'll ever want to give up on it.
So that's his new appearance?
I think so.
I like being an actor.
It's a good time.
You always tell a story, and here's a great place to do it.
I love stories.
People like stories.
Kenya registers government officials to identify “invisible workers”
Kenya has begun biometric registration of all government officials in an attempt to remove “invisible workers” from the Government ' s payment statement.
Staff members who are not registered within the next two weeks will no longer be paid are reported in the Government statement.
The Government suspects that thousands of people continue to receive salaries after leaving the public service.
President Uhuru Kenya promised to reduce corruption in government structures after he came to power in 2013.
The audit audit found earlier this year that at least $1 million (£70,000,000) per month is missing from “invisible workers” and other financial violations.
The Government suspects that payments continue to be made to bank accounts, even after a person dies or leaves the public service, reports BBC reporter Vannyam Chebusiri from Nairobi.
All government officials should be present within the next two weeks at the identification centres to ensure that their data will be collected through a biometric registration procedure is reported in the Government statement.
Any person who fails to do so without due cause will be excluded from the payment account shall be reported in it.
“This procedure would be a significant means of streamlining the public service by determining the actual number of public servants, and would also be used to clear the payment statement at both levels of government, thus ending the problem of “invisible workers”, said Ann Weigru, Secretary of the Cabinet of Ministers for Planning and Structure of Authority.
Ten Turkish police officers arrested in connection with "agreement" against the Government
A total of 33 police officers were detained in Turkey on suspicion of “a conspiracy against the Government”, reports local information agencies.
Police representatives did not immediately comment on this information.
Among the detainees were 14 high-ranking officers reported by Hurriet Daily News.
Some of them were involved in corruption detection activities last December, which was aimed at verifying government officials, including four Government ministers.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested for suspecting the establishment of an organized criminal group and hearing the phone.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was then Prime Minister) defined their actions as part of the measures taken against him and others under the authority of the Islamic clique Fethullah Gulen.
Not all children returned to school in Ukraine
Schools in most of Ukraine reopened their doors on Monday (September 1st) after summer cannibals.
This day is traditionally a major event for families, and as thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arsien Yacenyuk took his daughter to school.
There he told expected journalists that not all schools had been reopened, but that he would do his best to protect the country for future generations:
On the first September, the ceremony was not held in every school.
There is no peaceful sky over every part of Ukraine.
We must fight for the peace sky.
The whole of Ukraine, a huge united Ukrainian people's front, must fight for the peace sky.
Alexan Pastuhov, head of school in Slavyanska, where the daughter of Yacenjuka went, spoke Russian.
We hope that the world will finally be established here and that children will receive knowledge that will be useful in their future life.
On the first day of the study, children are traditionally noted for wearing high - quality shirts, holding air scarves in their hands, and giving their teachers flowers.
In the face of Rona Fairhead BBC, she may have found such an impressive leader as she needs
It is followed by a wave of fame from the world of banking, media and internal affairs of the Tori Party.
In fact, she has her own experience in leadership.
Its career began at a consulting firm on the global management of Bain and Co and then continued at Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and in the media world at Pearsons.
She was the head of the Financial Times for seven years, resigning when Pearson's senior position was taken over by a lower-ranking colleague.
They say her earnings are approaching £1 million.
Its political rating is also strong.
She was recommended by David Cameron Lord Brown, a former head of BP when he tried to bring private sector experts to Whitehall: she became a consultant to the Cabinet of Ministers.
She's her husband, former counselor Tori.
Earlier in May, I called the work of the president of the poisoned glass.
BBC is not only a huge and complex organization in the heart of public life, but there is an internal paradox in its structure.
The Council has two aims: inside the management hierarchy itself, but outside as a voice of public concern and concern when something goes wrong.
This is a nearly unattainable duopolis that requires full radical reform.
However, what new president would risk coming, exploding and destroying an institution as difficult as a Chinese dynasty if it itself did not work in this process.
It's a difficult solution.
It would not be so difficult, many people would be happy to see how the BBC would decrease in size, after reviewing its powers, finances and status.
As competitors narrow the circle and new technologies pose challenges to delicate old habits, inevitable negotiations on the value of the licence pose a special danger to BBC.
For a modest amount of £145.50 per year, the British acquire a share in the largest media business in the world.
BBC tells a good story: it claims that the results of its work cover 96 per cent of households and each of them stands at 40p per day.
Moreover, it is evident that Beeb’s popularity is growing: 53 per cent support it today against 31 per cent 10 years ago.
The viewing and use models of BBC have changed: now I get news headlines on my mobile phone and watch missing iPlayer programs.
But it remains a very popular and impressive institution.
He needs an impressive president - I hope she found him.
Perry from Texas says a humiliating tweet was written by someone outside
The tweet from the confirmed account of Governor Texas of the Republic of Rick Perry contained an insulting image of the district prosecutor from the Democrats at the centre of criminal prosecution for abuse of power on Sunday evening.
Twitter was removed later, followed by another from Perry's account, in which the record was decomposed.
Only a tweet from my account was published that was written by someone from abroad.
"I don't approve of this tweet, and I took it off," the later record says.
Perry's assistants did not respond immediately to the requests to comment.
Although the records were loaded from Perry ' s confirmed account, it was unclear who was actually involved in publishing the tape.
Earlier on, the tweet contained an unintended cartoon for the prosecutor of Travis Rosmary Lemberg County, who was found guilty of driving in a state of drunkenness in April 2013.
Perry imposed a ban on her agency when she refused to resign, which led to the trial of a large jury in Austin this month against Perry, who was a potential candidate for the presidents in the 2016 elections.
The signature on TV says, "I don't always drive a car in a state of drunkenness, three times the permissible level of alcohol in the blood, but when I do, I accuse Governor Perry of what he tells me about it."
I'm the drunkest democracy in Texas.
The Lemberg delegation did not conduct an investigation with the participation of a large jury against Perry.
They took care of Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was appointed a Republican judge.
Perry did not acknowledge himself guilty and called the charges a political prisoner.
His powerful legal team had asked the judge in charge of the case to reject the indictment, stating that the law used to prosecute the governor who had been in charge for the longest time throughout the history of Texas would be contrary to the Constitution.
Perry has stopped funding for $7.5 million from the state resources of the State Public Control Division, which is based in Travis County and is pursuing corruption in the public sector in Texas when Lemberg refused to resign.
The Vetera made a formal complaint by a group of public controls with left views.
Perry's confirmed account chain is often updated - and sometimes becomes famous.
When Perry arrived at the fifth party in Iowa during his presidential campaign in 2012, he responded to the news that he could get out of the game by posting a tweet with a photograph of himself running near the lake and saying, "Here we are, South Carolina!"
Berkeley reports that the real estate market has returned to "normal"
One of London's most famous contractors warned that the real estate market in South-East England had “returned” to the normal level of activity.
Homes in the capital were the subject of rising demand and rising prices, and there was widespread fear that a credit bubble would force the Bank of England to impose restrictions on mortgage loans in June.
Tony Piggly, founder and chairman of the Berkeley elite construction company, said Monday: "From the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned to the normal level of transactions since peak 2013, adding that it has provided a "stable working environment".
The London real estate market was successful during the fall, as foreign buyers went to the capital.
Prices in the city jumped by 18.5 per cent last year alone, according to the Earth Census, significantly increased the average rate of 6.7 per cent for England and Wales as a whole.
The average market prices for private, accessible and student schemes Berkeley increased by about one fifth last year, reaching £423,000 by the end of April.
However, the strengthening of the pound in recent months has made London's real estate less attractive to foreign buyers, some of whom have also stopped introducing new real estate taxes and political rhetoric around the potential " personal tax " before the general elections next May.
The London Real Estate Agency Foxtons warned last week that April's reform of the mortgage market, under which more stringent loan conditions were introduced, would also lead to a reduction in market growth, both in real estate sales and in the second half of the year.
New data from the Bank of England showed a fall in the number of approved mortgage loans in June, suggesting further cooling in the housing market.
Hamptons International, another real estate agency, has reduced its forecast of rising London real estate prices for 2015 to 3 per cent on the basis that real estate prices have already begun to weaken.
The volume of transactions fell to the fourth in comparison with the previous year in the most expensive areas of London, such as Chelsea, Mayer and Kensington, according to WA Ellis.
However, the demand for a home in the capital has proved very beneficial to Berkeley, raising sales of more than £2.2 billion.
Mr. Piggly added: "The demand for goods with good design and better location remained the former and, reflecting this, sales remained for a time."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3742 new houses this year by the end of April, almost three times as much as in the 2007 peak.
The annual income before tax was increased by 40 per cent compared to the previous year to £380 million, income by 18 per cent to £1.6 billion.
On Monday before the annual meeting of the company, Mr. Piggly said that Berkeley ' s expected revenues would be in line with current market expectations this year.
According to the unanimous opinion of analysts, income is expected for the whole year before tax payments of £450 million.
The cost of Berkeley's shares was £23.96 on the London Stock Exchange in the afternoon.
Photos by Jennifer Lawrence are posted online by hacker
Jennifer Lawrence is attending the 85th anniversary ceremony of the American Film Academy.
The photographs of the filmed actress Jennifer Lawrence, who received the Oscar Award, were posted on the Internet by a hacker who assures him that he has another 100 rising stars in his "catalogue".
The star star "Golden Games" confirmed that the photos of Lawrence are present and condemned the hacker for "sudden invasion into private space".
The law enforcement authorities have been tried and will be prosecuted by anyone who will publish stolen photographs of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos that were originally posted on the 4chan photo exchange site were allegedly obtained due to the lack of an Apple iCloud online storage system, and the alleged “catalogue” of victims of fractures includes dozens of names, including Ryanna, Kim Cardassian, Mary Elizabeth Winston and Mary Kate Olsen, according to BuzzFeed.
It is not clear how many of these photographs are real, although the Scott Pilgrim Star against everyone, Winsted, on Twitter, also condemned the invasion.
"The one who looks at the photos we took with her husband a few years ago when she joined us at home, I hope you're proud of yourself," wrote Winsted on Twitter.
However, Victoria Justis from the Nickolodeon series "iCarly" and "Victory Victory" denied that in the photos she wrote on Twitter: "These are the so-called photos of me being immersed in FALSHIVIKI, people.
Let me stop this in the womb.
Buzzfeed reported last Sunday that the representative of the Aryan Grande pop star denied that the photo on which she was supposed to be real was true.
The exclusive break from Howard Jacobson's new novel about "J" and "J" praising critics
They were dissolved, the best thing to say is, they gradually fell apart like a cardboard box they left under the rain.
Only sometimes did a woman tell him that he was too serious, heavy in society, tense, closed and, perhaps, a little irritable.
And then she grabbed his hand.
He saw anger in him.
He was spinning like a goat, yeah.
The last victim of this coyote was a little novel, which he expected more than usual, to be saved from loneliness and boredom and perhaps even some satisfaction.
Eileen Solomons was three times as beautiful as the hairy and trembling heart of the northern island village, which was even more distant and harsh than Port Royben.
She came to the south with a satellite older than herself, whom Kevern considered her aunts, and her last heir to the home in the raw, but looked like a paradise valley called the "Ray Valley."
No one's lived in the house for a few years.
The plumbing pipes, which were sitting in the bathrooms, left their trails in all the windows, confident that the house belonged to them; the garden was destroyed by locusts like giant catfish.
It was like a cottage from a children's book, at the same time scary and charming, with a whole secret garden.
Author's view: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" was included in the Longlist of the Bucker Prize in 2014.
The shortlist will be announced next week
Kevern and Eileen were sitting behind their hands in the cracks in the middle of a high grass, enjoying an unexpected hot spring day; they both had a wide connection to the cheap console that provided the country with soothing music and soothing news, when, in view of her shriveled brown legs, he remembered the old song of a long forgotten black performer who loved to listen to his father, relaxing the dishes in the house.
You've got too big legs.
Because of their aggressiveness, such songs on the consoles were no longer lost.
They were not prohibited - nothing was actually forbidden - they were not lost anymore.
They were helped to become archaic, just like the word "archaic".
The public taste was doing something that could never be achieved by orders and regulations, and just as among the books, people chose rich memoirs that grew up in poverty, culinary books and love novels, they picked up all the music.
With that day in mind, Kevern agreed to play on an imaginary piano and with a rough comical voice to sing the big legs of Eileen.
Eileen didn't understand.
"It was a popular jazz pianist song named Fats Waller," he said to her, handing her two fingers to her ass.
That's how his father always did to stop the letter "J" before she got out of his mouth.
It started with the game they played when he was a kid.
His father played with his father as he told him.
Start with "J," forget to apply two fingers to the lips, and it'll cost you a penny.
It wasn't very fun at the time, and it wasn't very fun right now.
He knew what was expected of him, that's all.
He had to explain that it was jazz.
Elynn never heard him.
Neither did Jazz, although he was not openly banned.
The improvisation came out of fashion.
There's only one ass left in life.
When the melody began, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
It's exactly the same with the blade.
His unpredictability had an effect on people’s nerves.
And jazz was an austere expressed in music.
Although he was 10 years old, he never heard of Sammy Davis Young, Kevern knew about jazz from the Father's semi-secret collection of CDs.
But even if he didn't have to tell Aileen that Fats Waller was black.
Considering her age, she hardly remembered the time when popular singers were not black.
Again, no laws or pressures.
The community was obedient, and that meant that each segment had agreed with gratitude, thanks to those who had preserved fate, with the principle of group predestination.
People of Afro-Caribbean origin and physical characteristics had a good approach to entertainment and sports - and they sang and ran.
Those from Indonesia, as if by nature they were talented in all electronics, were taken to ensure that no family was left without a working electronic phone.
What was left of the Polish diaspora was Santechnique; what was left of the Greek was tarella.
Those who left the Persian Gulf and Levant whose grandfathers did not quickly leave the country, when TO, WHAT WAS IT? If IT WAS, they were afraid that they would be charged with burning fires, in fear, saying that the fire would devour them the next, opened restaurants with labs and kaliens, did not hesitate and suffocated from Sundays.
Everyone's capable.
Since she had heard only the ballads before, Elynn was hard to understand how insulting words that she had just heard from Kevern could be put on music at all.
Music is an expression of love.
"They're not really offensive," said Kevern.
Or maybe for people with big legs.
My father never insulted anyone, but he missed this song.
He said too much, but the lost garden gave him a security illusion.
No word could come through the sound isolation of giant leaves, which resembled the shells.
Eileen still didn't understand.
How could your father love that?
He wanted to say that this was a joke, but he didn't want to stick two fingers in her face again.
She already thought it was weird.
"It seemed funny to him," he said instead.
She raised her head in disbelief, closing the Kevin review.
There was nothing in the world but the land of its black and white hair.
Nothing he'd like to look at.
"Well, if that's what you're saying," she said in her opinion.
But that doesn't explain why you eat it to me.
She said she was really upset.
Do I have too big legs?
He looked at them again.
You can't say no.
Dolls, maybe I can hear...
And you say you hate me because my boots are too thick?
Do I hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It's just that stupid song.
He could have said, "I love you," but that was too early.
"I like you just because you've got the thickest dolls," he tried to say instead.
I've got such a fuss.
That sounded wrong.
He wanted it to be funny.
The attempts to shoot him were often made to make him feel uncomfortable because, like his father, he lacked the reassuring promise that could alleviate the harshness of beatings.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel.
Maybe he, Kevin, wanted it.
Despite the good eyes.
Eileen Solomons was adorable and stood out of the locker, and the console and wine poured out that they had been drinking.
Wine from the bush, so alcohol could not serve as his excuse.
In her excitement she seemed like palm leaves in the hurricane.
"And I like you just because you have a stupid head," she said...
Even if you don't like it.
He felt sorry for her and for the excessive cruelty of her words, and for the fear that appeared in her eyes when she gave him up.
Did she think he was gonna hit her?
She didn't talk to him about life in the cold northern archipelago where she grew up, but he didn't doubt that in the main lines she looked like this.
The same huge ice ocean hit both of them.
The same men who were beaten, even more sensitive and capricious after that, if they had been tried, than their ancestors, smugglers and destroyers, had been flogged out of the pope's rage, ready to raise their hand against any woman who laughed at them or taunted them.
A stupid head?
They'd show her a stupid bullet if she wasn't careful!
We would first kiss -- the kiss now became the most common expression of erotic anger between men and women; opposition from the fresh ballads that the console issued -- first kiss her and then hit her.
More detail, in Kevern's opinion, because kissing yourself was already a hooliganity.
Eileen Solomon’s corpus showed that he had to leave.
He got up out of his locker like an old man.
She felt lead weight herself, but the weight of his grief surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
She watched him leave, and from the top window she watched him leave, her companion was the man who was carrying his burdens.
Adam, leaving the garden, she thought.
She felt compassion for him and his men at all, even though some of them had raised their hand.
The man who turned his back on her, with his back bent, angry, all the power to fight left him--why did she think she knew it so well if she could not remember any of the events until today when she saw it?
Once again, one of Eileen Solomons looked at her feet.
Twenty years before the events described above or around Esme Nussbaum, a smart and energetic 32-year-old researcher who worked in Ofnau, the informal community control service, has prepared a small report on the maintenance of low and medium-level violence in the same parts of the country where it was expected to be reduced if it did not stop completely, taking into account the resources and forces that had been allocated to its eradication.
"A lot has been done, and much is done," she wrote, "in order to alleviate the vicious aggression of people who fought in thousands of wars and won most of them, especially among these divided villages and narrow settlements where, despite the money on the ruins of the churches, the gentle breathing of human kindness has rarely been felt throughout history.
However, some of the qualities appear to be inexhaustible.
The higher the mirror, the lower the passion it produces.
The population shed tears over sentimental ballads, ravaged the history of overcrowded obstacles, and declared their own failure to believe in a good marriage and family life, but not only did old cruelty keep its strong grip both in rural communities and in urban settlements, but there is also evidence of new and vicious homelessness, workplaces, roads and even playgrounds.
"You have a boring habit of writing too much," said her scientist, reading the whole report.
I think you should read less novels.
Esme Nussbaum dropped his head.
I also have to ask you: Are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to answer," Esme Nussbaum replied.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme again insisted on her right to privacy and silence.
Feminist?
Silence again.
"I ask," said Luther Rabinovic, "not because I am against atheism, lesbianism or feminism.
We don't have any prejudice here.
We are servants of society without prejudice.
But some types of hypersensitivity, absolutely acceptable and commendable in themselves, can sometimes distort the results, such as what you have shown me.
Obviously, you are themselves prejudiced against the church, and what you call "bad" and "bad," others would interpret as an expression of natural love and energy.
To continue to offer what has happened if it has always been, as if it had happened yesterday, means to leave the country in need of life.
Esme Nussbaum watched the sides while Rabinovic spoke.
Behind his head, pink, like flamingo, was repeated by the words that "ofnau" has given the country for the last four centuries or more.
Smile to your neighbor, your wife's prices, listen to the ballads, go to the music, talk on the phone, share it, explain it, listen, agree, apologize.
A word of silence is better, a word of song is better than a written word, but there is nothing better to love.
"I fully understand what you want to say," Esme Nussbaum quietly replied when she found out that her research director had finished saying, "and I don't want to say anything except that we haven't been treated as effectively as we are convinced of ourselves.
I'm worried that if we're not ready, we'll find that we're repeating the mistakes that initially led to TOM, what it's all about if it's all about.
Only this time will we throw out our anger and trust in others.
Luther Rabinovic united the ends of his fingers in the pyramid.
This gesture must have meant endless patience.
"You're going too far," he said, "by calling the "errors" of actions that our grandfathers have done or have not done.
You go too far and when you say they've thrown their anger and their lack of trust in others.
In your place, a person should not need to remind himself that, having understood the past, that is to protect the present, we are not talking about "we" and "them".
There were no "us" and there were no "other".
It was a time of turmoil. That's all we know.
"For which, if you're honest with yourself," dared to insert Esme, "no part of society can justify itself well.
I don't blame anyone.
Was it bad or good, what was done, was done.
It was then.
You don't have to say anything anymore. We agree.
And just as no one should be blamed, no one should be justified if it was appropriate or if there was something that could be corrected.
But what if you don't want to learn?
The past is for us to forget it.
If I can add one word to that--
The pyramid of Luther Rabinovic broke down.
"I'll take care of your report," he said, letting her go.
The next day, on the way to work, she was hit by a motorcyclist who went on the road, as described by passing, "in anger."
It's a coincidence.
The Army of Lesotho claims that the conversion was not planned; the Prime Minister remains in South Africa
The representatives of the Lesotho Army objected to the preparation of a coup in order to overthrow the Government, claiming that they were acting against the police who were suspected of attempting to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Tabane left the country, claiming that the country ' s army had surrounded his official residence and had seized government buildings in Masera.
The Prime Minister took his family into neighboring South Africa, claiming that he had been threatened with attempted life.
Major Ntlele Ntoi's army said that there was actually no revolution, but that the army reacted to the threat of "political fanatics" that police were trying to arm.
"What happened this morning is that the command of the Lesotho Armed Forces has taken action, having received several reconnaissance reports that there are some elements among the police that are really planning to arm some political, young political fanatics who were prepared to create chaos," he told the Voice of America.
The representative of the South African Government, Clayson Moniel, said that the army ' s actions looked like a turning.
"Although no one has filed claims to seize power, according to all the information, the actions of the Lesotho armed forces now have the main signs of conversion," he said.
The representatives of Lesotho’s army reported that the soldiers had returned to the barracks on Sunday and that the capital had calmed down.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Motejoa Metsing is administered by the Government in the absence of Tabana.
The Taliban stated that it believed that it was under attack in connection with an attempt to combat corruption in the country.
The situation in Lesotho was very tense since June, when Tabané suspended parliamentary sessions as a result of disagreements in his united Government.
He stated that his actions had not been undermined by the Government, despite the charges against him.
Chelsea's semi-protector Marko van Ginkel will conduct the upcoming rental season in Milan, says Milan Channel.
The 21-year-old Dutchman will be in Italy in the near future to conduct a medical examination.
In the past season, he went to the London Club field only three times.
Let's remember that Milan used to rent to Liverpool attacking Fernando Torres.
Production in eurozone at the lowest rate for 13 months
Production growth in the eurozone slowed down to the lowest 13 months in August, according to popular research.
The latest value of the euro area industry business index (PMI) for Markit fell by 50.7 in August, falling from 51.8 in July.
The value above 50 indicates growth.
New orders have been held, and enterprises have been affected by the growing tension between the EU and Russia in relation to Ukraine.
The values came before the European Central Bank (ECB) meeting on Thursday.
Markets will expect a clear plan from the bank to deal with the cessation of the eurozone recovery, as well as the threat of inflation, which is only 0.3 per cent.
It is assumed that the head of the ECB, Mario Dragi, may later this week give additional signals that he is considering a scheme of quantitative mitigation for the eurozone, similar to those used by Britain and the United States during the financial crisis.
"Although some growth is better than any growth, the slowing effect of growing economic and geopolitical uncertainty on producers is becoming more evident," said Markit, Senior Economist Rob Dobson.
Germany’s production sector’s PMI, Russia’s largest trading partner in the EU, fell to the lowest in 11 months of note 51.4.
Meanwhile, in the second-largest block economy, France, PMI fell to 46.9.
France continues to be concerned about the present as well as the weakening of Italy from stable growth to stagnation.
The signs that the momentum of the increase in emissions in the main industrial engine, Germany, as well as in Spain and the Netherlands, also does not add confidence," said Mr. Dobson.
The slowdown in the industry is likely to still be seen in the fire by analysts waiting for additional monetary or fiscal incentives.
One good news was from Ireland, where PMI grew to 57.3, its highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist IHS Global Insight, said: "The brightest thing to say about the August study of the business activity index of the eurozone industry is that it shows that the sector is still growing."
He added: "The eurozone producers are obviously living very difficult at this time, as the current increased geopolitical tension - especially in Russia/Ukraine - adds uncertainty to the still difficult conditions in many countries.
This increased tension has apparently hit business - and especially consumer confidence - and is likely to lead to some orders being delayed or even cancelled, especially large orders.
He said that "more and more like," that the ECB would eventually have to carry out some variety of quantitative mitigation, "though we suspect it will be limited."
The inhabitants of Mariupola will show a live line against the militia
In Mariúpolis before last week, everything was quiet — no one had to organize the Mariúpolis People’s Republic, the city of the Azaw Sea.
Now the inhabitants are looking forward to the arrival of "policemen."
According to politicians, separatists are breaking into Mariupoli to go to the Azov Sea, a recently taken town of Novoazovsk, which had not previously been part of the self-proclaimed republics.
The Mariuples decided that the Ukrainian army, although it would protect them, had little power against the well-armed representatives of the DND-LNR, and had gathered to assist the military.
They're tearing up shelters, building blocks and reinforcements.
On Saturday evening, several thousand people arrived at the eastern border of the city, and they stood there in a live shack, singing Ukraine’s gymnasium.
They're going to do the same thing in the event of an incident.
Volunteers collect and transport equipment and products, collect medicines, publish the newspaper.
In the city, shops are gradually closed, banks and ATMs are stopped.
Ten Years of Hell for the survivors of Beslan: Ten Years of the Iron Curtain Like the Children It Has Been
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen fighters at the school in Beslan, South Russia
More than 330 people, more than half of whom were killed during this three-day trial that shocked the world
We went back to Beslan to find some of the victims who cheated on death at school.
Just ten years later, after the terrible arrest of the Beslan school, during which 334 people were killed, including 186 children who had survived the heroic catastrophe, were warned yesterday evening about the new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When terrorists, Islamic fanatics, captured and killed children and parents on 1 September 2004, at the beginning of the new quarter, this seemed to be something of the extreme degree of possible evil.
The tragedy brought the East and the West together in a reversal, which then miraculously came into effect and hope for the future in the worst of times.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan, south of Russia, to find some of the victims who cheated on death at school.
We have found amazing young people who have resisted evil, although memories of the terrorist hell will live with them forever.
The greatest hope for them?
That the war that now haunts Ukraine, in which children like them are killed, will end now.
A girl who's trying to get back to the shooting sports room
It was printed on a picture of a famous Russian photographer, Dmitria Belakova, when a white man tried to take him back to the shooting sports hall after the mine exploded.
In the destruction of Aida, she desperately sought her mother, Larissa, who is now 40.
They were afraid they were killed, but they actually survived.
"The woman told me to run away from all the forces, but I couldn't," Aida said.
My legs were covered with blood.
I got up and went back inside to find my mom.
Soldiers have improved her and taken her to a safe place.
After the surgery, she thought she had recovered completely, but yesterday she said, "Three months ago, the pain came back.
I'm afraid I may need more surgery.
There's a couple of scissors left in my knee.
Her goal now is to become a dentist, to help people the way doctors helped her.
"This tragedy has changed my life, but of course it has not broken it," she says with a challenge.
"It happened to me, and you can't change that.
Once a year, I always go to this gym to remind everyone who's left.
My friends and I are trying not to talk about it the other day.
It's too strong.
My best friend, who was supposed to be my classmate, was killed there.
We played together when we were little, and we dreamed we'd go to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I finish school and start working.
I'll think about the family later.
She says she's still caught up with her, even though memories fade a little every year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our poverty, and we are so grateful for the help we have received from people from Britain and everywhere.
When I see a photo on the Internet where I go into the school window, I think that many people will see it for the first time, learn about our tragedy and do it so that it doesn't happen anymore.
The boy who ran through the city pool, thinking his mother was dead
It was his first day at school (Russians start school at age 7) and survived three days of arrest, including his mother Tamara.
Then he had seven, and he said, 'My mother said to me to heal, if there is an explosion, and to keep her by the hand.'
After one of the explosions, he thought she was dying.
She told him to run.
Fearing that she was dead, he ran away and saw a crying little boy on the way, grabbed the child by his hand, and fled through the city of the pool.
His father Vladimir, who had captured his son outside, said, "Damir told me his mother had died.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara was released and was in a hospital with leg injuries, thinking that her son had died.
After they were reunited, she said, "I cried out for joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran and hugged me.
Damira was later brought to London (now unknown News of the World) where he was rewarded as Child Protection Officer of the Barnardo's Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Sheri.
"That horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it," he said yesterday.
Still, I can tell you that I remember him squeezing.
I remember throwing all my toy guns right after that.
But now I can play computer games with guns, and it's not a problem for me.
"I'm not afraid to go back to that gym, but I don't think about myself.
I remember the kids I was playing with in the yard who weren't even chosen.
We never say they were killed or dead.
We're saying they stayed in the gym.
I remember my trip to London so well, especially a toy store where I was allowed to choose everything I wanted, and a trip to a car with an open top.
But now he is afraid of places like Ukraine where wars lead to a mountain that he and his friends have survived.
This horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
"I'm so sorry for all those who suffer from these horrors," said Damir, who was volunteering last week at a women's monastery.
That's how I want to help.
I want to go to the police sometime, and I hope I'll be enrolled in the training academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48 years old, said, "37 children were killed in our neighborhood, can you imagine?
I remember the yellow silence immediately after the capture, there were just no children to scream and run around, and that silence continued for many months.
She will remember her visit to London with Damir.
The people in London cried when I told our story.
I realized how people at the other end of the earth can understand our feelings and provide support.
She was grateful to Sheri Blair and her fund for the award and the opportunity to go to London in the fall of 2004.
I'd like to call Sherry and just tell her it's been 10 years, but I still remember the meeting with her and her husband in London and how they helped Damira and me.
I remember when Damir wanted to eat the boat, they called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember him playing with the officers at the restaurant, Damir shot them out of his water gun, and they ran away and played with him.
And it's been a month since our nightmare then.
I was shocked that the British were so willing to share our pain and support.
She said, "I don't think this world has gotten any better in these 10 years.
There's a war going on in Ukraine, people die every day, and I think a lot of kids have been killed and will be killed.
They're just children like ours.
I think for many people the war is a news report they listen to when they're bored or when they're busy.
I just know that these people feel the horror of it.
And I can't stop feeling it.
Nothing's changed, people still want to kill each other, and it's so sad.
Damir grew up to be a very soft and calm boy, not aggressive or bad.
He's not looking for a place, for example, he's not surrounded by this past nightmare.
I know he doesn't like to remember him, but they're very close to six classmates, and they go to the sports hall from time to time and light candles there.
When he was younger, he suffered from it. I remember him lying on the couch, turning away from us for hours.
He didn't sleep. His eyes were open.
I also remember how he threw all his weapons and other military toys.
I find it hard to believe that I've been so sure for several hours that he died and that I'll never see him again.
When I was able to repair the explosion and get up on my feet, I looked around, and I saw myself lying around.
I was absolutely sure it was impossible for my little boy to survive in this hell.
"I remember screaming to him, "Damir, run away," but again I was so sure he didn't hear me.
But he heard and fled.
Such a life continues for us, unlike so many others.
Georgia Illin, 17 years old
A boy whose shocking photo after the capture has become a determining factor for the tragedy in Beslan
Peace: survivors of Beslan Georgia Ilyn and his mother Fatima after the arrest in 2004 and the Georgia case today
On his shielded face was a sign of fear when he was saved from death when Czech terrorists shot his classmates.
His photograph was one of the most shocking symbols of barbarism in Beslan.
His mother, Fatima, was 54 years old, the principal doctor, took him to school on the first day of school before taking Vladimir’s eldest son to university.
"I left in two minutes before the terrorists ran into the court, so my little boy stayed one for three days of nightmare," she recalled.
Not exactly one, there was a family of our relatives, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgia managed to survive.
The closer that date, the harder it is to think and talk about it.
There's not a day when we don't remember this tragedy.
We don't think it's been a long time, I think it happened yesterday, some scenes these days are always in front of me.
No one will ever forget, I promise you.
It is in the soul: the photograph of Georgia (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was forever preserved in the sculpture (right)
I remember Georgie so wanted to go to school the day she said she wanted to embrace the teacher.
I just found out he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there's even a sculpture of a crying Georgia in San Marino.
Georgia doesn't like to look at this picture, and she's hidden in a book cabinet in our house.
I understand, but I also think that this photograph makes people around the world feel our pain.
Georgia now says: "It is important that this never happens again.
"I doubt we'll ever know the truth.
People continue to investigate such tragedies and never know the truth.
Now they're investigating this Boing riot in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what it was called?
This world is going to something very bad.
"I can't understand how it happens, because if you ask people, they don't want war, because it happens?
Ten years is nothing for that pain.
We need ten years to forget her a little.
She influenced my health, and I still feel it.
I've had nightmares about three or four years since I was caught, but now it's getting better.
I went back to school later in 2004, and I was very scared every day.
I thought about my friends and classmates who were killed.
That is why I continue to go to this sports hall before 1 September.
I want to remind my old friends of my childhood.
It's hard for me to get into the gym, but I have to do it.
I don't feel victimized, this story is part of my past now.
I won't forget about it, but I don't feel sorry for myself.
My life continues.
I graduated this year and went to medical school in Vladikavkaz.
I'll learn to become a cardiosurgeon.
My first choice was to go into the army.
I wanted to be military, but my health didn't allow me.
I wanted to fight for my country, but it won't happen.
Georgia Farniev, 20 years old
The boy who survived, despite what was at the terrorist's feet.
Amazing: Georgie Farniev was at the feet of a terrorist during his arrest, but he managed to survive.
At the time of his arrest, he was photographed in a sports room next to a bomb at the terrorist's feet.
Actually, it's a miracle he wasn't killed.
"We think it was just yesterday," said Georgie, who wanted to study with an FSB intelligence officer, but could not because of the damage he was caused to his health during his arrest.
It's still with me, it's not something I left behind.
I'm older now, and they're saying that kids are easily dealing with bad things, I have to say it's not true.
"In 2006, I worked with psychologists, and I felt a little better after that, but I can't forget it.
And I'd like to forget.
In 2005, for the next year, it was the first and last time I entered this sports hall again.
I've lost consciousness.
I would never go there again, and please don't ask me to show where I was sitting on this famous photograph.
Survivor: Georgia Farniev today with an open photo of himself in the hospital after arrest
My pain is huge, and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know that I don't like to think about it or discuss it, and they never asked me about school.
As far as physical condition is concerned, I'm healthy.
I need to be careful with the knee that was damaged, but now I'm walking fine.
But health still didn't let me go to the FSB Academy in St. Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent my documents, including medical findings, and they replied that it was impossible.
My second involvement was animal, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I've been studying there for two years.
He learns how to treat all animals from basket to cow.
He said, "I know I will never tell my children about my experience.
This is not what children should know, and of course it is not what they should survive.
His mother, Marina, aged 42, said, "This pain never leaves me.
She's in my soul, worse when the anniversary approaches.
I will go and attend the ceremonies that will be held to mark it.
I know Georgia won't go.
She must be even stronger for him because he was there and I wasn't.
I was waiting for him at home, and I couldn't help it.
I'm so grateful to God that he came back to me.
He's staying with us.
Georgia is now an adult, but this nightmare is still with him.
It's hard to accept when something so awfully unfair happens to you.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't take care of them because of their knees.
He had a few operations, he could walk, but he couldn't do sports.
I'd say he's over 50%, but it's impossible to completely overcome and forget.
This juicy experience will remain with us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the capture, and that only makes my pain more intense.
I've lost a lot of people that I knew well and were dear to me.
My son is with me, and this is the best gift God could have given me, but my heart hurts for those who have been killed.
I know families where new children were born, but I also know widows who have never married again.
It's hard to believe that life is going on, even if you don't want to.
I'll never forget how my heart broke out in my chest when I saw him in the hospital.
Now I look at what is happening in the world, wars in different regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is very close to our country now, and I find it hard to believe.
We were one friendly country in the past, how did we get to fight now?
People and children are suffering, I'm sure many children have already been killed in Ukraine and many will be killed.
If you could catch all rebels and throw them out as far as you can.
Alona Ckaeva, 10 years old
A young man who has been brought to a safe place by a skilled fighter
Saved: Alonu Ckaevu is taken to a safe place by the Russian Szcznaza (left).
Now she's ten on the right, and she doesn't even remember the great crime.
The world had stopped breathing in 2004, when a Russian police officer took little Alion out of the trapped school in Beslane.
Terrorists fired her, but brutally left her 30-year-old mother, Christine's ten-year-old sister and Brother Mahara in the school's gym.
Mahar, who was then three years old, was saved, but Alona’s mother and sister died in a deadly battle.
Her father, Ruslan, has been married again since then, and they have his new wife, Svetlana, a little daughter whom he called Christina, in memory of the daughter he lost.
AIIona, now ten, who remembers nothing about capture and blooming in a smart and life - threatening girl, says neighbors.
"They're a great happy family now, and Alona and Mahar are both beautiful children," said a close friend.
Ruslan is a great father and wants to keep them away from all memories when the tenth anniversary is observed.
You can understand why.
The defender of Sindhi Kagawa, who returned from Manchester United to Dortmund's Borussia, said he looked forward to being able to go out again as a German club.
He says that this transfer is a happy event in a career.
Of course, I'm very glad that I'm going to play for "Borusia" again - the image of the word Kagawa.
I feel really good.
It's a trap of positive emotions, and I'm looking forward to it when I can go back to the field in the form of "Borusia".
Remember, Kagawa moved to the MU from Borussia in 2012 for 16 million euros.
However, he was unable to become a member of the English club, carrying out two seasons of 38 matches in the English championship, killing 6 balls and delivering 8 successful transfers.
A man accused of riding a girl on a pilgrimage to the "Pelican" in Fife
A 78-year-old man will be brought before the trial for a three-year-old girl on a pilgrimage to the Pelican in Fife.
Gordon Stuart was supposed to have killed a girl on the way to Pittenvin in East Newke.
The prosecutors said that Mr. Stuart had brought his Audi Q3 without proper care and attention and had beaten the girl, resulting in her injury.
Stuart, 78 years old, from Anstrouter, denied his guilt in Sheriff Dandi's court.
Sheriff Charles McNair, a royal lawyer, appointed the date of the court in January.
Obama, Merkel and Holland don't play in Vladivostok
Vladivostok's duty-free airport trade shop has set up a table banning the purchases of a number of world political leaders.
Don't get drunk with spirits, vodka, and horses.
The store administration decided that US President Barack Obama, Chancellor of FRG Angela Merkel, French President François Holland, Vitaly Klicko, Julia Timoshenko, Prime Minister of Japan and several other famous associates would not be able to recover by vodka, horses and spirits in their store.
And put the appropriate plate on the door.
Obama had previously been banned from appearing in an even less accessible form of the Dietary Table IWI facility, as reported by the public health services.
Whether the American president ever had a dream of eating at a diet table in Russia is unknown, but the authors of the ban seem to be extremely cruel.
Is there cheese after the embargo: Medvedev gave advice to the farmers
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev believes that under the embargo, Russian farmers should develop new technologies in order to set up the issue of grain-earned buyers.
The Council was given during a visit to the company "Yugticeprom" from "Agrocomplex".
The Head of Government also advised the restaurants to refocus on Russian meat, the quality of which is at an appropriate level.
The annual food import embargo was introduced in Russia from 7 August.
The Russian Chief Collector Valentin Maslakov is pleased with the DecaNation tournament.
According to the expert, third place is a good result, given the lack of targeted training for competition.
Our athletes have spoken at their level, the word "all sports" comes from Masalkov.
The third is the confirmation of our high level of command.
It is good that the advantage of the French and even the Americans over us is minimal.
It should be borne in mind that we are not prepared for these competitions.
The season is over, and we did not commit our leaders to the DecaNation match.
In recent years, we have become the second on this tournament, but we have had a meeting this season.
On the contrary, the French have issued a military team comprising 13 European champions.
They did not hide their intention to win this year, which was announced many times in public.
But even that kind of group of rivals couldn't stand the Americans.
I therefore believe that the Russians have spoken in such a representative company at a good level.
But the results in some species were in order below the same "Brilliant League".
Season's over.
Of course, sportsmen are no longer so important as they are more at the level of command.
The main place was the place.
And as a result, it seems absurd when men were so involved in tactical skirmishes at 1500 m, that they showed the result below the average level... of women's races.
4 tips on how to improve the quality of underwater photos and videos
If you want to photograph or take a video under the water, you have a variety of options for the equipment.
The cheapest option is a water-based mill, e.g. Nikon Coolpix AW120, or ex-camera, e.g. GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which are sold for about $300.
I took these photos at the family party using a few cameras, all at about $350.
No matter what equipment you use, there are several rules to be followed in order to achieve the best results.
Check your equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery camera and other offices are closed.
Also, set up your camera for the type of photos or videos you will take.
Some cameras have sampling modes or object types that optimize exposure to dark underwater conditions.
And before you get into the water, you'll find out how deep your equipment can get.
Some cameras are only 5 feet, others 50 or 60 feet.
Look at our buyer's guide and digital camera ratings for both traditional and waterproof models.
Take a few pictures, because many of them won't get.
There's a D.C.D. that will help you compose the photos, but there's usually no one in the ex-camera.
Even if you have a CCD, it will be difficult to see it under the water, and the staffing will be a random process.
So do a few things.
Also, if your camera has a serial collection system that takes several personnel with a little different exhibition facilities, use them.
Stay on the surface.
The amount of light goes down significantly, as deep as you dive under the water.
If possible, stay on the surface when you take pictures in the pool, river or ocean.
This will also allow you to pass more colors on the photos; the deeper you go, the less color you see.
Swim closer to the collection facilities.
It's a great advice for land grabbing, but it's even more important under water because of the dark light conditions.
Especially important if you take a picture of the camera: This device is often equipped with a fixed, wide-angle lens, which means that you will have to get closer to the collection facilities if you want to fill the frame.
The 2012 Bronze Prize of the Olympic Games for the Free Fight of Bilal Mahov can go to the Greek-Roman struggle.
This was reported by the chief coach of the Dagestan Congregation for the Free Fight of Sajid Sajid.
A specialist did not exclude the participation of a sportsman at the world championship in Tashkent in September 2014.
Bill Mahov is currently on the "classic" team, the "R-Sport" of Sajid Sajidov.
In fact, as a young man, Bill spoke both ways.
At the 2005 youth world championship, he became the winner of the volleyball tournament and the third stage in the Greek-Rhyme competitions and decided to focus on free fighting.
A long time ago, we had been talking about a new phase of our career in the Greek-Roman struggle.
I'll say more: Mahov can take part in the world championship in Tashkent if he wins the match.
But the crucial word is always behind the coaching headquarters in the head with Gogi Koguasville.
Andrew Lawson was such a man whose personality strength could have shaken everything around him, even in a giant organization like the National Health Service.
The consultant anesthesiologist devoted his career to the relief of both the suffering of the disease and the pain of the treatment.
Among those who had referred to him, his wife was an officer of MI-6, who had had to live with the devastating consequences of torture.
Louson realized that while the doctor was involved with diagnosis and disease, those who were being treated were mainly concerned about something else - pain.
Once in 2007, however, it proved to be the first to suffer.
"I didn't feel as usual," he wrote last May.
It was hard for me to find the strength.
Fighting with flu-like symptoms, he discovered that he was upset with his wife, Juliet.
"I want it to happen faster, not later," he remarked.
When Juliet left for the week, Lauson found out that he was unusually upset.
Something was wrong.
He asked his colleague to do a chest X-ray.
Just two weeks earlier, he had been on the cliffs in the French Alps.
X-ray results came.
It was a mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that affects the pleural, or a cloud of light.
For most cancers, it is difficult to determine the exact cause.
Although some smokers suffer from mild cancer, for example, not all smokers suffer from mild cancer.
But with another mesothelioma.
In almost every case, the reason is contact with asbestos, a fiberic construction material that was once called "a miracle", but which, as is now known, is mortally dangerous.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that can be ignored.
Asbestos, in the end, is material from the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in Britain since the 1960s when the recommended industrial ban entered into force.
Even when it was used, only people from specific industries worked closely with it: pipe-insulators, builders, plumbers and dock workers, for example.
Industrial toxins from another era can hardly be seen as a cause for concern today.
But such calmness is wrong.
Britain seems to be at the peak of the mesothelioma epidemic today.
More people die from mesothelioma than in any other country on the planet.
In the case of an annual death of some 2,500 people, more than twice as many people die from this disease than from car accidents.
Annual number of deaths from mesothelioma since 1980 and projected number of deaths in the future in Britain
The reason why we now feel its fatal consequences is that, although the use of asbestos has been illegal for many years (all types of asbestos have finally been prohibited by law in 1999), mesothelioma is usually ten years old.
And to attack mesotheliomas is not limited to veterans of industrial construction.
Asbest was, and in many cases remains, placed in the house where we live, offices where we work, schools where we learn, and shops where we go shopping.
As a result, mesothelioma does not focus on the class, level of supply, profession or age.
The election pools, from modern London universities to private schools, have proved to be no rescue.
Parliament's building is framed by asbestos.
Even the hospitals that are meant to treat us were the reservoirs of this deadly cancer.
Andrew Lauson wasn't old.
He wasn't a plumber.
In fact, he had to think about where he could get into contact with asbestos.
And then he's done it.
"There seems to have been a lot of asbestos in the tunnels in Gai's hospital, where I spent six years in the internship," he wrote.
All students, nurses, doctors and truckers used these tunnels.
I wonder how many of my nurses will get the same disease?
It was a question that he was, unfortunately, able to give a partial answer.
"Among the four doctors who have been interned in the Gai hospital and who have subsequently developed mesothelioma in the last five years," he said in a letter in 2010, "I was the one who remained alive."
How many of us are sick of this disease?
Andrew Lauson was diagnosed with mesothelioma when he was 48 years old.
When he died on 17 February this year, he was 55.
Living so long is unusual.
Fifty per cent of mesothelioma patients die 8 months after diagnosis.
She's always mortal.
So now we can just repeat the question, "How many of us are going to get the same disease?"
According to the leading expert on mesothelioma in Britain, Professor Julian Pito, it is most likely that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in Britain is expected to survive, some 90,000 people will die.
Most do not now imagine that they will die like this.
Asbestos mine in Quebec, Canada
A quick review of reports from courtrooms, where victims often resort to compensation, shows how far the attack of mesothelioma has spread.
In June, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted that Jenny Ellen had failed to contact asbestos.
She worked on the network for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, managing the clothing divisions on two sites, one of which was the main store in Oxford Street.
Mrs. Ellen was only 18 when she started working at M&S.
Now she has two children over 20 years of age.
"Before that happened," she said, "I've never heard of mesothelioma, I barely knew about asbestos.
Me and my head couldn't come to me that would touch me.
Not many people really know much about asbestos.
Actually, asbestos is not a single substance but a group of six minerals.
They received their name from the word "asbestiform", which means a fiberistic structure that tells them strength and flexibility.
Of these six, three were often used in construction.
Chrisothil, widely known as white asbestos, is more often found in buildings today.
It was used in blood panels, filling plates, thermo-insulating tubes, wheel screws, even in the brake sources of cars.
He is less mortal than other forms of asbestos, but is still recognized by the European Union and the World Health Organization as a “serious source of health damage” that could lead to death.
More dangerous, however, is brown asbestos (amozite) and blue asbestos (croquidolite).
Britain was once the largest importer of brown asbestos in the world, and experts suggest that “there are strong, although indirect reasons to believe that this is the main reason for a very high number of mesothelioma patients.”

Janice Ellen may not have thought of herself as a typical victim of mesothelioma, but Julian Pito's work suggests that her story is far from unusual.
He conducted a study of patients, which suggests that “a significant percentage of mesotheliers, when there is no known effect on work or home, were probably caused by environmental asbestos”.
Most of this effect, he said, is due to the “normal use and impact of the weather” on our buildings.
Nobody seems to be sure he's safe.
The report by Goddard Consulting, which was considered by the Westminster Palace, shows how people, even at the government's very centre, could have been affected unconsciously.
In 2009, Goddard reported that technical mines and pipelines for parliamentary committees had been contaminated by asbestos, whose deadly fibers could be moved as harmless as “strong air flows”.
Members of Parliament often accuse themselves of pursuing their own interests, but in this case it seems to be quite the opposite.
Although the Parliament's Technical Services Directorate insisted that the Westminster Palace had received a "clean health certificate", it now recognized that work would have to be done for £1 billion on Parliament's reconstruction, improving electricity and removing asbestos, and that after the 2015 general elections, Parliament's members might be sitting at the QE2 conference centre near the Westminster Greens.
Goddard's report noted that “the asbestos situation was not managed in accordance with different rules”.
It is not possible to know if this mismanagement will be worth living.
All you can do right now is wait.
One of those that couldn't find his contact with asbestos is Graham Ebbott, a doctor of general practice.
Like Andrew Lawson, Ebbott, 50 years old, he suspected that he had been affected by asbestos when he was working in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital that successfully filed asbestos-related claims," he says, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It's so hard to remember all the places he worked and the dates.
He remembers clearly, so that was the day in early December 2009, when he was hit by something that looked like a flu.
He was 45, and he was in the middle of the operation late at night.
Suddenly I started to get sick.
It started very fast.
I felt terrible.
I thought I couldn't go all the way home.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain came from the pelvis, the clouds around the light.
But like Janice Ellen, he just didn't have reason to suspect a mercenary.
Eventually, he couldn't go to work for a month.
The tasked doctors took X-rays of the chest and placed pleural catheters to extract fluid from the lungs and send it to the analysis.
Still, his condition remained undiagnosed.
His health improved gradually, and he returned to work.
But from time to time, the same symptoms returned, often after he was involved in sports and took a heavy breath.
In 2011, one of Ebbotta's patients came to him with similar symptoms and was subsequently diagnosed with mesothelioma.
However, even then Abbott did not link it to his own case.
At the end of the day, his patient was ten years older and worked with asbestos directly.
The link was obvious in this case.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition worsened again, and his consulting doctor showed the results of the CT and X-rays to the expert group.
In December 2011, just two years after Abbott began to feel bad, a camera-equipped sensor was inserted into the gap between his chest shell and his lightweight shell.
I'm an optimist.
I'm usually just going further," he says.
I wasn't too worried about it, I'm telling you the truth.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The biopsy result came on a Sunday between Christmas and New Year: "I was told it was mesothelioma."
Grem Abbott: Mesothelioma diagnosed
Ebbott suddenly met with Macmillan's nurses, one of whom invited him to contact a lawyer.
It was then that he realized the extent of the epidemic.
"It turns out that asbestos has been widely used, especially in large public buildings, where asbestos thermalization on the pipes has been quite often," he says.
People who have been affected by asbestos in these buildings are now suffering from this disease.
Thus, mesothelioma now affects more young people in atypical profession.
The most dangerous isolated asbestos tubes in the hospitals were in the basements, so it is unlikely that patients would be affected.
But many of the staff who walked through the pedestrian tunnels to fall from one building to another (like Andrew Lawson) or to eat in the basements (as Grem Ebbott often did) are almost likely to be exposed to the effects of the toxic substance.
For several decades after the war, hospitals were a place where, theoretically, they saved the lives of patients, but a place that posed a threat to the lives of doctors who had treated them.
He's still being removed today.
Schoolers set up their Bunzen fires on asbestos bases
And it's not just a hospital.
Asbest was often used in offices, shops, libraries and Marys because of its amazing isolation and fire - resistant features.
Schools, too.
In fact, many were probably the first to be exposed to the influence of asbestos in the classroom.
Throughout the country, in countless chemical lessons, schoolchildren set up their Bunzen fires on asbestos bases.
There are websites that focus on the issue of asbestos in schools.
In the meantime, in our homes, such harmless things as a plate or a roof of the Saras generally contained asbestos.
"It's an industrial poison that's placed in a huge number of our buildings," notes Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Louson in the case against the Gay Hospital.
In one case, the only contact a sick woman could remember was the garden sarcastle in the 1970s.
So be careful, you've got garden rats.
The effect of diagnosis, when it is known that the disease is incurable, is huge.
"To realize this, it's going to be a long time," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I realized I couldn't focus on what I was doing.
I've been in surgery for two weeks.
Then I realized that I had to leave and get to know myself.
Well, I'm not going to see Christmas anymore.
One of the most difficult things was the transition from a doctor to a patient.
As an infinite number of patients before him, he remembers how much information had to be taken.
"It was hard to understand," he says.
"I asked my doctor, "How much time do I have?"
He gave me about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not going to meet Christmas anymore.
That's it."
Mesothelioma is particularly dangerous, because it's the mechanics of how we support life - the act of breathing - that causes cancer that kills.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by contact with asbestos.
Asbest consists of tiny fibers.
When asbestos breaks down and the fibers breathe, they can lock in the pleural, light coating.
The asbestos fibers irritate the pleural and may cause cell mutations.
“The problem is due to the inhalation of nipple fibers of asbestos,” Professor Tom Treger, a cardiac surgeon who came to the Gai hospital in 2001.
That is the hospital, where, as Andrew Lawson suspected, he was affected by asbestos, now by the ironic fate of the mesothelioma treatment center.
The vigilante knew Louison and treated some others who were probably affected by his internment in the hospital.
When the asbestos needles fall into the fabric of the lighters, says Treger, "they are pushed into the periphery where the shell is.
It's, in fact, an invasive process from the very beginning.
The usual treatment options for other forms of cancer are much less effective in mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of surgery, for example, causes heated disputes.
Some think it's worth a try.
The alarm didn't agree.
"It's impossible to cut the pelvis," he says.
It's impossible to get around with a knife.
However, this cancer "is not very well treated" which "acts" but does not cure.
"Sometimes there are sick people who have lived a long time," says Treger.
But in the end, they're all dying.
Fortunately, some patients live a lot, much longer than expected.
Author Steven J. Gold died 20 years after his diagnosis.
Two and a half years after the diagnosis, Graham Abbott continues to fight.
After he was diagnosed with mesothelioma, Ebbotta was introduced to Andrew Lawson, who, four years after his diagnosis, became a single office of support and consultation for the same patients.
"Hello, Cracow Central," he was very unhappy when they called.
"He was very positive," says Abbott.
He was diagnosed four years ago, and he's still very energetic.
At first, Abbott offered six cycles of chemotherapy that would take four months and prolong his whole life for a month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lauson, however, "has dared to give everyone a slightly more positive look."
After meeting with several specialists, Abbott decided to continue treatment with Professor Loick Lange-Lazduński, professor of surgical surgery at Gaya Hospital.
"We had the advantage that I didn't need a direction, I just called them, and they accepted me," says Graham.
A mid-statistics patient would have to be targeted and approved for funding.
Money plays a crucial role for patients with mesothelioma to get the best of the available treatments.
However, when such treatment is ultimately ineffective, many sufferers face another financial cause for concern about the future of their families.
And then they go to the courts for compensation.
Andrew Lauson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It has been known that asbestos has been harmful to health since 1898," Morgan says.
But what changed in the 1960s was that it became clear that even very small quantities could be at risk.
That's when we talked about the company's mistrust.
Andrew Louson and Gai's hospital eventually settled the case, but it wasn't a full-value solution, according to Morgan, because Lauson was unable to prove clearly that his mesothelioma was the result of contact with asbestos in Gai's hospital.
After the investigation of his death, the representative of the Gai hospital nevertheless confirmed that “the asbestos in the double rooms mentioned was removed in the 1990s”.
It was too late for Andrew Lauson.
How to Remove Asbestos
In fact, linking death to asbestos with one company or place of work, usually decades later, has become a major problem for patients with mesothelioma requiring compensation.
Many of their former employers have changed the owner or closed.
Insurance archives could have been lost.
And those who are protected from charges know that there is no time for the complainants.
In response this year, serious new legislation has emerged that facilitates the mesothelimic process of obtaining compensation, even if it is not possible to track their former employers.
Under this law, a fund of £350 million was established financed by the insurance industry for those diagnosed after July 2012 and who could prove contact but who could not be tried.
In such cases, the sick will receive 80 per cent of the amount that the court could normally judge for compensation, approximately £120000.
Some 300 successful claims under this scheme are expected each year.
Andrew Morgan, like many people who work with mesothelioma, believes that £350 million is “a great deal of good work” for the insurance industry.
"This is a transaction written by insurers for insurers," he says, stating that the sum is the fourth amount that insurers would have to pay if there was no temporary interval and those with mesothelioma would have been able to track companies and file claims in the usual way.
Even Mike Penning, a former Minister of Labour and Pensions, admitted that the law was “implemented”.
However, both Penning and Morgan recognize that, while seven people die every day, rapid action was needed.
"People are suffering so much and need help today," Penning said during his second reading of Bill's mesothelioma last December.
At the time, Graham Abbott was in the hands of Professor Loika Lange-Lazduński for 19 months.
Following the initial consultations, Lange-Lazduński recommended surgical intervention that, unlike Tom Treger, he considered to be effective.
This was followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy, a tritherapy in which Lang Lazduński could benefit 40 per cent of the survivors over five years.
Abbott felt a sense of strength.
"This is, of course, one of the most important things," says Abbott.
You see this in patients all the time.
There's some kind of force that supports you.
When you give up, things can get worse very quickly.
Grem Ebbott is in operation in March 2012.
By the end of August, he had completed the last six cycles of chemotherapy.
The following scans did not show any signs of disease.
Then I was scanned in March [2014].
There was a couple of five [cancers] in my chest.
I just had to meet 50.
It's not a threat to life.
It's the end of life.
And again, Abbott went through six cycles of chemotherapy.
Now there's no sign of a leak.
However, the process was both physically and emotionally difficult.
You can think of practical things -- the finances when I die, for example, or what you need to show a woman how a timer works on a bowler.
When you get bad news, you become unhappy.
We need to look ahead.
Like Ellie's father, 16 years old, and Temzin, 14 years old, it's not always easy.
"It's hard for a parent," he says.
It's hard to understand what to say and how much to say.
When I was first diagnosed, I told the girls that I had a disease that means I'm not going to get old.
They reacted very differently.
Temzin is very common and energetic.
She told all her friends, and many called us very quickly.
Ellie was more arrested.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all sufferers of cancer have to deal with.
But for patients with mesothelioma, such discussions are not balanced by hope, even by a difficult chance of survival.
This disease brings with it (even as in the end, for Steven Jay Gulda) a dark certainty.
According to Andrew Morgan, “mesothelioma does not constitute a threat to life.

China refuses to grant Hong Kong the right to choose leaders; protestants swear revenge
The Chinese Parliament decided on Sunday not to allow Hong Kong voters to apply for the 2017 elections, despite the growing demands for democratic reform.
Such a move is likely to lead to long-standing protests in Hong Kong business district, as activists have begun planning and mobilizing in the hours considered after that statement.
The decision of the All-China People ' s Assembly, in fact, allows communist leaders to remove all candidates who are not loyal to Beijing.
"It has not fooled our expectations, but it still provokes anger," said lawmaker Emily Lau, president of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Beijing promised.
They fooled the people of Hong Kong.
And obviously we're dealing with the authoritarian regime.
Defending China's decision, Lee Fay, Under-Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the All-China People's Assembly, said that allowing the international movement of the Hong Kong leader to be elected would be too “hootic”.
Since 1997, when Britain passed control over Hong Kong back to China, Beijing had promised to allow the people of the region to vote on the Government ' s head since 2017.
The Chinese leaders presented the decision taken on Sunday as a democratic step forward, since it gives the Congolese right to direct vote; however, the decision also makes it clear that the Chinese leaders will continue to hold the process firmly in their hands with the assistance of the candidates' commission, which is strictly controlled from Beijing.
And according to the new article, only candidates who “love the country and love Hong Kong” will be allowed.
The decision was taken after the summer when one of the largest and most widely announced protests in Hong Kong took place in many years.
Much of the pro-democratic campaign in Hong Kong is underway by the Occupy Central With Love and Peace, the organizers of which threatened to cover Hong Kong's financial area if Beijing does not guarantee this universal electoral right.
On Friday evening, just hours after the statement, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered under rain before the Hong Kong Government headquarters.
At the demonstrations, the organizers stated that their movement was moving to a new stage of civil innocence and that they would rise to protests in the following weeks.
However, they did not report details, apparently trying to avoid problems with public authorities.
In an online statement, the organizers reported that the movement “considered the possibility of occupying the central area only as an exclusive measure, which can only be taken if all possibilities of dialogue are exhausted and there is no other choice.
We regret very much that, to this day, all possibilities for dialogue will be exhausted and the central area will definitely be seized.
Government authorities in Hong Kong prepared for Beijing's statement for a few days, and security measures were stepped up by police and barricades at Government headquarters on Sunday.
Many in Hong Kong feel that they are slowly losing control of their own city.
The mother's income increases competition in goods and services.
The fear is also reinforced that the values of Hong Kong, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are beginning to weaken under increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some criticise the Occupy Central movement, saying that its demonstrations are at risk of business - a source of life force in Hong Kong.
“The proposal they are talking about can lead to great economic damage depending on how long and how long people will participate,” said Regina Ip, who has been criticizing the movement for a long time.
We don't want Hong Kong to worry about being out of control.
It's an idea that's bad for investment.
The Chinese State media have also reported in recent days, where Hong Kong's democratic movement activists have been shown by the dissidents sent by the Western Powers.
This summer, activists organized an informal referendum on electoral law, involving 780,000 participants -- more than one fifth of Hong Kong ' s voters.
And in July, tens of thousands went to one of the largest pro-democratic demonstrations in the history of the region.
U.S. Ball culture is coming to university life: the first riders were invited to come on a personal plane
We are happy to respond to such a demand by starting the first UK luxury travel service for current students.
In order to leave a clear impression of coming to the university, the company also offers transport options such as a passenger plane, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stuart also said that the service was thinking about security.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who usually have to transport their stuff across the country into a dangerous overloaded car.
In conjunction with our new options for the VIF, we look forward to helping students reach the university this year with minimum effort and maximum excellence.
The company’s representative reported that, since the service had just started, the orders had not yet been made, but added that “students would begin to order this service within the next few weeks”.
The company also stated that despite the need for students to pay £9,000 a year, it still hopes to find a market for this service.
Students today are quite different from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago in terms of expectations and hopes: more important than ever, to make a great first impression, and the VIF is what it takes.
However, the National Student Union has criticised this service as being out of touch with reality.
Megan Dann, Vice-Chairman of the NSC for Higher Education, said: "This project seems to be incredibly excluded from the lives of most students.
Many students who are going to start college this month face a life-value crisis when available financial support in the form of loans and grants fails to meet the rapidly growing cost of basic needs before they can even start thinking about raising thousands of pounds on some kind of simple income in the community.
Feminists raise the question of racial belongliness and police behaviour after Ferguson
The unarmed adolescent was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, earlier this month.
The incoming ones raise their hands and say, "Hands up, don't shoot," while they're waiting for the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri related to the murder of the unarmed adolescent Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Peres observed an Internet conversation among white feminists.
According to her experience, the white feminists who left their comments put gender above race when it came to promoting reproductive rights and income inequality.
However, as tension in the Middle West increased and national attention was drawn, Pérez saw the responses of white women, which focused 100 per cent on racial affiliation.
Compared to the reaction of black women shortly after the murder of 9 August, personal essays with titles such as "the thoughts of Ferguson from the face of a white woman" and "Feminism is not only about the oppression of women" appeared relatively late.
But for Peres, they showed a significant move.
"In feminism, I don't think there are many people who talk about white skin and privileges at such a high level," she said.
People felt the need to say something about what happened.
This is very symbolic of the crisis that we have faced, and because (the Ferguson situation) is so attached to racial belonging, they felt that it must be pointed out.
For an English professor at the University of Ohio, Mitchell Ferguson found out that black Americans are faced every day, but are not regarded as women's problems in the cultural sphere.
"I can write something funny on Facebook about what's going on with me and my partner and getting 150 likes everywhere," Mitchell says.
When I write something about how colorful people are being attacked in their own country, silence silences.
"Why is it safe to speak to women in public about relations, but not about public security?" she asks.
For black women, such as Mitchell, who have studied race, gender and sexuality in the history of the United States, there is no dichotomy between racial and gender issues.
In her view, black women are in a position to clearly deal with these problems; they face a difficult reality every day.
While white women are now uniting racial and gender issues in the feminist mainstream, Angela Hetter, professor of female and gender research at George Mason University, says that their predecessors have done the opposite.
" Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lynched, and this almost always resulted in white women being raped," Hetter said.
A white woman was needed to confirm the story to justify lynching.
From the point of view of Hetter, the gap between white and black women occurred when white suffrageists, such as Susan B. Anthony, studied the situation in the late 1800s and saw that the struggle for election law would be effective only for one of the groups: women or black people.
"They decided to put all eggs in the box of women's right to vote, and the right to vote for blacks should have appeared later," Hetter said.
Looking back on such things gives us a clear picture of why colored women do not trust white women.
We didn't do anything good.
We never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women obtained voting rights in 1920, it took ten years for white women to join the Association of South Women against Linction Prevention.
This group appeared almost 40 years after black women first asked for help, Mitchell said.
In the view of Mitchell, the response of white feminists to the problems raised in Ferguson - the conduct of the police, racial discrimination - reflects the time when white feminists had to "run" the problems faced by black women in several generations.
"Indeed, it would be great if activists who have such [traditional] feminist ideology were as serious about the right to raise a child as they are about the right to contraception?" Mitchell asked.
The feminists of the second wave, who have made careers to fight for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives, are now beginning to understand what this means.
A prominent white feminist activist, Gloria Steine, two weeks after Michael Brown's murder, took advantage of Facebook and published a harsh article by the columnist Guardian Rebecca Carroll, who demanded that white Americans participate more in racist protests.
"I hope that women with a different but similar reason to understand the danger of the body - and the perspective of racial problems that are significantly different in public polls - will be in the head of change," Steine wrote.
While Stein is concerned about more cross-cutting feminism, which includes both raciality and gender, her comments on race in America have so far surprised some.
A researcher at the American Business Institute Christina Sommers, author of "Who stole feminism?" said She The People, that young men in the United States, especially colorful young people, "are much more vulnerable than their sisters", but the remarks by Stein on Ferguson contradict the criticism she had previously expressed.
Now we have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
However, when the White House recently launched a small program, "Watch My Brother," to help vulnerable black and Spanish-speaking youths, it followed an angry reaction from many feminists, including Gloria Stein.
The relationship of the police with the black community is not the only problem that moves forward on the mainstream of traditional feminism.
After the U.S. Border Service arrested some 63,000 minors without accompanying them on the south-west border this year, immigration reform came back to the surface, this time as a problem for women.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women in support of immigration reform, said that in order to address this issue as important to women, it was only necessary to share the stories of women immigrants.
"They speak for themselves," said Mercado.
When the vast majority of work visas are issued to [immigrant men], women who come with them are placed in a position that is vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories are a response from women's organizations," she said.
Ipswich house with pigs sold
The photo of the house displayed for sale in Saffolke was removed by real estate agents when it was shown that there was a large pig resting in the hotel.
For sale for £120000, a separate house with one bedroom is located on a private road in Ipswick.
The detailed description was distinguished by a photo of the guest house, where a pig with a head resting on the couch was depicted.
The Connells Real Estate Agency reported that the pig in the photograph was the homeowner's favorite.
"At the same time, the photograph was incorrectly located and has already been removed," the company's representative reported.
In a detailed description of the house, Connells described the former House of Meetings as “one single house with one bedroom”.
Although the Agency has removed the photograph from its website, it remains in advertising material.
The sale of the house caused interest in social networks where some asked whether the pig was sold together with the house.
Russian tennis player Maria Sharapova, in the fourth round of the U.S. Open, believes that she lacks stability.
According to the sportsman, she wants to finish the year and try to get to a new level, she is moving from New York to Vasili OSIPO.
How do you generally rate your results at the Big Helm tournament this year?
Of course, I'm glad you beat Rolan Garros.
As for the three other tournaments, I did not have enough stability, especially at the end of some matches.
Now, of course, I'm upset.
She couldn't even get to the fourth final.
What challenges do you face by the end of the season?
I have a huge motivation to move on to a new level after I've been beaten.
I have something to work on, and I'm going to do my best to finish the year.
The Asian tournament series is beginning in a couple of weeks.
A member of the Committee on Physical Culture, Sports and Youth Affairs, former peace champion Nikolai Valuev proposed that GTOs be awarded bonuses when entering the line.
He said that, in general, the rules would be the same as in Soviet times, that people would give up the rules on withdrawal, escape and other exercises.
For example, 12 Russian actors will begin to implement the GTO rules as from 1 September in their territory.
I also invited schoolchildren who offered GTOs to give bonuses when entering the line, said Valuev.
For example, they can be added a little bit to the EEG.
There are also proposals to provide additional output workers to enterprises that have been tested in sports.
In Harvey, South Wales, a new millionaire appeared after winning the lottery
A game in the Harvey lottery this month.
Looking for a new millionaire in the south-west of Pert, where one lucky man will take home nearly $1.1 million from the lottery game on Saturday night.
The newspaper kiosk in Harvey brings gold to the main prize for the second time in five years, last win was $1 million in November 2009.
However, a successful winner still needs to make a statement about himself.
The owner of Steve Forvard's bed said you won caused a rejuvenation in a small town south-west of Pert.
The whole city is talking about it, and it's all very excited.
We thought such a win could be a secret.
Eight Western Australian winners celebrated the win of the main prize last month, noting the completion of several successful weeks for state players.
Last week, Kenning Well's game was one of five million in August, after a huge $7.5 million win from Belmont just a few weeks before that.
The winning couple has been playing for 20 years and reported that winning has given them the opportunity to travel around the world and buy a new home.
A millionaire from Harvey brings the number of winners in Western Australia to 59 this year, with a total of $85 million.
Mineconomy wants to accelerate the growth of the mobile market
This week, Mineconomy will introduce to the Government an integrated plan for the development of clean transport in Russia, told the deputy director of the Ministry of Oleg Plujniks at the round table, which was held by the "Reports" at the Moscow Auto Salon", 2014.
The plan is under the direction of the Government, one of the main objectives of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
It is expected that the document will be adopted at the end of September - early October, says the Plučniks, the proposed measures relate to electric cars and hybrids - a plan for the development of vehicles in the gas fuel sector in Russia already exists.
The plan (a copy is available from the "Reports") is planned for 2014-2017.
The criteria for the assessment of electrical and hybrid transport should be developed and it should be decided how to encourage the use and production of environmentally sound vehicles.
The report to the Government, which will describe tax and customs measures to support electricity transport, will be prepared by December 2014; the credit and concession scheme will appear by April 2015; and proposals to reduce the price of cars, stimulate localization and build service infrastructure will be developed by October 2015.
In 2014-2015, changes are expected to be made to legislation to facilitate the construction of freight infrastructure (in parks, automotive stations, etc.).
In addition, federal officials intend to make proposals to the regional authorities during 2015 to encourage the use of clean transport - in the form of benefits for transport and parking, for example; and by February 2016 - and proposals to increase the purchases of such transport.
Finally, by October 2014, the Mineconomy will list indicators for assessing the activities of regional authorities, reflecting the effectiveness of support for the production of clean transport, the development of freight infrastructure.
The market for electric cars in Russia has just been established - around 100 electric cars have been sold throughout the country in 2013.
At the beginning of 2014, the import duty on electric cars was abolished, so sales are about 500 items, according to Chief Executive Director Mitsubishi Motors in Russia Andrei Pankov.
However, the five-fold growth does not make the electric cars quite noticeable: 2.78 million light and light commercial cars were sold in Russia in 2013.
While in Russia only Mitsubishi Motors is imported.
The start of import is being prepared for Renault - the company focuses primarily on corporate clients, says the Director of Strategic Planning and Partnerships of Renault in Russia, Nikola Remiz.
Most other electricity producers, however, took a positive position with regard to Russia.
The development of electric cars is also for Russian producers -- "GAZa, " , but the release is miserable.
For example, in January - July 2014, according to ASM Holding, AutoWAZ released 30 electric cars.
The low demand for electric cars, the director of AutoWAZa for the engineer Sergey Amanov, will not be able to take over this segment...
The development of the Russian electronics market, in addition to automobiles (the electronics sold in Russia, on average, two-way analogues with internal combustion engines) hinders the inefficiency of freight infrastructure (units), inspired by the Director of Autostate Sergey Celikov.
Because of the road and low rates of self-sustainment in the next 3-4 years, the Russian market will remain a narrow segment, predicted by editor-in-chief "Authorev" Mikhail Pohranski, Celikov agrees.
On the contrary, car manufacturers say that some models of electric cars are already close to normal value.
The Russian mobile market has good prospects, mainly to build confidence in consumers that "electromobility" is real; this will, in particular, contribute to the emergence of all new charging stations, stresses the president of the BMW Group in Russia Wolfgang Schlimme.
Such infrastructure projects are being carried out, for example, by the Rossetti company: several stations have been built in Moscow, and about 80 more will soon occur.
Negotiations on the construction of the pipeline are also being held with other regions.
According to the director of the "Rossetai" department, Vladimir Sofia, the company believes in the electronics market and is ready to build shops throughout the country, but there are also problems: a small number of electric cars in the country and a lack of a single standard for charging different brands.
In addition, Rossetti as a network company does not have the right to sell electricity, it is designed to do so with regard to charging for electric cars.
The Pankov considers the most effective measure of the Russian power plant to be the recovery of customs duties.
The zero rate will operate by the end of 2014, with the possibility of extending it, expanding the list.
The replacement of transport tax on the environment (the idea is discussed and applies to all machines) also supports the market, but not as sensitive as customs preferences, Pankov believes.
Transport tax in Russia is small, says Pankov, unlike Norway, where tax cuts have led to a sharp increase in the sale of electric cars - they now account for 12 per cent of the market.
In Russia, there is also a need for incentives for car owners, such as free parking in the city centre (as already done in Moscow), as Pankov is sure, or the possibility of moving electric cars to a designated field, which is not yet available in Russia.
A private plane broke down in Colorado
A single-engine Piper PA-46 crashed in Colorado, U.S.A.
Three of the five people in it have died, handed over ITAR-TASS.
The survivors were delivered to the hospital.
The accident took place several kilometres from the airport airport of Denver.
The causes of the tragedy are now being established.
In the Danube area, the Donbass battalions are held captive.
The riders were surrounded by the additional.
They were handed over by their own commanders, and dozens of rapists were shot.
Those who survived say that if they knew exactly what the situation was in southeastern Ukraine, they wouldn't go to war.
108 prisoners can be called happy.
The Donbass battalions remained alive after the "measuring" they came under the additional.
In the area of the army of the Donetsk People ' s Republic, the fighters spent several days, actually thrown away by their commanders and the authorities of Ukraine.
When it was reported from the headquarters that the ring could be pulled out on the claim provided by the corridor, the column moved.
But literally a couple of minutes from all sides, the rifles and the bullets hung.
"The judge told me about the information we were given, we had a corridor, we were allowed to leave, and he told us.
And when we went down to the bottom between Multipole and Rednoise, we started a cross-fire with anti-tank-controlled missiles, with sushek, grenades of 30 mm, automatic BMD rifles, small weapons.
Four cars were ahead of me and behind three, and only two were left.
An officer called Lermont tells us that at least 60 people were killed, tens were wounded, many died after that.
The survivors are now providing medical assistance to those they have come to kill.
The prisoners are now surprised that the so-called "terrorists" are treating them well, feeding them, medicines.
While their own commanders actually deceived them and put them to death.
We've been betrayed, they say.
The colony, the whole battalion, to destroy it.
In the Battle of Donbass, as did many of his companions, Alexei was a volunteer, for in Ukrainian news, they were talking about the beast that they claimed to have been doing in the south-east "separatists".
Alexey's already seen a completely different picture.
His mother was killed in Lugansk and no one but Ukrainian soldiers.
My friend called me, told me that there was a mini-major shooting, which is probably the Ukrainian armed forces, one of the soldiers, Alexei.
After that, I wanted to get out of the battalion.
We weren't released from Addisco, they said we were in the ring.
I've already agreed with the commander, and I've already written the report on care.
We were immediately taken to Addisk with Zurakhov.
According to the prisoners, there were 300-350 men in the "cat" under the "Additional".
Some survivors now admit that if it were possible to return time, they would not enter the penal battalion for anything.
All detainees were handed over to the DNR.
Everyone will be checked for involvement in war crimes.

Rosnefti Head Igor Sechin said that the company assessed the damage of the Lisian NPZ shooting in Ukraine at $140 million.
He reported that in an interview with Spiegel.
"We estimate the damage of $140 million and will negotiate with the Ukrainian Government for compensation," Sechin said.
According to him, the operation of the modernized company of the Lisian NPZ was planned in 2014.
However, part of the plant was destroyed by Ukrainian artillery.
"There were no fighting, there were no "refugees," but the Ukrainian artillery destroyed part of the industrial facility.
In addition, the technology oil is missing, stuck in the tube," he said.
Remember, on 18 July, the Lisian NPT fired a tank for oil storage and destroyed two warehouses.
The Lisian NPZ is the main oil processing plant in Ukraine, firstly the company was established in October 1976.
The total capacity of the Lisian NPZ is approximately 7 million tons of crude oil per year.
The plant is capable of issuing the Euro-4 fuel standard, as well as the Euro-5 fuel batch.
In March 2012, shipments of oil to the Lisian NPT were suspended due to its mortality.
The company decided to start repairing.
Rosneftt received the Lisian NPN, together with other Ukrainian TNC-WR assets, a year later.
The Canadians have launched a small-distance rocket towards the Japanese Sea.
According to South Korean media, this occurred about 10:30 a.m. on the local side of the province of Chaganda, which is on the border of North Korea and China.
As Interfax reported in the Joint Committee of South Korea Chiefs of Staff, the rocket was reportedly dropped into the Japanese Sea after it flew some 220 kilometres.
The ruble falls on the ground of geopolitical pressure
At the Moscow Stock Exchange, the dollar grew to 3 kop. up to 37,15 rubs, and the ruble dropped to a bio-curse in the background of geopolitical tension.
Exchanges at the USD were initiated by transactions within the borders of $37.11-37.2 on average for two minutes at a rate of $37.16 at a level of $1, which was 4 times higher than the previous closure.
The course was 48.79 roubles for 1 euro, which is 3 times higher than the previous closure level.
The price of the exchange basket increased by 3.5 copies and amounted to 42,395 rubles.
The United States dollar is traded for 23 times higher than the official rate, the euro for 16 times higher than the official rate.
The Russian market continued to decline rapidly on Friday, 29 August, but there was no panic this time.
He continued his savings and rubble and even updated the historical maxim to the dollar.
Now investors are already losing the deterioration of the geopolitical environment and possible new sanctions against Russia.
But so far it is more like an artificial excrement that is spread through the media, especially the Western.
The options for introducing new sanctions to the RF are not so much.
Teletrade “At the opening of the Moscow Stock Exchange, the rubble continues to weaken sharply against the exchange basket.
The geopolitical background remains a determining factor.
However, if we do not see a new negative in the near future, both the Russian indices and the positions of the national currency can be adjusted.
The Orenburg Air Force will be judged by the Ideal Tour
The Orenburg Air Force filed a claim for an overall amount of 4.7 billion rubles.
It is two cases that will take place in October.
The case will be examined by different judges.
According to Interfax, the first claim was filed on 14 August.
It's worth over 425 million rubles.
The meeting was scheduled for 7 October.
The second statement was made on 18 August.
It's an amount of 4.24 billion rubles.
The meeting was scheduled for 2 October.
As journalists in the Russian Union reported, judges in cases were appointed different.
In July, the media reported an amount of 1.5 billion rubles on the “Ideal Tour” debt to the “Orenburg Airlines”.
The airline manager, Victor Zukin, talks about the amount of 1.6 billion rubles.
Vitaly Savelev, Director of Aeroflot, calls it another two billion rubles.
Twitter has tried to become more interesting for new users
The Twitter microblog service has changed the user registration process to involve new players more quickly in active interaction with the platform.
This measure should reduce the number of people who have abandoned their microblogs.
New Twitter users will now watch a large number of recommended accounts during the registration process to form their readouts immediately.
The recommendations are based on the established interest registration.
Twitter automatically sets a sign for all automatically selected accounts.
Because of this, the user will have to manually take pictures of the holes so that he does not read those who are not interested.
If the users of the micro-blog service had seen only the avatars of the recommended users, Twitter now draws a sample of one of the popular blogger's tweets to help make an impression on the person.
This is the biggest change in Twitter's country of registration in the last three years.
Recently, Twitter has been active in modernizing the service.
This activity is primarily linked to the ongoing efforts of the service to achieve infinity.
In 2014, the microblog service experienced a slowdown in the growth of the user base and a fall in reader activity.
The company is now desperately in need of more loyal consumer resources, which would remain for a long time.
This is the only way to ensure a stable flow of advertising.
The Day of Knowledge in Moscow will be a Day of Famine and Rain
The first September in the Moscow region will be cool and rainy throughout the day, meteorologists report.
The air temperature in Moscow will range from 16 to 18 degrees, in Podmoskovy - 13-18 degrees.
In a cloud-cleared weather, rain will pass through the areas, and the wind in the east will be quite weak, just 3-8 meters per second.
The vehicle repair programme resumed on 1 September
As of 1 September, Russia has resumed its car-utilization programme.
By 31 December 2014, 10 billion rubles will be allocated for these purposes.
As explained by the head of the Minpromtor RF Denis Manturov, money is allocated from the limits that have already been brought to the Ministry of Industry and Trade by redistribution from other areas of support.
The programme covers all cars over the age of six years.
The compensation will amount to 40 thousand per passenger car up to 350 thousand rubles per truck.
In Russia, a similar vehicle-utilization programme had already been in place.
The main difference of the current project, the Minister explained, is that not only is the use of cars to obtain a subsequent discount, but also if the car is over six years old, it is possible to acquire a new one with a discount when the old one is delivered to the dealer, the interface.
More than 16 billion rubles were spent on the previous federal disposal programme, which ran from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2011.
Thanks to it, the level of production of light cars in 2010 amounted to about 1.2 million items (plus 101.4% compared to 2009).
The creator of the Coming Out Simulator will play a contemporary journalism game
Gamemaker Nikki Case, known for playing the Coming Out Simulator, decided to play a contemporary journalism game.
He told us about his project in the Kill Screen interview.
Case started working on the game a few weeks ago, but it's only now that we're familiar with this.
A source of inspiration for the game was the events in Ferguson, where protests began after the police killed an unarmed black girl.
The focus of the project, which has no title yet, will be on how information education affects its impact.
The hero, a civil journalist, will need to photograph what is happening in areas where there is a conflict between the police and the population.
Hero can take pictures of what's happening, which affects the course of events.
If he shoots a scene that the police will look like a hero and the protesting gang, the police will begin to treat him better and let him go where the ordinary man can't go.
If he's going to light things up otherwise, his photographs can turn peaceful protests into a massive rebellion.
The eyes in the game will have to be picked up with a hero's Twitter, where new signatories will appear, if the photos presented there will be popular.
The game has no name yet.
The date of departure and the platform on which it appears is unknown.
Case, however, published an image demonstrating how the event could change depending on how the photograph was taken and processed.
In an interview, Kill Screen Case explained that he had considered the concept of such a game a long time ago, but originally he wanted to dedicate it to the US rather than to the events in the Gaza Strip.
After he began to collect material for the game, the game designer realized that he did not have enough knowledge and skills to educate the history of the region.
However, when he saw the media light up the events in Ferguson, he decided to play the game on the basis of what had happened.
Nikki Case is an independent developer who publishes browser games.
The most famous project was the Coming Out Simulator, which was released in 2014.
This game, which describes the events in the biography of Case itself, focuses on how bisexual adolescents try to tell their homosexual parents about their relationship.
Geletei drags Ukraine into the course of the bloodshed
The call to prepare for the regular “ten thousand” victims of the Ukraine Minister of Defence Valerie Geletei involves the people in the continuation of the bloodshed, says the TIR FM.
“In Moscow, of course, attention has been drawn to the statements made by the head of the Ukrainian military department of Valeria Gelet, which stated that “the completion of an operation to free the East of Ukraine from terrorists” and the beginning of “the Great National War”, which will include “ten thousand”.
The degree of adequacy of the head of Ukraine's military department, published on its Facebook page, is the subject of a study of non-military professionals," says the Russian diplomats.
They find it hard to believe that such statements may belong to the Minister of Defence of a civilized State.
On its Facebook page, the Minister of Defence of Ukraine wrote on Monday: “For informal channels, the Russian side has already threatened several times that in the event of continued resistance, they are ready to use tactical nuclear weapons against us.”
In doing so, he stated that “the operation for the liberation of eastern Ukraine” had been completed.
Through Hilton removed all the intimate photos of the stars and apologized
Today, more than 60 Hollywood stars have been engulfed by terror.
Hackers hacked primitive passwords into iCloud (data store) in smartphones, and then their intimate photos appeared on the website of Perez Hilton.
True, not long ago.
Remember, Jennifer Lawrence, the star's official star, has already reported stealing photos from her cell phone, and confirmed that all the photos that are “shining” on the network are real.
Through Hilton, the founder of a unique tabloid site, he apologized to actress Jennifer Lawrence and her colleagues for publishing their open images, writes The Independent.
No, no one made me do that.
I didn't have any contact with their agents.
And now I'm going to remove the exposed photos of Jennifer Lawrence and Victoria Justis," wrote a blogger on Twitter.
However, all exposed photographs of the stars have already flown through the network.
David Beckham fell into the DTP hiding from the parachutist
David Beckham got into the DTP on a motorcycle, saving himself from the parachute.
This happened in Los Angeles on the turn of Boulevard Sanset.
The British footballer was separated by the error and disengagement of the right hand muscles.
Beckham left the living room where he was waited by the parishioners.
As soon as they were chasing them on the motorcycle, he failed to turn around and fall, writing TMZ with reference to the close to the source footballer.
As a result, Beckham had his right arm and his carapine muscles.
Tony Stuart's having an accident back on track.
Tony Stuart's return to the track ended a little bit more than in the middle of the Atlanta Motor Speedway race.
Stuart broke into the wall the second time his right front tire broke down at 172 rounds, ending his speech.
Stuart took his car to the garage and then walked away without talking to reporters.
His team leader, Chad Johnston, said that 14 members of the team were upset, but would now focus on the race in the next exits in Richmond, Virginia.
"I would like to have a better try and a better finish for him," said Johnston.
We'll go to Richmond and hopefully we'll get better there.
Stuart first cut into the wall earlier in the race the night after he met Kyle Bush, which required repair on his right-hand side of his car.
"I started today with a pretty good hope to get to the finish," said Johnston, adding, "Just didn't make it."
Shortly after the second accident, Stuart's car was loaded into the evacuater, and the team gathered and was ready to leave.
Stuart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car hit and killed another driver during the ground track race in the north of New York.
He decided to return this week, and he needed to win either in Atlanta or in the next race in Richmond to participate in the Persecution.
He returned to work during the investigation of a tragic incident, resulting in the death of 20-year-old Kevin Ward Younger, who went on the track to express his discontent to Stuart during the race.
The law enforcement authorities announced on Friday that the cause of the accident would continue for at least two more weeks.
The decision to file an indictment to Stuart was not taken.
The three-time champion was met with loud applause and applause when he was presented before the race.
Starting with 12th position, Stuart Shell in the first 10th at the start of the race, reaching fourth position.
Then it's 122 rounds after Bush's restaurant.
The 18-wheeler got off the tractor on the way out of turn 2 and broke into Stuart, pushed both of them into the wall.
Stuart went on, but he stayed up to 21st.
Soback and Vitorgan are eating cigarettes with Zwanecki in Odessa
Xenia Sobacka and Maxim Vitorgan are now in Odessa, which the TV conductor has not failed to report in its Instagram.
True, one photograph was very surprised and very upset with the couple’s worshipers.
A picture taken in Zwanecko.
"At the breakfast at Mikhail Mikhalych Zwanecko Maxim explains what such an instagram is:)) #odess," signed a photograph by Xenia Soback.
However, there is nothing on the table but cigarettes.
No coffee, no scotch, no butter, no...
The couple decided that Xusha was smoking too, and they condemned her for it.
"And cigarettes whose?" "Smoking kills!" "Cacoy is a cigarette morning," "I would like to have breakfast, but only cigarettes on the table)")," "Sonnies, are you smoking too?" -- wondered about her favorite subscribers of her blog.
Consider, for the first time in her life, how she enjoyed the delicious meal that Maxim Vitorgan made.
"Happy is that when thou comest to the banquet, and thy husband hath prepared a supper for thee (the first time for a wife's life, for what a sweet one is.The main thing is that now at the end of the supper did not say in the anecdotes, "that it was so now every day," she boasted to her husband, Xenia Sobbach.
The picture shows that Maxim is preparing something with a tantrum, and there's a sundial and a roast chicken already on the table.
Bulgarian prison officials conducted a national protest
Hundreds of prison officials from all over Bulgaria have taken national action against the Ministry of Justice in the capital of Sofia.
During the peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their demands to restore the former working conditions that had recently been changed.
The increase in wages is also included in the list of requirements that will be discussed with the temporary Acting Minister of Justice Christo Ivanov.
During the month, the officers expressed a symbolic protest against the new schedule of work, requiring the return of the previous 24-hour shifts.
Although the union of prison officials has repeatedly met with representatives of the Ministry of Justice, the agreement has not been reached, the Bulgarian National Radio (BNR) reports.
Negotiations continue, the head of the Chief Executive of the Administration reported on the execution of the sentences by Rosen Gelzkov.
Members of the Federation of Trade Unions of the Ministry of the Interior are expected to join the union of prison officials.
The army controls the new Government of Thailand
General Prawt (right) appointed Minister of Defence of the Right of Wongsuvan (left)
The military governor and Prime Minister of Thailand, General Prawt Chan-Ocha, announced the new cabinet of ministers of the country in which more than three posts were held by generals or generals in resignation.
The military received key positions: Ministers of Defence, Finance, Foreign Affairs and Trade.
On Monday, Praut Chan-Ocha was approved as Prime Minister following the official approval by the King of Thailand of the appointment of the head of the temporary military government to this post.
The 60-year-old military who took power in the country as a result of the bloodless coup on 22 May was the only candidate for the Prime Minister's post.
He was elected prime minister at the meeting of Parliament.
The army had previously appointed parliamentarians.
According to Prauta Chan-Och, conversion was the only way to maintain stability.
He had been preceded by the continuing half-years of demonstration during which protesters demanded resignations from the Government of Prime Minister Yinglak Chinawat.
Officially Praut Chan-Ocha will be the interim prime minister, as the military are planning to hold general elections at the end of 2015.
However, there are concerns that the military are trying to strengthen its power in the country.
Soldiers came to power on 22 May
on the background of the full paralysis of the civilian authority.
The leaders of the major political parties were arrested in a temporary manner.
Immediately after the military came to power, they were temporarily arrested by the country ' s leading politicians, including Prime Minister Yingluk Chinawat.
Some journalists and public figures were also detained.
The current political crisis is taking root in 2006, when the army has moved away from the post of Prime Minister Yingluk Chinawatt Taxiin.
Both of them enjoy the popularity of rural people, especially in the northern regions of the country, which has once again made them successful in the elections.
However, many representatives of the middle class and the capital elite have entered the anti-government movement, which has practically paralyzed the country since November 2013.
No one said that the middle room would be better, I didn't promise you, an officer from the new Palm brewery was getting away.
It has to be formally acknowledged that this is true, but the mind and stomach remain steadfast.
Because we've always known that we're saying "Belgium" -- we're saying "media," we're saying "media" -- we're saying "Belgium".
Restaurants like to say in depth that the success of the institution depends on three factors: location, location and again location.
There's places like this that aren't good enough, but even great, but something bad.
Shortly after sitting behind Palm's chair, I remembered that there was once a coffee "Golden" (in honor of the same television) and then "Odesa-mama" and another restaurant "Bhoole" and "Beautiful" beer.
Now it's beer again, but it's no longer nostalgic-Soviet, it's Belgian.
Only the top of the iceberg was located on the ground: a bar and a pair of chairs, all the rest of the space is not even a sunset.
That's why it's fun here, like in the children's room: red, yellow and green walls, colorful drawers, instead of windows, TVs where girls are swimming.
The Belgian institutions in Petersburg have long been out of the news, so there's something to compare.
Here are eight types of distilled beer (260-300 rubles per 0.5 l) and countless bottles (170-1550 rubles).
The company-positive officer is happy to present the menu, saying that “media are small seeds”, and it should be noted that, in spite of some shortcomings, this is the most positive side of Palm.
I am expected to be content, but often very unexpected.
Who, for example, is supposed to predict that the meat roulette with a Walloon Black (280 rubles) is actually a rock cut to the same extent that the parchment paper compares to it to material indistinguishably thick.
I can feel any taste, just if I'm gonna have a pultar.
It's worse with salads.
The classic lies (260) would best be recognized as a crime against the Belgian people: some sloppy iceberg, once opened a long time ago, a map, a dry Kenyan beans, the sloping chips from the bacon, plus a seagull.
You don't want to meet anyone like that!
The composition of the ingredients of the Belgian salad was partly different, but the impression was also not positive.
If you could still close your eyes to the unsuspecting quarter of tomatoes or reddished champs, why would the media seem to have been able to freeze and open them several times for their lives!
I already know that there are normal white sharks here!
They are delivered in bowls "in sauce for your choice" (490-560 rubles per 0.5 kg).
Half a thousand soybeans, white wine, celery and carrots, have not been explicitly given.
There are fruits, and there is no aroma, whether there is wine or not, it remains a mystery.
That's why it's good to be in the middle of fries with the house mayonnaise.
Curtain water is not a cake so thick that depending on your mood, you can decide the first or the second dish before you, but just a pleasant slurry.
It was claimed that the rabbit prepared a local dough in a beer sauce, and nothing was said about rosmarin.
The situation in question was dimensionally counterproductive: the zomarine has blinded everything.
It seemed that this rabbit had been fed exclusively by rosemary bites, from which meat had acquired so much unusual aroma.
But at the same time, the rabbit was attached to the leg - no, it was just a scratch in a caramelized short.
Waffles in Palm offer not only sweets but also sweets with beef, chicken or bacon and cheese (220-280).
The clay sauce turned out to be too watertight, and the waffles were dry.
But the manager who came to the table was very informally interested in lunchtime impressions.
So you have to come back.
The course of the dollar rose to over 37 rubles on news of new sanctions against Russia in the West.
It's a new historical record.
The dollar 'tomorrow' by 10:29 msk rose by 26.9 copies and was 37.02 rubles, the euro rate rose by 30 copies - up to 48.73 rubles, the Moscow Stock Exchange shows.
The ex-currency basket was increased by 28 copies to the previous closure level and stood at 42.28 rubles.
Before the Crimean Events, the dollar reached a maximum on 19 February 2009, at which time it was 36.43 rubles, and on 3 March 2014, it was already 37.005 rubles.
On the night of 29 August, the White House reported that US President Barack Obama and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany were discussing the possibility of introducing additional sanctions against Russia.
Weaknesses are long-term and in pairs with the euro and in pairs with the dollar.
The long-term forecast meant this mark, says senior analyst Alpari, Anna Bodrov.
Everything related to Ukraine will be reflected in courses anyway.
As long as this continues, investors will respond.
Today, reports of the invasion of armies have not been confirmed on either side, but the market has become very emotional.
All the discussions that he had held on to such news yesterday were overwritten.
According to the expert, there will be about 36,90 and 37,05 rubles per dollar per week.
The tax period was over, oil prices were weak, policies, sanctions, gas transit through Ukraine -- all of this was a single chain.
The inflation gap is also projected: current prices will be added from 5 to 10 per cent in the autumn.
In addition, seasonal fruits and vegetables will soon end, and some vacuum will occur until networks are redirected to other suppliers.
"The dollar came to a mark in 37 rubles, passed it and returned, there was no strong exodus," said the head of the market analysis department, "Opening Broker" Constantin Bushuev.
They will still see if they will introduce the promised sanctions on Saturday, as NATO will meet.
In his view, the ruble was severely weakened after the tax season ended, then news was sent to Ukraine, and last week, the CB said that it was moving to a floating course by the end of the year and refusing any exchange intervention.
If you look at day-to-day fluctuations, it was nothing different from the previous one during this month, everyone was afraid to note in 37 rubles, the analyst continues.
And yes, nothing powerful has happened.
The alarming times for the currency market were, recall, when demand for the currency was raised at the end of January, as well as the third of March, when the CB released a record of the currency.
The UFS IC also sees the positive side of the bending.
First of all, this is an increase in the budget's income from export operations, as well as an increase in the competitiveness of domestic producers due to the loss of imports, chief analyst UFS IC Alexei Kozlov says.
The travel of imported goods and services can be at a negative point.
The sharp fluctuations in the Russian currency have significantly reduced the attractiveness of investment in the Russian economy, caused inflationary pressure to rise and, as a result, have become the cause of money-laundering, which, in turn, will slow the development of the country's economy.
As far as the stock market is concerned, there is a slight reduction in the price of the shares expressed in the rations.
For example, the IMF index fell by 1.67 per cent during the quarter and the RTS index lost 3.27 per cent.
Such a significant difference in the relative rate of index decrease is due to a decrease in rubella over the day over more than 1.5 per cent.
Weaknesses are emotional and are due to a massive desire to buy a currency.
As the practice shows, emotions are gradually gone, and rubble quotations are partially or completely restored.
"We believe we will soon be able to see the ratio of the dollar and the Russian currency close to the level of 36 rubles per dollar," notes Alexei Koslov.
Genetic disorder is often incorrectly diagnosed
Britain reported that it had spent many years thinking that it would die after an incorrect diagnosis.
Karen Rogers spent most of her teenage years thinking that she had lived for a few years after she was diagnosed with another disease.
In fact, she had a Sharko-Mari-Tuta disease (SMT) - a group of hereditary disorders that caused nerve damage outside her brain and spinal cord.
The charitable organization CMT UK reported that misdiagnosis was a common problem among people with CMTs, as it was so little known.
There are approximately 23,000 people in the United Kingdom who are likely to suffer from motor symptoms, such as muscle weakness, unaccompanied walking, and fingernails.
Patients may experience nausea or pain, and the condition is not healed and progresses, which means that symptoms are increasing over time.
When Rogers was 13, she thought she was suffering from the attacks of Friedrich (AF) - a condition for which the prediction was very bad.
Rogers thought she'd be attached to a wheelchair by the time she was 18, and she'd die before she was 30.
The mother of two children, now 51, said, "I knew that I couldn't do what others could.
I fell down every day, and I spent more time with everything.
I could never get into roles or skateboards with other kids, and I had to play a lot at school because of how I walked and ran.
Rogers said that when she was 13, after several operations, to release her wingslids and straighten her feet, she looked into a medical map when her doctor left the room, and it was written there that she had an AF.
"I felt guilty because I had a nose that wasn't right, and that's why I didn't tell anyone, but I went home, found information about this situation in the library and wrote to the AF Association," she said.
When I received the information in response, I was shocked and tried the most terrible panic possible.
I thought I'd be in a wheelchair in 18 and die before I'm 25 and I'll gradually lose all my abilities in the meantime.
I went through it alone, and I planned my own funerals.
She said that by the time she was 17, she realized that her ability to walk had not deteriorated as much as she thought and asked her doctor about it.
He just got up and hugged me and said, "My dear, I don't think you have this disease because you'd already been in the wheelchair."
I think you have something that poses a much smaller threat to life.
After several genetic studies, she found SMT.
"When he explained that it was a SMT, I thought I had pulled out a happy ticket," she said.
The charitable organization of the United Kingdom of Great Britain announced a month of information about the SMT in order to try to draw attention to this disease.
The tax burden on businesses in the Washington area is increasing as the economy recovers
The recovery economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
This also means higher taxes.
The state and local tax accounts for companies across the country have increased moderately last year when economic recovery has accelerated, according to a new study published last week, and companies in the Washington area are no exception.
Companies in the district, Maryland and Virginia paid $27.6 billion in the state penalty and at the local level in the financial year 2013, by 3.8 per cent more than $26.6 billion in 2012.
The tax burden on state and local business increased by 4.3 per cent last year, up to $671 billion, compared to 3.9 per cent a year earlier, and this was the third year of growth after the next few years, when the accounts decreased in 2009 and 2010.
The taxes received by the State increased faster, 4.3 per cent than local taxes, 3.9 per cent, according to a study conducted by the professional service company Ernst & Young and the State Tax Centre, the Tax Policy Group.
More than half of the county's tax income, 56 per cent, is taxed on entrepreneurs, while 36 per cent of Maryland's tax income is taxed on firms.
Virginia, with 28 per cent, contributes the lowest tax income, proportionally, from entrepreneurs.
To a large extent, the increase in tax revenues was due to the continued value of the company ' s real estate, according to researchers, which raised real estate taxes by 3.7 per cent this year after three consecutive years when the increase was less than 1 per cent.
While the vast majority of these revenues come from large states, such as California, New York and Texas, the same seems to happen in the Washington area.
Companies in the district, Maryland and Virginia jointly paid $10 billion of real estate taxes at the state and local level last year, at $9.6 billion more than in 2012 -- an increase of 4.2 per cent compared to the previous year.
However, the observed return on real estate has no similar effect on state and local income growth in Maryland, where real estate taxes are barely more than one fifth of the company ' s tax accounts.
The companies in Virginia and the District of Colombia pay about half of the tax accounts per state and at the local level in the form of real estate taxes.
"What is happening in Maryland is that such a large part of their real estate, especially the tax base around the District of Colombia, belongs either to the Government or to a non-commercial organization that does not pay real estate taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, Executive Director of the State Tax Centre.
Thus, Maryland has to rely much more on income taxes, for example, to pay the same services that are in other states.
The recent growth in corporate tax revenues cannot be fully explained by the restoration of the real estate market.
Entrepreneur's income also appears to be being amended according to this data.
Companies in the region have declared corporate income tax at the state level of $2.3 billion, for $2.1 billion more than in 2012.
Maryland collected $1 billion of corporate income from income tax, mostly in the region.
While trends are in one direction, corporate tax at the local level is not increasing at the same rate in all three locations.
The growth rate in the District of Colombia was at the same level as the average country, 4.3 per cent, while growth in Maryland was significantly faster, 4.9 per cent.
In Virginia alone, tax revenues were raised below the average of 4.1 per cent.
In Virginia, the lowest corporate income tax of three jurisdictions (each of which had an equal corporate rate) was 6 per cent.
In Maryland, the corporate rate is 8.25 per cent, while in the county it is relatively high at 9.975 per cent.
A similar study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year showed that in Virginia the taxes for state and local entrepreneurs were below and generally more favourable to the tax for entrepreneurs than in Maryland.
The district was not evaluated in this study.
Despite its advantages, Virginia is experiencing competitive pressure from its southern neighbours.
North Carolina had recently signed a legislative act that reduced the corporate rate this year from 6.9 per cent to 6 per cent, as in Virginia, and the rate would fall to 5 per cent next year.
If the state continues to achieve tax income targets next year, this law could lead to a rate of income tax for entrepreneurs up to 3 per cent by 2017.
Meanwhile, a small business in the Washington area seems to feel better and thus pays more taxes at the state and at the local level, according to a recent study.
Taxes on entrepreneurs paid as an individual income tax by small business owners are a transitional structure for which the majority of small firms in the District of Colombia, Maryland and Virginia have grown by 20 per cent last year to $2.4 billion, with a much higher rate of growth than taxes on entrepreneurs as a whole.
Researchers say that the trend and increase in income from business tax across the country are likely to remain this year, with income from traffic tax in the state and at the local level increased by 6.2 per cent for the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period last year.
However, the Washington area may be left behind, as the decrease in federal expenditures affects the labour market in the region.
The Bronze Age of Russian Jew
The domestic champion of the Jewish world brought two silver and seven bronze awards to Russia.
To this end, the Russians have given up only the main favorite of the competitions of Japan.
The tournament in Chelabinska started on Monday, and the first day brought a silver medal to the Russian team.
Its owner was Beslan Mudranov, who played up to 60 kg.
In an equal final fight against Baldbaatar Ganbat from Mongolia, however, the outcome of the resistance was only one comment received by the Russian.
And this is the second day the tournament was the most successful for Russia's assembly - three medals were immediately won on Tuesday.
In men's competitions of up to 66 kg of silver, Michael Pulaev was achieved, and the bronze was Kamal Han-Magomedev.
In the final round, the Russians won the 2011 and 2013 World Cup for the Japanese Massa Ebinume.
Han Magomedov, at the fourth final stage of the winner, won a comforting tournament and became the winner of the bronze award.
In the women's tournament of up to 52 kg, also to the third stage, the pedestal reached Natalia Kuzuitina.
In the semifinal, she lost the current Milane Kelmandi World Championship from Kosovo, which was under the flag of the International Federation of Jews and successfully protected the title.
In the dispute over the Bronze Kuzutina won Ma Ianan from China, but after the tournament ended, it was recognized that the third place was not exactly what she had expected.
And once again, the Russians were on their way to gold, Kelmandi, who won Kusutina earlier at the European Championship.
On the third day, Musa Mogushkov, who was fighting in the 73 kg category, placed in a collection of Russian bronze tournaments.
In the fourth final, he became the former representative of Moldova, Victor Skvortzov, now a spokesperson for the OAU team.
However, then the Russian won two awards and became the winner of the prize.
Moguškov was at the home championship with a golenostage trauma he was planning to heal in the near future, so he would take a break in the competitions.
As for the ex-Moldovain Skvorzov, he and he got to the bronze medal at the tournament.
Interestingly, Ivan Remarenko and his fellow member of the OAU took up the sport nationality, and he graduated from the Bronze category up to 100 kg.
The fourth day of CM-2014 also brought the Russians one bronze, which was won by Ivan Nifontov in the category up to 81 kg.
In a difficult battle, he won the Frenchman Alan Schmitt by commenting.
On Friday, three sets of awards were immediately played, but Russians were traditionally limited to one bronze in a male tournament up to 90 kg.
Its owner was Kirill Prostov, and the Russian Consul was guaranteed this medal: his rival was Kirill Denisov.
However, the very notion was not made: the opponent of Questionova was unable to get out of his dad ' s trauma.
The male bronze was conquered by the masters and on the sixth day of the competition, it was placed in a collection by Renat Sayidov, who was more than 100 kg.
In the comforting finale, he won a clean victory over the Brazilian David Moore.
Thus the individual part of the world championship ended.
On the last day of the tournament in Chelabinsk, on Friday, the names of the world's champions were played in the team competitions.
Both Russian collectors - both male and female - were one of the main candidates for awards, but, as in individual competitions, the representatives of the beautiful sex did not get lucky - until they reached the medal.
And there were Russian Jews who won the command silver.
In the face of the decisive opposition, they have joined the main rivals of the Japanese team in the struggle against the 2-3 account.
Meanwhile, the Russian assembly ruled 2-0 after Han Magomedov's pure victory and the volleyball of Dennis Yarzev (up to 73 kg).
However, in the heavier weight categories with their Japanese rivals, Murat Habajirov (81), Magomed Magomedov (90) and Aslan Kambiev (100) were unable to cope.
In the same scenario, a bronze match developed in a women's tournament, where the Russian assembly, led by 2-0, joined the Japanese - 2-3.
At the team meetings in Chelabinska, Russian President Vladimir Putin was present, who, after the tournament, congratulated the male assembly with the silver.
"The second place is very respectable, but I want to say that it was obvious that you could become champions," said Putin, whose word is the RIA "News."
To play Japanese, Jewish cousins, there's nothing ominous about it.
But I'm sure you can win them.
Russia's assembly at the world's home championship was much better than last year at the similar level held in Rio de Janeiro.
At that time, there were only three medals in the Russian team, one silver and two bronzes.
The current tournament was missed by the Olympic champions Arsen Galstian and Mansur Isaiah.
We're all, of course, great maximumists.
Yeah, I want gold medals.
But let's remember that if a man in the Olympic cycle is in the eighth most powerful, he's the potential winner of the Olympics.
More like a sport like a Jew," said the Minister of Sport Vitalie Mutko, whose speech is the champion's press service.
The Assembly of Japan was expected to be the best in Chelsea, winning 11 medals of various dignity, five of which turned out to be gold.
The next World Championship will be held next summer in Astana.
Other materials, news and statistics can be found on the summer sports page.
Joan Rivers hopes for the best.
Joan Riverz is unconscious of coming to New York three days ago, but her daughter expressed the hope today that a 81-year-old comedy actress would recover from the illness.
"Thank you for your constant love and support," said Melissa Rivers in a statement today.
We hope for the best.
Her mother arrived at Mount Sinai hospital on Thursday after an emergency call that she had had a heart attack at a clinic in the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscope, reporting sources.
Doctors will deliberately keep her under drugs and under strict supervision until they are satisfied with her condition that remains “hard”.
The response was widespread, including numerous Internet support from such things as Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Rip.
All the Kings Can
For sale, the debut album of the Royal Blood Group is a new hope for the British Year, which brought the rock duet out of the clubs directly to the stadium.
The Royal Blood duet is on the stage all year long, but already has an active nomination for the BBC music prize, an Arctic Monkeys heat tour and a visit to a New York concert by Jimmy Paige himself.
Their debut album was awarded 100,000 pre-releases a few months before the release, and the contract for its release is in the Major Label Warner Music portfolio.
Taking into account the current crying situation in the music market, the situation from a number of vans is not about the new Lane Del Ray or the regular sweet-sweet representative of the new R'n'B, but about the duet of British people playing at the level of thunder and intensity, which was last in fashion a few decades ago.
Overall, rates on the first album in relation to all the above circumstances were particularly high and had already been fully justified.
The duet has not seen himself taking a name that could have reached the world before that the desperate metallists had already died, and the blood of which kings seems to them to have in their homes, too, is understandable.
It is, of course, primarily about the heroes of the past level of Led Zeppelin: like a large neighborhood, Royal Blood is aimed at tightening the standing blood of the British year, bringing it to a new height.
To make predictions about the company's success so far, please, it's been hurt, but something can be said.
A decade of songs that have been put into thirty minutes is not so much a demonstration of a phenomenal composer ' s gift as a convincing and powerful statement of intentions.
Some of the virtues of individual numbers, of course, can't be denied: let's say that the "Out Of The Black" single is characterized not by a melodic line, but by a drumming party.
The musicians in jokes say that this song is just a little bit easier than a drink.
The powerful Little Monster and the closing of the Better Strangers album with a Shakespeareic quote in the title is also to be awarded.
However, the truth is that each of these songs will sound great at the party of heavy-year lovers, but when played in a row, they are merged into a more or less uniform canvas.
And that's not necessarily bad, even on the contrary.
The Royal Blood force is that they do not claim new Lennon and McCartney's labs (they're already in Motörhead's inheritances), but they've pulled out a lot of rock duets from the Indian club ghetto.
Their music, despite some diversity, was created for stadiums, in a room of less than a thousand people, apparently close to them.
Part of the secret is the clever use of the bass, which replaced the guitar in the usual format, which was thought to be at the beginning of the zero The White Stripes.
However, the case is not only in the instruments but also in the very approach to the composition of songs.
The returnees of zeros were very hard chosen beyond post-modernist paradigms and were very reluctant to recognize themselves not just as epics but as independent creative units.
Royal Blood now sounds so powerful and sudden that this effort is successfully draining some secondaryity and strength of the musical material.
After all, who said rock should be smart?
Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed what information he reported on Friday morning: Online store - and video producer, and a hundred other things - buys the Twitch stream video production service for $1.04 billion ($US970 million).
This news turned out to be a surprise, not because no one expected that Twitch would be sold, but because many expected that YouTube would be a buyer.
Three months ago selling Google's Twitch video service for a good billion looked completely ready, and such a combination seemed natural.
Twitch, founded just three years ago as Justin.tv, set the goal of being a streaming service of a general nature -- a real-time YouTube version.
Instead, he quickly became a platform where gamers broadcast their internal moments; "YouTube for real time," says Business Insider.
Interface Twitch.
And let's play, a genre of videomakers who know how to give (mainly, old) games like the Secret Theatre, are already popular on YouTube.
The fact that YouTube is often mentioned when Twitch is described, so the news that YouTube acquires Twitch was met without special interest, the classic example of a leading technology company that buys a potential competitor.
It's a secret why the YouTube deal failed, given that, according to the information, he was willing to pay no less than Amazon.
All we have right now is this statement from the executive director of Twitch Emmett Shire: "We have chosen Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term goals, and they want to help us achieve them faster."
Another secret, frankly, is the incredible success of Twitch.
The snobs like me, who say they'll do better in sports than to watch it, find it hard to understand the appeal of watching games instead of taking the jostics themselves.
One thing is looking through the shoulder of a friend at 3:00 a.m. when she walks through Resident Evil, and another thing is looking at how a foreign person gets 20 shots in the head in the Call of Duty.
All the games you could watch right now.
Another problem is that many of today's most popular games are counted on one person, so to look at their collection without controlling the angle of view independently may be a prescription of the main pain that is worthy of Do It Right.
I agree that the speedy walks where Rogers Bennisters of our electronic age complete all the games in record time are entertaining.
But if this isn't about playing virtuoso or humor, it's unlikely that his Twitch channel will be interesting at all.
But what do skeptics know about me?
Twitch has 55 million unique visitors per month, the fourth of which is the source of peak internet traffic.
How does Amazon work for that?
It's hard to imagine that Twitch will turn to Amazon Instant Video as clear as YouTube could just swallow the Twitch.
However, Twitch has what any company would be pleased to get: a crowd of young men who are dreaming of advertising.
As head Twitch Shir said, Amazon and Twitch "both believe in the future game", and this channel does not give signs of confidence, even - ay - as a mature sport.
As a result of the 2004 attack, more than 330 people, including 186 children, were killed.
More than 800 people were injured.
We spent a few days in Beslan.
They spoke to survivors -- almost all of them now -- students, with the parents of the deceased, with the audience of the capital city of Angelov - Ramon Kaspolatov, head of the Beslan Mother's Committee of Susan Dudiev, who participated in the special operation of the PMS -- told the correspondent of the Society of Elizabeth Antonov, who was working on the special project.
As soon as he returned to Moscow, he met with Aslambek Aslahanov, who 10 years ago was the President's adviser to the North Caucasus and was negotiating with terrorists, as well as with the government officer "B" of the Russian Federation, Wiacheslav Bocharov.
What particularly impressed me during my work on this subject is that there was no such thing as these ten years in Beslan.
This subject is extremely painful for all who have something to do with it, and people are hard to agree to talk about what happened.
The impressions of a trip are very difficult.
But you can't forget Beslan, and I hope we did our job," Antonov said.
A special project has been prepared by Rambler & Co, who has been working in companies since spring this year.
The previous projects were devoted to the First World War and to the 15th anniversary of Vladimir Putin ' s stay in power.
The CDR launched a small-range rocket
North Korea launched a small-distance rocket in the Japanese Sea, reports Renhap.
Approximately 10.30 a.m. was launched at local time by the province of Chaganda, on the border of North Korea and China.
It was assumed that the rocket had crashed into the Japanese Sea, some 220 km in the spring, said in the Joint Committee of the Chiefs of South Korea.
Members have proposed to accelerate the entry into force of the Personal Data Act
If the initiative succeeds, Russian data will not be stored on servers abroad since 1 January 2015
A draft law was introduced in Gosdom, which provides for the transfer of the date of entry into force of the Russian Personal Data Act from 1 September 2016 to 1 January 2015.
The initiative is based on the legislative activities of the lower court.
Its authors were Mr. Wadim Dengin, Mr. Yaroslav Nilov (LDPR), Mr. Evgeny Fedorov ("One Russia"), Mr. Vladimir Parahin ("Just Russia") and Mr. Alexander Yušchenko (KPRF).
This change, in the view of the sponsors of the initiative, will contribute to the more expeditious and effective exercise of the rights of citizens of the RF to the preservation of personal data and to the confidentiality of correspondence on information and telecommunications networks.
The Act, which is quickly enforced by parliamentarians, requires that the personal data of Russians processed via the Internet be stored in the territory of RF.
It also makes mandatory records, systematization, storage, storage, clarification and extraction of personal data from RF citizens in databases located in the Russian territory, as well as information on the location of such databases.
In addition, the law grants Roskomnaszor the right to restrict access to information processed in violation of RF personal data law by a court decision.
The Act also proposes the establishment of so-called “black lists” of offender sites - the automated information system “Register of personal data subjects’ rights”.
This law was adopted by the Gosmund in summer.
The authors of the bill were Andrei Lugovova and Wadim Dengin from LDPR and Alexander Yušchenko from CRC.
Dingin and Yušchenko are also sponsors of the current bill on the date of entry into force of the law.
Those who do not have RF dates will have to pay for the rent
Commenting on the draft law of the first mystery of the Committee on Information Policy, Leonid Levin said that he did not see any problem in transferring the date of entry into force of the Personal Data Protection Act.
He said that those companies that would not have their own Russian personal data storage sites in the territory of the FF by 1 January 2015 would be able to rent them, for example, “Rostelekoma”, who had repeatedly said that they were ready to provide their servers for rent and are already providing their servers, to Mail Group, to Western companies that are already providing their servers today.”
"That's why there are several independent data centres ready to cooperate in this area," he added.
"If companies decide to enforce the law and continue to work in the territory of the RF, I don't see any problems - they will get technological opportunities for placement," said Levin.
Dispute Bill
Immediately after the bill was published, the Russian Association of Electronic Communications feared that if the draft law was adopted, Russians would no longer be able to use many global Internet services.
In particular, it is the online services of aircraft and hotels.
According to the association, “the bill excludes personal data subjects - citizens of the Russian Federation from the right to have their own data necessarily by determining that their record, systematization, etc. should be provided only in databases located in the territory of the Russian Federation.”
The RAEC statement emphasizes that a more effective measure would be the establishment of a user information mechanism for the recording of personal data.
In such a case, you will be able to choose which territory these actions will take.
The adoption of such personal data “localization” legislation in other countries has resulted in the care of global services and substantial economic losses.
The ice water tester pulled out the jaw
Isabel Roberts, from Britain, screamed so much when her head was poured out with ice water that it damaged the bone structure of her face.
This test of ice water didn't work.
The woman was hospitalized after she screamed so much during the test of ice water that the jaw burst.
Isabelle Roberts screamed so furiously when her head was poured out with ice water that it damaged her face.
"The water was so cold that I yelled, but when I did it, my jaw began to cry," she said The Mirror.
Water's flying for 20 years.

The militia transferred more than 400 prisoners to the Ukrainian military
In the army of Novorossia, they claim that the Ukrainian Su-27 have been defeated, and accuse the opponent of violating the ceasefire agreement
As at 10:00 a.m. on 1 September, the militia handed over 402 prisoners to Ukraine, 72 of whom were wounded and 35 dead soldiers.
This was reported to the press representative of the Forces of Novorossia.
He added that “the force of the WFP in the area of the village of Mereska will blow up the Su-27 aircraft that violates the ceasefire agreement”.
According to the interviewer of the agency, the Ukrainian side of the Lugansk Airport artillery fired cluster munitions prohibited by international conventions.
The representative of the press noted that policemen had been able to damage two Ukrainian WFP helicopters per night at one of the field airports, as well as destroy two bronze carriers and two ammunition warehouses.
"The loss of the enemy alive -- up to a hundred people killed and wounded -- 13 people were taken into custody," said the chief's representative.
The interface has no confirmation of this information from Ukrainian sources.
On Sunday, the armed formation of the “national republics” of Donbass declared the transfer of the Ukrainian side within the framework of the ceasefire regime of 223 prisoners of war and soldiers of the Ukrainian National Guard.
At the same time, on the night of the DND Army, according to the Novorossia Army, “it has prevented the efforts of the Nazis in violation of earlier agreements to remove heavy technology from the area of the environment”.
At that time, the militia reported the destruction of two tanks and two BMPs, the capture of six tanks and the disarmament of 198 military personnel.
According to the staff, the total enemy's losses in all directions (Doneck, Lugansk, Mariupolski) were five tanks, eight armored vehicles, more than 120 killed and wounded that night.
At the end of last week, a large group of Ukrainian soldiers appeared in the area of militias in the Addis Ababa area.
Russian President Vladimir Putin asked the leadership of the “national republics” to release Ukrainian soldiers from the area.
The DNR agreed to do so subject to the surrender of weapons and ammunition by the opponent.
The first tens of military personnel began to leave the surrounding human settlements on Saturday morning.
According to the commander of the Ukrainian territorial defence battalion Donbass Semen Semenchenko, 14 more people left the catalyse on Sunday.
In his Facebook, Semenčenko wrote that Ukrainian wounded were “in custody at 137 p.m. 32 RF divisions and 9 RF tanks” where they were well addressed.
Meanwhile, the IMI and the Russian Mino-Defence denied reports of Ukrainian military and NATO presence of Russian units in Ukraine.
MID RF: Russia will respond to new EU sanctions
Russia reserves the right to take response measures aimed at protecting its legitimate interests in the event of new anti-Russian sanctions, reports the IDF.
The Russian Foreign Office ' s communication states that the European Council ' s conclusions of 30 August have demonstrated the inability of EU member countries to overcome the insidious support of their Kiev authorities.
Brussels continues to insist that Russia is involved in the situation in eastern Ukraine, based on “absolutely unproven allegations of the presence of Russian armed forces in the territory of the country”, the website of the department says.
IDF regrets that, contrary to the interests of its Member States, Eurosovet is being influenced by countries that are interested in increasing confrontation with Russia.
Members of the European Council should call for a peaceful settlement of the conflict in eastern Ukraine, as well as for the conditions for a full “dialogue between the opposing parties”, the Bureau stressed.
It is also noted on the website that there are no objective assessments of the humanitarian situation in Donbass, where a full-scale humanitarian disaster has taken place and the number of victims of the peace population is growing.
Let us remember that during the next seven years in the European Union it is planned to develop specific proposals for sanctions against the FP.
In doing so, EU representatives work closely with US officials.
They are expected to correlate the measures introduced during the period of action and severity.
The new sanctions of the Euro Union may relate to energy and the financial sector.
The Australian Government also announced an increase in sanctions against Russia in the field of defence, finance and oil industry.
Smart ways to save on university textbooks
While the value of university textbooks for many students exceeds $1,100 a year, Matt Schroeder, who will soon move to second grade, thought of a clever way to reduce costs.
He developed a system of taking books to seniors, offering them nominal compensation for delaying their sale.
"My math textbook, which usually costs $180, got me at a $10 semester and Chick-fil-A roast," says Schroeder, 19 years old who is studying at the College Convention in Georgia.
The required literature for last semester would cost $430, he says.
He spent $120.
According to the College Board, the average student spends more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and training supplies, but students have a number of options for reducing these costs.
Students are increasingly choosing online stores and creative ideas such as the Schroeder system.
The brochure is becoming more popular, allowing students to use the book during the semester, and often it takes a lot of money to buy it.
Nibo Incorporated, which belongs to more than 250 university bookstores, reports that the volume of lost books has increased twice since 2011.
The industry's studies show that around four books in university bookstores were taken on board last spring, says Vice-President Nibo Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of all books are acquired in university bookstores, according to the professional association "National Association of University Shops".
This is an introduction course in the best way to make a successful deal.
Buying online stores
Sometimes, if you go online, the price for a new book may be one third of what you see in the university bookstore.
The ninth edition of "Mathematic Analysis" by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler is worth about $290 per pre-currency, but a new copy can be purchased for $239.99 on the Chegg.com website, which specializes in the sale of textbooks.
Purchase of the detainee
If you're not against other marks or injuries, the supported textbooks are a good option.
"Mathematical Analysis" is sold for $93.49 in a supported form at Chegg.com.
Matt Cassedy, 25 years old, a fourth-rate student from Brigham Young University, says he paid 42 cents at Amazon.com for a supported copy of the book "Strategic Solutions in the Media: Understanding the Business side of Advertising".
The book was sold for $48 new.
Teachers, for example, Ingrid Bracie, Director of College Without Walls at the University of Massachusetts in Emherst, invite students to clarify with their professors whether they can use previous publications.
Sometimes updates are not relevant for occupations.
In such cases, old editions can often be found to be a very small fraction of the value of the last edition.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon sites, Half.com owned by "eBay Inc." is a popular alternative for buying held books.
Prokat
In order to get the textbooks wrapped up, you have to think, if you're good enough to talk to them, don't forget to return them, and don't want to leave them after the course is over.
You can save more than 80% of the value of the new book.
For example, one student was able to take the "Mathematical Analysis" for a semester of about $20.
Clear the rules of the store where you take the books, including any fines that you may write for markings, stressings and injuries.
If you take the book, remember: If you do not return the book, the fines may even exceed the value of a new copy.
Electronic books
Electronic books instead of traditional textbooks are another option.
Sometimes such books actually take the lead in obtaining an electronic license for a certain period of time from distributors such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
The "Mathematic Analysis" brochure on the Chegg.com website for six months will be worth about $61.
Bracey says that students studying literature can often find the most profitable prices, since many classics can now jump free, while literature on natural and engineering sciences can be very expensive.
No matter what you do, check it out.
Joe Holt, 29 years old, who is going to start studying at the law school Pepperdin, recommends using the ISBN number to determine book prices, as this ensures that you are looking for exactly what you need.
Before ordering on the Internet, Holt says, make sure the book really is in store.
This lesson was not easy for him.
The delivery of the book he acquired was delayed for four weeks, and, at the end, he paid the full price at the university bookstore.
Putin stated that the Far East Development Fund had been completely ineffective
Russian President Vladimir Putin announced at the meeting on the management of priority investment projects and territories in the Far East that the Long East's budgetary investment fund, established two years ago, was ineffective, reports Interfax.
"15 billion rubles are still lying on deposits," the president stressed.
During the meeting, the Head of State requested an accelerated approval of the list of developing countries in the Far East.
He recalled that the draft law necessary for the creation of the TOROs should be introduced into the Gosdom in this autumn.
The Federal Assembly noted that until 1 July the President had not adopted the list of developing countries in the Far East and their criteria.
Vladimir Putin also set out key challenges for the development of the Far East.
Among them, improving transport availability in the region, removing infrastructure constraints - both in the internal market and for export development.
In addition, there is a need to create preconditions for attracting additional investment in the region, as well as to form a emerging development area, which should become competitive with the key business centres of ATR, the President stressed.
In the past, it has been reported that the emerging development territory could replace the OECD.
Why the Galactic Guards couldn't save cash collection
Sylvester Stallone ' s "Natural 3 " returned less than $30 million from his $90 million budget to the United States, while "The City of Sins: The woman to be killed" returned only $12 million from her $70 million budget.
The Home Video with Cameron Diaz brought only $14.6 million to the first outlets, while children's movies, such as "How to Bind Dragon 2" are also disappointed with breakfast.
The article by Telegraph Robbie Kollin points out that when it comes to children's films, it may be a matter of bad quality.
Collin called 2014 "the worst" year in all history with regard to children's films and called "How to Give Dragon 2" a barely "functioning" continuation of fantasy.
However, when it comes to films aimed at audiences of a slightly older age, it seems that the problem is not necessarily the same as movies.
In July Entertainment Weekly compared the average ratings of CinemaScore and Metacritic for each film that was released in summer with at least 2000 copies between the Memorial Day in May and 20 July 2013 and this year.
The results, which take into account the views of both filmmakers and film critics, suggest that the harvest of films this year is similar to the caliber with last year’s hits.
Some commentators suggest that the case may be in changing viewing habits and the increasing popularity of streaming Internet services, such as Netflix.
Director John Favro, who is currently working on the fast-track discney film "The Jungle Book" said to the Hollywood Reporter website, "I think the times are changing."
We have to admit it and not try to push for what was before.
Unlike the current fall in cash collection in Hollywood, Netflix's income from the flow generation service reached $1.2 billion, almost double the last year's figure of $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the studios for relying too much on comics and predicted the Hollywood robbery.
In the light of the current decline, some commentators claim that his dark predictions were a part of the truth.
Because several potential cash hits are expected in the summer of 2015, including the Founders: Ery Altron, the Minions and the Yur Park, other film industry representatives are more optimistic.
Human X producer Simon Kinberg recently called the fall of cash collection just "cyclical," said Hollywood Reporter: "The next summer will be the most cash summer in history, and nobody will worry about it."
The product sanctions are not feared by the owners of caucasian and medieval establishments, but for restaurants in the European and Japanese cuisine, Russian suppliers are a terrible dream.
In general, it still prefers to replace banned imports with products not from Russia but from Latin America, Israel and China.
"There's a little bit more sunny than a bad mozarel," is the Italian restaurant Barloti Mariano Valerio's chief bakery about the quality of the cheeses offered by its suppliers in exchange for Italians.
Mozarella and burrat cheese ended up in the restaurant first, they have a small storage period.
Parmesan stocks must be sufficient for a few months.
What to do?
Going to Russian?
In 2005, I was on the dorogomilov market.
Mariano Valerio is making such an eye that it is clear that shocking memories do not release him so far.
The meat was lying on the carpets just 30 centimeters from the sex!
There's cats!
Chris!
Then I said that for our restaurant we would never buy anything in Russian markets.
I don't know, maybe it's all changed now.
But in those days, I was given a fish sample from the Far East.
That's how it turned out!
I said I don't even want to talk to the man who brought this to us.
Valerio is surprised that many things are common to Italy for the Russian producer in the wild.
A few years ago, I had to buy Russian beef.
In Italy, meat is weighed in the cold room for 10 days at 1-2 degrees.
It must hang to become soft to relax the muscles.
I've done all this with the local beef.
Then they asked me, "Where did you get that soft meat?
I said, that's yours, Russian!
Why don't you guys do that?
In five minutes' walk from Barlotti in the French restaurant Brasserie Bridge on the kitchen hangs a stop list indicating the missing products: French oysters, seafood.
The head of the Brasserie Bridge restaurant and the Arrow Bar Regis Trigel is not as pessimistic as Valerio: the French oysters have already replaced the Tunisian oysters, and instead of the French cheeses, the restaurant will buy Swiss.
However, and the Regis is becoming more emotional when it comes to Russian suppliers: "The color of the hat is 200 rubles!
I'm asking, "Why does it cost so much?"
They say, "We have to earn, too."
But this hat shouldn't be worth 80 rubles!
We're buying off the long-east oysters by weight, but they live 15-20 years, do you imagine how much they're carrying?
The price is that it's super-delicate.
Russian suppliers seem to be one of the main sources of threats to foreign barriers.
The standard story: "The first three months were good, then the quality fell. "
Main claims: Russian suppliers cannot withstand stable calibration and quality.
Many restaurants in European cuisine don't know what will happen to them when the cheese stocks are over.

Penalties menu
On 6 August, President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on the application of certain economic measures to ensure the security of Russia, which are essentially product sanctions.
The country is prohibited from importing bovine, porcine, meat and offal products from domestic birds, meat delicacies, fish, molluscs, milk, yogurts, cucumbers, cheeses, vegetables, fruit, nuts, sausages and sugar syrups.
Restaurants have started a supply chain: prices for products have grown, demand for similar products from other countries needs to be urgently sought.
This will most strongly affect the expensive restaurants from the French, Italy, Spain, where products were placed directly from "mother" countries.
The census had to be rebuilt earlier.
For example, when in early 2014, Rosselhozhnadzor banned imports of Australian beef and earlier, American and Canadian meat.
In exchange for suppliers, supplies of beef from Argentina, Uruguay and New Zealand have been made.
But summer 2014 sanctions were much more serious.
True, on 20 August, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev adopted amendments to the Presidential Decree, which derogate from the prohibition of Atlantic salmon and fur, blue milk, seed potatoes, sugar maize, mountains and crops.
The Italian Valerio hopes that sanctions can still be mitigated.
For as long as some restaurants exist in uncertainty.
According to East-West, one of the largest suppliers of HoReCa, the share of imports in the premium segment was up to 70%.
"The expensive restaurants will have to change the menu by producing local farmers and other countries," says Sergey Mironov, a restaurant owner of Restconsult.
If the boss is strong, it won't be a problem for him.
We only have very few such gaps, and a new menu can be developed for two or three months.
The Trigel from the Brasserie Bridge restaurant is ready for this: to give up 10-15% of the dishes, another half of the menu is to be reprocessed.
Restaurants with mixed kitchens are already beginning to replace candles, such as strawberry steaks, on beef strogans, says Sergey Mironov.
"The cheeses from Europe can be replaced by Russian, Belarusian cheeses from Serbia, Argentina, Tunisia, Chile - the representative of East-West Oksana Glibchuk.
Slags and milk products from Europe are similar in Russia and Belarus.
A US chicken can be replaced by a Russian and Belarusian chicken, salmon and semga from Norway, salmon, semgo, fur from Belarus and Chile.
The absence of fruit and vegetables in European production can be offset by the production of domestic producers, proposals from Serbia, Moldova and China.
According to Mironov, the budget network restaurants would be transformed more easily than the primary segment: there were hardly any gurmans that could distinguish Italian mozarel from Russian.
Although it will be difficult for the Ginza Project institutions, he considers it.
Ginza Project has several dozen restaurants under different brands and with its menus.
"The time will run out," said Mironov.
In Ginza, the comments were rejected, referring to the lack of owners in the country.
Owners of Caucasian and Central Asian Caucasian Coffees stress that products from the former Soviet republics are more aromatic than European
But there are also many restaurants whose sanctions are almost unaffected.
These include institutions from CIS countries: Georgian, Uzbek, Armenian and Azerbaijani.
"There are no expensive products in the Georgian kitchen," says Hatuna Kolbay, owner of the Georgian restaurant Saperavi and the coffee "Way me."
All the cheeses are made for us in Russia, based on a lot of chicken beans, we don't use exotic vegetables."
At the Colbayi institutions, they haven't taken any wires out of the menu yet.
Timura Lansky, owner of Chihon N1 restaurants from the Uzbek kitchen, is also not disturbed by sanctions: he will only have to change his lamb to New Zealand.
If Russia were to import from Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, we would even win the price, it would be cheaper for us than imports from Europe, he says.
It's cheap to get steaks, lamb, tomatoes, cucumbers, fruits.
However, what is brought from Central Asia is much better than plastic from Italy, Spain and Turkey.
The Uzbek tomatoes all know they're delicious, sweet.
No one speaks like that about Spanish.
Following the imposition of sanctions, the representative of Minselvodhos of Uzbekistan Olymbai Artikov said that he was planning to increase exports of fruit and vegetables to Russia twice by 2016.
The intention was to replace European imports into Russia almost immediately after sanctions were imposed by Belarus and Kazakhstan.
The fast-food restaurants that responded to Deneg's request also respond mildly to sanctions.
The McDonald's Press Service stated that the location exceeds 85 per cent and works with 160 Russian suppliers.
According to Tatyana Bogdanova, head of the Subway Russia supplier department, about 80% of the network purchases in Russia, although temporary difficulties may arise with the supply of fruit and increased prices for meat products produced from imported raw materials.
In Themeque, "licensing products" were not more than 4 per cent at all.
They didn't touch the sanctions and the Walker laptop.
KFC, Burger King and Kroška Cartoška did not respond to Deneg's request, but other market participants claim that the location of Burger King is significantly less than McDonald's.
In the absence of Norwegian fish, restaurants are willing to buy more chili than Russian long-east
On your pride
As long as restaurants complain that the demand for prices increases, even local products.
"The prices for Grable products have grown by 10-15% on average, and for the Italian Cherry Mio restaurant, twice," says Roman Rožniski.
Even in Georgian restaurants, the value of the candle will grow by 5-10 per cent, according to Kolbaya.
"East-West" does not deny this: "For example, Belarus's milk production has travelled 10-15% since the beginning of August."
“The Brazilian suppliers have raised prices for pigs almost twice,” complains Sergey Rack, Deputy Director General Stardogs.
Short rides were 35%.
We're waiting for China's price, maybe they'll freeze the hot Brazilian heads.
In the near future, Stardogs will have a planned 8 per cent price increase.
Now it's so bad to raise prices, says Cancer.
According to statistics, the cost of the second quarter of 2014 is only 1.8 per cent.
This is the smallest rate since 2010.
Variety prices will continue to grow, he admits, but it is not surprising that as soon as most restaurants have been saved products for the next two months in the hope of overruns of purchase prices.
But what happens two months later, no one knows.
There are dozens of tents decorated with green and wood in front of the Moscow Mary.
In the center of the scene, musicians play the waltze.
It's a regional product festival called "There's a Time."
"We've been going on a local food party for a long time, and here's the sanctions, we've been down, we've organized a festival," says one of the organizers.
On the scene with Greek poets Anastas is making salads from pasta and homemade confectionery, and in days there was a master's class to prepare a brothel with caramelized apples.
All Russian products are certified by the organizers.
In tents is an exhibition of the achievements of the Russian population.
Honey from Baschiria, celery from Salehard, fruit from the sub-mosque "Sovhoza Name Lenina", cheese from Italian striped Jay Clouseum.
"The salmon for restaurants can easily be replaced by another salmon species from the Far East," says the owner of the fish shrimp "Your People" Philipp Galkin.
We've got a kidney, a cat, a cock, a cockroach, a cockroach, a royal salmon.
Yeah, they're not as fat as a Norwegian salmon because it's a wild fish.
The Norwegian salmon is the same aquaculture.
You take it in your hand, he won't even move.
And you won't hold our far east salmon.
Only institutions without special claims agree to replace the Italian mozarel of the home
In the midst of his tent lies the beds with a "Magadan" burrow, mollusk, mucksun, midsummer with the Crimea, the mushrooms with the Far East.
Galkin's sure it's been a long time since the Far East.
According to statistics, fish catches in Russia in 2013 amount to more than 4 million tonnes, much of the fish goes to Japan, Korea and even the United States.
Imports of fish in 2013 are around 800 thousand tonnes.
His people have been working since 2012, selling fish through the Internet store, and have served another half a dozen restaurants, such as Simple Things.
There have now been applications for more than 15 restaurants in Galkin.
The same sushi can be made from our fish, it's hot.
We're stuck, we've tried different recipes.
Now we're selling droughts through the Internet store for a million rubles a month.
Our fish is cheap several times, and delivery is a maximum of 15 rubles per kilogram.
As confirmed in Galkin's tent, I'm being prepared for the Philly version of the chain.
Unlike the scrolls with seven, they have to grow longer, but the knowledge that this fish, our native, gives power.
On the site of your people's dolls, there's even parts of the coat and the seaboard.
In sushi bars, indeed, the Norwegian salmon prefers to be Chilean.
Galkin explains this because I'm trying to make new recipes with long-eastern fish.
"Russian fish suppliers haven't offered us yet," explains the owner of Killfish Bar Dmitry Evseev.
The same is true of other products: Russian producers could take advantage of the loose nest, but this did not happen.
According to the founder and co-owner of the LavkaLavka Boris Akimov project, it is now possible to talk more about the substitution of imports from Europe and America from China, Israel and Latin America.
There are large transnational corporations with strong logistics and large volumes.
They are able to replace banned imports quickly, unlike our farmers.
This means that major producers from other countries will win from the ban," Akimov says.
However, in the last month, the restaurant industry received a more alarming signal than product sanctions.
As a result of the mass out-of-the-way inspections, the activities of three McDonald's enterprises in Moscow and two regional enterprises in Stavroupolis and Ekaterinburg were temporarily suspended.
"We are studying the essence of the claims made to determine the actions needed to open restaurants for visitors as soon as possible," said Denegam in McDonald's press service.
No one really understands what's going to happen.
If all is limited to product sanctions, this is one option that can be survived, says an anonymous staff member of a restaurant consultant.
If McDonald's is closed all over the country, the script will be completely different.
Europrotocol instead of GIBDD reports
Cash payments can be received without an IDBDD report, so the CB intends to encourage the introduction of the Europrotocol in Russia.
The Bank of Russia has developed a draft guidance that, from 1 September of this year, an insured car driver will be able to obtain payment for the helmet without an IDBDD report.
It is true that it is only when the accident was designed on the "Europrotocol" without the involvement of the road police.
That is, if only two cars were involved in the DTP, no individuals were physically affected, no damage exceeded the prescribed limit and both drivers agreed on who was responsible for the accident.
As of 2 August, the Europrotocol ceiling is 50 thousand rubles, and as of 1 October in Moscow, St. Petersburg and in Moscow and Leningrad areas, it will increase to 400 thousand rubles.
The point is that, often even with minor injuries, in situations where DTPs can be formed through the "Europrotocol", drivers in an accident are causing DPS.
It was impossible to obtain a refund without an IBDD report if there was a policy.
The parameters set out in the draft guidelines are intended to remove this obstacle to the introduction of the Europrotocol in Russia.
According to them, the maximum payment of the helmet in connection with the GIBD-free DTP should not be lower than the limit for the Europrotocol.
However, it may not be above the limit laid down in the helmet insurance contract.
The idea, of course, is useful and theoretically capable of unloading both DPS and roads.
But it's probably not the driver or the insurers.
The latter are already talking about a serious threat to the growth of fraud, which could lead to the introduction of new rules on cash payments.
With regard to drivers, it is difficult to imagine what work will have to be done to overcome the Estonian Russian conservative.
In most cases, the leader will wait for the inspector to form a small accident because it is more reliable.
And yet it is not known that it will be easy to defeat fraud or convince the drivers of the Europrotocol.
The safety certificate will make the nameless
Minfin wants to ban the supplier ' s savings certificates, so he will allow banks to make them similar to the unrevocable contributions.
Minfin prepares a bill that prohibits the supplier ' s certificates of preservation.
Recently, this instrument has gained popularity, since the rates here are higher than on bank contributions.
The fact that the depositary's savings certificates do not fall into the deposit insurance system and they are cheap to the bank as no deposit is required in the Fund of the Deposit Insurance Agency (CSA).
The fact that this step is intended to be taken by small and medium-sized banks that distribute such certificates and are affected by Sberbank and the Bank of Moscow, which, according to the ACS, control 98 per cent of the profile market.
The Bank's share of Moscow, according to the agency, is about 3.5 per cent.
The problem explained in the CBA is that the clients of a small bank that has bought such a certificate are trying to obtain money from the CBA if they withdraw it.
Some investors who do not have sufficient financial literacy and who purchase savings certificates from the sponsor may assume that their investments are insured.
Reasoned lack of insurance payments under these certificates may lead to misunderstandings and social tensions in the case of withdrawal of a licence from the bank.
In practice, the agency had cases where the holders of the submission certificates tried to obtain an insurance refund through the court," said ASV.
The problem is, of course, imaginary.
No one will be able to pay the buyers of the certificates anyway, since they do not have the law to repay them from the State.
If the instrument were not insured in the ASV, it would also be prohibited to use the metal accounts, which are taken into account by citizens in grams of one of the four metals, gold, silver, platinum and palladium.
These accounts also do not fall into the deposit insurance system, but their existence has not yet been tried.
It is likely that the certificates on the sponsor are a very comfortable valuable paper that can actually act as Quasidians.
However, their movement is virtually uncontrollable: any bank client can purchase a certificate, transfer a certificate to any citizen, and before such a certificate can be found, a number of owners may change.
The draft law did not, by accident, stipulates that a security certificate must be a nominal security that must be stored in the depositary.
In order to sweeten the pill to banks, such certificates are allowed to be issued without the right to early payment.
That is to say, there is a analogy of the unrevocable contribution that bankers have long dreamed of.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
Outbound protests against the NATO summit in Newport were held.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered at the centre of Newport on march against NATO.
On Sunday, about 150 people gathered at Cardiff's rat's house for what was described as an anti-Semitic.
Stephen Fairklau was watching us for developments during the departures and talking to Protestants who came all the way from Bridgend to Belgium.
Germany will send 30 anti-tank complexes to Iraq
Germany will place weapons in Iraq to counter the fighters from the terrorist group "Islamic State", reports ITAR-TASS on 31 August with reference to a decision taken following the meeting of the representatives of the Government of the FWG headed by Chancellor Angelo Merkel.
Germany is reported to send 30 portable anti-tank missile complexes to Iraq and 500 charges to them, as well as 8,000 G3 and G36 storms.
The items will be implemented by the end of September.
In addition, it was decided to allocate another 50 million euros to humanitarian assistance to Iraq.
On 1 September, Ms. Merkel will make a statement in protest on this subject by the Government.
So far, Germany has not put its weapons in hot spots.
The views of the people of FWG on the sending of arms to Iraqis were divided.
Some believe that it is only possible to stop the fighters from the Islamic State that others fear that these weapons may eventually fall into the hands of terrorists.
Policemen undercut the Ukrainian patrol station in the Asian Sea
The Donetsk militia have taken over the Ukrainian patrol station in the Azores Sea, ITAR-TASS reported on 31 August.
According to the available data, this occurred in the Taganrog Gulf near the people's points Shirokino and Unnamed (10-20 km east of Mariupol).
A number of Ukrainian media reported shooting two blocks of coast guard.
It is clear that the incident occurred today about 16:20 msec.
Adolescents take on a helicopter from the Blue Mountains
Two young bus drivers were delivered to a safe place on the helicopter after spending the night in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales.
The 16-year-old girl and the 18-year-old went on a march shortly after Friday morning at Govetts Lip in Blackkhite.
Concerned relatives called the police about 8 nights when they didn't come home.
A search team was sent into the local police and rescue team, and a couple of dinners were found around the Bridal Valley.
The girl injured her knee, and the young man fell and whose head fell.
The officers stayed with a couple for the night, and they were picked up on Monday morning.
They were taken to the ambulance in a stable condition at the Blue Mountain Hospital.
Two Unions Meet
The summit negotiations in Minsk did not solve the challenges that had been convened, but gave rise to a new format: the first people of the European Union met with the first people of the future of the Eurasian
Let it be with concern (the situation around Ukraine does not tolerate delays), the leaders of the EU and the Customs Union for the first time discussed a number of “burning problems”.
Whether such a structure is capable of working effectively or not, it is clear who took the slips off the summit.
Questions on this issue were dropped on the evening of August 26, when the Belarusians, and behind them and other Europeans, saw a new President Lukashenko telenovate.
The Belarusian leader was an example of genuine courtesy, which was the behavior of a man who had just broken the Jackpot - and was planning a decent old age in the highest society.
How Majdan Lukashenko Helped
The arrival in Minsk immediately of three main European Commissioners (EU ministers) who met with Lukashenko and allowed him to speak in the final briefing on their behalf -- not just the President's 20-year term.
This is an application for recognition by Minsk as a full-fledged European politician and the main mediator of the Ukrainian crisis.
The senior analyst of the Belarusian Institute of Strategic Research, Dennis Melianz, is confident that Brussels will no longer be able to talk to Minsk as before.
"What Catherine Ashton met Aunt Lucasenko gives reason to believe that relations with the EU will continue to freeze," he said.
This iceberg has a hidden part: preparations for the break-in began long before the November Mayan in Kiev in 2013.
“The results have been achieved and with the EU are successful negotiations on visa facilitation and readmission, dialogues on modernization,” said the spokesperson for Fire, and international security negotiations have been held with the United States.
The states even lifted some sanctions.
With regard to Ukrainian events, they themselves and the leadership of Belarus have only undermined the process.
Minsk, on the one hand, managed to maintain relations with Ukraine - warm enough not to lose much in mutual trade, and President Poroshenko could come to Belarus for negotiations.
With another, a Belarusian leader who de jure refused to recognize Crimea's accession to Russia and called for the punishment of the pro-Russian militias in Donbass with full rigour, he did not fight with Moscow.
Minsk did not leave the Customs Union or the ODKB, and Russian aviation was located in Baranovic.
Brussels and Washington have noted the balanced position of Minsk on the Ukrainian issue - and assessed it, as confirmed by the Belarusian experts.
As long as Lukashenko's political diversification is successful, it will be evident how often Minsk will have to meet in the format of EU+TS.
In the press service of the EU High Representative for Foreign Policy and Diplomacy, Catherine Ashton was unable to respond quickly to questions about what Brussels expects from relations in a new format.
The Press Secretary of Ashton Maya Cosiancic has only stated that the issue is not a priority in the light of the war and peace issues.
It was reported that the next meeting on the Ukrainian question with the first persons in a new format could also be held in Kazakhstan.
The hat of a man for Minsk became a statement by President Nursultan Nazarbaev, in which he recognized that he was being asked personally by the representatives of the European Union.
However, in his final briefing, Alexander Lukashenko made it clear that all parties did not object to Minsk being a central venue for meetings in both the Russian-OSCE-Ukraine format and at the level of Heads of State and High Representatives of the European Commission.
This means that "the last dictator of Europe" is a fully-fledged European leader who helps solve the global problem.
A Better Friend of a European Farmer
The composition of the EU delegation, which included the European Trade and Energy Commissioners, had already highlighted the conclusion that the main cover of the summit was not the tragic situation in Donbass but the economy.
Indeed, the timing of future negotiations on gas supply and overcoming the concerns of the TC countries in the association agreement between Ukraine and the EU seems to be more extensive than the peace declarations without specific dates and figures.
Trade Commissioner Carl De Gucht, however, noted: EU representatives “come to Minsk to seek a solution to the political crisis that has economic consequences, not the opposite”.
It seems, however, that the crisis in Ukraine is also “working” in Belarus.
Its consequences - and, above all, the mutual sanctions of the West and Russia - are given to Minsk, which has so far been subject to the sanctions imposed by the manoeuvre.
According to the leader of the Mises Research Centre, former candidate for the President of Belarus, Yaroslav Romancuk, European investors are actively interested in Belarus ' s ability to deliver agricultural products to the RF in the course of sanctions.
There are supply schemes for which Vladimir Putin has rushed Minsk at the summit.
"Initiators of these schemes," said Romanchuk Firenku, "are not Belarusian businessmen, but Russian companies.
They have long developed commodity supply schemes, including from Poland, Germany, Lithuania, and today these schemes are destroyed.
The Russian business is urgently needed to restore them, even through the Belarusian structures.
Secondly, the expert continues to relate to the fact that many Ukrainian companies will not be able to set up production in Belarus from Ukrainian raw materials, but also to the direction of the Russian market.
Ukrainian producers have around $4 billion of exports to Russia, and Belarus's trade schemes can now become very expensive."
In Romania's view, the role of the owner of the EU and TS negotiating area is ideal for Lukashenko and in terms of economic relations with Europe.
He recalls that the losses of the EU agricultural sector from Moscow's sanctions are estimated at 5-10 billion euros, while the European Commission has now offered farmers only 125 million euros.
The Belarusian President may invite Brussels to work together to minimize the impact of Eurofarmers.
This can raise Lukashenko's EU authority to an unprecedented height.
Hospitality without initiative
Catherine Ashton thanked the Belarusian authorities for the initiative to hold the summit.
But the paradox is that the official Minsk of its active role in the birth of the TS+EU format is reflected, and the Belarusian leader at the meeting with a Ukrainian colleague stressed that the new format was the initiator of the whole of Kiev.
"It was your proposal to gather, without having to discuss it, not with the bartenders, to decide, after signing the Treaty on Association with the EU, to deal with the situation that was at that time in Ukraine," he turned to the chambers of Peter Proshenko.
The observers, however, interpreted this as an attempt to calm Moscow, which, according to the hearing, was initially opposed to the mediation of Minsk, which greatly increases its political weight.
In the Belarusian diplomatic department, they strongly stress that Belarus does not pursue useful objectives when organizing EU and TS interactions on its ground, but the ultimate goal of such a format is to create a single economic space in the future from Lisbon to the Vladivostok.
"This is absolutely in the spirit of those concepts that, in other areas, particularly in the field of security, raise and promote the leadership of our strategic ally - the Russian Federation," said Firenku in the Middle East of Belarus, where words have been sloppy lately.
There may be a pay-in zone in Moscow
The Government of Moscow considers the introduction of a pay entry zone as a means of combating overcrowding of the central roads similar to other major cities of the world, conveys M24.ru with reference to the Moscow Mayor on the transport of Maxim Lixutov.
One of the options that he had successfully recommended was a payment entry.
That's an expert opinion. We're going to have to study it. We're going to look at all the minuses and pluses.
To talk about what some decisions have been made in this regard until early," Lixutov said.
Zammera stressed that it was very important for the authorities of the capital to experience Asian cities, which are similar to Moscow in terms of structure and load.
One of the decisions taken from those countries was the construction of the central wheelway already under way, added Liksutov.
The recent construction of the Central Wheel Road is an example of not having to miss all traffic through Moscow.
If there was sufficient landing infrastructure, there was no need to have transit traffic in Moscow," the mayor said.
Maxim Lixutov also stated that the introduction of pay-parks had significantly exposed the capital streets.
And he said that the capital authorities were not planning to stop on what they had achieved.
On 26 August, the mayor of the Russian capital, Sergey Sobianin, attended the ceremony of the construction of the first launch complex of the Moscow Central Wheel Road (CCAD).
Bugger is not valid
The film by Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez "The City of Sins 2: The woman who is to be killed" did not carry out the revolution that could have been expected from him.
The first "City of Sins" (2005), taken from the minimal, but symbolic, participation of Quentin Tarantino, carried out a revolution in the relationship between cinema, comics and literature.
Sikwell is also revolutionized: in the sense that it destroys the fundamentals for modern thinking the string "thesis - antithesis - synthesis" (if you understand this universe's neuron and the antithesis - the cosmic space of comics).
It should now be read: "Thesis - Antithesis - Chaos."
The City of Sins-2 is chaotic both at the dramatic and at the philosophical level: both are chaotic in the foolish sense of words.
Yes, part of the heroes are known for the first town, although, here, the thunder of Marv (Micky Ruck), remembers, ended life on the electric chair, and here, nothing but succeeds in excavating, as a people's wife, from the air of the knife and other toads.
But the old people are literally talking about a new one, like they're breaking into a city from some other movie, about the meaning and purpose of which viewers are asking not to worry.
Yes, his story, which is indistinguishably addressed by the authors in the most interesting place, in the superlative game of Johnny (Joseph Gordon-Levitt).
Hers is a willing-frigid Eva Lord (Eva Green) and something for her dueit (Jos Brolin).
But this error, in which Duyta, let's say we don't stand out from Johnny -- the more people, like other parts of the body, wear people with unrelenting regularity, not poverty, not even poverty.
They're not people, but we understand that they're the archetypes of the noura: a year-old bitch who's too confident of herself playing a game that's compatible with the "sweet hunting" of a sex detective, a corrupt senator.
Well, when an archetypal walks with an archetypal and an archetypal chases, it's not a movie anymore, but it's an abstract life.
It's just funny to ask an abstract picture of the logic of the summary.
In addition, even in this sad world, there is something constant.
The first "City" warheads continue to defend themselves against their own native forces of darkness.
Yeah, and Detective Hartigan's ghost isn't, and he's gonna look at the fire, and Bruce Willis is always nice to look at.
The main problem of the City of Sins-2 is another.
Frank Miller was good at how a painter talentedly combined comics and nuars and how a director transformed his idea of how to carry comics on the screen.
Comics and novels are two aggressively opposite "realities".
A contemporary comical phenomenon was born at the end of the 1920s, and when the Romanesques of Daschill Hemmet "Crowding Harvest" (1929), "Maltian Scoll" (1930) and "Glassy Key" (1931) created a canon of noura named then hard-boiled school.
Well, it's a pulp fiction.
The comics gave Hollywood many dozens of heroes: from the seaman Pope, the spinach who gave him the rich power, Superman, Batman, and Dick Tracy to Halka, Thora, Man Pauka and other "vengefuls".
But in any comic film, there was something harmful: painted characters were not constantly willing to raise their screens, remained hostages in the world's surrounding "real" affairs.
I'm just saying, they've been completely deprived of "existence."
Noir, on the contrary, is the most existential genre of world literature.
After World War II, the traditional novel - with its anxieties, its nature, its family scandals and its historical background - lost all conviction.
What For sites, such as Tybo and Rugon-Makkari, what even the Balkan and Rosts are thought of after Verde, Osvencim and Hiroshima?
Such a novel has been peacefully mutated in the form of a soap opera, and a criminal - that is, a marginal - novel has, by definition, increased to the level of the philosophical prose.
Hemmet on his skin knew what it was like to work as a paramedic on the front.
He was a communist.
Like, at least, they were close to the company and the pillars of the genre, such as authors Horas McCoy and Jim Thompson, director Jules Dassen, Joseph Louis, Edward Dmitrick.
So the nouar, whose archetype they put, first, rough and cynical, and secondly, is totally social.
It's not the American version of socrealism.
The first "City of Sins" was remarkable in that it was, by contrast, that it was organically interlinked with the nuar.
For the first time on the screen, the comic was alive without narrowing down its graphic nature and not becoming a "present" movie.
The dark world of sale, where the cardinal ordered the murder, and the senator covered the monster son-sadist, was quite worthy of Hemmet's feathers.
And the graphic details of the cut heads that the sadist decorated his nest, the feathers of the genius James Elroy, the author of the Black Orchid, and the best -- that is, a declaratively painful representative of the Neonar.
"The City of Sins-2" is not even a retreat, but the capitalization of the radical stylistic of Miller -- Rodriguez before the comic tradition.
Probably a lot of this happened because of 3D technology.
When you look at the second "City of Sins", you feel trapped in a glass layer where the snow is suffocating the toy.
However, it's often not snow, it's blood bills, but what's the big difference?
Well, it's about socialism, and it's about talking.
For it is possible only when we have somewhere, sometimes, let it be on the side of the dirty mud, but there is a normal peace, where we can return the girl lying on the wrong path or, say, tell the restless parents that her loser is punished.
And when there is no place for sin in the city, there is no sin but that which is sin; neither is there any sin therein, but custom.
It's boring, like any rule.
Chaos "City of Sin-2" is just boring.
For the sake of justice, the domestic sparrow gave this fine sin a small one, but a fine one.
The headlines warn: the film contains harmful smoke scenes.
With regard to maturity, the very Vegetarian episode that breaks the fingers of a person with his fists gives it a hell of a humor.
Hemmet would like it.
The socialists of France must “close and bring France in order”, said key ally Frasua Holland
Mr. Wall urged the deeply divided left-wing forces to “show a warm attitude” to the assaults of the Socialist President, whose relocations had not been approved by the vast majority of the French.
The President deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It's our duty to stay close to him," he said, shouting out applause.
As a gesture of reconciliation, the Prime Minister assured his Government that it would not question a 35-hour working week in France, despite a heated conflict of proposals, it would have to weaken the rules made by Emmanuel Macron, the new Minister of Economics earlier this week.
On Saturday, Mr. Olland begged his socialist partner to remain “one” with the Government.
However, Christian Tober, the Minister of Justice, put sticks in the wheel by joining the meeting of members of Parliament from the Socialist Party and criticizing the Socialist Party for allowing the French to “lose faith in the future”.
Marine Le Pe, leader of the extremely right National Front, expressed contempt for the ongoing internal conflicts among socialists, said that it did not represent that the new Walla Government would last for several months.
Francisco Holland is a naked king, but a naked and Prince Manuel Wall, forced to assemble a new government when the previous summer was not over.
"And the new will not take place in the fall or in the winter," Mrs. Le Pen told reporters.
She reiterated her call for parliamentary dissolution, said she was sure that the party could easily win in the early elections and be ready to manage.
The ruling party of France survived the collapse of the March municipal elections and the extremely right National Front came first at the EU elections in May.
The survey of the resurrected Journal du Dimanche found that 76 per cent of the French believe that the Socialist Party is at risk of being held by several competing factions until the end of Mr. Holland's presidential term in 2017.
Pascal Perrino, a politician at the University of Cyan Po, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new Socialist Government failed to correct the economy and record unemployment.
"He has little time, but public opinion needs to feel quickly about what's going on," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get even worse.
"The City Without Drugs" is missing.
The Sverdlov court of arbitration has left the claim of the Regional Ministry's Management Directorate for the Management of Societies to the City of No Drugs Fund without consideration.
The notification was intended to recover more than 7 million rubles from the organization as a rental fee for a building in the centre of Ekaterinburg.
However, the defendant did not appear twice in court.
Today, the Sverdlovska District Arbitration Court has left the claim of the Executive Directorate of the Ministry of State Property Management (MUGISO) to the City of No Drugs fund (one of the founders of the Mayor of Evgeny Roysman).
The representatives of the regional authorities intended to recover 7.3 million rubles from the organization as a rental fee for the building.
It was known today that the applicant had not appeared twice before the court and therefore a decision had been taken to refuse the hearing.
The reason for the absence of representatives from the UIGISO branch could not be explained, the Chief of the Legal Division, Maxim Titov, did not respond to telephone calls.
The Fund was also unable to communicate with representatives.
This is a person who has been holding a fund in the city centre on Belinski Street, 19 on a free basis since 2011.
Such a decision was taken by former Governor Alexander Misharin.
In November 2012, the Executive Directorate of the Ministry of Public Property Management of the Sverdlov area filed an application to the Sverdlov court for the eviction of the fund from the building.
According to the claim, the Authority requested the court to recognize an unencumbered contract of free use by a person ' s memorial.
According to the UIGISO Directorate, the agreement did not include substantial conditions for the rental of cultural heritage.
The Sverdlov court of arbitration denied the claim, and an appeal was filed in the 17th court of arbitration in Perma, which was satisfied.
The same court then filed a cassation complaint against the decision, which was unsatisfied, after which the decision was appealed to by the High Court of Arbitration, but the court accepted the direction.
In 2013, a new lease contract was concluded, under which the rent fund was rescheduled, and the head of the city of Evgenën Roizman told us about it.
The rent was allocated 300 thousand rubs a month.
The previous administration of the area has transferred this building to us for free, recognizing our merit in combating drugs, in respect of the fund.
The current administration has decided differently," he said.
Tatiana Drogaeva, Ekaterinburg
Why the Mayor of Ekaterinburg offered to leave voluntarily
On 24 July, the proud deputy of Ekaterinburg, the unicorn Alexander Kosinciev, invited the mayor of the city, the proud speaker of Evgen Rajman, to resign.
There was a criminal case with regard to the suspect in the murder of a retired member of the proud deputy of Oleg Kinev, who was considered a fellow mayor.
How the Evgen Roseman found a criminal case
On 1 July, a criminal case was brought against the fact of “accursed” (art. 128.1 of the U.S.R.) in the blog of the mayor of Evgenie Roizman.
This was reported to the SWI in the Sverdlovsk area, where Anna Filatov, the Legal Centre's Director of Protection, made a statement.
According to her, Mr. Roseman accused her in her blog of participating in crimes that she allegedly committed by her ex-wife.
Mary Ekaterinburg is convinced that "it's a regular attempt to avenge the truth."
iPhone turns into a basketball
On 9 September, when Apple was due to present its new developments, all new leaks appeared in the press about what could be expected from the presentation.
With reference to sources, the American media reported that the sixth generation of iPhone would be equipped with a mobile basket as a result of the Joint Apple Project and Visa, MasterCard and American Express payment systems.
According to Bloomberg and the specialized Re/code Internet Resource, on presentation of new products on 9 September Apple can also announce a joint project with Visa, MasterCard and American Express, thus making available a mobile wallet function in the new iPhone 6 smartphone.
The companies themselves refuse any comments on this.
This function allows you to pay for the cash in the store using a smartphone.
The payment identification will be carried out by the user on his fingerprint using the Touch ID function.
It is reported that the iPhone will be the first NFC (near field communication) technology to make a callless payment using a smartphone and an appropriate cash-in-the-counter.
The NFC technology itself will be available through a special microprocessor from the Dutch high-tech company NXP (formerly Philips Semiconductors).
The first NFC function was presented in 2004 as part of the cooperation of Sony, Nokia, Philips Semiconductors and more than a hundred other companies in the so-called NFC Forum, an association for the promotion of this technology.
The first NFC phone was issued by Nokia in 2006.
The first smartphone on Android with the function of NFC - Samsung Nexus S - was presented in 2010.
In May 2011, Google introduced a Google Wallet system that allows users to attach bank cards to their Google account and to pay off using a smartphone on Android.
However, American experts stress that, despite major investments by high-tech companies in the promotion of NFC technology, American rétailers are still careful about innovation and are not too willing to spend money on their stores ' equipment with such systems.
Observers are therefore now hoping that Apple's entry to this market will make the riders accelerate and more actively implement this technology at their trading points.
MID France: Paris' position on delivery to Russia "Mistralei" remains unchanged
The official representative of MID France, Roman Nadal, stated that Paris had remained unchanged on Russia's supply of Mistral helicopters.
"I can recall the statement made by the President of the Republic (François Holland) in his interview with the newspaper Le Monde of 20 August: "Today the level of sanctions does not prevent the supply.
This is the decision of the Europeans, not of France," he quoted Mr. Nadala as saying "RIA News".
The representative of the French foreign policy agency thus replied to the question whether the situation in Ukraine would be affected by a change in the position of Paris to implement the contract
For more details on the supply of helicopters to Russia, see the article "Ogonek" "Mistral" near ours."

Norwegian Cruise is approaching $3 billion deal with Prestige Cruises
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the third largest cruise operator in the world, is at the final stage of negotiations to acquire a similar Prestige Cruises International Inc for approximately $3 billion, according to people who are familiar with the situation.
The transaction would provide Norwegian Cruise, a market-priced company of $6.8 billion, access to luxury cruise ships and to Prestige Cruises' secured customers, as it competes with larger Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
The agreement could be announced this week, reporting sources on Sunday, warning that negotiations could still fail.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, a private investment company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also holds 20 per cent of Norwegian Cruise's shares.
The sources requested to remain anonymous, as negotiations were not open.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to the request to comment, while the representative of Apollo refused to comment on the information.
Norwegian Cruise, based in Miami, operates 13 cruise ships on routes covering North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its income was $2.57 billion in 2013, 13 per cent more than in 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, works under the brands of Oceania and Regent, which together own eight cruise ships that travel to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported income of $1.2 billion in 2013, 6 per cent higher than a year earlier.
The $29 billion cross-cutting industry is expected to have a positive impact on the growth of the middle class in developing economies, such as China and India, in the years ahead.
The companies are trying to position themselves as cruise operators preferred by these new customers.
Prestige Cruises was registered in the US regulatory bodies for the initial public placement of shares in January 2014.
Apollo became the principal shareholder of the company after a $850 million transaction in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was created as it now exists, in 2000 as a result of a merger with a cruise operator belonging to Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a conglomerate of entertainment and a casino controlled by Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Tey.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise became a public company in January 2013.
Genting had a share of 28 per cent, Apollo had a share of 20 per cent, and the private investment company TPG Capital LP had a share of 8 per cent in the company, as reported at the end of June.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruises together account for 82 per cent of the cross-country traffic in North America, according to registration documents at the first public placement of Prestige Cruises.
Crimean Radio Company can receive 250 million rubles of subsidies
In Minkomsfázi, Russia proposes to allocate 250 million rubles to the Crimean State Radio Company in 2014.
According to the draft Minkomsfázi decision, which has been placed on a single portal to disclose information on the preparation of regulatory acts, the subsidy is intended to “cover the cost of creating conditions for extensive information on the socio-economic situation and the development of the modern information space in the territory of the Republic of Crimea”.
Money will also be used to buy equipment, roof repair and energy security systems in the 1959 radio company building, reports the RIA Novosti.
The Hong Kong Democratic Movement Activists interrupted the Chinese representative's statement the following day after the election decision
A group of citizens loyal to Beijing stood nearby, waving the Chinese flag.
The Standing Committee of the All-China People ' s Assembly on Thursday established a procedure whereby only two or three candidates will be allowed to participate in the elections of the leader of Hong Kong in 2017.
All candidates must first receive the support of most members of the Movement Committee, which is likely to be a handful of Beijing loyalists.
The decision makes it almost impossible for the democratic opposition to enter the electoral bulletin and has forced the democratic movement activists to once again promise to stop Hong Kong's financial centre with the "Occupy Central" protests.
Political reform is the main source of tension in Hong Kong, as Chinese party leaders fear that the call for democracy will spread to other cities.
Following the publication by Beijing of a document describing China ' s control over Hong Kong in June, democratic movement activists held an informal referendum on elections in the special administrative region, and hundreds of thousands went out to the city ' s business centre and set up a sit-down strike.
Briefing Li is organized by the Government of Hong Kong and the Chinese Office for Communications in Hong Kong.
The Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the All-China People's Assembly of Zhang Rongshun and the Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Office of the Feng Wey State Council also had to make a series of briefings during the day.
Activists said they would meet at the Hong Kong Government headquarters on the second morning.
Britain has not mentioned the democratic administration for Hong Kong until the last 150 years of its colonial rule.
The Israeli authorities intend to attach 400 g of land belonging to Palestinian autonomy
The Israeli authorities announced that they were going to join 400 hectares of land on the west bank of the Jordan River, belonging to Palestinian autonomy.
According to Bibi-si, the decision to join the land South Whiflie is linked to the desire to pay off the kidnapping and murder of three Israeli adolescents in June of this year.
On the capture of the territory, the Ministry of Defence of Israel declared on Sunday and ordered the military to establish administrative administration in the West Bank.
According to the representative of the Gaza Sayb Arikat sector, the world public should call upon Israel to respond to “the continued settlement activity on the west bank of Jordan and in East Jerusalem”.
Putin calls on Kiev to start negotiations on the statehood of eastern Ukraine
According to Russian news reports on his comments, Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded on Sunday that the Ukrainian Government stop fighting with separatists in the east of the country and immediately start negotiations on the Statehood of the divided region.
His press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, later explained that Putin had no intention of implying that the eastern Ukrainian territory under the control of separatists would be part of Russia, but that its status within Ukraine had to be revised in order to enable the Russian-speaking region to protect its rights and interests.
However, Putin's call on the Kiev Government to begin negotiations with the pro-Russian rebels as it was in line with the clear strategy it should have since the start of the bloodshed five months ago: to help separatists take the territory and force the Ukrainian Government to grant the newly proclaimed territory of Novorossia real independence to get closer to Russia, not to the West.
In an interview with State First Television, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to return to the occupied territories in eastern Donetsk and Lugansk, which were captured in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian peninsula to Crimea on 18 March.
The Kremlin and separatists have recently named the occupied territories of Novorossia, or New Russia, which refers to the pre-revolutionary days of the glory of the Russian Empire.
Putin said that anyone who believed that peace negotiations would take place in the near future when Ukrainian policies started campaigning for parliamentary elections on 26 October and while government troops were attacking peaceful settlements in the regions held by separatists, the “pillar of illusions” reported ITAR-TASS.
"We need to start the substantive negotiations immediately, not only on technical issues, but also on the political device of society and the state status of South-East Ukraine, in order to satisfy the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskov said that Putina's words about statehood were meant in the context of broader autonomy, which had been discussed for months with the leaders in Kiev in an attempt to calm the fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights were in danger.
Only the Government of Ukraine can give the eastern regions the necessary autonomy, Peskov said.
This is not a question for discussion between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine but an internal Ukrainian conflict".
The intervention of the secretary of the Kremlin to correct the “unbelievable interpretation” of Putin stressed the Russian leadership’s decision to conduct itself in relation to the separatist uprising in the east in a way other than the open grip of Crimea, where most of the 2 million people are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have to endure a much more difficult battle to join even the Donetsk and Lugansk area of eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million non-Russian residents were not Russian, and the pre-conflict polls showed broad support for the desire to remain inside Ukraine.
The autonomy that Russian diplomats had discussed in international forums would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to determine trade agreements and foreign policy itself, in fact, by transferring to Kremlin actual control over the territory that would unite the main territory of Russia with Crimea.
On the Black Sea peninsula five months ago, the main Russian military fleet, as well as commercial maritime institutions and historical sea resorts, are located.
In the regions between the Russian Rostov Region and Crimea there are also mines, factories and lithium plants that produce the necessary equipment for the Russian army.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed, during his opening speech on 7 June, that Ukrainian legislators after the new elections weigh amendments to the Constitution to allow the regions to exercise greater control over their finances and the status of languages.
However, his view of autonomy seems to differ greatly from that of Kremlin and the separatists, whose weapons and incitement are being accused of Moscow.
Putin's last call to Kiev to agree with the separatist leaders as equals followed the new attacks of the rebels last week after the Russian troops and tanks entered eastern Ukraine from the pre-peace area along the Azores Sea.
Russian-supported separatists took over Novoazovsk in an incident that Ukrainian security officials said they were afraid it was the beginning of a campaign to capture the strategic coastal territory before Crimea itself.
This has resulted in extensive civil and military efforts to strengthen Mariupol, a stable port of 500,000 inhabitants, between the Novoazovski and the narrow passage of the Crimean peninsula.
On Saturday, the European Union leaders gathered in Brussels to call for measures to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which was independent at the age of 23.
"We're approaching the point of no return," warned Poroshenko.
Thousands of foreign military and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not take certain measures; the leaders called for a draft of more severe sanctions against Russia to be adopted in the event of an escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to leave their positions in Addiske after two columns of Russian bronze technicians and 1,000 soldiers entered the Donetsk region last week to support the difficulties faced by separatists, Colonel Andrei Lisenko, the press secretary of the National Security and Defence Council, informed reporters in Kiev on Saturday.
The first of the 63 Ukrainian soldiers, who were reportedly detained in the Addis munity as a result of the Russian invasion, were exchanged on Sunday to 10 Russian air carriers captured in the Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lisenko reported on Sunday.
The photo-enhanced scandal captures Australian celebrities and Gabi Greco
Jeffrey Adelstein expressed his aversion to the hackers who might have stolen the stolen photos of his pregnant wife Gabi Greco and a complete list of Hollywood stars.
Hollywood was upset after a number of exposed photographs depicting the discovered Jennifer Laurence came online as a result of a massive hacker scandal with celebrities.
They say that the hacker responsible for this has about 60 open photos of the star "Golden Games" Lawrence and superstars, including Kate Apton and Kara Delevin, Ryan, Ariana Grande and Lia Michel and the actress Kirsten Danst.
Australian actors Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Ivan Strahovski and living in Melbourne Greco also reportedly stole photos from iCloud.
In list 101, the names of the celebrities.
"Edelstein, who made the Greek proposal last month, said confidential, "That's disgusting."
All private censuses and photographs must remain private.
It is terrible that personal information can be stolen and sent to others.
Greco, who is in New York, reportedly told the news site that the hacker attack was “posterous” and that those to whom it was directed “felt that they had been invaded”.
The hacker is supposed to have 30 photos of Palmer with his ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two crews where she's in the pool with an exhausted chest.
Palmer's work in the movie includes "Love and Honor" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, the star of the film "Chuck" Strahovski and an actress from "Brouning" yesterday didn't comment on stolen photos.
The representative of Lawrence said, "This is a sudden invasion of private life."
Actor Seth Rogen expressed his indignation at the hacker, writing on Twitter: "To put out photographs stolen from your cell phone, in fact, nothing is different from selling stolen goods."
From a legal point of view, the publication of stolen photographs cannot be tolerated.
A potential way of stealing photos of discovered celebrities was found
The mass loss of the star accounts may be caused by vulnerability in the Find My Phone annex.
The potential scenario of developments was described by The Next Web.
Github has published a script in Python that has enabled you to choose the password for the Apple Find My Phone service.
This service allows you to track your iPhone location.
The same connection between the log and the Apple ID password is used to access the Apple iCloud cloud, from which photos of celebrities have been stolen.
The script enabled you to learn the password from Find My Phone.
This method consistently introduces all possible combinations of symbols, starting with the most frequently used passwords.
The author of the script claimed that there is no limit to the number of password options in the Find My Phone service.
If the security system is properly organized after a few unsuccessful attempts, the wrong password should be blocked and the user should be informed of the attempt to break.
Because of vulnerability, users did not receive any reports of an attempt to improve their account password.
The hackers learned the password from Apple ID and used it to access iCloud.
According to Hackapp's Twitter user, vulnerability was detected two days ago, on Saturday, and it has written a password selection script.
At this point, vulnerability is closed: five attempts have been made to block access to the service.
The resource contacted Hackapp user and he noted that the above-mentioned vulnerability was typical of many services, but noted that there was no evidence that such vulnerability was used to access the star account.
It's not me, please.
On Twitter, the Prime Minister reappeared
While there was no strong evidence that the use of this service had been used to steal the photos, there had been a wave of harmful acts.
The hackers seized the device and demanded a ransom from the owners.
In that case, Apple stated to the media that the safety of the cloud had not been compromised, but did not investigate how users had lost their accounts.
Russian Prime Minister Dmitria Medvedev has also been arrested on Twitter.
If the abusers had access to iCloud as described above, a password could also be kept for the Government ' s head account in the microblogging service.
The Next Web resource could not get Apple's comments on the vulnerability in Find My Phone.
Putin granted Russian citizenship to Ukraine's five-year-old
Russian President Vladimir Putin granted Russian citizenship to a well-known Ukrainian athlete, Anne Burrak.
The relevant order was published on the legal information website.
At the beginning of this year, the sportsman moved to Russia for a permanent residence and asked the Federation to provide her with the opportunity to speak for the RF.
In 2013, she won two stages of the World Cup, won a silver medal in Europe's personal championship and became a world champion in a mixed stadium, which is one of the new types of sports programme.
It maintains leading positions in the current season.
Under the rules for the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, it will need a special authorization from the Ukrainian Olympic Committee.
Anna Burrak is not the first Ukrainian athlete to change nationality.
In July Vladimir Putin decided to issue a Russian chess passport to Ekaterine Lagno, a lion breeding, which is a two-time European champion (2005, 2008), peace on the twins (2010) and fast chess 2014.
The Ukrainian women's team was the winner of the chess Olympics in Turin (2006), the World Cup in Astana (2013) and the European Team Championship in Warsaw (2013).
SCR ceased the investigation of the Tu-204 disaster in Nukovo
The Russian Investigation Committee (RCC) has suspended the criminal case on the fact that the Tu-204 Red Wings aircraft crash.
This is reported by the department's press service.
The decision was taken in connection with the death of the commander of the aircraft and the Bortingener.
The judicial expertise has shown that the disaster has led to an increase in landing speed, failure to perform standard landing procedures by the crew, as well as an unintentional engine exit for increased direct traffic.
The Tu-204 Red Wings aircraft, following the Prague-Moscow flight, suffered a break on 29 December 2012, when they landed at the Moscow airport of Nukovo.
The aircraft flew outside the airfield and burned down.
At the scene, the commander of the aircraft, the second pilot, and the Bortingener were killed.
Two shipowners were delivered to medical facilities where the injuries were subsequently terminated.
Three other shipowners who were hospitalized with severe bodily injury have been treated for a long time.
In addition, the driver of the car, who was in the moment of the Kiev Show disaster, suffered serious bodily damage.
There were no passengers on board an aircraft.
After the disaster, the Transport Office carried out a review in Red Wings, which identified numerous violations.
The airline licence was suspended in February 2013.
The company resumed its work in the summer of 2013.
Alexander Emelijanenko started training at SIZO
A well-known Russian 33-year-old mixed-style fighter, Alexander Emelijanenko, who is in the CISO for sexual assault against a domestic worker, has been completely cured of the trauma and has started training.
That's what the Championship reports.
In May this year, the Russian Investigation Committee filed an indictment against Alexander Emelijanko.
The suspect was reported to have been searched, and on 9 May, he was detained in Tambov following a road accident that resulted in his hip fracture.
The Emelianko-younger was arrested before 31 August and the sentence was imposed on 1 September.
However, the court was transferred, and the investigation required an extension of the term of detention until 30 September.
If a sportsman's guilt is proved, he is threatened by imprisonment for up to six years.
What power, brother?
Lenta.ru remembers the most scandalous stories in Alexander Emelijanenko's career

Alexander is the youngest brother of Fedo Emelianenko's most famous fighter.
The final is a four-time world champion for mixed martial arts, a four-time world champion and a six-time Russian football champion.
Anger was the most universal and functional human emotion
A person's heart expression is biologically universal to mankind, and every organ and group of muscles involved in its creation is not accidental, but is an additional means of expression of power and threat, as scientists have identified Australia and the United States.
They told about their openings in the magazine Evolution and Human Behavior, and they can be read briefly in the press release of the University of California in Santa Barbara.
The angry expression of the faces - the curved and lowered brows, stretched in the thin line of the mouth, the broken noses - are the same in all cultures, and make it even blind from the birth of a child, never seen, notes the lead author of the Aaron Sell study.
As part of a major research project on the nature of anger, scientists have found that this emotion has arisen to deal effectively with conflicts during the conflict.
The more physical harm one person can inflict on another, the more he has the ability to dictate his circumstances, and he brings them to the interviewer with anger.
Researchers have found confirmations and another hypothesis: physically strong people are more likely to get angry and go to extremes, consider themselves entitled to impose conditions that are unfavourable to others, and prefer strong ways to resolve conflicts in a peaceful manner.
Apart from the fact that anger is primarily “a trade emotion”, scientists have decided that the movements of each of the seven groups of brains that create an angry expression should represent an angry individual more powerful and dangerous in the eyes of the interviewer, thus making it possible to agree with his or her conditions to avoid conflict as soon as possible.
To verify this hypothesis, the researchers modeled on a computer the person where each of the seven elements of the person was angry and showed them to the informants.
Although the bridges dropped or pushed ahead of the submarines did not do any harm to the individual, the human image with these designs was recognized by the stronger physical participants in the study as one.
As in animals, man's anger poses a threat: an exaggerated manifestation of his own power, forcing him to accept and obey.
A man blows his nose and swallows his lips for the same purpose as a bed that goes up, or a baby who shows off his fists.
“An anger “begins” by refusing to accept the situation of the interviewer, and the person immediately takes the form, most effectively demonstrating the consequences of the rejection by the opposing party.
But the most devastating is that none of the elements of an angry person is arbitrary, they all express the same," said anthropologist John Tuby.
Mincoms have proposed to allocate 250 million rubles to the Crimean Radio Company
Mincomlinks offered to allocate 250 million rubles from the federal budget of the autonomous non-commercial organization Teleradio company Crime in 2014.
This is reflected in the draft Government decision prepared by the department that has been consulted by Lenta.ru.
According to the explanatory note to the project, subsidies from the federal budget will be “to cover the creation of conditions for extensive information on the socio-economic situation and the development of the modern information space in the territory of the Republic of Crimea, including the acquisition of equipment”.
In particular, the dedicated money is intended to refurbish the studio block, the video screen, the central apparatus and the video server.
The acquisition of a mobile TV station and a satellite transmitter is also planned.
In addition, the company will pay for the use of the fiber optic line (WOLS) and the maintenance of the energy system.
Subsidies will be provided within the federal budget provided for by the Mincommission.
The Crimean State Broadcasting Company was established in 1959, delivering a message in seven languages: Ukrainian, Russian, Crimean, German, Greek, Bulgarian and Armenian.
To date, over 75 per cent of the territory of the peninsula is covered by a television signal from the radio company.
In 2011, the Crimean Television Company received a digital television license.
