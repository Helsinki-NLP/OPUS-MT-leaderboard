Wells Assembly is concerned about ‘mapping like a map’ themselves.
Several Assemblies are working hard to change their name to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This is the cause of the fear and the proposal to change the name of the Assemble to the Weiss Parliament.
Asembly members of various political groups are afraid to face up to this change.
A laber group member said his group thought that "the new topic was compatible with Twp and Pwp"
For readers outside Welsh: in Welsh, the meaning of Twp is stupid and the meaning of Pwp.
One Play Assembly member said that as a group they "do not rejoice" and suggested the option.
A member of the Welsh Konzervetiv Party said the group saw the change of name "open mind" but noted that there was little difference between MWP and the scale.
In other words, the expression of the Wess Wharn Wharkish is like the expression of the Yorkshire English U.S.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently implementing a decree for the change of name process, said: "The final decision on what will be described by Assembly members will certainly be taken by members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 allows Welsh Assemblies to change their names.
In June, the Commission published the results of a population where the proposal to change the name of Assembly has received considerable support for Welsh parliament.
Assembly members' credentials, the Commission is supporting Welsh Parliament member or WMP, but MWP has received the highest support in general.
Obviously, assembling members recommend different options, but it will be difficult to reach an agreement for the presiding officer, Ellen Jones, who has to collect money within a few weeks.
This reform rule will contain changes to the system of the assembly, which includes the disability of the members of the assembly and the design of the committee system.
Assemblies will be given the final opportunity to vote on what should be their name after the debate.
Macedonians are voting in a vote to change the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday to decide whether to change their country to northern Macedonia.
The popular vote is to avoid a decade-long struggle with the neighboring state of Greece, which has its own Macedonian province.
Athens has long claimed that its northern neighbour's name is a symbol of the establishment of claims on their territory and that is why the European Union and NATO have repeatedly called on members to apply.
Macedonian President George Ivanov, who opposes the change of name, said he would ignore the vote.
Although the supporters of the vote, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the change of name is only a necessary step for participation in the European Union and NATO.
St. Martin's fruit is still fresh in Harlem's churches
"The people I spoke to before said that historically there were churches and pansalas in each corner," Mr. Adams said.
"There's none of this today."
He says it's understandable that he's lost his mind.
Currently, "human social communication is different."
"Pants are no longer living in the area where everyone is on a regular basis."
As for the church, he thinks that the money that the sales sells will not go as long as the leaders think, "And today and tomorrow, they will go back to where they started."
He also said that apartment building and condominium could be built in church places where all people who will not help the rest of the area will live.
"Most of those who buy condominiums in all these buildings will be white," he said, "and so they will rush the day when these churches will be closed because most people who come to the condominium are less likely to be members of the church."
Harlem was established by both churches, the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and a decade later by St. Martins.
The Mul Shhetang Methodist Congregation left the church in 1930.
Nearly one agricultural congregation takes over the building.
A poor congregation of St. Martins, under the direction of Richard John Howard, who is leading a boy against the sellers at A Handred and Toenti Fift Street, which is the main street for Harlem Kanakar.
The building was badly damaged in a fire accident in 1939, but the Parisians of the Father's people planned to rebuild it, and they planned to build the carilon.
Rev. David Johnson, the son of the Father's and the heir to St. Martins proudly calls Carilon "the hour of the poor."
Last July, he called it something different: "A historical resource" and "an incomplete historical system."
According to expert Tifani Nyong, University of Michigan, it is the largest carilon in the world of a farm farmer’s environment, which was established 18 years ago by Bazan Dionio A. Lind, who was appointed to play the largest carilon in the Riverside Church.
Mr. Mariauder said St. Martins didn't replace him.
What happened in St. Martins last few months is a complex incident of the stand-up and decision-making by church leaders or Episcopal Dioceses.
Westry – the Parisian governing body, which was formed with the general leaders – expressed their concern last July that they thought that they would "transfer costs" from the Diocese West, even though the ban sent by Diocese and the decision-makers were not involved.
Some Parisian members accused of lack of transparency in the work of Diocese.
A 13 - year - old girl in California was injured in an attack by a gang after drowning to take a dog
A 13-year-old boy was injured in the attack on Hungary after the first day of the summer of Saturday, officials reported.
The incident of the attack near Ansinitas occurred seven mornings ago at the Biconium Beach.
Chad Hamel San Diego's KSWB TV tells her that she's going to go paddle there and help her get her out of the water when she drowns her friends for almost half an hour on Saturday morning.
Hamel said, first he thought that the boy was snorting at the pleasure of catching a golden ball, but then "you can understand that the boy was saying, 'I am stoned'!"
'He has crushed me!'
His throat was broken," Hamel said he could see the boy.
"I'm so excited to get out of the water for everyone: 'The water' adds Hamel.
The child is sent to a hospital where he is in serious condition.
The attackers did not know the Hungarians.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles reported that a shark was present in the area a few weeks ago, but it was not known as a dangerous breed.
Giles adds that the victim has suffered a serious injury to the upper part of his upper arm.
Officials from the Poto Beach of Casablanca banned access to the coast to Swami of Ensinitas for 48 hours in search of security.
Giles reports that there are more than 135 populations in Hungary, most of which are not dangerous.
Ensbaris is planning to enter the UK market
Sansbaris Boots, Superrag and Debenhams are going to compete as part of the department store's extensive business and business with specialist assistants.
As part of the United Kingdom's 2.8 billion pound model market, these large models will be launched in 11 national stores and will be launched in other markets if proven to be successful.
This investment comes in the form of a new way for supermarkets to find new ways to fill in the new features of TV, microwave and home furniture.
Sansbaris said it would double its amount by 300 feet, with the first of which will be the revolver, IG, Tweizerman and Doctor.
There will be a wide range of places that already exist, such as Larail, Mabelin and Berts, where there will be different places for brands like Butes.
The supermarket is launching its boutique makeup range to make most of the food Vigan Friendly – which has become very popular among young Croats.
On the other hand, the Perfume seller will run a food distribution test outside the Sansbaris shop, the first of which was launched last week in South London's Creed, and the second will be launched in the second part of the year after that.
On-line kanakata and eating in local Mudi stores means that supermarkets are trying to increase the population of Croatia.
Mike Coop, CEO of Ensbaris, says that the outlets should be viewed as a department store because supermarket chains are competing with shops such as Aldi and Lidl, and there will be more services and non-food.
Two years ago, Ansbaris was selling Argos and Habitats Chain two hundred years ago and demanded that Argos Outlet be placed in a shop and opened up some Habitats, which increased Modi's food sales and made it more profitable to take over.
Prior efforts to expand the Supermarket and the Farmsy sector failed.
A joint project with the first Fik Boots in the 2000s was examined by Ensbaris, but the project was closed because of the conflict over how the profits from the company would be shared by the company.
Ensbaris is following the sale of the company's 281 companies by the owner of the company Lydes Farms, Selesio.
The company said that by adding a huge range of Skincaer brand, Lloyds would play a role in the project, including La Roshe Poze and Vissi in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hix, the commercial manager of Sansbaris, said: "We have changed our wheels to improve the environment for our creators.
We have also invested specifically in trained workers who will be present for advice.
Our brand ranges are designed to meet all kinds of needs, and because of the attractive environment and convenient location, we have now become a dependable model that will challenge the old ways of kanakater."
Peter Jones 'Fireshama' when he returned from the 11 million pounds deal
The TV presentation Halli Willowby Marx and Spencer and the ITV to focus on his new deal with Dragons Dan's star with the lifestyle brand of Peter Jones in Peter Jones's "firework"
There's no time in Willoby's hand for their home supplies and their accompanying brand truly.
Gyneth Paltro's Goop brand is compared to this pair's business.
This morning's representative, 37, reported his departure in Instagram.
Halli Willoby Dragons Dan's star angered Peter Jones by reversing their attractive Lifestyle Brand business in the last minute – aimed at focusing on his new pump deal with Marx and Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones's golden daughter admitted to a meeting in Marlo of his commercial empire in Bakinghamshaer on Tuesday that she had no time for her new unit – worth up to 1.5 million pounds – for her home supplies and follow-up brand trolley.
The business was compared to the Gyneth Paltro Goop brand and expected to double the amount of 11 million pounds in Wilobir.
Willoby, 37, after reporting his departure from Truly in Instagram, Jones left Britain on the jet plane for his holiday home.
One source states: "Truli has so far been at the top of the list of oil priorities.
It was part of its long-term future plan that would meet its economic needs for the next few decades.
The decision to withdraw has surprised everyone.
No one could believe the events that took place on Tuesday, the project was about to begin very soon.
There's an old stuff in Marlo's office that's ready for sale."
Experts believe that the presence of Deis Marning, one of the most dependable stars in Britain, could result in the company's millions of pounds being lost because they have already invested heavily in food such as furniture, clothing and household items, and could be added to this damage.
And that could be the reason for a long day's friendship.
The mother of three children, Willoby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, were close to the cape for a decade.
Willoby started with Cap Truly in 2016 and joined Jones in March 52.
There are 40 percent shares of Jones's TV company and Baldwin's TV show together in Jugladesh.
Willoby Amands will be the Brand Ambassador and will represent Aunt McPartlin as the representative of the I.I.A. Celibrite event.
Jones' closest source last night said, "We will not comment on his business lenden."
Complex discussion 'and after we fall in love'
He laughed, saying that he had a positive attitude about North Korea's leader and that after making a comment some people would call him "a non-President. "
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump calls his friend "the news representative" in a voice.
"I didn't give up."
He said that he was interested in meeting Kim the second time after his first meeting in Singapore in June, and that Trump called for their first meeting to be a huge step towards the establishment of North Korea's temple.
But the dialogue of the Goddess is over.
More than three months after the Singapore summit, North Korea's head of the Democratic Republic of the Congo announced to the world leaders at the General Session of the United Nations on Saturday that North Korea could not see any "related reaction" in the United States to the exodus of North Korea.
While, he says, the U.S. has banned the use of pressure.
Trump expressed a more positive view when speaking to his Ali.
"We're in a good position with North Korea," he says.
"We were facing a war with North Korea.
Ten million people could have been killed.
Now we have a great relationship."
He claims that his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim have yielded positive results – which has led to the completion of the rocket tests, the release of prisoners, and the return of the remaining American workers to the country.
And he supported the unusual urge to talk about Kim.
"It's very easy to act as president, but this famous woman in Erina would have waited here for only 200 people," Trump said with his finger to ensure that she was in front of him.
In Indonesia, Sunami and Earthquake killed hundreds of people on an island that was devastated.
After the Lombk earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told that they did not need help.
Although more than 10 percent of people in Lombok were displaced, no national disaster was announced, a precondition for international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it very clear that they are not asking for international cooperation, so it is challenging," Mrs. Sambang said.
Although the Save The Children are gathering a group to go to Palu, it is not yet certain whether foreign workers can work in the field.
Mr. Sutopo, the head of the National Disaster Agency, said that Indonesian officials are assessing the situation of peace in order to determine whether foreign organisations will be allowed to participate immediately.
In view of Indonesia's regular earthquake, the country is also in a terrible position to deal with this kind of anger.
Although the Sunami refugee centre has been created, it is the same as the one seen in other marine areas.
The clear lack of security in Pulu, despite the state of alertness, may have affected life after death.
As time goes by, many islands in Indonesia are challenging.
The natural disaster communication system is more anticipating.
A ship hired by Lomba is going to a hospital to clean up the injured, but it will take at least three days to get to the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo of Indonesia kept the development of the giant infrastructure at the centre of his election campaign and invested a great deal of money in road and rail construction.
But before the re-election of the next year, the lack of investment has seized the government of Jokor.
Mr. Joko also feels pressured by the long-standing cultural excitement of Indonesia, where Muslim leaders have taken a more conservative life of their religion.
In a fight between Christians and Muslims, more than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands of people were homeless, killing two groups with guns, guns, and other wooden weapons.

"When I see the canteen coming forward, I'll give a note to a god and not think too much."
In 25 minutes of the game, the Belgian star Aden had moved to 1-0 ball in the Hof time.

The number of deaths in Indonesia’s tsunami has increased to 832
Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami deaths have increased in 832, the country's disaster management agency announced on Sunday morning.
Many people are said to be trapped in the destruction of the 7.5th earthquake, which caused damage last Friday and caused a 20-foot drought, the head of Sutopopur Nugroho announced at a conference.

Police suspect arrested a 32-year-old man in the case of the murder of a woman in Suryaqah
This morning, after the rescue of a woman in Barkenhead Mercside, a murder investigation was initiated.
A 44-year-old woman who was killed in Sukakha was found dead in the Grace Museum at 7 to 55 minutes of John Street, a 32-year-old man suspected of being arrested.
The police have invited the people of the area to make them aware of something they have seen or heard.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan says: 'The investigation is at an early stage, but I am asking any person who can see or hear any doubt about John Barkenhead's location.
I'm asking everyone, especially the taxi drivers, who may have any footage in the Dash Camera, to contact us because they may have information necessary for our investigation.'
A spokesperson for the police confirmed that the murdered woman Barkenhead was found inside a house and her body.
Friends today, who think this woman is familiar with them, ask where the woman's body was found this morning.
Investigations are under way, and police have reported that they are trying to inform women's neighbors.
When a taxi driver in Grace's mouse tries to get into his flat, the police tell him that no one is allowed to enter the building or get out of the building.
He's shocked to hear about the incident.
The residents of the building are told that it will take more than an hour to get them inside.
A police officer has been told to tell a man that the entire area is being held as a crime scene.
There was a woman in a state of shock at the scene.
He said, "It's very sad."
At 2:00 p.m., two vans of the police were inside the barricade and another van was outside the barricade.
A group of police officers were monitoring the fleets inside the barricade.
If anyone had any information, he was asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC directly or to call in 101 or to call 8800 555 11 on September 30th.
The new victim of the conflict with the statue of the Parliament's Chromewell's 'History Review'
His religion will remove this image after the destruction of many of the cultural and religious symbols of England's adherents.
But the Chromewell Society has announced Mr. Creek's advice as "insanity" and "an effort to re-write history".
Cromwell Society's president, John Goldsmith, said: "It was possible that the statue of Oliver Cromwell, located outside Westminster Palace, would become a symbol of the current removal of the image.
It has not been edited or edited by Cromwell's command to destroy icons or scenes during the battle of the English House.
In the previous century, his previous Thomas was going to dislodge the image of the wrong Chromewell.
Sir William Hamo Thornicroft's extraordinary image of the 19th century opinion and a part of a historical character that many people consider to be worthy of celebration.
Mr. Goldsmith said in the Sande Telegraph: "Many people consider Cromwell to be the protector of the parliament in the face of external pressure, in his case, against the pressure of the empire – which now had a lot of praise to the poor.
But it is part of the ongoing historical debate that is a complete picture of the time.
What is certain is that the 17th century conflict has shaped our nation's next development and Cromwell is a well-known character that represents one of the parties to this category.
His achievements as Lord's Protector are worthy of celebration and remembrance."
Killed by the black Chinese farmer
According to local news reports, a thirsty farmer was attacked in a South-West China market.
The man, who was only identified as "Yuan", was reported in a report from the South China-Guizo-based newspaper on Sunday South China Morning Post, which reported that he was found near a sugar market.
On May 30, 2005, a sugarcane in China's China Shining prepares the sugarcane for a sugarcane farm.
He came to the market from nearby Greece on Wednesday to sell 15 p.m.
The next morning, his brother-in-law met him dead and saw him opening the door of a brick wall next door.
He said there was a big man in Astala who had blood on his face.
A forensic test confirms that the weight of 550 pounds has been attacked by the farmer, reports the report.
"My mother's feet were two bleeding and injured," said Fupato brother who was identified as his son-in-law "U," quoted Guiang Evening News as saying.
The security camera's feet are visible in the market for 4 to 40 minutes on Thursday.
Almost an hour later, his body will be found.
The man who kills the man is not his brother or his cousin.
A manager of the market told Evining News that the police were collecting a plot on the scene and that the pig was detained separately so that it could not attack anyone else.
Ewan's family and business authorities are talking about determining the amount of damage to his death.
Although poor, there has already been an attack on the people of Sukh.
In 2016, a woman in Massachusetts attacked her husband and her husband with a blow to make him seriously hurt.
Ten years ago, a six hundred and fifty pounds of dry weight put the Xan Welsh farmer under pressure in his tractor until his wife came to scare him.
In 2012, after a farmer in Oregon had eaten his pig, Manitobar told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive but can serve as "trigger or exciting" for blood.
"They're just doing bad things.
They're tiny, very interesting animals... but they don't try to hurt anyone.
But you have to go through enough of them," he said.
The remains of Hariken Rosa will create heavy rains in the south-west across the United States
According to the forecast, Hurricane Rosa is weakening the power of the storm when it runs over the colder waters of the northern region of Mexico.
Although the next few days will result in heavy rains on Mexico's coast and on the south-west of the United States.
Today, on Saturday morning 5th, Russia was a 1-hectare category with a speed of 85 miles per hour, and Mexico’s Punta Ugenia was 385 miles south-west.
It's time to go to Rosa's north on Sunday.
On the other hand, the Pacific has begun to size a system and is heading east to the west coast of the United States. On Monday, Rosa Baha California will be hit by a storm and will lead to a deep rise in the north-west of the United States.
There will be up to 10 inches of rain in various parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, along with the system that is driven towards the deep cyanide, will create heavy rainfall in the south-west in the days ahead.
Locally, between 1 and 4 inches of rain will create dangerous flash floods or avalanches, floods of destruction, and possible earthquakes on the ground
Because of deep cyania, rainfall rates may range from 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in different parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In various parts of the Southwest, rain may be up to 2-4 inches, especially in most Arizona areas.
Flashing and very fast situation can be disrupted due to the rapid rate of the tsunami.
In the face of the threat of the Chinese rain, it would be very foolish to go out into the desert.
Heavy rains can make canyons a terrible river, and there will be a strong storm with dust.
The storm system will cause local heavy rains in various parts of the southern California area.
The amount of rain can be up to half an inch that can cause the glass to become a tiny stream of destruction in the streets.
It will be the first rainfall in the region in the rainy season.
On Sunday night and on Monday morning, there may be some scattered rains in Arizona, and then the rain will rise and spread all over the area from Monday night to Tuesday.
This heavy rain will arrive at the Four Corners on Tuesday and will continue until Wednesday.
In October, there may be a number of severe temperature changes in various parts of the United States, as the Arctic is getting colder, but the Chinese temperature is still very warm.
This sometimes shows dramatic changes in temperature between small distances.
A fine example of the dramatic change in temperature in the middle of the U.S. Sunday.
Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Mins, find a difference in temperature between about 20 degrees Ivor.
The next few days will try to increase and spread the heat of the summer.
In the middle of the U.S. and most of the eastern part of the region, there is a temperature of 80 in the area from the south east to the north.
On Tuesday, New York City could reach a temperature of 80 degrees, more than an average temperature of 10 degrees.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates that in the first half of October, there is a much more likely than average temperatures in the United States.
Brett Cavern heard more than 20 million people.
Cristin Blaji Ford, who charged the Supreme Court with the election of Bret Kavana and her sexual assault, saw more than 20 million viewers on the television network last Thursday in the 1980s.
On the other hand, political opposition continues, due to the remarkable Friday's final moment, broadcasters have suspended the regular event: an agreement by Senator Jeff Flick of Arizona that will be given a week for the investigation of the FBI's allegations.
Ford's Senate Judiciary Committee tells him that he's 100% sure that Kavana will hand over to his body in a high school drinking party and try to open up his clothes.
Kavana says in a sensitive witness that she is one hundred sure it didn't happen.
It is possible that Nielsen's report saw this program of more than 20.4 million viewers on Friday.
The company was accounting for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, fax news channels and MSNBC viewers.
Other networks that broadcast the program were not supported with the number of viewers, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fax Business Networks.
And Nielsen is usually in trouble with the quality of the visitors in the office.
The number of viewers for the program was equal to those of the Play of the Academy.
Fox News Channel, who strongly supported the selection of the Cavena, attracted the largest audience on the network, with an average of 5.69 million viewers, Nielsen.
ABC was in second place with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS saw 3.1 million, NBC saw 2.94 million, MSNBC saw 2.89 million, and CNN saw 2.52 million, Nilsen.
After hearing the story, there was a lot of interest.
Flack was in the center of the stage today.
After giving his statement to the cabinet, the Republican office of the Middle Republic was arrested in the Chamber of CNN and CBS on Friday morning, when he was on his way to the hearing of the jury committee and the protesters shouted for him.
He stood in the face of protestors for a few minutes, which was broadcast directly by CNN.
"I'm standing right in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think Kavana is telling the truth to the country?
He's told, "You have the power when many women are in trouble."
Flack says his office made a statement and said before the elevator was closed there was something else to tell him in the committee hearing.
Later, when the sessional committee votes for the entire Senate's election, all cables and communication networks are broadcast directly.
But Flack says he will vote on the condition that the FBI will investigate charges against an elected person next week, whose request was made by a few democrats.
His conversation with the Democratic Senator Chris Kohn has been partly influenced by his friend after Feck's resignation.
After speaking to Kun, Flick spoke to several other senators and made his decision.
Flake's decision was flawed because it was clear that there was no vote to approve the Cabinet except for the investigation by the Republicans.
An FBI investigation has been initiated on the basis of a complaint against President Trump Cavena.
British Prime Minister May complained about the break of the reviewers 'political game'
In an interview with Sande Times, Prime Minister Teresa May of the European Union accused critics of abandoning her plans for the future of Britain's "political game" and of ignoring the nation's character.
On September 29, 2018, British Prime Minister Teresa May was present at the Conservative Conference in Burmingham, Britain.
On the first page of the paper, his former foreign minister Boris Johnson Brexit continued to review his so-called Chekers' plan for May, saying that Britain and the European Union are "completely impenetrable" to collect each other's empire.
Wade Sims Shooting: Police suspect Denton Simpson was arrested at the death of the LSU player
The LSU's 20-year-old basketball player was arrested by the police for killing a suspect.
Twenty-year-old Dayton Simpson was arrested for second degree murder, Baton Russ Police Department reported.
The authorities published a video of the distribution between Sims and Sims and the police reported that his eyes were lost during the time of Sims Maramari.
The police released the mirror from the scene and reported that the Simpson DNA was found in the Simpson DN, a WAFB associate of CBS.
After defeating Simpson, the police reported that he had committed suicide by shooting Wade.
According to the Advocket's report, his Jamin is set to $350,000.
An initial report by the East Baton-Ruz Research Office on Friday was published to indicate the risk of gunshots being hit in the head and neck.
The department is grateful for the task force, the State Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police and the local population to help investigate the causes of the attack.
LSU's athletic director Joe Aleva thanked the law-enforcement organization for its "austerity effort and the establishment of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
This six-foot six-inch high foreword baton was raised in Rue, where her father played basketball as Wayne and LSU.
Last season he scored 5.6 points per game and 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, LSU's basketball coach Will Wade said that the party was "suffering" and "killing" at the death of Wade.
"It's a matter of concern for all time," Wade says.
In Mexico City, there is an increase in fuel consumption.
Vostm from Popocatepelt Agnegiri has reached the southern part of Mexico's capital.
The increase in gas-fired face and the amount of gas and gas generated on the 183th scale has warned Mexican citizens to stay away from gas from the national disaster centre on Saturday.
The center was monitoring more fertilization and tear.
Photo from social media shows that the vehicle’s van leaves fall in areas such as Josimilco, Mexico City, in Windsild.

The gas industry known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
In front of the calendar of freedom of vote, Catalan clashes with disbanders
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, while they joined the protestors for the first year of the campaign, focusing on Catalonia's freedom of choice.
A group of face-to-face discontinuing policemen beat the dams for them, and hit the powders of color, causing the streets to create black clouds that are usually filled with tourists' communities.
The next day, Marmario will be arrested by the police.
For a few hours, freemen "I won't forget, I won't forgive," protestors in the slogans faced the same supporters who called the slogan "Span Long Live."
14 people are taking medication for minor injuries because of protests, local news media.
After the announcement of Madrid Bayini on October 1st by the disbanded Catalans, there is an excitement in the area of freedom of expression.
The majority of the voters vote on their own freedom, although the number of votes was low because most of the population voted against divorce.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 100 people were killed in a deadly conflict with the police during the polls that were going through the area last year.
Freemen were on the street all Friday night to stop the national police from showing themselves.
Protesters continue their activities but have to go on different roads.
68-year-old Narcissus Termis, a power worker with his wife who participated in the protests of disunityists, says he is not hopeful about the benefits of Catalonia's freedom.
"Last year was one of the best times in our lives.
I've seen my father's eyes get water to vote, but now we're trapped," he says.
Despite the important but complex victory in the regional elections last December, Catalan freedom groups have fought to maintain their momentum, where many of their well-known leaders are waiting for their freedom to be released or detained in their role in the declaration of freedom.
A 42-year-old mechanic Joan Puig, who is recording the protest on his phone in support of the police, said that both sides' politicians created this opposition.
He added, "The day is getting tougher."
Not in pre-trial prison on Saturday, one of the Catalan leaders announced last year that he would take part in the European Parliament election.

Three men, 33, 34 and 39 years of age, were arrested after being hit by a car in a house in London.
On Thursday in Bangladesh, the event took place in the Balinagard Criscent in 1930.

At some point in the car, it's probably going to cross and explode.
Menger's race against Rangers wins the 1-0 range in Livingstone.
The first round of Dolly Menger is confirmed by Livingston.
In 18 games, Stephen Gerard won a second victory as the manager of the Ibrax Club, as well as the successful Livingston Rangers.
The Dolly Menger has created a gap as Gary Holt's team has made a second round with the Hibernians.
As a result, Gerard's team went off the premiership without winning any aircraft in the weather, and on Sunday they will face the hearts that have gone eight points ahead.
Earlier on Thursday, the European League of Rangers will admire the Epidition of Vienna.
Livingston, the race for their independence in the division has already increased by six games, but the main Koch Holt was not able to enjoy losing last month.
Livingston misses a number of opportunities against their unprovoked opponents.
Many years ago, they had to move on to join the Holt team because their aggressive attitude created all kinds of problems for the Rangers!
Scott Robinson's defenses went on but failed to achieve his efforts, so Alan Lithgo can only run his efforts via the videos after he has joined the Craig Hallcat header.
The guests on the set dog may have a problem knowing that the hosts were putting the Rangers in front of them.
And that's the important goal of the project.
The Rangers consided a freeskirt and opened a livingston ball shop, which assembled to set up Deklan Galagar and Robinson Menga, which had rolled from the centre of a taxi box.
At this point, the Rangers had authority, but they knew the defense of the guests as a difference, and the bulletproof Lyam Kali has long since made sense.
This series continued in the second half, even though Alfredo Morlos took a shot at Kelly.
Scott Pittman was taken to the foot of Alan McGrigo by Rangers and won another set of pizzas for Livingston from Lithgo Way.
The cruises came in the Livingston Box and became clear all the time, even though two panels were required -- alternative Glen Middleton after the Hallet Challenge and Handball.
'Incredible' Livingston-analysis
Alsadier Lamont Tony McKerney at Arina, the BBC Scotland
Livingston is a great match and result.
To any person, they were poor, they continued to leave everyone's hopes at their own pace.
After returning to the top level, their game type and player have changed very little, but gratitude has to go to Holt for the way he united the group.
He had a lot of nephews.
Captain Halket was great, created a poorly organized defense, and always kept Menga Cone Goldson and Joe Waral.
Even though the rangers were less inspired.
As they were doing well under Gerard, they lost that value.
Their final ball was missing - only once they opened the guests - and this is a warning for Rangers, who are now at the table.
Erdogan Colony Got Mixtures
On Saturday (September 29th), the leaders of Turkey and Germany were very happy to meet for Brexit in Berlin.
This is the last day of the German trip to President Erdogan's debate - which is aimed at restoring relations between NATO partners.
They are discussing human rights, freedom of the press and participation in Turkish law.
After Erdogan, he traveled to Kolon for a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police have protected 2,500 people from joining the mosques, but many supporters have come to see their president.
Hundreds of opposition protesters - many of whom were Kurdish - heard their voice condemning the two decisions to welcome him to the country in Erdogan's policy and in Germany.
This protest proves that a spectator is praised by the German Turks as a goat and condemned by others as a ruler.

Hariken Roza Phoenix, Las Vegas, Saltlake City is threatening the Arctic rainforest.
The crisis in Arizona in the winter subcontinent occurred, but the first week after it seemed that it would be the same when Hurricane Roza South-West was exposed to its remaining force with the threat of aerial rainstorm.
South and East Nevada, South-East California and Utah, FINIX, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Saltlake City, have already launched Flash Flow Watch in the cities of Western Arizona for Som and Tuesday.
Rosa is expected to reach the end of the month with rain, directly and on Tuesday.
In a tweet by the National Weather Minister of Phoenix, only "the ten-synthetic storms have remained in the summer of 1950 between 200 miles of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was one of the 40 miles across the Jed border."
The latest model of the National Haricen Centre provides a forecast of rainfall of 2-4 inches, which may be up to 6 inches apart.
In other areas of the South-West Mediterranean, with central Rockies and Great Basin, there is the possibility of rain up to 1 to 2 inches, which may be up to 4 inches apart.
The rains of a rainstorm can be a blessing to people at risk because the areas are devastated
Although the forest is a very serious concern, some of this rainfall may be of benefit to the south-west.
According to U.S. survey, more than 40 percent of Arizona is suffering from severe drought, as the second highest category.
First, the Hurricane Rosa route will take place along the California island of Baja in Mexico.
Rosa, who is still a powerful Harican, is heading north from Mexico’s Ponta Eugenia to a maximum of 85 miles in the morning, and every 12 miles in the morning.
The storm is driving cold water into the Pacific.
So on Monday afternoons or evenings, we expect to experience a global earthquake in Mexico.
Mexico may have heavy rainfall, which poses a significant risk to the forest.
"From Baja California, there is the possibility of rain in the north-west Sonora to 10 inches"
Then Rosa will travel north along Mexico as a Greece low before arriving at the Arizona border on Tuesday morning, and it will enter the south of Arizona on Tuesday night
"Roza or the expected major danger since the end is the heavy rainfall of Baja California, the North-West Sonora and the South-West of the United States," according to the National Hariken Center.
As a result of this rainfall, deadly natural and destructive floods and floods in the Mediterranean can be caused by earthquakes in the region.

In Indonesia's earthquake, hundreds of deaths in Sunami, toll increases are being witnessed.
On the island of Sulaoc, Indonesia, at least 384 people were killed at sea level during a major earthquake and tsunami disaster, and many reported that there was a flood on Saturday.
A few thousand people were gathered at the beachside in Palu on Friday, when six meters (18 feet) of water broke down in the middle of the night, causing many people to die and destroy everything on the road."
Sunami comes after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"At the time of the tsunami threat yesterday, people continued their activities on the sea side and those who could not run immediately and became victims of it," BNPbi's spokesperson for BNP, Sutopo, who said in a briefing in Nugroho Jakarta.
"Sunami didn't come from itself, it took all the cars, logs, homes, it hit all the things on the ground," Nugroho also says, Sunami traveled 800 kilometres (497 miles) on the open sea before being hit.
Some people rose up to live from Shunammy, and they also survived.
Nearly 16,700 people have been taken to 24 places.
The photos of many buildings and shops have been destroyed, the buildings have been overturned and destroyed, and a museum has been demolished.
The aftershocks continue to live in the sub-city on Saturday.
The Earthquake Series was felt by 2.4 million people in the entire area.
In a statement by the Indonesian agency For The Assement and Application (BPIT), the power released by the Great Earthquake on Friday was nearly 200 qualities in the Hiroshima of World War II.
The city's geographical location, which is at the end of a long, salty sea, can increase the size of Sunami
Nugroho described the damage as "backer" saying that a few thousand homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels have been broken down.
He also said that there are 5400 injured and 29 missing."
Nugroho said that the incident and damage could be even greater in an area close to the center of the earthquake, over 300 kilometres (1990 miles) from Palu.
The communication said "no information has been complete" Nougroho.
There are more than 30,000 people living there, "Red Cross made a statement, and added that workers and volunteers are going to the affected area."
"It's already a tragedy, but it could be worse."
The agency was greatly criticized for not giving this information to Sunami Palu, even though officials said that there were rumors when the alerts came.
A person on the top of the building at the foot of the cupboard shared in social media has been shown to turn people down the street to hear the warning of Sunami.
In a few minutes, the water is hit by a muddy stream, and the building and the car are blown away.
The Reuters could not immediately authenticate.
Earthquakes and tsunamis have led to a power revolution that decomposes communications around the river and impedes the speed of recovery of the authorities.

Doseba also says, "They saw many homes destroyed there."
It's a pity.
Even when relief teams began their disaster relief efforts, some complained that foreign aid workers were being hampered by a lot of skills.
Indonesia's law says, "From abroad, food supplies and workers will be able to arrive when a disaster is declared national disaster area."
But it hasn't been announced yet.
Aulia Aryani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross, said, "It's still a country disaster."
"If the government once said yes, it is a national disaster" we could start international aid, but no announcement has yet been received.

Cain West: This appar has changed its name.
Ro Apper Cain West is changing his name.
With the announcement of this change, he wrote on Saturday: "The officially known Cain West."
West, 41, was also known for some time as Yee and he used his name as his successor.
His presence in Satarde's Night Life was revealed earlier, where he hoped to discover his new album Yandi.
The event was replaced by Gáika Ariana Grande, who cancelled the event "for emotional reasons".
The West has already said that the word is religious, in addition to the short name of his current professional.
At the beginning of the West year, radio operator Big Boy said when discussing the title of album, "I believe that 'yes' is the most used word of the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'.
"I'll be you, I'm us, that's us.
Cain says that, which means only people, it reflects our good, bad, our confusion, everything.
This album is more of a reflection of our identity."
He's one of several famous apparitions who changed his name.
Sean Kombus is known as Paf Dadi, PD or DDi, but this year he announced that he prefers the name of the Brothers.
A former partner in the West, J.J., and Haifen, Hyfen, and the capital.
Mexico's MML has sworn not to use military forces against ordinary citizens.
Mexico's elected president, Andres Manuel Lopez, has sworn on the 50th anniversary of the bloody torture against students that he will not use military force against forced citizens.
Lopez Abrado pledged on Saturday at Tolateloko Plaza that "no military force will be used to oppress Mexicans."
On October 2, 1968, soldiers fired peaceful protests that killed 300 people while the left-wing student movement in Latin America was building a strong position.
Lopez Abrado apologizes to young Mexicans for their monthly education and other government colleges.
He said that the lack of opportunity for unemployment and education attracted young people to the crime scene.
The U.S. should be given double gifts in artificial wisdom.
China has become more active in nuclear intelligence, says the US and should double the cost of research in this area by researchers of nuclear intelligence and investors Kai-fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
This phrase came from various parts of the government, in the United States, announced that the United States has an official intellectual capacity.
China has already launched its new plan last year: to achieve a number 1 place in the development of artificial intelligence by 2030.
Lee adds, "A double-budget research will be a good start where most countries are far behind in this field and we are looking for the next step towards progress in artificial intelligence."
This week, it is said in an interview with C.N.B.C.L.
Lee, whose book "All Superpowers : "China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" is the main executive of Huton Miflin Harcourt, who has been involved in China's one of China's most central nuclear intelligence organizations, Facebook+.
In the 1980s, the University of Carnegie Melon was working on a generous intelligence system that defeated the top-ranking American player and was the CEO of Microsoft Research and the Chinese Google branch.
Lee has recognised the previous US government's technology competition, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Agency's Advanced Research Project, for the next step.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to win government contributions, Li says.
"China is not removing academic leaders; the corporations are giving," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology organizations have appointed educators from universities to work in practical wisdom.
Lee says that changes in immigration policies can help boost the U.S. AI's efforts.
"I think the Green Card should be offered to the HDD automatically," he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China launched its next generation of practical wisdom development plans.
China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to American researchers, such as the National Science Foundation and other government agencies, but there is a low value for academic work, says Lee.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defence has established a joint humanitarian research centre, which includes art and educators, and has announced the election committee's establishment on white house humanitarian intelligence.
And this month, DRPA announced 2 billion dollars of investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As a NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, the U.S. law did not see any progress in trying to establish a National Security Commission on Human Wisdom within a few months.
Macedonians vote to change the country's name
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted in a vote to change their name to "republic of northern Macedonia", a step that would resolve the decades-old conflict with Greece that impeded the European Union and NATO's efforts to gain membership.
Greece, where there is a region of Macedonia, represented its northern neighbours by a claim to its territory and voted against the entry of NATO and the European Union.
The two governments have signed a new name in June, but nationalist opponents believe that this change will undermine the ethnic identity of the major Macedonian population.
President George Ivanov said that he would not vote in the vote and doubted whether the minimum 50 percent of Tarn Output required to be valid for the public vote in the campaign would be met.
The question at the poll was: "You are for NATO and the members of the European Union, with agreement with Greece."
Supporters for the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, have argued that the European Union and NATO countries from the fall of Yugoslavia should be part of one of the most Macedonian countries.
"I have come to vote for young people in Macedonia today in order to live independently in the shadow of the European Union because it means a safe life for all of us," 79-year-old Olivers said in Skopje.
While the law is not mandatory, enough members of the parliament say they will follow the vote by decision.
Two-thirds of Parliament's majority is required to rename.
The Kingdom Elections Commission said there was no news about Nagad Najam this afternoon.
However, 34 percent of the 2016 National Parliament elections voted only 16 percent, when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I have come to vote for my children, we have seats in Europe," said Joselle Tenevski, a voter in the capital of Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Jorica and his son Dushko voted to change the country's name in Macedonia, which will open the way for NATO and European Union membership in Macedonia on 30 September, 2018.
In front of the Skopje Parliament, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardakv prepared a small stage and chaired the tabloids to set up those who would vote.
"We are on the side of NATO and the European Union, but we don't want to join our heads with the service door," Kavardrav said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can go to others like China and Russia and be part of the Euro-Asian setting."
Prime Minister Zayev said that NATO will make the necessary investments in Macedonia, where unemployment rates are more than 20 percent.
"I believe the vast majority will be because more than 80 percent of our citizens are European Union and NATO," Jaev said after he gave his ballot.
He said a "yes" will result in our "verification of the future."
The Macedonian Institute for Police Research said in a poll published last Monday that 30 to 43 percent of the votes required for the Turnout vote would be cast.
Another poll conducted by the Macedonian Telma TV is planned to vote 57% of respondents on Sunday.
70 percent said they would vote yes.
More than 50% of the votes need to be voted in order to be successful.
The failure to vote last May will represent the first deadly attack on the Western candidate government since its accession to power.
See: For Sargio Aguaero, Manchester City, enter the entire Briton defense
In the history of Manchester, England's Manchester Stadium, Joe Briton defens Sergio Aguaro and Rhehim Starling, between the city of Manchester and the city of Manchester.
Aguaro made it easier to see his score in the 65th minute.
At the beginning of the Sequence, Argentina striker took a pass in midfield.
He ran through three Briton Defenders before he went to the open field.
Aguaero was then surrounded by four green Jerseys.
Before leaving a number of others at the edge of the Briton Box, he turned to a defender.
Then he pushed a step to the left to find the starling.
The English foreword uses its first touch to return the Balt to Aguaro, who defeated Briton's protector Matthew Ryan and shot his right arm at the right side of the river.
"Aguaero is struggling with some problems at his feet," the City Manager told reporters Pep Gardiola.
"We've been talking about his game for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he's got a bullet in that moment."
However, Sterling gave Sky Blouse the primary advantage of the primary league.
That bullet came in 29 minutes.
Aguaero found the bottom of the Briton area in the game.
He sent a beautiful path on the left side of Liray sent the ball to Sen.
Sene took a few toes before taking Starling to the remote post.
Sky Blues tapped the ball in the yard just before leaving the border.
In the group of the City Champions League, Hophenheim will fight in the Rain-Neker-Arena, Germany, on Tuesday afternoon at 12:55.
Sherger Spylar wants to play Rocky's game
After removing the Nationals from the playoff debate, there was little reason to force anyone else to start.
But he is hoping to take a stand against Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if the L. West has a playoff against Los Angeles Djars on Sunday.
On Friday night, Rockis won a 5-2 match against the Nationals, but they still want to win their first division title.
"If we don't play for anything, at least we can get to Rabbar about the audiences of Denver that Abu and the other group may be facing me this year at the top of any point.
Why don't I want to compete in it?"
The Nationals have not yet been able to announce a starter for Sunday, but it is said that sherjear can be hunted in such a situation.
Sherger, who will begin his 34th time, released a Bulgarian session on Thursday and will play in his normal restaurant on Sunday.
In the spring of 220 2/3 inches, Washington's right hand was 18-7 with 2.53 IU and 300 strokes.
Trumpet assembly in western Virginia
In the middle elections, the president strongly stressed the importance of the Republican vote in the situation around Bret Kavana, who was elected to his Supreme Court.
"All we've done is in danger of November.
Five weeks from the most important election in our lives.
It's a big, big -- I'm not running, but I'm really running, so I'm all around fighting for the poor candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You see this horror of the Democrats, the Addictal Group of the Terror, you see it happening now.
And they're strong enough to use any means they need to regain power, you see this low, high quality.
They're hitting, they're going to get power and control, they don't give anything, they just want power and control, we won't give it to them."
He said the democrats are on the mission of "resistance and obstruction".
"And you've seen that for the past four days," he says, "democratics have been called "angrily and low and precious and unfaithful."
He called on the name of Dian Finstein of the Senate's Department of Justice, who received high-titting from the viewers.
"Do you remember his answer?
Have you lost the argument?
Oh, oh, what.
No, no, I'm waiting - it was really bad body language – the worst body language I've ever seen."
Leber is no longer a free organization.
Those who think they're in the face are not tolerated here.
When the members of the Momentum Party in my area blamed me for voting, it was not surprising.
Because your heart will not be welcomed here by the nature of your speech – I was the last leber of the list to tell you.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan was treated in the same way because he stood firm against Judaism.
As far as I'm concerned, I've been blamed for messing with Jeremy Corbin.
The importance of a responsible economic policy, Europe and national security, and similar issues, which were not agreed with the former leaders of Jeremy.
For Friday's Ntingham East Laber meeting, it was said in a note that "we want to make meetings inclusive and productive."
As a local lab MP in my eight years, this first Friday night's GSI meeting was exactly the same.
Sadly, however, today, it is not the Sunday of that meeting and the promise of "mildness and mildness" policy has been forgotten for a long time, if ever it begins.
It has become increasingly apparent that differences in the book party are not tolerated and that it is acceptable for group leadership.
After Jeremy became the leader, it began that I thought with my colleagues that I was declaring the same political outlook they were hoping to take the Internet to me and say that I would not be in any position - whether it is national security or Io one market.
Whenever I speak in public – and even if I don’t have anything to say – there’s a call for me to get rid of social media, condemn the policy of the centre, and tell me that I shouldn’t be at the Leber party.
And it's not just my unique experience.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments I have made are also political.
I am surprised to see all the colleagues who face a storm of racial or racial discrimination on the basis of sex, but I am never ashamed to see their professionalism and their designs.
The most disappointing aspect of this era of politics is how Galagali's disability has become normal.
Jeremy Corbin claimed last week that the Leber Party should develop a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer a free organization and that every "unlawful" vote or election rule is aggravating the group.
For the past two years, I've been giving advice to keep my head down, not so much talk and I'll be "right"
But I came to politics not to do this.
When I joined Lebar as a school student 32 years ago, we were raised by the abandonment of the Thakar government, which literally destroyed the categories of our extended school, I tried to provide the necessary government services – whether as a local council member or as a government minister.
I haven't kept my politics under control in the last few days with the last election.
No one in the Ntingham East was in any way confused about my policy position and the areas of conflict with current leadership.
For those who preached this Friday, I will only say that when the country is moving towards a brigade that will damage the family, business institutions and our communities, I cannot understand the intention of violating my time and strength by showing loyalty to the leader of the Leber Party.
But I really don't have a message for the Ntingham Momentum, whether it's a member of my constituency or not: I'm proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of injustice or political urgency will prevent me from doing what I believe to all of you.

Ir 38-17 Melrose: Rise at the head of the undamaged ir
Two efforts can reduce the gap between the final results in time, but there is no doubt that this day's great entertainment talent was worth winning.
They are now at the top of the table, the only group in ten.
In the end, it was their best defense, just as it was their ability to take the opportunity, which helped the party win and gave them the right reason to be happy.
"We've been tested in every game so far and we're still defeated, so I have to be happy."
Melrose's rabbin Christy said: "Irre needs credit, they've made their chances more workable than we have."
In the 14th minute of Grant Anderson's attempt, the Frezier Klimo transformed the air into a yellow card from Rury Hughes, Scotland's player, who expelled him from the game by Waryers, made Melrose a majority, and tried Jason Baggot a failure.
At the Klimo Panel, the iron led to an increase, just before, in the time of hafttime, he turned into a 17-5 break in a single attempt.
Melrose, however, took a good start and tried Patrick Anderson, transformed by bagot into five points of space.
Then, for a long time to hit the serious hit of the Ruarid Nott, which has become a stretcher and has gone on much further after the game has started again, through the efforts of Stefan McDoval, which has been transformed by Klimo.
The heavy-duty president of Ayre's Blue McFarson then took a yellow card and ended up with another player at Melrose's Bruce Colvain's attempt to Ayre.
Even though the welcoming Ra is coming back right, and when Struan Hachinson sees the yellow card to confront Klimo without telling him, he pushes off the channel line to get off the MacFerson touchdown.
Again Klimo converts, Kyle Roo, when David Armstrong's box of kicks bagladeba and sent Gregor Henri out to the fifth attempt on Home Side.

'The sea is ours': on the ground, Bolivia hopes that the Court will open the way to the Pacific Sea again

The memory of Haran is still clear to Chile in a 20th-century blood fund in Bolivia – and the urge to travel again to the Pacific Sea.
These expectations are probably highest in several decades, because Bolivia is awaiting the International Court of Justice's ruling on 1 October after five years' discussion.
"Bolivia has the speed, unity and normal consciousness and we are sure to expect results with positive outlook," said Bolivia's co-political Roberto Calzadila.
Many Bolivian ICZ will see large screens across the country, hoping that the hag's tribunal Bolivian claim will be forced to discuss a sovereign outlet on the sea after a few decades of appropriate discussions.
Ivo Morales, Bolivia's Carishmatic Native President - who will face a debate fight next year to re-election - also depends on his decision on Monday.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised toward the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that it is not possible to take decisions on the part of the courts - and if so, it will only change slightly.
The United Nations based in the Netherlands does not have the ability to land Chile and says they will not determine the possible outcome of the discussion.
The final argument that ICJ's ruling will be heard only six months later suggests that the case "was not complicated," said Chilean expert in international law in the Jeret.
And it can go back over the past four years more than bringing the cause of Bolivia.
"The issue of access to the sea has been undermined by the current Bolivian administration," Jerette said.
Morals's speech against war has highlighted Chile's enthusiasm for the good news.
Bolivia and Chile may continue to speak for a while, but then it will be very difficult to discuss.
The two countries haven't been able to exchange the state since 1962.
The Bolivian representative of the Hague, former President Edwardo Radrigez Veltzi, rejected the unusual speed of the decision.
On Monday, Bolivia's "an extraordinary opportunity for a new era about Chile" and "to settle the 139 years of conflict with each other."
Kalzadila also denied that Morales - still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America - is using Merithim Isuti as a political figure.
"Bolivia will never give up access to the Pacific," he adds.
"It's a chance to see that our past must be cut."
North Korea said nuclear disarmament will not come until the United States believes it.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ree Yong Ho said that if Washington could not believe it, his nation would not first disarm the nuclear weapons.
He made a statement at the United Nations General Session on Saturday.
He called on the United States to comply with the promise made at a summit in Singapore by rival leaders.
His comments come when US Foreign Minister Mike seems to be on the way to relaunching the horrid dialogue more than three months later in Singapore with North Korea.
Rey says it's a "pipe dream" that will continue the bans and threaten North Korea's rise to the end of the Korean war.
Washington warns that Pyongyang may agree with this announcement without first making significant decommissioning.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump both wanted a second convention.
However, there is great doubt that Pyongyang sees Syria as the only way to secure its security.
Pompey wants to go to Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Tramp meeting.
Paris Fashion Shows publishes the last line of large headway on a high street near you
You don't have to see if you want to add or block your hat.
Designer Valentino and Thom Brown Ranwei have published a series of Oversized Head Shows for their SS19 collection in Paris Fashion Week.
In the summer, very unusual toppies were released into the Instagram and these designers sent their eyes to Katwa.
Valentino's first creation was an over-the-top beez top that was decorated with a wide-ranging cloth that covered the models.
Overcrowded towers among other Overcrowded inhabitants, including the top of a wizard, are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Brown also published a selection of the envelopes – and for Halloween at the right time.
Many of the colored faces were like the Hanibal reader in comparison to the horrendous jokes.
A creature with snorkel and Googles is similar to the full Scouba Diveing gier, while the other ice cream is similar.
And if you continue the big fashion statement - you're lucky.
Style watchers predict that large bets can reach you on high street.
The outsight hats compete for La Bombay, a two-foot cross-sectioned candace hat that is visible from Ryana to Emily Ratazkovski.
Calt label has created another major piece of social media that has been spread around the top of a very unusual carpet - a street beach bag that is almost the same as the silken model.
Paris Fashion Wike Jackimas La Riverer's SS19 bag was the only one to cut with Rafia Fring and with a white leather handle at the top.
Celebrity Stylist Luke Armitage Fimme said: 'I hope that the big hats and special bags will arrive on the high street in the next summer - because the designers have so much impact, it will be difficult to ignore the needs of the oversized family.'
John Edward: Language skills required for the world’s citizens
The free schools in Scotland have played a record of academic excellence, and this has continued a further limited test in 2018, which is strengthened by personal and joint success in playing, art, music and other communities.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIs), try to provide their students and parents with the best level of service.
Lonely schools aim to prepare for their place as their chosen profession and world citizens for higher and higher education.
As an educational area that can be designed and applied in a special school, we see modern language in schools continue as a popular and popular subject.
Nelson Mandela says: "If you speak to someone in a language he means it's going to happen to him.
If you speak to him in your own language, that will be in his heart."
It is a powerful sign that we cannot rely only on English if we want to establish relations and trust with people from other countries.
As a result of this year's recent testing, we can see that languages are at the top of the league tables with the highest cross-sections in the single school.
A total of 68 percent of foreign-language students have achieved a higher degree.
According to data from the 74 member schools of SCS, 72 percent of students in Mandarin have achieved a higher degree when 72 percent of German students, 69 percent of French students and 63 percent of Spanish students have achieved this.
It proves that Scotland's independent schools support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Language now, as a matter of preference, the single school's textbooks and other STM topics (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).
A 2014 review of the Commission for Emplement and Skills shows that 17 percent of employers are responsible for the loss of skills they have given to their employers to fight zero.
More and more, language skills are becoming essential to prepare young people for their future careers.
These skills are needed in the world around the world to provide more opportunities for action.
Anyone who chooses a career, if they learn second language, will have the real benefit of gaining their lifelong skills in the future.
A multilingual person is automatically able to communicate directly with foreign people.
In 2013, according to Ugov, more than 4,000 adults in the EU, 75 percent could not speak well in any foreign language during the conversation, and 15 percent of the French-language languages were the only language of the decade.
This is why it is important for children today to invest in language learning.
More languages, especially the languages of the developing economy, will give children a better opportunity to find a decent place to work.
In Scotland, each school will be divided into the languages taught by them.
A number of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will be considered to be the most important languages for Uk, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest in, there will always be many languages to choose from in private schools, including specialized teachers.
The Scottish Single Schools are requested to provide an educational environment that will prepare children and create them with the necessary skills to be successful in the future.
In the global business environment, it cannot be denied that languages play an important role in the country's future, so it should be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be regarded as "the ability to communicate internationally."
Lonely schools will give this preference, variety and emphasis to young people in Scotland.
You need to do it.
John Edward is the manager of the Scottish Council of Independent School.
Lebron will reveal himself in Sunday Laker in San Diego
Lebron James is almost finished waiting for the fans to start their first trip as Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers Couch Luke Walton announced that in San Diego, Prince Oppenar James, against Denver Nagets on Sunday.
However, the number of minutes to play is not yet set.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lex's rapporteur, Mike Trudel, tweeted that James would probably play a limited minute.
After this week's training, James was asked about his plans for the first six-game of Lakers.
"I don't need my favorite game to get ready for my career," he said.
While Ellie is in West Virginia, on YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump has blown the campaign meeting tonight in West Virginia.
This was the first at five summits in a friendly place with Tennessee and Mississippi, with stop-to-stop.
The purpose of the Supreme Court is to create support for the mid-term elections, as the Republicans are in danger of losing control of the Congress after the vote in November.
What is the time for the West Virginia convention tonight, and how do you view it online?
Trump's Wheeling, West Virginia's meeting is scheduled for 7th night, tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can see the West Virginia convention below on YouTube live stream.
Trump is likely to comment on the hearing of the Supreme Court's selected candidate Brett Cavenar this week, which has emerged from the allegations of sexual abuse by an expected signature during the FBI investigation.
However, the primary goal of encouraging these meetings is to help the Republic to achieve some speed in the face of November's election.
Thus, President Trump's campaign said the following week that the five Ali's aim was "to strengthen volunteers and supporters, as the Republicans are trying to protect and expand their majority under the Senate and its representatives," Reuters said.
"Congress control is so important to his agenda that we will travel as much as possible to the government as we can, with our involvement in the campaign," said a campaign advocate of Trump Reuters.
For Wesbenko Arenas in Wheeling, today's conference "Can bring supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and can bring coverage from Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
From last month on, like the second time in Saturday, Trump traveled to West Virginia, where he won more than 40 percent in 2016.
In front of the Trump election, the western Virginia Republican Senate is trying to help Patrick Morrisik, who is behind.
According to Reuters, West Virginia University politician Simon Hadar said, "It is not very good for Morris to try to encourage him in the election," he said.
Ryder Cap 2018: Team USA shows the hunger for war to keep the hope alive on Sunday.
At the end of the three-month session, this rider was needed for the evening of Saturday.
Momentum Pendulum's doll is a completely invented game idea, but players really believe it, and most of all in this national competition.
So where are they going to say the moment?
"One of them had a six-point lead and now it's four, so I think we have a few moments now," Jordan Smith said to go for the day.
Europe's benefits, of course, are four points ahead of the remaining 12 games.
As Spith said, Americans think they have some help on their way and can be encouraged by a lot of things, especially by Spith and Justin Thomas, who have played together every day and they have taken three out of four points.
Spyth was deadly from the beginning to the end and was leading from the front.
With his rounds, he was stronger when he and Thomas were behind two points after scored two, and took the four-point full-point score match as important as taking over.
He got the same scream as the match he won on the 15th, which tells you so much he believes that the American team isn't out of it.
"You really have to go deep and think about your game," Spith said.
Each of these players now exists.
18 halls to mark one.
More points have been found in two days than in Spith and Thomas, only Francesco Molinari and Tommy Flitwood, the judge's judgment of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but obedient couple in Europe can't make four or four mistakes.
"Molywood" was the only couple who didn't shoot any bogies on Saturday afternoon, but they were avoiding bogies on Saturday morning, Friday evening and Friday morning.
The race, and their strength, seemed to be moving towards and out of this exciting crowd, that they were the winner of Sunday, and that with the sunset in the Gulf, there was no more popular player than to win the European victory without flitwood or millinary.
It's good if both of them are in different caves at the same time.
Even though European glory has been spoken of for a long time.
While he was dating Alex Norren, Bobba Watson and Web Simpson had a problem for Forebol Nayak Sergio Garcia in the morning.
In the first night, a bogie and two double Spaniards and Sweden were thrown into a cave from which they could never get up.
On Sunday, though, there's no one to get you out of your grave.
The interaction between the two sides is very attractive because of what they recommend, what they do not recommend, and what can be changed suddenly because of the force and the closeness of the forum.
Europe has so far played well as a team and has taken an important lead on the final day, but this forum session has further shown that there is a hunger for the fight by team U.S. which was particularly suspected by the statesside.
Europe 10-6 led on the final day of the Ryder Cup
On the final day of the Ryder Cup, the Forum and the Forum will take Europe's health care with 10-6 countries against the United States.
The encouraged Tommy Fleetwood and Francisco Molinari have now taken their Taliban to four points against Tiger Woods twice.
Thomas Jørn's European team, two years ago, is calling for the recovery of the lost trophy in Hazeltin, and has won the wrong American side in the morning's Forebols and won the series 3-1.
America offers more resistance to win two matches, but they can't complete the defeat.
In order to restore the trophy, it takes eight points from the 12th single match of Jim Forik's team.
Tana Four Points Fleetwood is the first European Rocky and he and millinary, together with "Millewood" a remarkable week in the history of Ryder Cup from the first four months.
Woods and Patrick Reed were stabbed to death in the Forebol, and then the U.S. Rucky Brixon Decambiu was forced to defeat more heavily by 5 and 4 superbly jailed.
On Saturday, two months later, he was able to bring a storm of light on his own back, but now he has lost 19 matches and seven Tanas between his forebible and Forsam's 29th.
Justin Rose, taking a break for tomorrow's forum, returns to Henry Stanson in Forsam, Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koopkar's 2 and 1 defeats - one and three numbers from the world.
In the south-west of Paris, though it was not on its own on the day of the wind.
The three-time winner Jordan Smith and Justin Thomas set the stage for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won 2 and 1 strong defeats of the Spanish Zone Ram and Ian Polter in Forrbol and returned to defeating Harre Poltar and Rury Maclery 4 and 3.
In the history of Ryder Cup, only two times a group has returned from four points of defeat, even though it is now only necessary to recover the Furic side's trophy.
After being the second best for two days, however, on Sunday's change, it seems to be leaving them.
North Korea said 'how' would not be desecrated without faith.
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the existing ban is deepening the mistrust of the United States and that there is no way of leaving their country's nuclear weapons together in this national situation.
At the annual general session of the World Organisation, Rey Yong Ho said that North Korea took significant positive steps last year to stop nuclear testing, break the nuclear examiner, and promise not to increase nuclear technology and nuclear weapons."
"Then we didn't see any similar reactions in the United States."
"If there is no confidence in the United States, we will have no confidence in our national security, and there is no way to separate ourselves from us in this national situation."
Although Re described North Korea's "leveled" method of demobilization against South Korea's allegations that North Korea will be rewarded for slow action in North Korea, his speech was clear because he did not allow the demobilization of people to go away in the same way because Pyongyang had done so in the past.
In June 12th, Kim Jong On and Donald Tramp issued a joint statement at the first meeting of the President of the United States of America and North Korea in Singapore, when Kim promised to work with the "Permanent Disengagement of Korea's Sub-Islandes" and when Trump guaranteed security in North Korea.
North Korea is looking for the official end of the 1950-53 Korean war, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first abandon his nuclear weapons.
Washington's call for severe international bans on North Korea has also been rejected.
"America has stressed the "disarmation-first" and has increased pressure by bans to achieve their goal with coercion, even protesting the declaration of the end of the war." Rey said.
"The bans can interfere with our Earth's only dream of those who don't know about us.
However, the problem is that the continued ban is deepening our disbelief."
There was no comment on the plan of the second summit between Rey Kim and Trump, which was first highlighted in the United States Prime Minister's week.
Instead of Minister Mohday, Kim and South Korean leader Mun Jain said three meetings last five months: "If this issue of disarmament were to be South Korea without the United States, it would not have been so difficult to eradicate the Korean Islands."
However, Rei's speech was not so dramatic since last year when he told the U.N. to the general public that America's main continent was being targeted by North Korean rockets when "Mr. Evil President" called Trump Kim "Racket Man".
In spite of this year's nationwide, Trump threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea last year, he praised Kim for his courage in taking action on disarmament, but said that there was still much work to be done and the bans would have to be lifted until North Korea was set up.
Wednesday Trump said there was no time limit for it, he said, "If it takes two years, three months or five months - nothing will happen."
China and Russia argued that Pyongyang should be rewarded for the steps taken by the U.N. Security Council
However, the U.S. Secretary of State Mike has also told the Americans that Thursday's Security Council: "The Security Council's prohibitions must continue effectively until we fully understand the fully verified disarmament."
The restrictions on North Korea have increased since 2006.
The general newspaper of the United Nations of Pompeii met with Rye in Esemblei and then said he would go back to Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second assembly.
Pompey has already traveled North Korea three times this year, but his last trip is not good.
When he left Pyongyang in July, he said that some progress had been made, only a few hours before North Korea condemned him to "claim like Gunda"!
North Korea promised to break a missile site and a nuclear complex to meet with Mun this month if the United States accepted "reform."
He said that Kim was looking for the "specific steps" that he was looking for was the security he provided in Trump Singapore and was moving towards normalising his relationship with Washington.
Harvard students are taking sufficient rest.
This year, Harvard University's new course "Cafine-Zbalani" is turning all of its dancers into more sleepers for the further development of the "night's wake-up" of the student's culture.
One scholar discovered that a number of university students in the world are often confused about how to take care of themselves.
Harvard Medical School's Medical School has established this course, which he believes is the first in the United States.
After giving a talk on the impact of the lack of sleep in school, he was moved to start the course.
‘ At last, a girl came to me and said, ‘ Why is this so much said to me that I came to my senior year? ’
He said that anyone who never told him about the importance of sleeping - what surprised me, 'he told the telegraph.
This course, which began this year for the first time, explains how students can improve their sleep patterns in academic and athletic performance and how they need to improve their general health.
Dr. Edward Medical School's senior health teacher and head of the university's health department, Paul Bareira, said students decided to start the course after they had been seriously asleep during the week.
There's a few related tasks in the long course for an hour.
In one section, there are images of a student room where students click on coffee, screen, trainers and books to know about the effects of caffeine and light and how it is affected by the loss of athletic performance and the importance of a Bedtime routine.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer
A map of the campus with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
'We know it won't change the behavior of students immediately
However, we believe that they have the right to know - as you decide to eat your cigarettes, but also the health effects, 'professor Sicilian added.
He said there is still a culture of pride of "sarat" and he said more, a growing problem of sleeping because of the increasing pressure on modern technology and students.
To make sure you sleep well enough, a teacher should be a 'secret weapon' in order to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, he says -- even making the head of the sleep unhappily, making them hungry."
19-year-old Raymond So, who studied chemical and physical biology in California, helped Professor Sziler design the course, also took a class at Harvard last year.
He said the course opened his eyes and gave him inspiration for a campus-wide course.
In the next step, he hopes that all senior students will be asked to complete a study program before participating in the competition.
Professor Sysil recommended that students should consider setting an alarm for when to go to bed and when to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of the 'Blue Light' produced by the Vidration Screen and Elyde Light, which may destroy your Circedian sun, thus causing the problem of falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: The defeat of the hunters of Mangar Golir Gerard.
The Dolly Menger team, Steven Gerard, was defeated between 1 and 0 by the Yellow Team at Livingston, and the Rangers saw another plane match.
After 4-1 rounds in St. John's Day in February, Ibrax's team had another victory, but Gary Holt's team won the second Gerard defeat on March 18th, which took him to the top of the Leadbrok to be the hearts of eight points away.
Menga was hit seven minutes ago by Haf-time, but hopeful Rangers lineup could never beat them.
Rangers have now gone down to sixth place, Livingston has gone up to third place, and the goal is to turn the Haberian behind.
And there may be more problems for Rangers because Lineman Calam Spence has to be treated for damage to the head for any items that are attached to the plane.
The Gerard group has changed eight that took the top to the Betfrid Cup semifinal.
Holt, on the other hand, went along with the same Liv 11 who took a point from Harts last week and was proud of how his clever team shook the enemy.
The Rangers may have the authority, but Livingston has done more than they have.
Mengar's first Le-of Alan McGrigger shot Scott Pittman in just two minutes, but the midfielder had ruined his big shot.
One of the long-term free-kicking presidents of the Kahhan Jakobs had received HALKET, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgo was only able to tell the back post.
The Rangers re-established control of the button, but the final string had more hope than they believed in.
Alfredo Morlos certainly felt that he and Steven Lollès should have found his panel in the Quartet-Awar because of the conflict, but the rapporteur, Steven Thomson, answered the Colombian request.
The Rangers can only target two shots of the first century, but the previous IBROX guard Liam Kali Lasana Kulibali's head and OV Ajaria's shot had little trouble.
Liver's 34-minute incentive was probably against the flow of the game, but no one can deny that they alone are the owner of their design.
Again, the Rangers Jacobs failed to complete the Deep Set-Pis.
The decan galagar Scott Robinsons did not respond to Scott Arfield's voice, and he kept his head cool to choose Menga for general finance.
Gerard took a break with Ray Cant to replace Kulibali and it was almost working together because the Winger was in Morles, but the amazing Kelly took him off the line.
Livingston viewers, however, were just beginning to play with the kind of game they had long played after Lithog and halkett had long played.
Holt's team could have continued their lead to the final stage, but McGregor's efforts to destroy Jacobs had stopped before heading from Litho Korner.
With Jacquebs, Thomason again turned his face to the substitute of the Rangers who claimed to have lat panels.
Almanac: Discovery of the Gigagar counter.
And now a page of our "Sande Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago... when physicist Johannes Wilhelm was born in Germany in the future.
A method for the detection and measurement of Google blood is a discovery known to the last time as Google counter.
Since then, a major foundation of science has also become the main foundation of a pop culture in Gigagar County, in 1950 at the "Bels of Kernado" film, possibly Kapok scientist Ray Rogers and Del Evans:
Man: "What's this again?"
Rogers: "It's a Google counter, such as Urenium, used to identify blood mines.
When you answer these calls, you can hear the effects of blood pressure on the mines."
Evans: "What does that sound like?"
A few days before his 63rd birthday, Hans Giagar died in 1945
But his famous discovery is still alive.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the detection of weakened cells to the immune system.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to detect and kill the affected cells.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to detect impaired cells as part of the treatment
The method includes removing anti-inflammatory cells and changing them in the lab.
Then they can see a simple protein for cancer and then reintroduce.
An experimental vaccine has shown amazing results with cancer patients.
A woman who is being treated with vaccine, who teaches the immune system to identify the affected cells, has been invisible for more than 18 months.
The method is to take the anti-inflammatory cells, test them to see the normal protein of many HER2 cancers and then reintroduce the cells.
J. Burfsky, head of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "Brest, Dimbassy, Fusfus and Colorectal Cancer Increases Cancer, Professor Barzfsky explains.
The removal of the disease-resistant cells outside the patient and the "how to target cancer cells" has also been used to "train" them in a similar way.
Kanye West SNLE joined the pro-tramp debate after a MAGA hat
It's not good.
Kani West was hit by a bad performance during a Saturday night live in a studio where he praised US President Donald Trump for staying in sleep in 2020.
After performing his third night song in Ghost Town, where he had a Mac America Great Cap, he condemned the Democrats and reiterated his support for the Trump.
"Sometimes when I talk to a white person, they say, "How do you like Trump, he's a writer?"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I'd come out of America a long time ago," he said.
The SNL Matt Demon opened the show with a sketch where the Hollywood star, Christian Blaji Ford, had fun at the jury committee of the Senate to witness the Bret Caven.
Although it has not been disseminated, the West's television football player, Chris Rock, uploaded to the social media.
It's not clear if the West has tried to laugh at the rock post.
In addition, the West accused listeners of having to take him through his head to backstage.
"They put me in the backstage.
They said, 'Don't go out later on.'
They kicked me!
And then they said I'm in a dive, according to the Washington Examiner.
West also says, "Do you want to see the place?" He says he'll get his "superman cap, because it means you can't tell me what to do."
Then try with love."
His comments were repeated twice from the viewer, and the members of the SNL cast felt upset, the Varyite said, where a person told the publication that "the whole studio had five hundred silences."
The West was chosen as an alternative to the Ariana Grand, whose former lover, Appar Macmilla, died a few days ago.
The West I Love It sings around like a periphery bottle that deceives many.
West Protective Group TPUSA has received support from the lead Canadian Turner, who tweeted: "Thank you for standing up against the abusers."
However, the Tokyo representative Karen Hunter tweeted that the West was "and she was so poor."
"Then I chose not to reward someone (who buys his music or clothes or who supports his "art") who is playing and spreading a harmful role in my community.
He's free.
And so did we," he added.
Prior to the show, this apper announced on Twitter that he changed his name and is now "officially known as Canye West."
D is not the first artist who changed his name and followed his path, known as Paf Dad, Pafi and P Dad.
Another contemporary apper, Snoop Doug, was Snoop Lion and must have changed his name to a character known as the Prince.

Game of Thrones Star Kit Harington attacked toxic masculinity or poisoned humanity.
Kit Hartington H.H.V. is known for his military role in the medieval fantasy serial game of the Thrones.
However, 31-year-old actor Macho Nayak said about the stereotype of the stereotype on the screen that this national role means that small children are thought to be hard when they get respect.
She believed that when she spoke to Sande Times Kalchar, she said 'Something is wrong' and asked how she could cope with the problem of toxic massculinity in #MeToo.

'What did we teach them when men were grown up that we are now facing this problem?'
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity for its very male characteristics.
He also said, 'What's easy and what do we learn?
What do TV and street education teach children to follow this particular path if they are men?
I think it's really the greatest question of this time - how do we change it?
That is because there has indeed been a great error in the young men .
In the interview, he admitted more that when the next summer the series will be new, he will not do any game of thrones either casual or sequential, he said he ended his life 'warfield and horses'

HIV/AIDS: China's new developments have raised 14%.
China has reported an increase of 14% in HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820 000 people in the country, said Helth officials.
The second quarter of 2018 alone reported nearly 40,000 new events.
Most of the new cases were due to sexual assault, which has changed since.
Traditionally, HIV is rapidly spreading to different parts of China in order to kill HIV.
However, the number of people infected with HIV has been nearly zero, China's Helth officers said at a conference in the country of Greece.
Although the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 per year.
A serious problem with HIV-attacking China's LGBT community through sexuality.
In 1997, China was allowed to have a monopoly, but LGBT is still considered to be a project against people.
Because of the country's conservative values, it is estimated that between 70 and 90% of men have sexual relations with men, they later marry women.
Many people come from inadequate sexual protection in this regard.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged public access to HIV as part of its efforts to combat this problem.
Maxine Waters Rejects Zipp Senators, 'Variable Lies' and 'Tool Entities'
On Saturday, the U.S. Republican Maxin Waters denied the claim that one of his employees posted personal information on the website of the three Republican U.S. senators.
The Los Angeles Democrat strongly claimed that these claims are being disseminated by the "Altra-Rite Wing" education and websites.
"False, lie and more hate lies," Waters tweeted.
The published information tells us that US senators are home address and phone number, and that the senator, Graham in South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch, both U.S.
This information was posted online on Thursday, an unknown person posted to the Capitol at the hearing of the Senate Panel on the charges of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court.
After questioning this three-sensor cabinet, it was just a moment ago.
Protective sites such as the Gateway and Redset reported that the IP address identified the post source was connected to the Waters office and reported on any members of the Waters staff.
"This baseless accusation is a complete lie and an absolute lie," Waters continues.
"Members of my staff - whose identity, personal information and security have been charged with this fraud and false accusations - were not responsible for the fraud.
This baseless accusation is a complete mistake and an outright lie."
Waters' statement on the fast White House's former press release Schib Ari Flasher has been criticized online.
"This denial is angry," Flasher wrote.
"It says he doesn't have the tendency to be a congressman.
They won't be angry when they're accused of something they didn't do.
Of course they won't argue.
They should certainly not be questioned about the purpose of the defendant.
Surely they shall be in peace and security.
Compared with the democrats' criticism of the judge's cabinet, the response of the Waters was felt very angry by the critics during Thursday's hearing.
The Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who is electing to appoint Waters in the middle elections, also posted his views on Twitter.
"If it's true, it's big," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his office warned "the relevant authorities and law enforcement organisations" about these deceptive claims.
"We will make sure that the criminals will be released," he continued, "and that any member of my staff and any member of my staff who is destructive and dangerous will be legally responsible for all their actions."
Johnny English Strikes Agent Review - Weak Ryan Atkinson Privacy
It is now traditional to see the Brexit effect in any new image with the British Triac, and it seems to be useful for the restoration of John's English-English Action-Comedy Spouf Francesiz - which began with John's English in 2003 and returned to John's English Ribern in 2011.
Clearly, how many garbage nations are we going to be able to make that self-controversial issue a new one?
At any turn, pop-student, rabbi-faced Johnny has a second-time license to create new things - his name suggests more than anything else that he is an extensive comic creature designed for the world of cinemas other than English.
He must have been a stupid secret representative who, despite the tremendous turn of events, contributed a note to the 2012 Olympic Springs of the Fire Theme Tune, a Dash of Mr. Bin and a Dolp of Chap in London.
He was basically based on the Traveller, and people of international secrecy, Atkinson, were acting on Barkcard TV ads that had been forgotten once, spreading confusion in science.
There's one or two bad times in this last game.
I liked to see John the Englishman come to a helicopter after the Middle Ages.
Atkinson's gift for physical entertainment is being shown, but chemistry has been very low and surprisingly highly felt, especially in 2007 and Mission Imposible "Syrias" film brand now offers as an element of self-confidence.
The joke seems to be aimed at children more than adults, and I have nothing to do with the strange happenings in John's English, such as Atkinson's silence-film jokes.
The topic base has been a major problem in Britain for many years.
A cyber hacker infiltrated the very secret web network of Britain, a small role to identify all British agents in the field, to discourage the responsible agent - unfortunately for Kevin Eld.
It's the last trust of a prime minister who has already experienced the full condemnation of politics, he's a weak and confined person: Emma Thompson has done his best with this semi-terresa character, but there's nothing more to do than to work on the script.
His research advisors tell him that every active secretor has been collected, so he has to get someone out of the way.
And it means calling Johni English, who is now appointed as a school teacher in some of the institutions, but teaches outside the record about how to become a student: there are some good jokes here because English is offering a school at the Rock-Type Academy in Goendagir.
For urgent briefings, English Whitehall returned and Ben Miller's assistant again met with his former long-suffering side-cau.
Bau is now a married person, married to a subordinate commander, a role of a jolly-haki-stick, in which Vicki Papardin has been abused.
Thus, when Batman and Robin returned to action to make a fatal mistake in the Magesty's Secret Service, Olga Curelenko's test came back to the woman's office, Ophelia Bulitover.
The prime minister of Carismetic Technology is already in danger of falling into billionaires, who claims that he will be able to solve the problems of British computers:
English and Bau begin their far-reaching high-jink sounds: they set fire to a flash French restaurant on the sidewalks of the Wetter; they push themselves into the volleyball boat and start to steal; and the virtual reality of the headset to get in touch with the inside of the English voltaire.
Of course, all stops have been drawn for the final order, but as many children's TVs as they are and are open, there are a number of children's TVs in the whole thing.
A lot of middle staff.
And I couldn't think of anything like the other Johnny English movies: British film artist Royan Atkinson can't play any role that really does justice to his performance?
Leber denies that it is planning to work four days a week for Britain, but will be paid for five days.
Geremi Corbin's lab party will consider a major plan that British workers will work four days a week - but will be paid for five days.
According to the report, the organization's owners will take part in a further day's holiday saving of workers through a creative intelligence (AI) revolution.
It will try to enjoy the three-day holiday of the workers - but it will still pay the same home.
According to sources, the idea will be 'fit' with the group's economic activity and the workers are planning to move the country.
Trade Union Congress has approved a four-week move to the labour market as a way to take the opportunity to change the economy.
A senior source of the Leber Party told The Sande Times: 'A policy is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
It won't happen at night but four days' workdays are a desire that fits the group's method of maintaining balance in economics beyond the work force .
The Green Party promised four days' workdays during its 2017 general election campaign to support this national idea.
The desire is not currently supported by the tree party, however.
A spokesperson at the Leber Party said: 'A four-day working day party is not a policy and is not considered by the group.'
Shado Chancellor John McDonald used last week's Labour Conference to express his views on a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonald said he was determined to give back power to the utility agencies from 'individual manager' and 'beneficiary'.
The current shareholders of the Shado Chancellor's plan for water funds can even get their entire share back because the labor government may 'distort' some of the wrong work.
He also confirmed the plan to keep employees on the organization board to give 10 per cent of the employees of the Bessocrates' organizations, including the owner's gift, whose annual salary amounted to $500.
In Lindsey Graham, tell John Kennedy "60 minutes" whether Kawana's investigation can change their mind
Judge Brett Kavana has been delaying the final vote on his vote on the complaint against the Supreme Court, and asked whether any Republican senator could be supported by the Bureau's investigations.
In an interview on Sunday, Scottish journalist "60 minutes" asked the Republican senators, John Kendy and Lindsey Graham, whether the FBI could find out what led them to change their mind.
Keddy was more open than his coworkers from South Carolina.
"I think, of course," Kennedy said.
"I told you to go to court, I said I spoke to Judge Kavana.
After the incident, I called him, and the charge came out, and I said, "Did you do this?"
Lo! he was a strong (man) of planner and a man of no strength.
Graham's vote, of course, seems unchangeable.
"My Bret Kavana has developed a mind and a very important accusation will need to be changed," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know it: Bret strongly denied it," said Christine Blacy ford, adding Graham.
"And what he said his name couldn't be checked.
It's 36 years old.
I can't see any new changes."
What has Global City Festival done and done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday will be a Global Sitting Festival, an annual music event that has a poor line-up of star performances and an equally spectacular mission; the world's poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival, Jeanette Jackson, Cardie B and Sean Mendes, will see only thousands of people turn around in the central park, not so, but raise awareness of the real end of the event of extreme poverty in the 1930s.
Global Cities Festival, which was described in 2012, is an extension of the global poverty project, which is an international campaign to increase the number of people who are actively engaged in fighting poverty eradication.
To get a free ticket for the event (if you don't want to pay for the VIP ticket), more work or "activities" of the Consertgoers, such as volunteering, e-mailing to a university, calling a phone or helping to raise awareness about their target in order to stay in another poverty.
How, though, did Global Cities succeed in achieving their goal for the next 12 years?
What real steps are being taken to encourage people to take action through a concert, or another case of the so-called "Clicktivism" - where people think they are really different by signing an online application or by sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has said that it has recorded more than 19 million "action" from its supporters, moving towards different goals.
It says that these actions have helped world leaders to declare more than 37 billion dollars of the same promise and principles that will affect the lives of 2.22 million people in the 1930s.
Towards the end of 2018, the group quoted 390 promises and announcements that began from its activities, with at least $10 billion already being distributed or donated.
The group is expected to have a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the main promises are the acquisition of neutrality, the participation of UK-based investors and implementing partners "to help children increase their full potential" and the commitment to provide Rwanda with 35 million dollars after more than 4,700 global sites have been received on Twitter.
"With the help of the United Kingdom government, donors, the national government and the Global Cities, we can make the social injustice of corruption the cornerstone of history," said Tracy Ulman to the public during a concert held in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 steps have been taken in the United States to improve mothers and children's nests, the government has announced funding for a project, which will reach 5 million women and children in the womb.
In answer to a frequently asked question on the website, "What do you think we can end the extreme poverty?"
Global Citation responded: "It will be a long and strong path - sometimes we will go down and fail.
However, like the great civil rights and anti-racial movements in front of us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeks, Sion Mandes, Cardy B, General Moni New York this year is one of those who will be performing Deborah-lie Farnes and Hue Jackman.
The U.S. Army can use firefighting rifles to stop the war.
In the Middle East, Washington can take refuge in its naval army in order to prevent Russian fires from arriving in the Middle East, according to the US Interior Inspector Schib Ryan Jink.
Jink complained that the Russian merger in Syria - markedly, where it works in the invitation of the legitimate government - was a shame to look around the new fuel market.
"I believe that their location in the East is the reason they want to power the Eastern Europe, the southern centre of Europe," he said.
And according to the authorities, there are ways and means to do this.
He said, "We have the ability of the United States to keep the sea free and, if necessary, to prevent their fires from being traded."
In the United States of America, Gink spoke for participants in the event by an unfavorable Conjugated Conjugation Group.
He referred to Russia and Iran in the same way, comparing them to Washington.
"Russia is referred to as a "holding cards in Athens" with an economy based on biogas," he said, "the less economic options of Iran and Russia are more profitable than the more fuel," he said.
Instead of the Trump administration in Russia, these statements are made when European customers are expected to be exposed to natural gas exports in many situations.
This is how President Donald Trump of the United States, with the authority of the Trump Administration, is trying to bring Germany back from the "unsuitable" North Stream 2 pipeline project, which he claims to have been imprisoned by Berlin Moscow."
Moscow Barbar stressed that the 11 billion-dollar North Stream 2 pipeline, which doubles the power of the existing pipeline, is ready to take 110 billion cubic meters - it is a fully financially-sponsored project.
Kremlin's argument is that the project is not just financial because of Washington's strong opposition, and this is an example of an unfair competition.
"I believe we agree that we can't use it as a tool of fire pressure and that we should be able to choose the suppliers of customers," Minister of the Russian Fire Department Alexander Novak said after a meeting with US Fire Minister Rick Peri in Moscow in September.
As a result of the situation in the United States, Germany has responded negatively, confirming its commitment to the German project.
In the field of art, the German Federation of German Industry (BDI) told the US to stay away from bilateral agreements between the European Union's fire policies and Berlin and Moscow.
"After the recent meeting between the German Chancellor Angela Markel and the Russian President Vladimir Putin of Germany's Federation of German Industries (BDI), Kampf said that our third-country intervention is a major problem.
Elizabeth Warren 2020's application for presidents "will be open," says Massachusetts Senator
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said on Saturday after the internal election, he will "openly see" the petition for the president's petition.
Warnen assures us that he is in the race when he is in a town in Massachusetts.
"The time has come for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government and include women in it," he says.
"After November 6th, I'll be very much named in the presidential contest."
Waren Town is saying that during the course of the race, President Donald Tromp is leading the country in the wrong direction.
"I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy," he said.
The Supreme Court of Warren Trump and the Supreme Court of Trump face the criticism of Bret Kavanawagh.
On Friday, Warren said in a tweet, "We need an FBI investigation before we vote."
In a review published on Thursday, Warren's majority of voters do not think he should fight in the 2020 elections.
The political research centre / Boston Globe of the Safok University said that six percent of Massachusetts's "possible" voters said they should not fight in the senator's vote.
Twenty percent supported the fight.
The review shows that the former Governor, the Devil Patrick, is more supportive of fighting in the vote, where 38 percent supported the possible war and 48% did not.
Other high profile democratic names that could be discussed during the 2020 vote include former vice president Joe Byden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
The Association Press announced that Byden would formally decide on January.
The whole palin Donald tramp quotes the PTSD of the track
The 26-year-old Track Palin cut off Iraq one year after the list was added in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and accused of internal violence
"He tells viewers at a Donald Trump convention in Oklahoma, "When my son comes back through which he is going through, I can understand the consequences of the other families that the PTSD and our soldiers are returning with."
Palin calls his arrest "home hand" and says about his son and other war-scientists that "they come back, they come back, they come back, they come back, they come back, they think that the army and the Air Force and other members of the army are being held accountable for what they gave them?"
He was arrested in Alskar Wasila on Monday, and according to Dan Bennet, a spokesperson of the police department, he was charged with family violence, arms and drug abuse.
18 The UK supports the challenge of a new security policy
Apostate U.S. and District of Colombia are supporting Iney Challenges against the new U.S. policy that refuse to protect victims fleeing gang or family violence.
NBC News reports that 18 representatives from the UK and the district of Washington have given a friend - or - the Court Brief on Friday to support a refugee who is challenging the policy.
The full name of the party in the Grace V. Sessions case, which was filed in August against the US Civil Liberties Union policy, was not published.
He said his associate "and his violent gang members" had beaten him, but US officials refused his asylum on July 20th.
He was arrested in Texas.
As an example of the supporters of Greece's states of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, many of them have faced the problem of gang and family violence, from which many seek refuge in the United States.
The new American Refugee Policy Migratory Appellate Board has reversed its 2014 decision to allow unregistered migrants to seek refuge for domestic violence.
The District of Colombia, Attorney General Carl Rezin, said in a statement Friday that the new policy "has ignored many decades of federal and international law."
Frend-Ob-Da- Court Brief says that "all refugees' requests under this federal law should be judged according to specific information and circumstances, and this national ban violates the basic purpose."
In the statement, the Attorneys argue that the policy of denying entry to immigrants has been undermined in the US economy because they are more likely to be motivated and "supply".
Attorney General Jeff's session orders that family violence and non-refugee victims who have escaped from gang violence are joined by immigration judges.
"The nation, religion, nationality or certain social group can be protected from oppression or fear for membership or political opinion of those who have left their country," she said in her policy announcement on June 11th.
The solution to all the problems - even all the deadly problems - that people face every day throughout the world has never been understood.
The death toll between the rescue efforts of the living and the death toll
The north was a terror to the survivors.
"The 35-year-old Risa Kusuma in the city of Palu said to provide comfort to his zealous child," it was very exciting."
"Every minute, there's an ambulence.
No clear water can be found."
In an attempt to save what can be found in the middle of the pool, the residents were returned to their homes for destruction.
Hundreds of people were injured and 7.5 injured in hospitals.
Some injured people with Dui Harris who broke their back and shoulders have been kept outside the Palu Army hospital and are being treated below the sky because of the next company.
While in the hotel room with the wife and the daughter, he cried to express his feelings of terrible earthquakes while he was in the hotel.
"There's no time to save themselves.
I was trapped in the middle of the broken wall, it seems," Harris told the media representative that they had come to the city for a wedding.
"I can hear my wife's cry for help, then calm down.
I don't know what happened to her or my kids.
I hope they're safe.
"Propaganda ad" brought charges against the U.S. state of China to "galaly"
A week after a four-page announcement of a U.S. newspaper, a Chinese government accused the US of using U.S. press to launch an intentional campaign against the U.S. state of Beijing.
Last Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump referred to the Peed supplement of the Chinese Daily Dees Mins Register and accused China of attempting to take action in the US Congress on 6 November.
Trump's accusation is that Beijing is trying to intervene in the US elections, which US officials call on Reuters to press China.
It is a natural event that the foreign government will announce for the promotion of trade, but Beijing and Washington have now descended into a trade war, which has led to an increase in shell imports.
Chinese and US experts say that China's vengeful shells, such as Iwa, were designed in the U.S. to harm refitanists who supported the Republic of Trump's party in the first place of the war.
Teri Branstad, a major agricultural farmer in China, says that Beijing has damaged US workers, farmers and businessmen.
According to a report in the Daes Mines Register of Branstad on Sunday, China "has now doubled its bias with our own intentional advertisements."
Branstad writes, "The Chinese government is taking the immoral advantage of US freedom of speech and free media in advertising money in the Dees Mines Register."
"Then you will find a limited voice in the streets of Beijing, and you will not see the real difference between the Chinese people's economic and economic pathways, because the media is in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party," he writes.
He also said that his paper "refused to print a major newspaper in China", although he did not mention the name of the newspaper.
Before the midterm debate in Kavanf, the Republicans wanted to keep women's voters away, the analysts warned.
Analysts have stood next to the Supreme Court's Brett Kavanf in the face of a number of allegations of multi-situ republican sexual assault and have warned that they will be able to see a response from women in the upcoming Mediterm election.
The issue has become increasingly intense and most Republicans are already looking forward to voting.
In a paper published on Saturday, Professor of State Science at Maxwell University, Siracuz, Grant Righ, told Hill, "It can't come back."
Richard says that he has doubts as to whether the pressure of Senator Jeff Flick (ar-Arisona) will calm angry voters in the final moment for the FB I investigation.
According to Washington Disi's magazine, former Movaon Group leader and national female spokesperson Karen Jean-Pierer said on Friday, "Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow and November."
Despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blaji Ford, the ruling section of the ruling committee on Kavanf's decision to move ahead with the decision of the Republican Republicans protestors at the Senate on Friday morning, "November!" said Mike.
"The neutral political analyst Stu Rothenburg told the site," democratic excitement and inspiration will be past.
"People are told there's already too much; that's true.
However, it may be more, especially among women in the city, and among young voters between 18 and 29 years of age, who often do not vote because they don't like the president."
Even before testifying to Ford's public allegations of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that if the Republicans proceed with approval, they could act as if they were going to do so.
"It has become a complex issue for the JOP," former chairman Michael Steel NBC News told the Republican National Committee the first week.
"It's not just the committee's vote or the final vote or the Kafonf, how the Republicans took it and how they used it," Prioritis U.S. told a group who helped the Democrats in the vote, their director, Gay Cecil News Channel.
However, in the face of the testimony of Fords and Kavanf, the Americans have felt somewhat different, and the next person has taken the view seriously.
A new Ugov review shows that 41 percent respondents are sure to believe the testimony of Ford, where 35 percent say they believe in Kavanf.
Moreover, 38 percent said that they thought Kavanf had probably lied at the time of his testimony, and only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After Flick's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the charges against Debora Ramirez, the Guardian's report.
Ford testified to the Justice Committee last week that he was married to Kavanf Nasha at the age of 17.
Ramirez accused him of having sex at a party when he was studying in the 1980s.
The World Wide Web designer plans to start a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook.
The World Wide Web’s designer team Burners-Le Facebook, Amazon and Google is starting to compete.
The latest project of this technology, Enrapt, is a company that will create Burners-Lire open source platform solids.
Solid users have the right to choose where their data will be stored and what information people can access.
In a private interview with Fast Company, Burners-Ley said the Inrapt's real goal was "world government".
"We have to do this now," he says about the start.
"It's a historic moment."
This app allows everyone to create P and D or "Personal Online Data Store" using solid technology.
It can include contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Lock and Spitify in the same browser and get it together.
This is a unique feature of personal online data storage that depends entirely on the user. Someone can access information of any kind.
The company called "personal power through the data."
According to Sio John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt will help all to gain the strength of resources, processes and skills.
The organization is currently setting up a security platform to buy Burners-Lei, Bruce, and IBM, with a group of contracted on-staff developers and volunteer encoders.
This week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own unfocused applications using tools available on the Inrapt website.
Burners-lie said he and his team "will make a complete change with Facebook and Google where their business model will be completely changed at night."
"We don't ask permission from them."
Burners-Ley wrote in a post on Saturday's media that the Inrapt "is foreign to protect the integrity and quality of the new web created on solids and to provide a facility"
In 1994, Burners-lie Massachusetts Institute of Technology set up a World Wide Web Consortium to make major changes to the Internet.
In the last few months, Burners-lie has been a strong voice in the debate about net neutrality.
Would Burners-Le World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute be the founder and director at the time of the launch?
"I'm impossible hopeful about this future age of the web," Burners-Lei added.
Bernard van: Victoria Cross's First War Clerical Celebration
The century of the city of Adi celebrates the only priest of the Church of England who won Victoria Cross during the first world war.
Lieutenant Colonel The Reverend Bernard Van won the award at the time of the 29 September attacks by Beneglis and Lehankot.
Whatever the case, he was killed four days later by a rebel and never knew that he had received the highest honor from the British military.
On Saturday in Northamptonshaer Russia, two of his ancestors discovered his memorial monument.
His nephew Michael Van says that it is "unbelievable" that his grandfather's key was revealed just 100 years later.
According to London Gaget, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van led his battalion through "the Great Cows and the Field and the Machine" during the de Saint-Quantin Canal.
He then went off the fireline and led the line with "Serbish Courage" and accompanied only one field song and struck three enemies.
Lieutenant Colonel Van Van on 4 October 1918 was killed by a German attack - just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Van, 72, says his grandfather's actions "something I could never do and terrible respect."
He and his brother, Dr. James Van Kuskawaz, have appointed a poet, led by the Brandud Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Van says, "I feel awfully honored about the part in Paris," and he adds, "The character of a real goat is shown in support of a lot of people."
M.M.'s hostages woke up all night to see 206 belots, but instead they got pepa Pyg.
Consider that you've woken up all night to see a great 206 dancer and the main event has not been shown.
There were 13 feet in the main card of the San José bill and live on channel 5 all night.
In the morning, when Gegard Mousaci and Rury McDonald were ready to face each other, the cover was turned into a pepa pag that threatened the viewers of the United Kingdom.
In particular, they were awake until the morning, so some people became angry.
On Twitter, a child abuser described it as "such disgusting jokes".
"According to the rules, it is not appropriate to show such events at 6 a.m. when they were forced to change their children's cartoons," said President Dave Shorez of Bellato in answer to the question.
"Peppa The Pig," yes.
Belato's president Scott Koker said that in the future he would work to create a timetable for future U.S. audiences.
"We may be able to solve it at the time of the raid," Koker said.
"Then we can't do this until Sunday morning, six o'clock, and we can't do it until Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when it's switched, a lot of messages came later and they weren't very friendly.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it might be a technological error.
But no, it was a government matter.
I promise it won't happen the next time.
We're going to cut it down to five files instead of six -- as we're usually used to -- and we're trying to add more fans.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Disc: Tom Delly has suffered "innocently" because of her sexuality.
The Olympic driver Tom Delley said that he was embarrassed when he grew up because of sexuality – but it gave him the inspiration to succeed.
This 24-year-old said he didn't go to high school until he didn't realize that "they're not like me."
When he spoke on the first 4 December Island radio presented by Lauren Lavern, he said he spoke about homosexual rights in the "hope" of others.
He also says that after the birth of the child, his thinking about his Olympic victory has diminished.
Christian Yong, the regular representative of the event, has been on vacation for several months because of his illness.
In Lavarna's first social event, Deli said he felt "small" more than anyone else, because "boys were not socially acceptable."
He said, “To this day, the feeling of being a little bit different has become a reality, which has given me the strength and strength to succeed.”
He said he wanted to prove himself "one thing" so that everyone would know about his sexuality so that everyone would not be disappointed.
Two times in the Olympics, Bronze candidate Victory has become a proclaimer of the high profile of LGBT and has been working in Australia to ask for more countries to acknowledge their solidarity in the Komunwelth game this year.
He said he opened his mouth because he thought he could live in public without difficulty and wanted to "hope" others.
This three-time World Championship says to read in love with a man -- American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, who appeared with him in 2013 -- "I was surprised."
Deli married the Oscar winner last year, who was 20 years older than he was, who said the age range was not a problem.
"When you're so young" -- he first went to the Olympics when he was 14 years old and his father died of cancer three years later -- he said that the elderly were hard to find someone who had just run away in life.
The couple gave birth to a boy named Robert Ree Black-Delli in June, and Delly says that his "full view" has changed.
He says, "If you asked me last year, I would say, 'I have to win a gold medal' that was my idea.
"The truth is, there's something bigger than the Olympic speaker.
Ruby is my Olympic harpist."
His son's name was his father Robert, who died in 2011 when he was 40 years old.
Dale says his father never admitted that he was going to die, and he finally asked whether his ticket was sure for London 2012 - because he wanted to stay in the first row.
"I never could say that 'you won't be in the first row anymore," he said.
"When his breath stopped, I held his hand and he gave up and died, and I didn't admit that he was indicted," he said.
The next year, Deli won the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
He says, "It was my whole life's dream to give my viewers a ride to the Olympics, and it doesn't make any sense."
It also inspired her first song -- the performance of Hidhar Small -- which was followed by her in the Olympic preparation and which is still tearing down her song.

You'll be sitting in the bank at the top of Michaelson's desk on Saturday.
American Phil Mikelson will make a record of his 47th Ryder Cup match on Sunday, but if he wants to not be lucky, he will have to return his form.
Michaelson, who has played a 12-year record on this two-year event, has been placed in the bank in exchange for Captain Jim Forik on Saturday and Forsam.
Instead of being at the center of the rally, which he was playing in the United States, this five-time major won day cut off the cheerleaders and was busy fixing his game in the range.
Not always available among drivers in the head of Korea, this 48-year-old title is not suitable for golf national courses, where long-range Raf is often disrupting long-range shots.
And if the course itself is not bad enough, Michaelson, 9th March, is faced by the British Open Championship Franco Molinari, who won four of them this week along with Ruki Tommy Fleetwood.
If Americans, who are four points down at the start of the 12 Singles match, can start well, Michaelson's match can be significant.
Forik showed her self-confidence, even though he didn't have much to say.
"Even today he understands his role, holds his hands on my shoulders and says he's ready for tomorrow."
"He has great self-confidence.
He's one of the world's most famous characters in the past, and he's given this team a lot this week.
I probably didn't think they'd play the game.
I was hoping more, but that's what happened and we were thinking about moving on like this.
He wants to be on the floor, just like everyone else."
On Sunday's game, Michaelson Nick Flanders will play the record of the most ryder cap game in the world.
It can pull the rider's cap into a car that doesn't even follow his personal record.
Michaelson has 18 wins, 20 installments, and seven bars, although Furik says his presence brings the team back to life.
"Even fun people, Amuda, smart people, love people to dance, stay in the team room and a great person," he says.
"I think the new players enjoyed playing with him, also this week, which is very good to see.
He only gives more than play."
The European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the great Lid may become invisible
Thomas Bjorn, a European captain, knows from experience that the last day of the Ryder Cup in Singles can lead to an unfavorable situation.
Dan's self-expression in 1997 in Valdarama, where Savi Balesteros's leading team received five points from the Americans, but only at the narrowest margin won the finish line at 141⁄2-1311⁄2.
"Keep in mind that there was our great lead in the dormant; there was our great lead in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in the dormant, where we won, but only in space," Bozrn said, in the picture, he was seen on Friday and yesterday two days at the Golf National in 2018 at 5-3 in the next 10-6 in the winning class.
History will show me and the team that it's not over yet.
We'll be with you tomorrow.
Go to the ground and do the right thing.
Not until the point has been raised on the board.
We have a target, it's trying to win the trophy, and that's where we'll have our eyes on the bird.
I've always said that I'm looking at 12 players in my team, but I'm very aware of who we are on the other side.
Bjorn adds, "I'm happy that our players have done the same thing in the hard golf course I've never believed in before.
Tomorrow's a different fight.
Tomorrow's personal performance will come, and it's a different thing.
When everything goes well, it's great to be with your partner, but when you're alone in the field, your ability as a golfer is fully tested.
This message needs to be reached for all the players, and the amount of time each player has to give.
Now, let your companion go ahead and bring her back the best of it."
Contrary to Bjorn, the opponent will be watching Jim Forik to make the players play as a team better personally, except for Jordan Smith and Justin Thomas, who have scored three points in four points.
In Europe's "Morning Miracles" as part of the winner's team in the War and Brooklyn, Furik has gained two experiences of the dramatic change in the last days.
He said, "I remember every word."
"Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but you want to get rid of Brooklyn and Madina quickly.
When the game is turned on, there is a lot of pressure in the middle of the game.
We're going to make lines like that and we're going to call the boys as we think we're going to do some magic tomorrow."
Paul Cassie, Justin Rose, John Ame, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Polttar have been given the responsibility of leading Thomas against the Europeans, who will face Rory Maclery at the game.
"I've arranged this group because I think it will cover everything," Bjorn says about his singles election.
Germany's new warship stopped again
Local news reported that Germany's newest ship to replace the warships of the former Cold Ages had to be launched in 2014, but not at least until the following year because of the wrong system and the use of Snoblingi.
According to the Die Jet newspaper, the first ship of the new Baden-Wartemberg-category to launch the "Rainland-Falz" was suspended until the first half of 2019.
The ship was due to join the Navy in 2014, but the high-voltage project was in trouble due to the Delaware-Next Problem.
In 2007, the Navy will replace the four boats of the Baden-Wartemberg-category with the brake-class frigate that will be used to command.
They are known to contain powerful cannons, anti-aircrafts and anti-ship shells, such as recycled radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include long-term surveillance - new friggets can be monitored for a maximum of two years from the port of the country.
Anyway, it's not long ago that the modern warships - which will help Germany to show power abroad - will be obsolete when the water is called, the news of Die Jet.
Last year's accident took over F 125 frigates, when the German Navy refused to launch the ship and returned to Hamburg's flowers and voiceshipyard.
This was the first time a ship was sent back to shipbuilder after the Navy was delivered.
The reasons for the return are very little known, but the German media has mentioned a number of important "software and hardware errors" that will unravel the ship in the war.
The software's money is especially important because the boats of the Budden-Wartemberg-class will be run by about 120 sailors - half the population of the old Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, it was found that the ship was moderately heavy, which would reduce its performance and create obstacles to the future upgrade of the Navy.
During the second world war, these 7,000 tons of ships are thought to be twice as heavy as those used by the Germans.
In addition to wrong hardware, the entire project, including the training of the Crusades, has become a problem.
The initial level of 2.2 billion pounds is amazingly reached at 3.1 billion pounds (3.6 billion dollars).
New frys are becoming more important in the recent context of Germany's threat of nuclear power.
At the beginning of this year, the German Parliament's main defence committee Hans-Peter Bartels acknowledged that the ship "is being shipped by Motaine's appropriate ship" in the Navy.
This officer said that the problem was overdue, because there were no replacement ships that had been cancelled.
He regrets that no vessel of the Budden-Wartemberg-category was able to join the Navy.
Do not listen to the national trust in the secret life of young people
A new study is being conducted in an estate in the Scottish region to learn how to use landfills in search of food.
It is hoped that the search will bring fresh light on the behavior of this unique flying creature and help in future conservation activities.
The National Trust for Scotland will be researched with the ordinary and super-performing Pipesrels and the Dbentons of the Invariu Garden of Western Russia.
To track the performance of the bats in the entire mouse area, you will be placed in an important location around the recording area.
NHS workers and volunteers are also running a series of tests using portable detectors.
The expert will analyze the sound of all recordings and build up the call complex and will let you know what people are doing.
Then a map and a report will be made to create a detailed earthquake-scaling image of their behavior.
The conservation advisor of NTS hopes to provide Rob with results that some areas of residence are most important and how they are used by each nation.
This information will help determine how to manage the habitat, such as how to protect the soil for landscape creation and for the breeding and other related populations.
Over the last century, the number of snowflakes in Scotland and the United Kingdom has been very low.
For building and development, they are in danger of damaging their sleeping places and homes.
Air-based Tarbin and light may be at risk, as may be from some chemicals in flypers and construction tools, besides the attack of the hairdressers.
It's not really blind.
However, their ears are more effective in catching victims at night than their eyes.
They use an improved echo-location strategy to identify dangers and obstacles on the road.
NTS, which is responsible for more than 270 historic buildings throughout the country, 38 important operations and 76,000 hectares of land, has given priority to the population.
Ten of them are trained experts who perform regular exams, visit sleep places, and sometimes rescue.
The organization has also set up the first and only requested storage sites of Damfriez and Galloi's Drive Estate in Scotland, where there are eight residences among the ten largest populations in Scotland.
Estate Manager David Thompson says it is a model area for birds.
"There's the best area for teenagers in the Trive," he says.
"There are old buildings, there are many old trees and there are all good dwellings.
But there's still a lot more we don't know yet, so what we do here and elsewhere will help us to understand more about what we need to survive."
He emphasizes the importance of the presence of the dam before safeguarding the property, as it could be the destruction of 400 mothers and children by the accidental destruction of a mother's residence, and the destruction of the entire local dam.
It is illegal to kill, destroy or destroy wild animals and their habitats.
Sketch Officer Elizabeth Ferell encouraged the public to help with the security trust.
He said, "We still know a lot about the young and we don't know anything about how many people live."
Ronaldo's allegations of rape are being denied, and lawyers are going to bring charges against the German newspaper
The charges of rape against him are described as "false news" and say that people want to increase their "identity" with his name.
His lawyers are ready to file a case against the German newsmagazine D'Spiegel, who published the complaint.
This Portuguese and Juventas Foreard was accused of rapeing an American woman at a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
He was accused of giving him $375.000 to remain silent about the case, reported by Dr. Spigel on Friday.
A few hours after this claim came out, 33-year-old Ronaldo commented on the report as "false news" when he spoke to his 142 million flowers in his Instagram live video.
"No, no, no, no.
What they have said today is a lie," said Balloon-de-O's victorious camera.
"They want to increase their contact by using my name.
It's a simple thing.
They want to know their own name, but it's a vital part.
I'm a happy man and I'm all right." The player said more in the face.
According to Reuters, Ronaldor's lawyers are preparing to bring charges against Dr. Spigel, whom they have called "a suspicious report on privacy".
Lawyer Christian Shertz says the player needs to be more than compensation "for the moral damage that may be one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent times due to the importance of crime".
The story was mentioned in June 2009 as a package of Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
According to the paper submitted to the Nevada Clark County District Court, Ronaldo and Mayorga went to the house after a night club where he was raped.
Mayorga claimed that Ronaldo formed the petition after that incident and told him that he had been disappointed by "99 percent" "good people", "one percent".
The paper claimed that Ronaldo confirmed that they had sexual intercourse, but it was acceptable.
Mayorga further claimed that he had gone to the police and that his injuries had been taken to the hospital, but later he was tried outside the court, because he was "feared by retaliation" and was afraid to be "defended in public".
The 34-year-old said that he is now trying to re-establish this settlement because he has been mentally disturbed by the story.
At the time of the crime, Ronaldo Manchester was among those who joined Royal Madrid from the United States and joined Italy's famous club Juvey in the 100 million dollars agreement.
Brexit: Losing the position as a car manufacturer will "suffer forever"
Trade Minister Greg Clarke says that the United Kingdom will "suffer forever" in its first position in the world after Brexit.
He also said it was "suffering" that the United Kingdom told the BBC that if they left Britain without any agreement, they would temporarily shut down their products in the factory near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that people could go to work because of the limited delay without a contract.
Burnston's factory - which has produced Toyota Aris and Avenis - has produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, with approximately 90 percent of them exported to other countries of the European Union.
"We believe that if Britain comes out of the U.S. at the end of March, the production can be stopped at our factory."
With Honda, BM World and Jaguar Land Rover, the other manufacturers of Uke's international vehicle have expressed their concern about the European Union without any agreement on how to operate the international trade.
For example, B.M.W. said they would shut down their mini-plant in Oxford within a month after Brexit.
What car manufacturers say about primary concern is the risk of the supply chain in terms of the break-in without agreement.
The TV production line is based on "Just-In-Time", which comes every 37 minutes from both suppliers to the ordered car.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without any agreement on 29 March, it may break down at the border, which could cause a delay in the operation and a crisis in the operation.
The company said that the Tioter Derbisha plant cannot hold more than one day's worth of inventory so that the product can be stopped.
Mr. Clark says that in the future, the Thessa May Chekers plan "has been properly implemented to avoid such checks at the border."
"We need a deal, we want to make the best deal not only to succeed, but we can also enjoy the possibility of future progress," he said at today's BBC Radio 4 event.
"Not only does it, but other producers also show that the success of the supply chain is very important."
It is impossible to say how many days the product will be closed, but they have suggested that an additional cost-factory competition can be reduced over the long term and can lead to many job losses.
Working in Burnston for 24 years and the United Union of Ahwaik Peter Suvalaris of the plant said his members were alarmingly saying: "They will not return once in my experience.
One government spokesman said, "We need to keep a definite and credible plan for the future with this U."
White House said that the tramp meeting with Rosenstein could be longer.
First Court Nomini Bret Kavanf, Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosstein, said that the High Representative could be sent to the meeting "for another week" on Sunday White House.
Rozstein, a special adviser to Russia's electoral action, cooperation between Trump and Russia's connection and the possible opposition to the President's trial, discussed Robert Mueller's work.
Whether the Trump Deputy will destroy the Attorney General and whether he will face the issue of the freedom of the mueller is going on in Washington over the past few months.
At the beginning of this month, the use of secret Mike to record talks with the New York Times tramps and the 25th amendment to the president has been discussed by Rozstein in Morm.
Rosstein rejected the report.
However, she is going to resign from such a report, saying she went to White House last Monday.
Instead of announcing the meeting with Thursday, Trump was then in the United Nations office in New York.
Trump said he would "not like to destroy Rosstein", but one of the women who accused Kavanf and him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blaji Ford, both of whom were admitted to testify, was behind the meeting to avoid the hearing of the Senate's section committee.
On Friday, the FBI ordered a week of investigation against Trump Kavanf, for which the full vote of the Senate was delayed.
The Trump press secretary was present on Sunday, Fox News.
Regarding the meeting with Rosstein, he said: "No date is fixed, it may be this week, it may take another week for all other matters in the Supreme Court.
But let me show you and I always want to tell the news media."
Some journalists objected to this statement, and Sanders did not brief the White House after 10 September.
Corporal Chris Wallace asks why.
Sanders says that because they don't have a briefing, it's not about "showing people" to journalists, although he says, "I don't deny that they've shown things."
He then suggested that he increase direct contact between tramp and the press.
"The current president presided over more than any previous president," he said without giving any evidence: "We have judged that number."
The briefing will also be in the future, Sanders says, "Then the news media is much better than talking to me if the president of the United States is able to ask directly.
We've been trying very hard to do this, and you've seen us do this for weeks and you've been talking directly to the president of the United States instead of the press briefing."
When you leave the White House, or at exciting sessions, or during a press conference with special guests, you will receive a regular question.
A single press conference is very low.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why to do unusual work, and sometimes to face the press.
Health Minister N.H.S. Scotland wrote a letter in fear of the British Workers' Brexit
Health Minister N.H.S. thanked European Union workers for their country and expressed their desire to stay in the future.
Jean Freeman M.S.P. sent a letter about six months before he left the U.S.
The Scottish government has already promised to metabarize the state application for government services in the U.S. country.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: There is continued discussion between UK and UU throughout the summer, which can be expected to result in this condition.
However, the UK government is also preparing it for the impossible situation.
I know you're all going through exciting times.
That's why I want to remind you again how valuable their contribution is to me, apart from the nationality of each member.
Workers from all over the European Union and outside it have gained valuable experience and skills that have strengthened and improved health care and have benefited the patient and our community.
Scotland is your own country and we want you to stay here."
Christian Abercrombie’s Emergency Armour After Smashing
Mike Organ of Tennessee said that he was a Christian at the Battle of Tennessee State Tigers on Saturday at Vanderbillt Commodores on 31-27.
The chief coach of the Tennessee State told the Red Journalists that the strike was just past the hour.
Reed says, "He's getting so upset on the sideline."
Trainers and medical personnel gave oxygen to Abercrombic according to the sideline and then returned for further testing.
A Tennessee State official in Nashville, Dublin, told Chris Harris of the MSV that the Vanderbitt Medical Center was outside the Abercrombie Armour.
Harris also says that "there is no description of the type/type of injury yet" and is trying to know when the tennis state is hit.
After moving from Illinois, a second-year student from the Red Shirt, Abarcromby, was the first to play with the Tennessee State.
He had five totals before leaving the game on Saturday, with a total of 18 totals.
Foreigners have to give more stamps when they buy property in the United Kingdom
Under the Tori Plan, when foreign creators buy new assets in the United Kingdom, they have to give more stamps and use this extra money to help the homeless.
This step will enhance the success of Corbin's campaign to attract young voters.
This stamp will be applied to those who do not do so in the United Kingdom.
Trejary hopes that more money will be available to help households grow their income by up to £120 million per year.
When foreign creators buy some property in the United Kingdom, they have to give more stamps - and this extra money will be spent on households, Thessa May will announce it today.
This step will further enhance the success of the Corbin's campaign to attract young voters and target high-ranking housing and high-ranking voters.
This stamp will be applied to people and organisations who don't work in the United Kingdom, and additional funds will be needed to help households.
In addition to the current stamp shell, which was raised in the second and second houses two years ago, more than three percent of the charges were paid.
Trezari hopes that this will result in an increase of £120 million per year.
About 13 percent of London's newly created total wealth is bought by citizens outside the United Kingdom, which has increased prices and made the situation more difficult for the first-ever residents.
Most of the country's coastal areas - especially the capital - have become "unknown city" by foreign Kretats who spent most of their time abroad.
A few weeks later, the new principle came after Boris Johnson Stamp Schulk Komora called for their first home.
He charged that he did not use land against large-scale construction organizations to raise the cost of the property and called on Ms. Mac to solve the home cost of the building in Britain.
Mr. Karbin announced an attractive series of proposals for housing reform, including wage control and "no-flute" accommodation.
He wants to give the Council more power to create a new home.
Ms. May said: "Last year I said that I would raise my prime minister in the recovery of the British dream - which should make life more beautiful for each new generation.
And his meaning is to run a broken house shop.
Britain will always be open to those who want to stay here, work and create life.
However, it can't be said that foreign and foreign non-United Kingdom NGOs will easily buy hard-working British citizens.
Many people have lost their dream of home ownership, and the problem of homeless people is really gone.
Jack Ross: 'My final dream is to take responsibility for Scotland'
Sanderland Boss Jack Ross said his "final desire" was to be managed by Scotland in the future.
The 42-year-old inhabitants of Scotland, currently enjoying the challenge of restoring the North-East Club, now in third place in League One, have three points behind the first team.
In the past month, St. Maryen returned to the Scottish Prime Minister in the summer.
"I wanted to play country as a player.
I've had a B cap and until now, "Rs. BBC Scotland's Sports Sound."
"Then I grew up with my father in Hampden, and he always took me back.
If I succeed in running the club, only this chance can come."
As Sanderland Manager, there are Dick Advockets, David Moes, Sam Allardis, Martin O'Neil, Ray, Gus Poit and Paulo De Cani.
The former Aloi Athletic boss says he did not feel disappointed by the offer of a large club name such as Burnsley and Ipswich Town.
"At this moment I'll have the degree of success "can I bring this club back to the primary league?"
It is undoubtedly due to the structure and convenience of the club, "He says.
"It's not that easy to get there, but I'll probably see myself as a success if I can get the club back there."
After 15 months as a cosing staff of Dumberton's boss and Hearts, the life of Ross's manager is only three years old.
Then he helped to restore the light from Abanmon to the third level and to turn St. Maryn from the door of Abanmon to win the championship.
And Ross says that he now feels more free to play here than he does in Clyde, Hartlpool, Falkark, St. Mary and Hamilton academics.
He recalls taking responsibility for Light, "It was probably a real Milton."
"I really believed that management was better for me than gambling.
It's strange to hear it because I've made it right, I've lived through it, and I've enjoyed some success.
But it's a tough game.
You have to go through a lot of things every week.
I still feel the same way about working pressure, and the management is right.
I've always wanted to manage, and now I'm doing this, it's the most satisfying thing I've ever had in my adult life."

The exam says Saturday afternoon 5.30 is the best example of paint.
The winter's heat has increased in Britain's sinks, but the restoratives have put pressure on China.
The sale of bars increased by 2.7% in July, but the cost of the restrooms was 4.8%.
SGA's business advisor, Peter Martin, who collected the statistics, said: "The unexpected long-term participation of the UK in Aberto Rhodes and the World Cup is going to be the same in July as last June, when the sales of mushrooms increased 2.8 percent and the sale of desserts decreased.
In June, the restorative business has worsened by 1.8% in July.
Drinking and bars have been very good until now, and the sale of restaurants has been so bad.
The main food outlets are also hot, but they are not sold under the name of the restaurants.
It looks like people just go out for a little drink.
All bars and bars sales have increased 6.6 percent this month, and food sales have dropped by three percent."
Apostate and Atheatist analyst and SM Paul Neuman said: "The intensity of the end of April is still continuing.
The impact of climate and large social or sporting events on sales outside the home is the most important.
There is no surprise that the restorative groups will be in a difficult situation, but this 4.8 percent of the annual sales will be particularly painful.
It's time for food operators to come out of the long and hot winters and tell them if August's normal climate will bring some relief."
In July, there was a rise in total sales growth of 2.7 percent in the restaurants, reflecting a drop in sales in the Brand Roll-Outs.
U.K. has collected and analysed the performance data collected and analysed from the Operational Group 47 of the Coffer Pitch Tracker Industry Sales, with a total of more than 9 million pounds of Tarnover, and this is an art standard.
Each of the five children has a private social media account that they keep with their parents
The survey revealed that one in five children - some 11 years of age - have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed an increase in the "Col Insta" page
This news shows fear of posting sex content
Hundreds of fucking students say there's a "principal" account to show their parents
One of the five children - someone is hiding a social media account from 11-year-olds.
In comparison with 20,000 students in the secondary school, "Non-Insta" -- the photo share's website is related to the growth rate of the account.
The news revealed that sexual content is being posted.
Hundreds of fucking John students say they've also kept a transparent "head" account to show their parents.
A mother who has seen her 13-year-old daughter's hidden site has seen a young girl call out "Shoot me" to others.
A study of the Digital Awarness U and the Headmasters and Headmasters Conference shows that between 11 and 18 years of age, there are two 40 percent of the profiles that have been accepted by half of the private account.
H.M.C. Chief Mike Bouchann says: "It's interesting that child-kissory online is designed to create places that parents and teachers can't find."
Elid Doyle Scotch Athletics will be "Vese For Athlite" on the board
Elid Dowell was elected a member of the Scottish Athletics Board as an executive manager at the annual general meeting of the Governing Body.
The most successful tracks and field athletes in Doyle Scotland and Chairman Ian Bite described this step as a bad opportunity for game managers to benefit from their international experience in the past decade.
"The Scottish, the UK and the World Athletics community are highly respected and we are sure that he will benefit greatly from the Scottish Athletics Board," said Bite.
Doyle says, "I am interested in acting as a voice for athletes and I hope that I can really help Scotland's game and move it forward."
The American, who won four Olympics with 200 meters and 400 meters in the Atlantic in 1996 and is now the regular pondit of BBC, has closed his hand after the Transient Ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't stand.
The doctor said it's time to tell me how much I can heal.
It was hard work, but now I've learned to be healthy, to walk again, and to start the bodywork again today!
Thank you for sending me a message!"
Internet divides the advertising of salt pumps from mother and cow
A feed pump agency shares the Internet's opinion with an announcement that children are compared to milk cows.
What is called "the first silent pump in the world," the food technology organization Elvi published a funny music video to show the new pump the freedom that modern mothers give.
Four real moms are dancing with a song that says, "Yeah, I'm milking my own milk, but I don't have any mud" and "If anyone sees it, it's no animal bite, it's my stomach."
And the course goes, "Bow down, pump down, I'll feed the kids, pump down, I'll milk my friends."
Although, the advertisement, which has been released on the company's Facebook page, has created an online debate.
77,000 views and she commented on the mixed reaction of the video viewers, many say it highlights the "favour" of dual art.
"The use of cows in advertising is a very bad decision.
To create milk, we need to be pregnant and give birth to children, the difference is that in a few days of birth their children are being stolen from them," wrote one.

Another commented: "It seems that it is disappointing for both mother and child alike.
But why don't they use them in the breast pump advertisements for those mothers who keep their babies alive?"
Another said, "A very unscrupulous announcement."
Others are standing next to the ad, one woman admits that the song has become her "rejoicing".
"I think it's a great idea.
If I had milked the child, I would have taken one.
When pumping, it's just as hot as it is.
The advertisement's kind of crazy, but I'm good at it.
It's an innovative product," wrote one.
Another commented: "It's a funny announcement that he's made to target mothers who pump (usually in their jobs or in the toilet) and think they're "dogs."
This advertisement does nothing to praise or criticize Deary's art."
At the end of the video, a group of women reported that they all danced with their brother's hidden pump.
The announcement is based on the idea that many women feel like cows when pumping.
Although the LV pump is completely silent, there is no such thing as a tube or tube and the nursing bridge is beautifully fitted, which also allows women to move, keep the baby on their knees, and even go outside.
Anna Balarin, a partner of Mother and I C.D., said: "LV Pumps should start a fast and exciting food.
By drawing parallel pictures of women and twins, we want to highlight in the Tune Pumping and all its challenges, the new pump will bring an incredible sense of freedom in a fun and relevant way.
The LVP has not been the first news yet.
In the London Fashion Week, the mother of one of her two children used this food to dress Katwa for the designer Marta Jacuboski.
Some immigrant children were taken to a taboo on the silent Texas border
The number of children in detention has increased, although the monthly borders are relatively unchanged, because the harsh rules and policies of the Trump administration have made it harder to keep children at their own expense.
Traditionally, most Spencers themselves are afraid of losing their chance of living in the country without having to report the demands of migrants and children.
This risk is growing in June when federal authorities announce that potential sponsors and other adult members of their family will have to deliver fingerprints and share the information with the immigration authorities.
Last week, a former immigration and Shulk official testified before Matthew Albens Congress that the agency had arrested a few dozen people who had applied for the sponsorship of orphan children.
The Agency then reported that 70 percent of those arrested had no history of crime.
"Approximately 80 percent of the family members of the sponsors or sponsors are illegally in the country and a large part of them are violent criminals.
That's why we're looking for them," Nister Albens said.
In an effort to speed up the return of children to society, officials have introduced some new rules, including a month of detention to be brought before the courts, which was 60 days ago.
Many will not come to the immigration judge personally during their trial by video conference calls.
Those who are considered unworthy of salvation will be quickly released.
According to refugee workers, and in recent months according to reports published by the system, children are more likely to suffer from anxiety or despair, which could lead to violent events or escapes.
Supporters have said that these concerns are more intense in large areas, such as Turnillo, where children are more concerned, more likely to be ignored, because of their size.
They also say that if children are not mentally prepared or do not give their friends enough time to move away from the center, many may increase the trauma several times so that they are already suffering.
The U.S., French and Turkish forces have told Syria to leave immediately.
Resolving the U.N. general situation, Foreign Minister Walid-al-Mualem has called for the return of refugees to Syria, although the country has been fighting for eight years.
Moylem, who is also the Deputy Prime Minister of the country, says that foreign forces are inseparably on the ground in the fight against terrorism, and "We will take appropriate measures."
"They have to leave now without their condition," he tells the professor.
Moalem stressed that Syria "almost ended the war on terrorism", where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have been forced to flee their homes.
He says Damascus will continue "until all Syrian soil is cleared" against both terrorists and "unlawful foreign presence".
There are nearly 2,000 US troops in Syria, against President Bashar-al-Assad, the Kurdish army and the Syrian Arab for the main training and advice.
There are more than 1,000 French soldiers in this war-stricken country.
Moalem said in the refugee question that the situation is suitable for their return and that he is responsible for "spreading illegal fear" to the "something Western country" that has encouraged refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and human organizations to help this return," he said.
"They're politics about the entire human problem."
The U.S. and the European Union have warned that Syria will not be helped to recover until the political agreement is concluded between the assads and the opponents.
U.S. states that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey has provided an opportunity to move forward through political discussion in Idlib's last major rebel zone.
The Russian-Turkey Agreement has prevented a major attack by the Russian military in the area, where three million people live.
Moalem, however, insisted that the agreement has "a clear time limit" and hoped that this military action al-Qaeda-related Nussers would work against the Gihadites, who will "be re-armed".
The United Nations state angel Stefan De Mistura soon hoped to call for a new meeting of a new committee on government and opposition members to make war-related bills and access the way to elections.
Moalem said the Syrian government's participation in the committee should limit the panel's work to "review existing constitutional clauses", and he warned against unnecessary action.
Why Trump won the second round
In this argument, Trump 2020 will win the re-election, as many liberals probably hope that the curses and calendars will soon end.
Which will certainly be "the most dramatic end of any president!"
Until now, there is no sign of changing the views of the viewers.

In the middle of the election, money goes into the middle like rainwater
It's not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th vote is running out of money, as two candidates are fighting for the return of the Congressional District.
The recently re-designed city of Pittsburgh District Pitts has brought the Democratic Representative Coner Lamb to fight - which won another district in a special election last summer.
Lamb is fighting against the Republican Keith Rothfas, who is currently representing the 12th district of the old Pennsylvania, many of which are part of the 17th district.
In January, Pennsylvania’s Supreme Court ruled that the old districts are constitutionally well-designed according to the Republicans, which has redesigned the map.
This new 17th district electorate has been involved in the campaign between the Democratic Campaign Committee (DISC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRC).
In March, the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania only won a limb after winning a special election.
For over a decade, it was the right of the Republicans and President Donald Trump won 20 points in the district.
Politicians are moving on to a few democrats.
To support the U.S. China, El Salvador's Guru Panda, then return
Co-initiators have noted that Dominican Republic and Panama have already accepted Beijing, a bit from Washington.
Mr. Trump Panamar met with President Juan Carlos Verler in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama, but later the participants removed the tromp organisation's executive team.
In a statement at the end of the month, Foreign Affairs spoke, officials from the office decided to bring back US leaders from El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama to Taiwan with the latest decision not to acknowledge Taiwan.
However, only El Salvador was punished, which received nearly $140 million as US rescue in 2017 for drug control, development and financial assistance.
The proposed penalty, including financial aid and a specific visa ban, could become painful for this country in Central America due to its high unemployment and loss of life.
With the progress of the internal meeting, North American and Central American officials suspended a high-level conference to prevent migrants from expanding to America last year as a step towards security and economic prosperity.
But in mid-September, Nagad, chief administration officials indicated that they wanted to hold the conference, which effectively ended El Salvador's sentence.
The co-sponsors have announced that the Vice-President Mike Pens will give a speech at the conference, which was scheduled for mid-October to announce the administration's import.
And the American angels in three countries have returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without a new message or punishment from Washington.
Mr. Bolton was not willing to comment on the statement made by three U.S. officials who were in the internal discussion on the condition that a White House's spokesperson was not published.
Their speech administration confirmed the closeness of an external analyst, and he also refused to publish a name.

The next incident could be an accident with Robert Mullar's special report on the possible obstruction of Mr. Trump's law, which now has sufficient evidence in the public record.
At the time of the election, Mr. Trump's Russian presence was known to have been a turning point in Mr. Mullar's investigation.
If the Congress changed its hand, Mr. Trump had to take responsibility, just as he was preparing to go back to the voters and possibly to the jury with his colleagues.

History has often turned like this, and it is sometimes driven by the constant pace of democracy, and it is sometimes delayed.
America's history has come to be like this.
What should we do if Mr. Trump deputizes Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who will determine the fate of Mr. Mular's investigation.
Since it was published last year, Rosenstein has been in danger that he has advised the president of the secret to record and assumed his disability in his position.
Mr. Rosenstein says the news of the Times is not true.
"What will happen to us if the F.B.I. investigation starts against Bret Kavanf is incomplete or unjust - or even if he has a credible charge of sexual assault and false testimony?

Half of the participants said they spoke to their husband or wife about the cost of long-term service.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to think about them, but they're not taking action to talk about this," said Vice President Holly Snyder of the National Aid Business.
You know where to start.
Talk to your husband or wife and children: If you do not publish your wishes well enough, you will not be able to prepare your family for the ministry.
To discuss where and how you want to take care of yourself and your family, keep in touch with your advisor and your family because setting your preferences is also important.
Talk to your financial advisor: Your advisor can look for solutions to these costs.
For long-term service, you might like to have a long-term service if you have a long-term service policy. You can use a hybrid city-value life insurance policy or your own resources to support these tasks.
Deal with your own documents: try moving them away from the battlefront.
Choose a proper health care proxy so that you can select someone who is faithful to your profession and so that you will be able to follow your wishes if you are unable to communicate.

Federal Councillors want death penalty for suspected terrorist attacks in New York
The New York Federal Consuls want a death penalty for Sifulo Sipov, who was involved in a terrorist attack in New York to kill eight people, and who were not punished after 1953.
There is a charge that 30-year-old Sipov launched an attack on the way to the Western Side Highway bike in Lower Manhattan in October to get rid of bikers and travelers.
Consuls must prove, according to the note given to the New York South District, that the Cypriot "willfully" killed eight people and "willfully" seriously injured them.
According to the Court's document, it is sufficient to execute both death sentences.
A week after the attack, a federal grand jury filed 22 charges against Siepov, including eight charges of murder, which are usually brought against organised crime, and with him charges of violence and car destruction.
According to Sipov, as the attack "disgusting, cruel and corrupt" has occurred, the council members say that it requires "a sufficient amount of planning and guidance".
"Syflo Habibluevich Sippov, whose family and friends are affected, damaged and damaged by the Digo Enernik Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, Ann-Lorra Decat, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlis, Harnan Furuchi, Harnan Digo Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Mendoza," notes from the Intent State.
The victims were visited by five Argentinas.
New York South District was the last death sentence in force a decade ago.
Asami Khalid Burns was convicted of killing two drug suppliers, but he was sentenced to life imprisonment by the end of September 2009.
The death penalty in a New York federal case was imposed in 1953 against a married couple named Julia and Ethel Rosenberg, who were accused of conspiracy in the Soviet Union two years ago during the Cold War.
The Rosenberg couple were sentenced to death on June 19, 1953.
The citizens of Uzbekistan did not express any remorse, the Court reports.
The police said he was happy after the incident.
Sipov told officials that he was inspired by the video of the I.S.S. in the home.
The police said he also asked for an I.I.S. flag at his hospital's home.
He accused himself of being innocent in 22 cases.
According to one David Patton of the Federal Public Defenders of Cyprus, they are "evidently disappointed" in the decision of the Consul.
Patton says, "We believe that the trial will extend the trial of each of us in the area of the death penalty rather than the request for life imprisonment."
Sipov's legal team applied for the death penalty before.
Samsad Tory says Nigel Farez should be responsible for the brief review.
Nigel Farez promised to "set up a public-military" at the Tori conference today.
The former government leader says that politicians have been 'sucked up from Eurosceptics' - when one of Thessa May's own MP says he should be given the responsibility of talking to the U.S.
Consarvetive leader Peter's sister Burmingham said that if Mr. Farez Brexit had been secretary, the United Kingdom would already have come 'outside the U.S.'.
However, Mrs. May has once again become clear in order to keep her deeply divided officials in one place, when Brexit-Toris took part in another Brexit protest in the city.
Among other things, the Brexit-Responsive Brexit-Resistant and EU attacks are driving the chekers to keep the deal in the right direction.
His colleagues stressed that despite opposition, they would force Europeanseptics and Lebar to make a choice between their packages and 'bigshkhla' to make a deal with Brussels.
Mr. Sister Solihale at the Live Mins Live Assembly said she wanted 'Chuck Chekers'.
He suggested that Mr. Farez should be co-worked and that he should be responsible for the discussion with Brussels.
"If he were responsible, we'd come out of it," he says.
Wellinboro's MP says, "I'll support the brief, but I need check checks."
I told his opponents in Uu: "We did not fight for the world to survive
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
After the 2016 vote, Mr. Sister suggested that people should change their views. "British people want to stay in UU - this idea is completely false."
Tori Brexit was also in Andre Jenkins, who told reporters: ‘I just want to say this: Prime Minister, listen to people.
"Chekers will not vote against the general public, and it is also the people who have brought us here who are the people and the active actors.
Move out of the way and try to hear the words.'
He also said to Ms. May, in the express language, "The Prime Minister is thinking about where his promise should be fulfilled."
At Mr. Farez's meeting, politicians should be forced to understand the 'opportunity situation' if they were to be unfaithful to the 2016 vote.
"It has now become a matter of faith among politicians," he says.
"They're trying to cheat on Brexit, and we'll tell them, 'We won't let you escape if we do.'
To encourage the people, he added: ‘I want politicians who are trying to commit felony to Brexit face the opposite.
"We are driving the forces of the people who have defeated us, and we will not rest until we have become an independent, independent and proud kingdom."
The Brexit-Resistants have spent two hours at the city centre in Burma.
At the end of this week, a group of workers showed a brief banner against the Tori.
After a party's security problem, Leber Party leader at the Adonis Conference ridiculed the consarvets.
"Some people tell us that they can keep free trade, Canada's plus plus plus and IT systems in free borders," he adds.

The president is thinking of giving Warren a hard look at the candidate.
The U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said he would think deeply about the presidential candidates after the November vote.
Boston Globe reports that this Massachusetts Democrat is a town in the western city of Massachusetts in the course of its future.

He is currently discussing that he can compete with Trump in the 2020 election.
The 36th meeting with his organizers was held in Holio on Saturday evening after the Trump double.
One participant asked him to be a candidate in the presidential position.
In the north, Warren says, "It's time for a woman to take the government that we read about in this breach."

Russian Grand Prix: Louis Hamilton, a subsidiary of the Sebastian Vettell, went further to the World Cup.
It was clear when Valteri Botas Luis Hamilton was able to do so before Saturday and said that the Mercedes team would play an important role in this race.
Botas from Paul well started ignoring Hamilton and keeping his first two left positions and inviting the veteran to attack his team player.
He left the Vetel Hamilton behind and went into the pit himself, which could have been the maker.
Marcidez's driver is pinged and followed by the vetel, but Hamilton Tanton's fight went ahead to see that the ferry driver was a double-moved and left empty with the risk of unintentionally hand-handling.
Max Verstappen began his 21st birthday in the back row and was number seven after the first laptop.
Then he has many parts of the race first, and then Kim Ryconen takes fourth place with bad tires.
He's got 44 laps, but he couldn't get the rest of the eight laps, so he's staying in the fourth place.
It was a hard day because Valteri fought all week long and worked like a real gentleman.
The group is working hard first," Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language.
At a meeting on Saturday, President Donald Trump, Senator Dian Finstein, did not throw a letter from Christine Blaji Ford against the charge of sexual assault against Bret Kavanf.
Instead of speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly about what was happening in the film, he said that people's "low and valuable and false" mentality was revealed.
"It's one thing that could have happened and that the beautiful thing is going on in the motion last few weeks, you'll see anger when you see the low and the high and the false people," he said.
"When they see the data being lost, they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
Oh, I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diane Finstein, did you throw it?
Remember his answer... did you dump the paper-- "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I have not lost my purpose."
Hey, wait a minute.
We've lost... no, we didn't," he says, copying the senator.
Last July, this letter was sent to Ford Finstein with a description of the charges against Kavanf, and the letter was dropped in September – but Finnstine refused to leave his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't make any mistakes," says the Finnish Committee, The Hill's report.
"He told me to keep it secret and I kept it secret according to his word."
But his speech was not that of the president, he answered at a Saturday night's meeting: "What I said was a very bad body language.
Maybe he didn't, but I've never seen a worse body language than that."
Three women spoke out against the Supreme Court of Nomini accused of sexual misconduct, the president said that the democrats were using the charges for their own purpose.
"They want power back at any cost.
Look at low mentality, see dignity, don't force them to hurt, don't force anyone to change power and control," the president says in Morm.

In Indonesia, the head of the International Red Cross, Jean-Galfand CNN, says: "The Indonesian Red Cross is moving quickly to help the animals, but we don't know what we'll see there.
It is already sad, but the situation may be worse."
President Joko Widodo of Indonesia went to Palu on Sunday and told the country's army members: "I ask you to stay in your day-to-night rescue work.
Are you ready?" CNN's report.
At the beginning of this year, Indonesia's Lambo was hit by earthquakes that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesian plane crash: Laguna aircraft accident reported an undetectable aircraft crash
When an airline crashed into the Pacific Legion of Micronesia, they reported that 47 passengers and workers were rescued from a deep plane, and now they say there is someone missing.
Air Neugini says in a report on Saturday afternoon that a man cannot be found.
The airline reported that they were working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find him.
Airline immediately refused to disclose details such as the age and nationality of the journey.
After trying to get to the island airport, the plane is able to help rescue some local ships and workers after they crash into the water.
Officials reported Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline says six passengers are in the hospital on Saturday, and they are all in stable condition.
There's still nothing clear about what happened.
Airline and the U.S. Navy both said that the plane was going to land before arriving in Ranway.
Several observers thought the plane was lost in Runway.
American Traveler Bill Jens says the plane went down very low.
"That's a very good thing," says Jens.
Jens says that he and others reached the airport in the early hours of the deep.
He said the airmen were shouting in fear and he had a little bit of a kick in his head.
The U.S. Navy reports that nearby jet crews are helping to rescue the crew, bringing the aircraft 30 metres (100 ft) to the water before the air is flooded.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died on the PNG-registered airline for the past two decades, but there has been no accident with the aircraft.
Analysts have been able to stop a woman from burning alive
In 2014, a woman in Mississippi filed a prosecution case again on Saturday in the trial of the accused for burning alive.
U.S. Department of Judicial Analyst Paul Raolette has witnessed several hours as an expert in the analysis of research.
He describes what happened to Jessica Chambers, 29-year-old Asami Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers at the night of her death.
Raolet says he has recovered several cellphones that indicate that Teles and Chambers were together at the night of death, which was the report of Clarion Laser against the former Tels.
The information suggests that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time, although he claimed that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police spoke with Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he was not in town at night.
When the Consuls ask whether Telis was telling the truth that she was on a Sanford truck that night, Sanford answers that "it's a lie, because her truck was in Nassville that day."
Another contradiction is that Telis said that two weeks before Chambers died, he knew him.
The cellphone record says they've only known each other for a week.
Raolet says that shortly after Chambers died, Teleis deletes text, call and contact information from his phone.
"He just deletes it from life," Haley says.
The case's final argument was filed on Sunday.
The judge says the case is expected to go to the jury the next day.
The High Brid: What's Consuas hip hop?
By giving a positive message in a hip hop third song, you want to challenge this series's negative thinking.
The High Brid of Bristol claims that hip hop has escaped from the main source of political messages and social problems.
They want to go back to their main stream and repopulate Consass hip hop.
The Fugitive and the Commons have recently seen a resurrection through artists like Akala and people in the United Kingdom.
Another farmer?
New York Nani filed a case against a couple after the "descriptive" text.
A mother is suing a New York Nanny couple for a controversial text to be called "a strange farm".
The couple denied the claim to be a characterist and sought a trial for the "Julum" complaint.
In 2016, the mother of two children, Lincy Plasco-Falksman, expressed disappointment at the first day of work, and learned that Gigel Morris was a new farmer.
Mrs. Plasco-Falksman wrote her husband "NAAA Another Farm" in a text message.
Anyway, she sends Miss Morris twice instead of sending her husband.
Later, when he realized his mistake, he released Plasco-Falksman Miss Morris, who said that their former African-American Nanny had been working badly, he was expecting a Filipino, the New York Post report.
Miss Morris was given a mine one day and then sent home.
Morris is now filing for damages against the couple and wants to pay $350 a day for six months, although he was first hired as a housewife without any agreement.
"I want to show them, look, I can't do that," he told the post on Friday, and he added, "I know it's different."
The couple said against the claim that it was reasonable to banish Morris because he could not be trusted after being accused of him.
"My wife didn't mean what she sent.
He's not a characterist.
We're not a characterist couple," says husband Joel Plasco Post.
"But will you leave your children with whom you have abused, even if it is wrong?
Your native son?
Say it."
Plasco said about the "Jullum" claim that his wife only gave birth two months ago and was in a very difficult situation.
"Would you like to go against someone like that?
It's not very good to do this," said that investment banker.
In view of the ongoing case, the Social Media Court strongly condemns the couple's behaviour and arguments.
Padington's publication expressed fears that readers may not be able to relate to the good they speak, published in a new letter.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born after the book was adopted, said about the letter: "It's hard to say what she's going to think about for the first time before the publication.
It's a fun thing to know after the great success of Paddington.
His father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before he was inspired to write children's books from infancy, said he was hopeful to deny his work, and said that he had the 60th anniversary of his death.
Regarding Paddington, whom he described as "the very important member of our family", he said his father was very proud of his final success.
"He was a quiet man, and he wasn't a bad man," he says.
"Then Paddington was so real to him that your child had achieved some success: you're proud of him, even though you don't have a role in it.
I think he saw the success of Paddington this way.
Although it was his own creation and imagination, he always thanked Paddington himself.
My daughter was on the way to death and I had to say goodbye to the phone.
Soon after the drop, his daughter was taken to Nish Hospital, Louis Pasteur, where doctors tried to save her life.
"Nad called regularly and said it was very bad, and she wouldn't live emotionally," says Mrs. Eden-Lapperoz.
"Then I found Nad's phone and found out that she was going to die in two minutes and I was forced to tell her by the phone.
And that's what I do.
I say, "Tashi, Darling, I love you very much.
I'll come to you soon.
I'll come to you.
The doctors gradually stopped working on her body and went outside.
He died a little while ago and then it all stopped.
There was no way but to wait on my seat.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to keep myself."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Lapperoz, who was crying at the death of her daughter, was on the side of the other passengers - she was different for the difficult situation.
No one knew," he said.
"I had my head down, and my eyes had been filled with tears.
It's impossible to describe it, but I was the partner of Nada's uncontrollably on the plane.
He needs my love and compassion.
I know how good he was.
This sad woman posted a card to kill herself in the storm
Two women, who lost their love for people in suicide, work to stop the suicide of others.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Hamfries Wells Bridge post a card with inspirational messages and keep a phone number where people can call for help.
Miss Davis' son died of depression from 13 years of age and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel what I represent," he said.
45-year-old Miss Davis, who lives in Lidney, said his son was a promising boss and was the owner of a violent laugh.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
Everyone used to say that his house was shining with a smile."
Anyway, he left work before he died because "he was really gone into the dark."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, then 11 years old, was found dead.
Ms. Davis says, "I'm still worried that this will be a challenge."
Miss Davis made a card, "To tell everyone that there is someone you can talk to, he might be a friend.
Don't sit still. You need to talk.
Miss Hamfries, who lost her 15-year-old partner, Miss Davis for many years, after her mother died.
"He never said that his heart was bad or he was poisoned or anything else," he said.
"I took care of some changes in the use of it two days ago.
"He was in a very bad mood on Christmas day - when the kids opened their presents, he didn't even look at them."
He said his death had a huge mental impact on them, but it had to be cut off: "It created a huge void in the family.
We've been separated.
But we have to go and fight."

Brett Kavanf's future question to begin his investigation of FBI
"I thought if we could give something that he wanted - because the investigation is limited, the opportunity is limited - we could probably bring something together," Mr. Flack said on Saturday, and he also said that he was afraid that the committee might "fall apart" in the face of this malicious behaviour.
Why did Mr. Kavanf and his Republican supporters not want an FBI investigation?
Their obligation is related to time.
On 6 November, only five weeks left in the middle of the election - if the Republicans are expected to bear bad fruit, their efforts will be weakened to find people they like in the country's highest court.
George Dubley is calling the Bush senators, and Mr. Bush is investigating Mr. Kavanf, who works in the White House, through whom Mr. Bush is familiar with his wife Ashl, who was the personal saviour of Mr. Bush.
What will happen after submitting the FB I report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are now 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
If Mr. Kavanf can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, it is still not clear that he will be assured by the Supreme Court in the collapse of the Vice-President Mike Pens.
Number of North Korean troops "comes" under Kim
Seven years ago, after Kim Jong-un came into power, the number of North Koreans had dropped, a South Korean legal entity made this statement.
Park Byong-Seg, quoted South Korea's integration ministry as saying that last year's number was 1,127 - which was 2,706.
Mr. Park said that the main reason for the harsh border controls between North Korea and China and for the burden of human traffickers is to press.
Pius Yong has not made any public comments on this.
A large number of refugees from North Korea have been granted citizenship in South Korea.
The Sun reported that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the Korean war ended in 1953.
Most of China has fled, which has the longest border with North Korea and is much easier to cross than the very safe uninhabited zone (DMJed) between two Koreas.
China considers these refugees not as refugees, but as illegal migrants and often forces them to return to their country.
Relations between North and South Korea - who are still in the war - have improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met for a discussion in Pyongyang, whose focus was on the divine liberation of the Tham.
It followed a historic meeting in June between President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed to work together to create a nuclear weapon-free Korean sub-island.
But on Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister Ree Yong-ho accused the US of losing progress.
In a speech published in the United Nations in New York, Mr. Rey said, "If there is no confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such a situation we will not separate ourselves first."
Nancy Pelosse Brett Kavanf called "Histeria-Gresto" and said he was unable to perform his duties in the Supreme Court.
The House's few leaders, Nancy Pelosi Suprem Court Nomini, called Bret Kavanof "histeria-Gresto" and said that he was not normally responsible for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi Saturday Austin, Texas, commented on this at a meeting at the Texas Tribune Festival.
Pelocy said about his reaction to the witness about Kavanf in front of the Senate jury on Thursday, "I couldn't imagine that if any woman had ever done such a thing, she would be called "Histeria-Grut".
Kavanf Zor said he denied the complaint that he had sex with Dr. Christine Blaji when they were both young.
During his initial statement, Kavanf was excited to talk about his family and high school life and was caught up in the breath.
He explicitly condemns the Democrats in the committee and accuses liberals of a "democratic and federal character" that Hillary Clinton is doing this out of the rage of Har's presidential election in 2016.
Palosy says he believes Kavanf's testimony proves that he is not worthy of the Supreme Court, because it has proved that he is biased against the Democrats.
"I think he himself has proved himself unworthy of the statement he has made and the way he has led Clinton and the Democrats," he says.
When asked if he would curse if Kavanf was certain and if the democrats got the majority in the house, Pelosi would say no.
"I'll say that if he doesn't speak to Congress or FB I, he's not only in the Supreme Court, but in the Court he's also in the court he's in."
Kavanf is the judge of the DC Circuit Court of Apples.
Pelosy adds that as a democrat, he is concerned that Kavanf Afordable would oppose the act or Ro V. Wade because he himself is a conservative justice.
To hear his confirmation, Kavanf has avoided changing some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
"It can't be that Histeria-Greece will go to court and tell us, 'It's not great,' says Pelossey.
And women should control it.
This is a fair debate, month and year after year of anger, and he can't be crying.
"When we get angry, we cry," Miss Steinem told me after 45 years.
"I don't think it's fair, what do you say?"
He also said, "A woman executive helped me a lot, who said that she was angry, but she chose this complaint that when she was angry and started to cry, she said to the person she was talking to, "You might think I'm sorry because I'm crying.
I'm really mad."
Then he went on.
I thought it was amazing."
The tears are partly an expression of anger, because they are mainly a victim of misunderstandings.
First of all, I had a quick memory of a job, a man-chief office, where I once saw myself crying in incredible anger, an old woman held my scarf - who was a bad manager I always feared - who took me down to the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry," he told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy to see you."
Patrick Schroeder, who then worked with Colorado Democratic Congressman, during Gary Hart's election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in a boat called Manky Business abroad and left the competition for dirty work, Miss Schroeder was deeply disappointed that he had no reason to be a candidate for his own president.
"It wasn't a very thoughtful decision," she said in laughter 30 years later.
"There are already seven other candidates in the fight, and no one else wants to.
One of them said, "Snow White and Seven Bammon."
At the start of the campaign, he was late for the festival and therefore promised that he would not be able to name the race without raising $2 million.
It was a war.
He saw that if a supporter gave a man $1,000, he was only given $250.
"What do they think I'm going to get?" he says surprised.
When he announced that he was not carrying out an official campaign, he was deeply moved by his feelings and thanks to his supporters, which made it difficult to collect funds because of the disappointment of the Deoja system, with the exception of representatives, he targeted the voters, and became angry about sexuality.
"You might remember that my nervousness has occurred," Ms. Schroeder said.
"You might think that Klinex is my corporate sponsor.
Remember, I thought where would they bury me?
"He's crying?"
How can this trade war in the United States go against Beijing?
The first summit of the U.S.-China trade war was horrendous, and when the war ended, the two countries could benefit from the Beijing long-term fight, like experts.
President Donald Trump of the United States, the solar panel, expats and aluminum is the first to warn of China's major waste products this year.
The most significant response is this week, when new shells are placed at almost half the total imports from China, of which about 200 billion dollars (150 billion pounds).
Beijing has taken revenge like every time - more recently they have increased between five and ten percent of US dollars' worth of food.
China's eyes have decided to fight, and the world's second largest economy will not be able to see soon.
Washington's claim to kill Washington was well-founded, but Chinese President Chi Jinping would be very disrespectful to the public to lower his head to the United States.
However, experts say that if Beijing can play cards correctly, the pressure of the US trade war can help China to reduce its dependence on two economies in the long term.
"Any quick political decision by Washington or Beijing can lead to economic downturns in both countries, much more dangerous than the idea of the Waqibhal Palace," said researcher Abigail Grace of the Center for New American Security, who is studying with Asia.
Syria 'prepared' to return its refugees, Foreign Minister.
Syria has said that the country is ready to return to its homes for refugees, and they have asked the war-torn country to be rebuilt for seven years.
While the United Nations is speaking in general, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Mualem says the country is improving.
"The situation today is stable and secure because of the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he says.
The government has continued its return to the areas that have been destroyed by terrorists.
The situation is now well suited for the voluntary return of people who are forced to leave the country because of terrorism and the economic situation around them.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million people have left the country since the war began in 2011.
The remaining 6 million people from the country are in need of human assistance.
Al-Moualem says the Syrian government welcomes all assistance to rebuild the country.
But he also insists that no specific aid will be accepted or that the aid of the rebel countries will not be accepted.

It's been a bad year.
Thanks to Thomas for choosing me and trusting me.
I'm so happy to get the cup back.
It's the success of the team, I'm glad I was able to help," says Garcia, excitedly from the European side.
He took responsibility for his country's R.A., who lost the US Legend Golfer Woods on Sundays 2 and 1 in Singles.
"I'm so proud to lose Tiger Woods, I've grown up to see him," says 23-year-old John Ame.
Woods lost his four matches in France, and his record in the Ryder Cup was 13-21-3.

This morning we put a little pressure on Europe.
We couldn't.

All of his 12 players have played very well.
"We'll stand back, I'll work with the U.S. P.G. and the Ryder Coffee Committee and move on.
I love these 12 people and am proud to be their president.
You have to respect them.
We are not up to play."
