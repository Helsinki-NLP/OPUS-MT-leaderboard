Rapid increase in the cumulative incidence of coronary disease (COVID-19) within the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom between 1 January and 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronary disease cases (COVID-19) shows similar developments in the countries of the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, confirming that, although at different stages, the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly progressing across all countries.
According to Italy's experience, countries, hospitals and intensive care services need to prepare for a peak of patients with COVID-19 in need of care, and in particular intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, a home for unknown etiology pneumonia was reported in Wuhan, in the province of Hubei, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Chinese Centre for Disease Prevention and Control designated the agent responsible as a new coronavirus now known as coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been baptized as a result of the SARS-CoV-2 infection.
To date, about 80 per cent of people affected by COVID-19 have a beneficial condition, i.e. respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, most of which are cured.
In about 14 per cent of cases, COVID-19 has a more severe approach requiring hospitalization, while 6 per cent of remaining cases develop a serious form of disease requiring intensive care.
The mortality rate of patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 is approximately 4%.
As part of this study, we evaluate the evolution of the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each of the countries of the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (U.S.), and compare it with the evolution experienced by the Province of Hubei in China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom with Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Cases of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
After China, COVID-19 continued to spread, and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world are now following that of that country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) said that COVID-19 was a pandemic.
In the 5 March 2020 Eurosurveillance, Spiteri et al. reported the first cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Europe following the definition of WHO cases.
Within the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 by persons coming from Wuhan, in the Province of Hubei, China.
As of 15 March 2020, cases of COVID-19 were detected in each of the 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (U.S.) with, between 31 December 2019 and that date, 39 768 cases and 1,727 reported deaths, including 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths for Italy alone.
Cumulative number and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (CEPCM), the number of cases of COVID-19 reported in each country worldwide, obtained only from official sources such as health ministries, national and regional health authorities in the various countries and WHO, is updated daily at 08:00.
These data were used to assess the evolution of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, and to compare it with Italy's experience.
In order to assess the prevalence of active cases of COVID-19, we calculated the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases, taking into account the natural evolution of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, for the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also compared the cumulative number of cases reported in each country on 15 March 2020 to 8 a.m. with data from Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Development of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
The evolution of the cumulative 14-day incidence of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and the United Kingdom generally followed that of the Province of Hubei (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, the cumulative impact of COVID-19 began to grow around 21 February before a dramatic increase around 28 February 2020 (additional data).
This change was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of reported cases in Italy, but all other EU/EEA and UK countries presented a similar increase in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (additional data).
Figure 2 presents the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom in relation to Italy data for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
It is noted that by 15 March at 8 a.m., 15 other EU/EEA and the United Kingdom had already reported a total number of cases comparable to that of Italy only 3 weeks ago or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported cases of COVID-19 is increasing rapidly within the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom.
The evolution of the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggests that the pandemic progresses at a comparable rate in all countries.
This is despite the fact that countries are at different stages and that there are differences in responses from national public health services, potential variations in case definitions, and differences in patient selection protocols to be tested for the purpose of confirmation of COVID-19, including for screening tests.
At the beginning of March 2020, doctors in affected regions in Italy indicated that approximately 10% of patients affected by COVID-19 needed intensive care, and the media reported that hospitals and intensive care services in those regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on admission of cases of COVID-19 in hospitals and/or in intensive care are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (data not provided).
However, a systematic collection is needed to complement current monitoring data that focus on the number of reported cases and deaths.
A 2010-11 study showed a significant difference in the number of beds available in intermediate and intensive care services in Europe, ranging from 29.2 beds for 100,000 people in Germany to 4.2 beds in Portugal.
This means that countries have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds in intensive and intermediate care for 100,000 people in 2010-11).
Modelling scenarios for care capacity saturation, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and the United Kingdom of the prevalence of COVID-19 hospitalized cases associated with a risk of > 90% excess capacity in intensive care, are provided in the sixth update of the COVID-19 CEPCM rapid risk assessment.
Given that cases have been grouped up to then in certain EU/EEA and UK countries, and that hospitals and intensive care services generally host a defined regional population, case data and intensive care beds should preferably be established at Level 2 of the Nomenclature of Statistical Territorial Units (NUTS 2).
Italy's experience and current developments in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly progressing within the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care services should therefore prepare themselves for a sustained community transmission scenario of SARS-CoV-2 and for an increase in the number of patients affected by COVID-19 who require care, and in particular intensive care, as in the affected regions of Italy.
As highlighted by the recent rapid risk assessment of CEPCM, a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-COV-2, by moving from a narrowing approach to a mitigation approach, as the rapid and early increase in the number of cases may not allow sufficient time for decision makers and hospitals to understand, accept and adapt their response accordingly, if nothing has been implemented.
The rapid risk assessment also includes public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a short window during which each country will be able to strengthen its control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure on health services.
Without that, it is likely that the health systems of other EU/EEA countries will have to deal with a peak of patients requiring intensive care in the days or weeks to come.
The epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (CVID-19), caused by coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SRAS) (SARS-CoV-2), has so far caused more than 3,000 deaths and infected more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, causing a humanitarian disaster.
Like its counterpart, SARS-CoV, which resulted in thousands of SARS cases in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could be transmitted by mice and caused similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has less severity and mortality than SARS, but it is much more communicable, and it affects older people than young men and more men than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on this emerging disease, this article strives to provide an appropriate and comprehensive review of this subject of research in full scope.
We will address the fundamentals of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and disease prevention.
While many questions still await answers, we hope that this review will participate in better understanding and eliminating this serious disease.
The Spring Festival, January 25, 2020, has never marked the Chinese, who have been forced to remain closed for the entire duration of the golden week and for many other weeks because of the spread of a new viral disease.
The virus is highly homologous to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SRAS) epidemic in 2003; it was therefore baptized by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020 and the associated disease called coronavirus 19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan and spread rapidly throughout China before expanding to almost 50 other countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, the virus had resulted in more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients hospitalized and more than 3,000 deaths.
For WHO, COVID-19 is "public enemy number 1", potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 works have been published on COVID-19, particularly in the fields of virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report on 7 January 2020 presenting the virus sequence, isolated from several patients.
This review tries to sum up the progress of research on this new subject in full depth.
As soon as possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another coronary disease, the respiratory syndrome of the Middle East (MERS, an epidemic that took place in 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far in terms of disease prevention and prognosis, and we will address some still outstanding but urgent issues.
Coronaviruses are traditionally considered non-mortal pathogens for humans, mainly causing approximately 15% of the common rheumats 4.
However, during this century, we have experienced two highly pathogenic coronaviruses for man, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused an epidemic that started in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, before spreading rapidly to many other countries with high morbidity and mortality.
The current COVID-19 is therefore the third epidemic of recent coronavirus history.
As presented in Fig. Fig.1.1 of the then unknown home of pneumonia was first reported to Wuhan on 31 December 2019 to the Chinese National Health Commission.
Seven days later, the sequence of the coronavirus was revealed.
On 15 January 2020, the first fatal case was reported to Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to neighbouring cities, provinces and countries.
On 20 January, it was reported that health professionals had been infected, suggesting that interhuman transmission was possible.
On 23 January, the city of Wuhan was placed in quarantine with interruption of all its public transport.
On 24 January, the first clinical study on the disease indicated that only 21 patients had been in direct contact with the Wuhan Sea Fruit Market, considered the starting point of the infection with an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, WHO qualified for the global health emergency epidemic.
At the time of the drafting of this report, the disease had already spread to China as well as to almost 50 other countries around the world (Fig.
To the extent that the situation is rapidly changing, the final scope and severity of the epidemic remain to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multicentre study of 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed cases of COVID-19, presented an updated overall view of the epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qqq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, but mostly in the 30-65 age group.
About half (47.7%) of infected persons were over 50 years of age, very few were under 20 years of age, and only 14 were under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more men (0.31/100 000) than women (0.27/100 000).
COVID-19 was developed at home, mainly in the province of Hubei and in the periphery.
The mean duration between the onset of symptoms and the diagnosis of COVID-19 was 5 days (2-9).
The mean incubation period was 4.8 days (3.0-7.2).
The mean duration between the onset of symptoms and death was 9.5 days (4.8-13).
The base reproduction rate (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected persons had increased exponentially until January 23, 2020, which coincided with the massive movements that took place before the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality rate of patients identified as confirmed cases was 1.44 per cent (95 per cent CI: 1.10-1.86 per cent), and the overall mortality rate was 3.06 per cent (95 per cent CI: 2.02-4.59 per cent).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were sex (man), age (≥ 60) and severe pneumonia.
Coronaviruses form a subfamily of large wrapped viruses containing a simple brin RNA.
They can be classified into four genres, i.e. alpha, beta, gamma and delta, the kronavirus known to infect the human belonging to alpha and beta genres.
Glycoprotein Spike (S) of the envelope is associated with angiotensin 2 (ACE2) conversion enzyme and dipeptideyl peptidease-4 (DPP4) of its cellular receptors for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, then a membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA gene is released into the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, the genomic RNA accompanied by envelope glycoproteins and nucleocapside proteins forms the viruses containing viruses, which then merge with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was presented on 10 January 2020.
It was established that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of betacoronavirus, with more than 99.98% of genetic identity among 10 consecutive samples taken on the site of the epidemic, the Huaan Sea Fruit Market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically closer to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
With the help of the transmission electron microscope, SARS-CoV-2 particles were detected in ultrafine sections of human epithelium of respiratory pathways.
Human ACE2 has been identified as a recipient of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 is associated with human ACE2 less strongly than that of SARS-CoV, which coincides with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes a smaller infection than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein coded by the orf3b as well as a secret protein coded by the orf8.
SARS-CoV-2 Orf3b could play a role in viral pathogenity and inhibit the expression of IFNβ; however, the Orf8 does not contain known functional domains or patterns.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, et al., presented the cryo-ME structure of the complete human ACE2 to a resolution of 2.9 Å in complex with the carrier of amino acids B0AT1.
They found that the complex, which had open and closed conformations, was assembled in the form of cement and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could bind two S proteins, providing indications for the recognition and infection of the coronavirus.
B0AT1 could become a therapeutic target for drug cracking in order to eliminate the infection in SARS-CoV-2.
The original host and the intermediate host
It was established that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV came from slums and they were transmitted to Man through the civets and chamelids, respectively.
Following a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, mice were advanced as the native host of SARS-CoV-2, since the new virus is 96% identical to the two Saras-type coronaviruses called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediate host that allowed the virus to cross the species barrier to infect Man remains unknown, and the transmission path is still to be elucidated.
Ji, et al., issued the hypothesis that the virus could have been transmitted from the mice to the human by snakes, which would involve a homologous recombination within the protein S.
According to a study conducted by Guangzhou researchers in China, the pangoline - a long-muscle mammal that feeds on ants, often used in traditional Chinese medicine - could be the average host of SARS-CoV-2 if the genetic homology is judged to be 99% between a coronavirus discovered in the pangoline and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a 1 % gap between the two genomes is a significant difference; therefore, conclusions should be expected to produce concrete evidence (Fig. 33).
The physical-chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still very little known.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at a temperature of 20 °C and a humidity of 40 to 50 %.
SARS-CoV-2 could very well possess similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 appears to be sensitive to ultraviolet rays and at a temperature of 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, ethanol at 75%, chlorine-based disinfectants, peracetic acid, chloroform and other fat solvents, but not chlorhexidine, can effectively inactivate the virus.
The human population as a whole is generally immune to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore vulnerable to the new virus.
At present, no detailed studies have been reported on the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to studies previously carried out on other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig.
In general, when a virus infects a host, it is first recognized by its immune system infused by molecular motive recognition receptors (PRRs), including Type C lectine receptors, Toll type receptors (TLRs), NOD type receptors (NLRs) and RIG-I type receptors (RLRs).
By various means, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells and the synthesis of Type I interferons (IFNs) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, SARS-CoV protein N may allow the virus to escape from immune responses.
Soon, the adaptive immune response joins the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in defense.
T CD4+ cells stimulate cells B that produce specific antibodies to the virus, and T CD8+ cells directly eliminate infected cells.
Help T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to support defense cells.
However, coronavirus can inhibit the functions of T cells by inducing their apoptosis.
Humorous immunity, with supplements such as C3a and C5a as well as antibodies, is also essential to combat viral infection.
For example, isolated antibodies from a restored patient neutralized the MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an excessive reaction of the immune system causes a localized explosion of the number of free radicals, which can lead to serious lung lesions as well as other organs and, in the worst scenario, a multivisceral failure, even death.
The infection in SARS-CoV-2, characterized by a home appearance, is more likely to affect elderly people with comorbidities and pregnant women.
It is widely accepted that people exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune functions are compromised are more likely to be infected than others.
It is estimated that the mean incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1 to 14 days, but more generally than 3 to 7 days after a study in the first 425 cases reported in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period was 3 days on average, for a range ranging from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, concluded with an incubation period of 4.8 days (3.0-7.2) after a population of 8 866 cases.
It is very important for the health authorities to adjust the effective quarantine after the most precise incubation period possible, in order to prevent infected but asymptomatic people from transmitting the virus.
Generally, people exposed to, or infected with, the virus are quarantined for 14 days.
Should the quarantine be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often the first and main symptom of COVID-19, and can be accompanied or not by other symptoms such as dry cough, swelling, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, throat disease, rhinorrhea, thoracic pain, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients had dyspnoea and/or hypoxaemia one week after the onset of the disease.
As regards serious cases, patients rapidly developed acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms as well as those with acute fever, even in the absence of thoracic radiographic anomalies, should be tested for the virus in order to allow an early diagnosis.
A demographic study conducted at the end of December 2019 showed that patients had 98% fever, 76% dry cough, 55% dyspnoea and 3% diarrhoea; 8% of patients needed ventilation assistance.
Similar findings were reported in two recent studies conducted on a family and on a home that appeared following the transmission of the virus from an asymptomatic individual.
Similarly, a demographic study conducted in 2012 showed that the main symptoms of patients affected by MERS-CoV were fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnoea (55%).
However, 80 per cent of patients with COVID-19 require ventilation assistance, which is consistent with a higher safety profile of COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and gorilla disease (21%) were also observed in patients with SMR.
With regard to SARS, it was established that the main symptoms were fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnoea (40%-42%), diarrhoea (20-25%) and gorilla disease (13%-25%), and that ventilation assistance was needed for approximately 14 to 20% of patients.
As at 14 February, the mortality rate of COVID-19 was 2 per cent, for 66,576 cases confirmed worldwide.
Comparably, SARS mortality in November 2002 was 10 per cent for 8,096 confirmed cases.
For the MERS, according to a demographic study conducted in June 2012, mortality was 37% for 2,494 confirmed cases.
A previous study reported that the SARS-CoV-2 R0 reached 6.47 with a confidence interval (IC) at 95% of 5.71-7.23, while the SARS-CoV R0 reached only 2-4.
A comparison of the symptoms, mortality and R0 of SARS-CoV-2, MERCS-CoV and SARS-CoV is presented in Table 1.1.
The above data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a more important capacity to spread than MERCS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is less lethal.
Therefore, it is much more difficult to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than it has been for the MRS-CoV and SARS-CoV epidemics.
The appearance of a home often takes place within a family or within a assembly or a vehicle, as in the case of a cruise.
Patients have often traveled or resided in Wuhan or other affected regions, or have been in contact with infected people or patients within two weeks of the onset of symptoms.
However, it has been demonstrated that individuals can be carriers of the virus without so many symptoms for more than two weeks and that recovery patients can be carriers of the virus again, which underlines the need to increase the quarantine period.
Patients have normal or reduced number of peripheral white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) in the early stages.
For example, a lymphopenia with a number of white blood cells < 4 × 109/L and a number of lymphocytes < 1 × 109/L, as well as a high aspartate aminotransferase and viraemia were identified in 1,099 patients with COVID-19.
Some patients had high blood levels of liver enzymes, muscle enzymes, and myoglobin, and most of them had elevated C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation.
In the most serious cases, the rate of D-dimmer, a product of fibrin degradation present in the blood, was high, and the number of lymphocytes gradually decreased.
Thoracic radiography abnormalities are observed in most patients with COVID-19, characterized by bilateral uneven shadows or depleted glass opacity at lung level.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, acute pulmonary injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA).
In the case of SDRA, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis seriously compromise gas exchange.
The dysfunction of Type I and Type II pneumocytes results in a decrease in the surface surface rate and an increase in surface tension, thus reducing the capacity of the lungs to sink and increasing the risk of pulmonary collapse.
Consequently, the most worrying thoracic examinations often coincide with the most severe form of the disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 revealed a pneumocytosis, the formation of hyalin membranes, an interstitial lymphocyte infiltration, and the presence of multi-nucleated synthetic cells in the lungs of a patient who died from the disease, which coincides with viral infection and SDRA pathology, and is similar to that of patients affected by SRAS and MERS.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA through a chain reaction by polymerase after reverse transcription (RT-PCR) was used as the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of negative false, which may accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for the diagnosis (which was no longer based solely on RT-PCR) in China on 13 February 2020.
A similar situation had been observed for the diagnosis of SARS.
Thus, the combination of medical backgrounds, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological examinations is essential and imperative for effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, Feng Zhang described a SHERLOCK technology-based protocol for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, which identifies synthetic parts of SARS-CoV-2's ARN between 20 × 10-18 mol/L and 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microlitre of sample) with the help of a reactive tape in less than an hour, without the need for sophisticated equipment.
It is to be hoped that this new technique will significantly improve sensitivity and practice if its use on clinical specimens is conclusive.
Due to lack of experience with the new coronavirus, physicians can only provide support to patients with COVID-19, while trying a variety of therapies that have already been used or proposed for the treatment of other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapies include existing and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma of patients who are restored, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
Even the plasma of restored patients was proposed for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are all involved in developing antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily targets the lungs at an early stage and probably also, to a lesser extent, other organs expressing ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.
However, respiratory dysfunction and insufficiency are the main threats to patients, and the main cause of death.
Thus, respiratory assistance is essential to relieve symptoms and save lives; this includes general oxygen therapy, high flow oxygen therapy, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should receive extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (OMEC), a modified cardiopulmonary derivation technique used to treat heart or respiratory impairment.
In addition, the maintenance of electrolyte balance, the prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shocks, as well as the protection of the functions of vital organs are also essential for patients affected by SARS-CoV-2.
An excessive response to the immune system was found to cause cytokine shock in patients with SRAS and MERS.
A cytokinic shock is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a whole series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release a large number of free radicals, which are the main cause of SDRA and multivisceral failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine shocks, especially in serious cases.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, were used to treat cytokine shocks.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokine shocks include the modulation of the immune response by T cells, the blocking of IFN-γ, IL-1 and TNF cytokines, the inhibition of JAK, blinatumomab, the cytokine 4 signal suppressor and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, such as immunosuppressants, have been widely used in the treatment of SARS in order to reduce the severity of inflammatory injuries.
However, high-dose steroids have not had any beneficial effects on severe pulmonary lesions in patients with SRAS and COVID-19.
Instead, they would cause serious side effects, including atrial osteonecrosis, which would significantly affect the prognosis.
However, careful use of low-to-moderate corticosteroids has been recommended for patients with a severe form of COVID-19.
At the time of drafting this report, no effective antiviral therapy has yet been confirmed.
However, the intravenous administration of remdesivir, a nucleoside analogue, has been shown to be effective in an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral medicine originally developed by Gilead for the treatment of Ebola and Marburg-induced diseases.
As a result, remdesivir has also demonstrated a possible inhibition of other simple brin RNA viruses, including MRS and SARS.
In view of these findings, Gilead has sent the component to China to allow a number of tests on individuals infected by SARS-CoV-2, and the results are highly expected.
In addition, baricitinib, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin were advanced as potential treatments for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver injury and other side effects may occur following combination treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other medicinal products used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma of restored patients and antibody production
Collecting blood from patients who have been treated with a contagious disease in order to treat other patients with the same disease or to protect healthy individuals from this disease is an ancestral practice.
In fact, restored patients often have a relatively high rate of antibodies to the pathogen.
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign bodies; they recognize unique molecules in the pathogens and neutralize them directly.
Plasma has thus been removed from the blood of a group of patients who have been treated with COVID-19 and injected into 10 severely affected patients.
Their symptoms have improved within 24 hours, in association with a decrease in inflammation, a reduction in viral load and an increase in oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification are necessary in order to propose this method for large-scale use as long as no specific treatment has been developed.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some adverse reactions associated with plasma should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can cause excessive stimulation of the immune response and cause a cytokines release syndrome, potentially fatal.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is generally low, and the demand for plasma to treat seriously ill patients is important.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies sufficiently quickly to combat a global epidemic.
Therefore, it is more essential and effective to isolate cells B of restored patients and identify the genetic codes with the relevant antibodies or to seek effective antibodies against the main proteins of the virus.
This would quickly increase the production of antibodies.
MTC has been used for millenniums in China to treat a wide variety of diseases.
However, its effects are largely based on the combination of multiple components in a formula that varies according to the diagnosis, based on MTC theories.
Most of the effective components remain little or no known to the extent that it is difficult to extract and verify them, or to know their optimal associations.
At present, due to the absence of specific effective treatment of COVID-19, MTC is one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or in remission of a serious form of disease.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules have been effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
The best cure rates for COVID-19 were observed in provinces of China that had used MTC for 87 per cent of their patients, including the province of Gansu (63.7 per cent), the Ningxia region (50 per cent) and Hunan (50 per cent), while the province of Hubei, which had used only 30% of the patients affected by COVID-19, had the lowest healing rate (13%).
However, this is a rather approximate comparison, as many other impact factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of the disease, need to be taken into account for the evaluation.
On 18 February 2020, Boli Zhang and its collaborators published a study comparing treatment using Western medicine (MO) only and combination treatment associated with MO and MTC.
It has appeared that the time to return to normal body temperature, the time of disappearance of symptoms and the duration of hospitalization were significantly shorter for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group alone.
Even more impressive, the rate of worsening of symptoms (light to severe) was significantly lower for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group alone (7.4% versus 46.2%); mortality was lower for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group alone (8.8% versus 39%).
However, the effectiveness and safety of the MTC remains to be specified through larger-scale controlled tests and more centres.
It would also be interesting to characterise the mechanism of action and clarify the effective components of MTC treatments or their associations, if possible.
Individuals identified as probable or confirmed cases of COVID-19 generally feel a deep concern about this highly infectious and deadly disease, and those placed in quarantine also experience a feeling of boredom, loneliness and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infection, such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as adverse effects of treatment, such as insomnia induced by corticosteroids, may lead to increased anxiety and psychological distress.
In the early days of the SARS epidemic, multiple psychiatric morbidities have been reported, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitement, psychotic symptoms, acute confusion and even suicidal tendencies.
Compulsory search for contacts and quarantine, as part of the response of public health services to the COVID-19 epidemic, can increase anxiety and lead to a certain guilt of the sick with regard to the effects of infection, quarantine, and stigmatization of their families and friends.
For example, mental health care should be provided to patients with COVID-19, to individuals identified as likely cases, to persons in contact with these populations, and to any other individual in distress.
This psychological support must include the training of multidisciplinary teams, a clear communication with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and treatment plans, as well as the use of professional electronic applications and equipment to avoid any close contact.
Effective vaccines are essential to interrupt the transmission chain of animals and human beings infected with vulnerable hosts, and are often complementary to antiviral treatment in the control of outbreaks caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop protein-based S vaccines to produce strong long-term neutralising antibodies and/or to induce protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Attenuated live vaccines were evaluated on animal models for SARS.
However, the in vivo efficacy of these potential vaccines in the elderly and on models submitted to lethal prophylaxis and their protection against infection by a zoonotic virus remains to be determined, as no clinical study has yet been initiated.
This is probably due to the fact that the SARS was extended 17 years ago and that no new cases have been reported since.
On the other hand, cases and sporadic homes of MERS continue to be reported in the Middle East and other regions due to the persistence of zoonic sources in endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies have been developed for SMR using inactivated virus, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-related particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated on animal models.
The development of a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for non-immunized individuals is an urgent and essential objective for monitoring the current epidemic.
However, this is a real challenge because of the significant time lag (18 months on average) needed to develop a vaccine and dynamic variations in the coronavirus.
To the extent that this is an emerging disease, COVID-19 is just beginning its clinical development through thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients recover gradually without sequelae.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality for the most serious cases.
Therefore, establishing a forecast model is essential for health agencies to be able to prioritise their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
According to clinical studies conducted so far, the factors that may affect or be associated with the prognosis of patients affected by COVID-19 are as follows (Table 33):
Age: age was the main factor for SARS prognosis, and this also seems to be the case for COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly affects individuals aged 30 to 65 years, with 47.7% more than 50 years of age, according to a study conducted in 8 866 cases, as described above.
Patients in need of intensive care were more likely to have underlying comorbidities and complications and were significantly older (mean age 66 to 51 years), thus suggesting age as a prognosis factor for patients with COVID-19.
Sex: SARS-CoV-2 infected more men than women (0.31/100 000 versus 0.27/100 000), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: patients with COVID-19 needing intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute heart injury and arrhythmia.
Cardiac events were also the main cause of death in patients with RAS.
It has been established that SARS-CoV-2 may also be associated with positive colangiocytes of ACE2, which may result in hepatic dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.
It should be noted that the age and presence of underlying health problems are highly correlated and may interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: the C-reactive protein rate (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury; it has been advanced as a factor of potential prognosis of the disease, response to treatment and healing.
The correlation between the CRP rate and severity as well as the prediction of COVID-19 was also proposed.
In addition, a high rate of dehydrogenase lactate (LDH), aminotransferase aspartate (AST), aminotransferase alanine (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) may also be involved in establishing the prognosis.
These enzymes are widely expressed in several organs, especially at the heart and liver level, and are released in case of tissue injury.
Thus, they are traditionally heart or liver dysfunction markers.
Major clinical symptoms: the results of thoracic radiography and the temporary progression of clinical symptoms should be considered in conjunction with the other elements to determine the prognosis and complications of COVID-19.
Use of steroids: as described above, steroids are commonly used immunosuppressants in support of infectious diseases in order to reduce the severity of inflammatory injuries.
Since high-dose corticosteroids have been widely used in severe cases of SARS, many survivors have presented atrial osteonecrosis resulting in permanent disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, the administration of steroids to patients with COVID-19 should be limited to a low dose and short duration.
Mental stress: as described above, the COVID-19 epidemic has resulted in a large number of exceptional cases of stress, patients who often have long periods of quarantine, extreme uncertainty, and the death of loved ones or other patients.
It is imperative to offer psychological support and support over the long term in order to help these individuals overcome this stress and find a normal life.
According to demographic studies carried out so far, COVID-19 appears to have epidemiological characteristics different from those of the SARS.
In addition to replication in lower respiratory pathways, SARS-CoV-2 is also effectively replicationd in upper respiratory pathways and does not or does not present any symptoms in the first phase of the infection, such as coronavirus at the origin of the common rums.
As a result, newly infected individuals or during incubation can produce a large amount of viruses during their daily activities, which significantly impedes the control of the epidemic.
However, it was considered that SARS-CoV was transmitted by severely ill patients, with a very low probability of transmission in the first phase.
The current epidemic of COVID-19 is therefore far more serious and difficult to control than that of the SARS.
Significant efforts are currently being made in China, including the bordering of Wuhan and neighbouring cities, as well as the continued quarantine of the almost total population with a view to interrupting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures had a dramatic impact on the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new cases declined, indicating a slowdown in the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimates suggest that the epidemic will end in March and that the decline phase will last from 3 to 4 months.
However, not all experts share this optimism.
Paul Hunter, et al., believes that the COVID-19, which appears to be much more infectious than the SARS, will not expand in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., established a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and concluded that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 had been detected in the mid-nasal cortex and the throat of restored patients, 2 weeks after their exit from the hospital, indicating that the newly identified virus could become a cyclical episode like influenza.
However, encouraging signs have been observed in China with the gradual reduction of new cases, suggesting that the strategies implemented would have worked.
According to the initial estimates, the Ebola virus was expected to result in up to one million cases and one and a half million deaths.
However, due to quarantine and strict isolation, the disease was finally placed under control.
It is possible, as for SARS-CoV, that SARS-CoV-2 weakens in terms of infection to eventually expand or develop into a less pathogenic virus co-existing with Man.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with the SARS and MERS epidemic is provided below (Figure 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmitable by touch or eternation, and possibly by direct contact with contaminated materials.
The virus has also been identified in seals, thus revealing a new possibility of feco-oral transmission.
A recent study in 138 patients revealed that 41% of cases were possibly due to nosocomial infections, with 17 patients with previous diseases and 40 health professionals.
Care should therefore be taken to protect individuals, including health professionals, social workers, relatives and colleagues of the patient, and even anyone who is likely to be in contact with patients or infected persons.
The first line of defense possible to reduce the risk of infection lies in the port of facial masks; the use of surgical masks and respiratory masks N95 (1860) is involved in controlling the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks prevent the projection of potentially infected drops or their deposit on surfaces, where they could be transmitted to other people.
However, only the N95 (1860) masks provide protection against inhaling 10 to 80 nm virions, with only 5% of fully penetrated virions; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size, as both measure approximately 85 nm.
Since particles can pass through five surgical masks stacked on each other, it is imperative that health professionals in direct contact with patients wear N95 (1860s) and not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health professionals need to wear adjusted insulation bubbles to further reduce contact with viruses.
Viruses can also infect an individual by eye.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor proved to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 even though he wore a mask N95; the virus could have penetrated his body through an eyelid due to inflammation.
Therefore, health professionals should also have transparent views or protection glasses in contact with patients.
For populations in affected or potentially affected regions, it is strongly recommended to wash hands with soap that is more often disinfected than usual, to remain confined to the maximum and to limit any contact with potentially infected people.
It is recommended to maintain a distance of one metre with the sick.
These measures are effective means of reducing the risk of infection and preventing the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus for humans, its high degree of homology with SARS-CoV, as reported on January 7, 2020, must have placed China as a high alert after the SARS epidemic in 2003.
However, on 19 January 2020, the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention would reassure the population by saying that the new virus was scarce, that it had limited inter-human transmission and that it would not be difficult to prevent and contain the disease.
This message led to a significant release, particularly at the time when the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the critical opportunity to contain the disease in Wuhan was missing.
The Chinese disease control agencies must learn from this and take the necessary measures.
For example, these agencies must (1) be more cautious in their public announcements, as each word accounts and can affect the behaviour and decisions of the population; (2) be more sensitive and responsive to unusual clinical data rather than expect formal reports of doctors or official bodies; (3) be more restrictive in order to contain a potential epidemic at its beginnings than to try to reassure the population; and (4) be more targeted and relevant to raise awareness of epidemic diseases, but also to test and improve the response system of society regularly.
The COVID-19 epidemic caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus started at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, at the time of the drafting of this report, it extended to China as well as to almost 50 other countries around the world.
To the extent that this virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms of COVID-19 are also close to those of the SARS, the epidemic of COVID-19 is born as an impression of already seen.
However, there are significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which should be taken into account in order to contain the epidemic and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects older people than younger people and more men than women; severity and mortality rates are also more important in older people.
SRAS has a higher mortality than that of COVID-19 (10.91 per cent versus 1.44 per cent).
The transmission of COVID-19 virus is possible even in the absence of symptoms, while the SRAS was mostly transmitted by severely ill patients; therefore, it is much more difficult to contain the spread of COVID-19.
This explains in part why SARS-CoV-2 spread much faster and much wider than SARS-CoV.
Regular SARS-CoV-2 ARN detection tests may prove negative for some patients with COVID-19.
On the other hand, patients who are restored may be again positive for the virus.
This significantly increases the risk of proliferation.
Despite the rapid progress of research on COVID-19, a number of critical issues remain pending, including:
Where does SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although a 96% genetic homology has been established between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-type coronaviruses from mice, this is not sufficient to conclude with certainty that SARS-CoV-2 comes from chiropteras.
What is the intermediate species that has allowed the transmission of the virus from the initial host, such as the mice, to man?
Without answers to questions 1 and 2, it is impossible to effectively interrupt the transmission, and the epidemic can resume at any time.
Molecular modelling and biochemical analyses have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is related to ACE2, but how does the virus penetrate exactly into respiratory tract cells and how does it cause pathological changes?
Is the virus also linked to cells expressing the ACE2 of other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, it is impossible to define a quick and accurate diagnosis or effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve genetically during interhuman transmission?
Will it evolve into a global pandemic, disappear as the SARS or resurface regularly as the flu?
It is essential, even if it may take time, to find answers to all these questions as well as to many others.
However, no matter what the cost, we have no choice but to put an end to this epidemic as soon as possible in order to resume the normal course of our existence.
Generally, the incubation period of these two viruses is less than one week, followed by approximately 2 weeks of disease.
Only rare immunodepressed patients have had a severe infection of the lower respiratory tract.
The first case of SARS dates back to the end of 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
Regardless of the supertransmitters, it was estimated that each case could produce approximately two secondary cases with an incubation period of between 4 and 7 days, the peak of the viral load on the 10th day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially have myalgia, headache, fever, malaise and chills, followed by dyspnoea, cough and respiratory distress as late symptoms.
Lymphopaenia, false liver function tests and high creatinine are common abnormalities observed in laboratory analyses in case of suspected SARS.
There are also widespread alveolar lesions, proliferation of epithelial cells and increased macrophages in patients with RAS.
Some 20 to 30% of patients then require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to lower respiratory pathways, several organs including gastrointestinal, liver and kidney pathways can also be infected in these severe cases, often accompanied by cytokinic shock, which can be fatal especially in immunodepressed patients.
Since then, enormous efforts have been made to research on HCV.
The HCV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
Initially, it was prevalent in young children, elderly people and immunodepressed patients with respiratory disease.
The presence of coryza, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis is common in the disease caused by HCV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from the nasal collection of an 8-month-old boy with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although he has been identified in the Netherlands, he is actually present worldwide.
The HCV-NL63 is associated with an obstructive laryngitis, also called crop.
In the same year, HCV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man hospitalized for pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
Like HCV-NL63, HCV-229E and HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1 is present worldwide, causing moderate respiratory disease.
Generally, when these HCVs acquire the ability to transmit effectively and continuously in humans, they also become less virulent or pathogens.
Another secondary epidemic occurred in South Korea in 2015, with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to those of SARS and are characterized by an evolving acute pneumonia.
In contrast to SARS, many patients with MERS have also developed acute renal failure, which is characteristic of MERS compared to HCV pathologies.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
As of 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 confirmed cases in laboratories were reported at a high death rate, or 34.4 per cent, which makes the MERS-CoV one of the most known deadly viruses in humans.
Diarrhoea is also observed in some patients.
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogenic, but more transmitable than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and could contribute to its rapid spread worldwide.
The comparison and opposition of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCV revealed very interesting similarities and differences.
First, the incubation period and the duration of HCV diseases are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the overall trend of the other six HCVs.
Secondly, the severity of the symptoms of COVID-19 is between SARS-CoV and the four community HCV (i.e. HCV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1 and HCV-NL63).
On the other hand, a small subgroup of severe cases of COVID-19 is also observed as in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Finally, like the other HCV, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in seal samples.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, its pathogenity and its long-term spread after transmission to humans, will influence the ultimate fate of the current COVID-19 epidemic.
The four community HCV causes moderate symptoms have been well adapted to man.
In other words, both could be survivors of previous HCV pandemics.
In order for this to happen, HCV should be replicated in humans in a sufficient proportion to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that make up the host restriction factors.
In this perspective, the more the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic persists and the more infected people are important, the more likely the virus is fully adapted to man.
If appropriate, its transmission between men will be difficult to stop by quarantine or other measures to control infections.
For many years, the four CoVs in the community have been circulating within the population, triggering a simple space in immunocompetent subjects.
These viruses don't need an animal reservoir.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, highly pathogenic, have not been well adapted to man and their transmission between men is not sustainable.
They must maintain and spread in their zoonic tanks and seek an opportunity to reach potential human targets, probably through one or more intermediate hosts and amplifiers.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four HCV acquired in the community.
However, it is more pathogenic than HCV acquired in the community and less pathogenic than SARS-Cov or MERS-COV.
It remains to be seen whether it will be fully adapted to human beings and will circulate among them without reserve or intermediate animal hosts.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCV, it will be useful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the evolving, natural, reservoirs, intermediates and amplifiers of HCV.
An animal serves as an evolving host of an HCV if it covers a close ascendant sharing a high homology at the level of the nucleotide sequence.
The virus of origin has often been well adapted and is not pathogenic to its host.
Similarly, a reserve host covers the HCV in a continuous and long-term manner.
On the other hand, HCVs can also adapt to the intermediate host and even establish a long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes a natural reserve host.
In particular, since 80% of Guangzhou market animals have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibility that several species of small mammals can also be used as amplifiers cannot be excluded.
These mice are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and for the genomic sequence of SARSR-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These studies laid the foundations for a new concept that the mice are hosts of emerging human pathogens.
The human angiotensin 2 (ACE2) conversion enzyme is known as the SARS-CoV receptor.
Despite a high homology between these two viruses, it is generally estimated that WIV1 is not the immediate parent of SARS-CoV and that mice are not the host of the SARS-CoV.
That's why mice can't be the MERS-CoV intermediate tank host.
In addition to studies conducted in the Middle East, it has been shown that snorkelers were seropositive to specific antibodies neutralizing the MERS-CoV, as well as the camels originating in the Middle East present in several African countries.
In addition, infected camels excite the virus not only by respiratory pathways but also by fecal pathways, which is also the main route of excretion of mice.
We cannot rule out the possibility that pangolin is one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 is even less important than that which separates beta-CoV associated with SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 from pangoline.
Recombination is a common factor in the development of beta-CoVs.
Scientists remain divided on the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCV, zoonotic origins of HCV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCV-NL63 and HCV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Phylogenetic evidence indicates that HCV-NL63 and HCV-229E could both be derived from the coV of mice, whereas parent viruses of HCV-OC43 and HCV-HKU1 were found in rodents.
On the other hand, the HCV-229E was genetically associated with another coV of hot cheese, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, detected in Ghana, while Camelides were also suspected of being intermediate hosts.
When the HCV-OC43 crossed the species barrier to infect humans from domestic livestock around 1890, a pandemic of respiratory infection was reported.
The history of the inter-species transmission of the HCV-229E is less clear.
Alpha-CoV of the close HCV-229E cavities have been found.
First of all, unlike alpagas, men can have contact with mice in a shared ecological niche.
On the other hand, humans have close contacts with alpagas.
Then, the alpha-CoV of the HCoV-229E-related mice are numerous and non-pathogenic in the mice, while the alpha-CoV of the alpaga has caused an epidemic of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, the Alpha-CoV of the alpaga was not found in wild animals.
In fact, mice are the direct source of human pathogens, including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
It is therefore not surprising that mice can transmit HCV-229E directly to humans.
Another possibility, while the alpha-CoV of the mice serves as a genetic reservoir of the HCV-229E, alpagas and rudders could serve as intermediate hosts transmitting the viruses to humans, just as in the case of the MERS-CoV.
The MERS-CoV is an excellent example of the inter-species transmission of mice to rudders and rudders to humans.
The evolving origin of the MERS-CoV found in mice is known by its initial identification and has also been strengthened by subsequent discoveries.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV has been present in slums for decades.
It has adapted well to these camels that have passed from intermediate to stable natural reservoir.
Unlike the role of camels in the transmission of the MERS-CoV, the role of the pangolins in the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2, if they have one, is different.
In particular, pangoline beta-COVs are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
Several possibilities for inter-species transmission of SARS-CoV-2 animals to humans have been included or excluded from future studies.
First of all, mice may be the host of a virus related to SARS-CoV-2 almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Human beings could share an ecological niche with the mice through decomposition or coal mines.
Secondly, pangolins could be one of the intermediate amplifier hosts to which a SARS-CoV-2-related virus has recently been introduced.
Human beings contract the virus by decontamination and meat consumption of hives.
Many mammals, including pets, may be sensitive to SARS-CoV-2.
Thirdly, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have taken place in a third species that have been in contact with both mice and pangolins.
Research on the animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 is under way.
Compared to other single-bred RNA viruses, the estimated exchange rates of CoV could be considered "moderate" to "high" with an average replacement rate of ~10-4 per year per site, depending on the phase of adaptation of CoV to new hosts.
However, CoV mutation rates are about a million times higher than those of their hosts.
In addition, the rate of mutation is often high when CoVs are not well adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV, with a high rate of mutation, the rate of mutation of SARS-CoV-2 is apparently lower, suggesting a higher rate of adaptation to man.
It can be assumed that it has already adapted to another close host of humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which has been well adapted to road users.
In theory, the genetic derivative is unlikely to render vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective in the short term.
Third, the CoVs change randomly and frequently as a model when the NRA is replicated by a unique "choice-copy" mechanism.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found for both HCV-HKU1 and HCV-OC43, as well as for CoV observed in animals, such as SL-CoV and BatCoV-HKU9.
Virus-host interaction related to transmission
In addition to these three viral factors listed above, the viral interaction with a host receptor is another key factor affecting inter-species transmission.
The recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example here; it also shows positive selection evidence during inter-species transmission episodes.
In other words, these two amino acids substitutions can be key factors in the adaptation of the virus to man.
It is interesting to note that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor as SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 protein unit means that the affinity of this S protein with human ACE2 may have been altered.
In fact, a study by electronic cryomicroscope indicates an affinity 10 to 20 times higher than that observed between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S protein.
It will also be interesting to determine whether another co-receptor may be required for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Incrediblely, HCV-NL63 is also associated with ACE2 but with a different part of protein S.
There are many other HCV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCV-229E, and 9-O-acetylated silica for HCV-OC43.
The diversity of host proteins between humans and host natural HCV reservoirs, such as mice, ruminants and rodents, could constitute a barrier to interspecies transmission.
New HCV emergency: return to the departure box
The diversity of the coVs of hot-souris offers many opportunities for emerging new HCV.
In this sense, the coVs of mice are the genetic reserves of HCV.
Among the accessory proteins of SARS-CoV, ORF8 was considered important in human adaptation, given that SARS-CoV-related hemorrhage viruses were isolated, but coded different ORF8 proteins.
This removal breaks the ORF8 in ORF8a and ORF8b and is present as an adaptive mutation that promotes host change.
Recombination sites have also been identified in nsp9, in most nsp10 and in some nsp14.
Similarly, it has been demonstrated that the MERS-CoV epidemic has experienced episodes of re-combination between different lines, which occurred among drominarians in Saudi Arabia.
While an ORF4 could be observed in the HCoV-229E-associated mice and camels viruses, the alpha-CoV of the alpaga presents a simple insertion of nucleotide, resulting in a breakdown of the reading framework.
Finally, the evolution of new HCVs is also stimulated by the selective pressure exerted in their reserve hosts.
Asymptomatic cases or moderate symptoms were detected when the mice were infected with CoVs, indicating mutual adaptation between the CoVs and the mice.
It seemed that the mice were well adapted to the CoV from anatomical and physiological point of view.
For example, abnormalities in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in mice effectively reduce the pathology triggered by CoVs.
In addition, the high level of oxygen-reactive derivatives (DROs) generated by high metabolic activity of mice could both suppress the replication of the CoV and affect the "relecture" by exoribonuclease, which would create selective pressure and give rise to highly pathogenic viral strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogen coV strains could also develop by recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for the adaptation of the host.
Thus, it is not a coincidence that three new HCVs have appeared in the last two decades.
CoVs are not pathogens or cause moderate symptoms in their hosts to reserve such as mice and camels.
They reply solidly without causing a strong immune response from the host.
This is where the secrets of the observation of asymptomatic carriers and of what causes severe cases of infection in humans remain.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to the hyperactivation of the immune response and cytokinic shock; the more the immune response is strong, the more pulmonary lesions are severe.
On the other hand, among asymptomatic carriers, the immune response was cut off from the CoV replica.
The same strategy of dissociating the immune response could have beneficial effects in the treatment against SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, the administration of type I interferon at least in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome is defective in mice.
Based on this reasoning, inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammation with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
While a beta-CoV of couve-soul sharing 95% of nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV has been discovered, there is also a couve-souling couve sharing 96% of nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Beneficial pangoline beta-COV similar to SARS-CoV-2 have been discovered, indicating that pangoline may be one of the intermediate hosts or that pangoline beta-COV could contribute to the genetic fragments of the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
The CoVs came under the ramp fires due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV has existed in the shipyard for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transport and a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the premises.
They are very present in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, as was done on the markets of wild animals in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to stop the recurrent epidemics of MERS, a global approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV in camels, associated with other measures to control the infection.
Since we are unable to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could emerge and cause epidemics.
Several zoonotic CoVs circulate in nature.
In particular, the coVs of hairdressers, whose zoonotic potential is very high.
The culture of the consumption of wild animals in certain regions of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contacts between humans and animals.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a long time.
They remain in their own natural reservoirs until an opportunity of accounting is presented.
Continued monitoring of mammals is needed to better understand the ecology of the CoVs and their natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of animals to humans and future epidemics.
To conclude, the most effective way for humans to prevent viral zoonoses is to stay away from the ecological niches of natural zoonoses reservoirs.
First, if mice transmit a parental SARS-CoV-2 virus to the pangolins, it would be interesting to observe under what circumstances mice and pangolins could share the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if mice play a more direct role in the transmission to humans, it should be determined how humans come into contact with mice.
Thirdly, if a third mammal plays the role of a true intermediate host, it remains to clarify how it interacts with the different species, including men, mice and pangolins.
Whether it's a snorkel, pangoline or another mammal, we should be able to identify SARS-CoV-2 or the almost identical parent viruses observed in their natural hosts.
It is possible to contract respiratory diseases such as flu or rum, for example by not washing your hands before touching your eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes).
The main medical objective of hand washing is to eliminate pathogen agents (bacteria, viruses or other micro-organisms that may cause diseases) and chemicals, which may be harmful or cause diseases.
Hand washing has many benefits for health, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhoea; reducing respiratory infections;
as well as reducing the infant mortality rate in domestic shelters.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates related to respiratory and diarrhoea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioural changes, such as washing hands in the soap.
Pneumonia, one of the main IRAs, is the first cause of mortality among children under five years of age, making nearly 1.8 million victims a year.
Together, diarrhea and pneumonia cause the death of nearly 3.5 million children each year.
Hand washing also protects from impetigo, which is transmitted by direct physical contact.
Minor deleterious effect, frequent washing of hands can lower the skin by causing skin drying.
A 2012 Danish study revealed that excessive hand washing could lead to echemia or a dermatitis at the hands level, characterized by squeezing skin and removals, and especially frequent among health workers.
Hand washing is also considered to be one of the symptoms of compulsive obsessive disorder (TOC).
The disparity twice a year, associated with daily washing of hands in soap and daily brushing of teeth with fluorinated toothpaste, is at the heart of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The main action of soap and detergents is to reduce barriers to solution and increase solubility.
Water alone is not an effective cleaner for the skin as lipids and proteins, which are organic substances of the soil, are difficult to soluble in water.
The solid soap, due to its reusable nature, may contain bacteria from previous uses.
To date, there is no evidence suggesting that the use of antibodies or recommended disinfectants allows the target of antibiotics in nature.
Therefore, even if antibiotic resistant strains are not the result of antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as announced.
In addition to the most complex formulations (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) used to regulate pH, benzoic acid, having an antimicrobial function, and other protective agents (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, extracts from plants).A rigorous analysis by the University of Oregon's University of Public Health revealed that regular soaps were as effective as antibacterial soaps for individuals and containing triclosan to prevent diseases and eliminate hand bacteria.
The hot water used to wash hands is not hot enough to kill the bacteria.
The bacteria multiply much faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, saltwater and soapy water is more effective than cold water and soapy water to eliminate natural oils that contain salads and bacteria.
However, contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that the use of tidal water did not contribute to reducing the microbial burden on the hands.
A hand disinfectant or an antiseptic is a non-aqueous hand hygiene product.
Most are formulated on the basis of isopropyl alcohol or ethanol associated with a thickening agent such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) to obtain a gel, or a moisturizer such as glycerin in order to obtain a liquid or foam for greater ease of use and reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
The addition of diluted hydrogen peroxide strengthens antimicrobial activity.The disinfectants for hands containing at least 60 to 95 % alcohol effectively eliminate germs.
Hydroalcoholic solutions kill bacteria, multi-resistant bacteria (SARM and ELV), tuberculosis and certain viruses (including HIV, herpes, VRS, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis), as well as fungi.
Hydroalcoholic solutions are almost entirely ineffective against the norovirus virus (or Norwalk), the main cause of infectious gastroenteritis.A sufficient amount of disinfectant for the hands or hydroalcoholic solution must be used to moisturize or cover both hands.
The increased use of these products is due to their ease of use and rapid disposal of micro-organisms; however, they must not replace an adequate hand washing unless you have water and hand-held soap.
The frequent use of hydroalcoholic solutions may result in skin drying if the formula is not reinforced by emulsifiers and/or skin hydrating agents.
The drying effect of alcohol may be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emulsifiers to the formula.
In clinical trials, hydroalcoholic solutions containing emulsifiers caused significantly less irritation and dry skin than antimicrobial soaps or detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in hydro-alcoholic solutions are rare.
Despite their effectiveness, non-aqueous products do not eliminate the organic matter on their hands, but only disinfect them.
That is why hand disinfectants are not as effective as soap and water to prevent the spread of many pathogens, since they remain on their hands.
The effectiveness of non-alcoholic hand disinfectants depends heavily on the ingredients and formula, and has always been significantly lower than that of alcohol and alcohol-based disinfectants.
More recently, the formulations using benzalkonium chloride have shown a sustainable and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, whose efficacy is reduced after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin adverse reactions.
Cinderella or soil can be more effective than water alone, but less than soap.
Moreover, if soil or ash is contaminated by micro-organisms, it may increase the spread of diseases instead of stopping them.
As with soap, the ashes are also a disinfectant because, in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
WHO recommends ashes or sand as an alternative to soap when not available.
Wet your hands with hot or cold water.
Current water is recommended because of the risk of contamination of stagnant water points, while the water temperature does not appear to vary).
Weave a generous amount of soap on your hands by rubbing each other against each other, not forgetting the back of your hands, between your fingers and your nails.
The soap removes the germs of the skin, and studies reveal that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap than with water alone.
Frutter for at least 20 seconds.
Fritter action creates friction, which helps to eliminate the germs of the skin, and longer frutting removes more germs.
Rinse enough in running water.
Cleaning in a stagnant water basin can lead to hand recontamination.
Dry with a clean or air-free tray.
Wet hands and wet hands are more easily re-contaminated.The most often forgotten areas are the thumb, wrist, spaces between fingers and under the nails.
Artificial nails and extended nail paints can accommodate micro-organisms.
A moisturizing lotion is often recommended to avoid dry hands; skin dryness promotes the emergence of skin lesions that may increase the risk of transmission of infections.
There are many economic alternatives to wash your hands when tap water and/or soap are not available. For example, coloring water from a well or from a well suspended and perforated well and/or using ash as needed in developing countries.In situations where water supply is limited (such as in schools or rural areas of developing countries), there are solutions to save water, such as tippy taps and other economic options.
A tippy-tap is a simple technology that uses a hook suspended with the help of a rope, and a pedal that allows you to pay a small amount of water on your hands and a soap bread.
Hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but the best way to dry hands in public toilets is to discuss it.
More and more research suggests that paper towels are much more hygienic than electric towels that are often found in toilets.
After the washing and drying of hands in the hot-mins, it was found that the total number of bacteria increased on average 194 per cent on the thumb pulp and 254 per cent on the palms.
Drying in the morning air resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria on the fingertips of 42% and on the 15% brakes.
After hand drying, the following variations in bacterial count were observed:
There are many different dry-mint manufacturers, and dry-mints have been compared to dry-mint using paper towels.
Washing hands with disinfectants is an alternative during movements, in the absence of soap and water.
Hydroalcoholic solutions must contain at least 60% of alcohol.
There are electronic devices that emit reminders when hospital staff forget to wash their hands.
Medical hand washing should last at least 15 seconds, using a generous amount of soap and water or ice to make each part of the hand wet and spray.
Hands must be rubbed against each other by passing between fingers.
After drying, the paper tray must be used to close the tap (and open the exit door if necessary).
The aim of hand washing in health structures is to remove the pathogen microorganisms ("germes") and to avoid transmission.
A relevant analysis was conducted by Whitby and al.
after exposure to the blood/biological liquid;
before an aseptic gesture; and
All jewelry must be removed.
As part of this procedure, hands and forearms should be washed to the thigh, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
When cleaning, you must avoid that water on the front door does not flow into your hands.
In order to reduce the spread of germs, it is preferable to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for your hands before and after taking care of a sick person.
Regarding the control of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that the main benefits of hand washing were obtained during the first 20% of the wash, and that there were only very few additional benefits to increase the hand washing frequency above 35%.
Further research is needed to identify the most effective interventions in different health structures.
For example, in most rural Africa, it is rare to find taps to wash hands near private or public toilets, despite the existence of economic options to build hand washing stations.
However, low hand washing rates can also be attributed to tenacious habits, rather than to a lack of soap or water.
Once minimum standards are met, schools can move from one to three final stars.
The construction of hand washing stations can be included in the hand hygiene campaigns that are carried out to reduce childhood diseases and mortality.
The World Handwashing Day is another example of awareness-raising campaign that claims to promote behavioural development.After the 2019-2020 crown virus pandemic, UNICEF encouraged the adoption of an emoji illustrating hand washing.
However, a review suggests that the promotion of the washing of hands in soap is significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
At that time, most people still believed that the infections were due to the fertile odors called miasms.
For example, in Germany, posters illustrating the "good hand washing techniques" were placed next to the vaults in public toilets and in office and airport toilets.
The expression "washing hands" refers to a person's refusal to assume responsibility or to be involved in something.
In addition, those who are allowed to wash their hands after having had this kind of thinking are less inclined to take other compensatory measures of "cleaning", such as volunteering.
Similarly, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam demand that they wash their hands before and after each meal.

It should also be noted that artificial selection can contribute to involuntary changes in the virus's genes, which are very likely to result from the pressures exerted during the selection, including through the host's immune system.
For example, the complete loss of ORF4 can be cited in the HCV-229E prototype strain because of a two-nucleotide deletion.
While an ORF4 could be observed in the HCoV-229E-associated mice and camels viruses, the alpha-CoV of the alpaga presents a simple insertion of nucleotide, resulting in a breakdown of the reading framework.
Finally, the evolution of new HCVs is also stimulated by the selective pressure exerted in their reserve hosts.
Asymptomatic cases or moderate symptoms were detected when the mice were infected with CoVs, indicating mutual adaptation between the CoVs and the mice.
It seemed that the mice were well adapted to the CoV from anatomical and physiological point of view.
For example, abnormalities in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in mice effectively reduce the pathology triggered by CoVs.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in mice is removed by positive regulation of the receptor inhibiting natural killer cells NKG2/CD94 and by the low expression rate of the major class I histocompatibility complex molecules.
In addition, the high level of oxygen-reactive derivatives (DROs) generated by high metabolic activity of mice could both suppress the replication of the CoV and affect the "relecture" by exoribonuclease, which would create selective pressure and give rise to highly pathogenic viral strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogen coV strains could also develop by recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for the adaptation of the host.
Thus, it is not a coincidence that three new HCVs have appeared in the last two decades.
CoVs are not pathogens or cause moderate symptoms in their hosts to reserve such as mice and camels.
They reply solidly without causing a strong immune response from the host.
This is where the secrets of the observation of asymptomatic carriers and of what causes severe cases of infection in humans remain.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to the hyperactivation of the immune response and cytokinic shock; the more the immune response is strong, the more pulmonary lesions are severe.
On the other hand, among asymptomatic carriers, the immune response was cut off from the CoV replica.
The same strategy of dissociating the immune response could have beneficial effects in the treatment against SARS-CoV-2.
The response to interferon is particularly strong in mice.
Thus, the administration of type I interferon at least in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome is defective in mice.
Based on this reasoning, inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammation with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The SARS-CoV-2 is based on the general scheme by which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV emerged.
While a beta-CoV of couve-soul sharing 95% of nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV has been discovered, there is also a couve-souling couve sharing 96% of nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
While civets and other animals present on the markets have been discovered as carriers of identical viruses in SARS-CoV, no immediate intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 has been identified.
Beneficial pangoline beta-COV similar to SARS-CoV-2 have been discovered, indicating that pangoline may be one of the intermediate hosts or that pangoline beta-COV could contribute to the genetic fragments of the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence indicating that SARS-CoV-2 was designed by man, whether voluntarily or by accident.
The CoVs came under the ramp fires due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
The study of CoV in mice and other animals has greatly altered our perception of the role of zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs in the transmission of HCV to humans.
Many factual data have shown that SARS-CoV, MERCS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 come from the hot sun and are transmitted to humans by intermediate hosts.
Since the infection in SARS-CoV comes from contact between people and civilians present in the markets, the closure of the fresh products markets and the slaughter of civilians found there could have effectively ended the SARS epidemic.
Following the same reasoning, pangolins should be removed from the market for fresh products to avoid transmission of zoonoses, given the discovery of many beta-COV lines of pangolins closely related to SARS-COV-2
However, the question of whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans by pangolins and other mammals and, where appropriate, how this transmission occurs will remain to be determined in the studies to be followed.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV has existed in the shipyard for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transport and a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the premises.
They are very present in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, as was done on the markets of wild animals in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to stop the recurrent epidemics of MERS, a global approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV in camels, associated with other measures to control the infection.
Since we are unable to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could emerge and cause epidemics.
Several zoonotic CoVs circulate in nature.
In particular, the coVs of hairdressers, whose zoonotic potential is very high.
There is no shortage of opportunities for these zoonotic CoVs to evolve and recombinate, leading to the emergence of new more communicable and/or mortal CoVs in the future.
The culture of the consumption of wild animals in certain regions of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contacts between humans and animals.
In the face of the disasters caused by SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better plan for preparation and intervention should be put in place.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a long time.
They remain in their own natural reservoirs until an opportunity of accounting is presented.
Although mice have many beneficial features for the spread of viruses, the probability for humans to be in contact with mice and other wild species can be minimized if people are sensitive to the need to stay away.
Continued monitoring of mammals is needed to better understand the ecology of the CoVs and their natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of animals to humans and future epidemics.
To conclude, the most effective way for humans to prevent viral zoonoses is to stay away from the ecological niches of natural zoonoses reservoirs.
Not all secrets of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 are known yet.
First, if mice transmit a parental SARS-CoV-2 virus to the pangolins, it would be interesting to observe under what circumstances mice and pangolins could share the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if mice play a more direct role in the transmission to humans, it should be determined how humans come into contact with mice.
Thirdly, if a third mammal plays the role of a true intermediate host, it remains to clarify how it interacts with the different species, including men, mice and pangolins.
Finally, given that many mammals, including pets, are capable of contracting SARS-CoV-2, both monitoring and experimental contamination should be carried out.
Whether it's a snorkel, pangoline or another mammal, we should be able to identify SARS-CoV-2 or the almost identical parent viruses observed in their natural hosts.
Future research in this area will highlight the evolving route of SARS-CoV-2 in animals and will have a significant impact on the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
An update of the diagnostic criteria for "suspect cases" and "confirmed cases" of COVID-19 is required
On 6 February 2020, our team published a Quick Recommendation Directive on the diagnosis and treatment of new coronavirus infection 2019 (2019-nCoV) and described our experience and provided references to combating this pandemic worldwide.
However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is recent, our knowledge and our knowledge progress gradually based on the results of ongoing studies and experience of clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
In this e-mail, we replied to a comment on our guidelines and provided the latest diagnostic criteria for a "suspect case" and a "confirmed case" according to the latest diagnostic and treatment directives of COVID-19 (seventh version) published by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) caused an epidemic that now officially carries the name of coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19), and the virus has been named severe acute respiratory syndrome with coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO qualified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick recommendation that was published online on Military Medical Research on February 06, 2020.
She's been paying a lot of attention since her publication.
Please note, however, that COVID-19 is a new disease, our knowledge and our knowledge progress slowly based on the results of ongoing studies and experience of clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
For example, the CVID-19 diagnostic and treatment directives published by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) have received seven editions in total between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, some of which have been substantially modified.
Our directive, which received a comment from Zhou et al., presented a proposal for a simple evaluation based on their clinical experience.
Their work has provided new evidence for our directive and is also a valuable reference to this global pandemic.
We approve their important work and thank them.
However, their work must also be updated in accordance with the latest CVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Directives (SEVID-19) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), confirmation of a suspected case must be associated with one of the characteristics of the epidemiological incidents with two elements of clinical manifestations for complete analysis, or should correspond to three elements of clinical manifestations in the absence of clear epidemiological incidents:
Epidemiological precedents: (1) a history of travel or residence in the city of Wuhan and neighbouring areas or other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) a history of contact with infectious cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with a positive test of nuclear acids); (3) a history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms in the city of Wuhan or neighbouring areas or other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (4) a history of contact with a confirmed case cluster of patients (≥ 2 cases with Fever or related areas or other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (4) a history of contact with confirmed cases of cases of cases of cases of outbreaks of outbreaks or outbreaks of outbreaks of outbreaks of outbreaks or outbreaks of outbreaks of outbreaks of outbreaks of outbreaks of outbreaks or outbreaks of outbreaks of outbreaks of outbreaks of disease; (3) a history of outbreaks of outbreaks of outbreaks of outbreaks of disease; (3) a history of outbreaks of outbreaks of outbreaks of outbreaks of outbreaks of outbreaks of outbreaks of outbreaks of outbreaks of outbreaks of outbreaks in the United in the United Kingdom in the United Kingdom of the United People of the United People of the United on the United People on the United People on the United on the United on the United on the United on the United on the United on the United on the United on the United on the United on the United on the United on the United on the United on which on the United on the United on the United on the United on the United on the on the United on the United on the United on the Internet on the United on the United on the United on the United on the on the United on the United on the United on the Internet on the United on the United on the United on the United on the United on the United on the United on the United on the United on the United on the United on the United on the United on which
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) picture showing the characteristics of an infection in COVID-19; (3) total white blood cell count indicating normal, reduced or reduced lymphocyte count from the beginning of symptoms.
The diagnosis of the confirmed case shall be based on the suspected case with any of the following pathological or serological evidence: (1) real-time PCR positive test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) sequencing of the entire viral genome with strong homogeneity with new known crown viruses; (3) positive serological test for the IgM and IgG SARS-CoV-2 antibodies; or modification of the specific IgG antibody for SARS-CoV-2 from negative to positive or increased title ≥ 4 times in the recovery phase compared to the acute phase.
We can see that the real-time PCR test of nuclear acids in respiratory pathways or in blood samples was added in the second edition (18 January 2020) and the third edition (22 January 2020).
Pathogenic blood samples were added to the fourth edition (27 January 2020) and to the fifth edition (8 February 2020); then the serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These changes are based on the continuous work of researchers aimed at finding an optimal nuclear acid detection kit for a rapid diagnosis, as well as respiratory path samples including blood collection, with increased availability of different specimens, and have contributed to the addition of the positive result of the specific antibody in the confirmed criteria.
In addition, there is increasing evidence of caution in atypical symptomatic patients and asymptomatic patients.
Therefore, Zhou et al.'s graphic representation should be updated as they classified people without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The evaluation system must also be verified in clinical practice and in future studies.
To conclude, we hope for more direct evidence and ask readers to submit their comments.
With regard to the diagnosis of "suspect cases" and "confirmed cases", we suggest that they follow and comply with the most recent directives in their countries.
Our team will also update our directive in due time to offer its help.
Bangladesh announces five new deaths related to COVID-19, a daily record
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths related to COVID-19 in one day.
The country thus records a record of mortality due to the virus within one day.
Yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute for Epidemiology, Disease Surveillance and Research (IEDCR) indicated that the number of persons infected with the disease included 114 active cases and 33 cured persons, who remained confined to the home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
The closure of public transport began on 26 March and was due to end on Saturday 4 April.
Transport of essential goods (medical supplies, fuel and food) was always permitted.
On 19 March, these three people were already restored.
Thursday, the total number of cases of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 infection exceeded the million in the world, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
Countries around the world have announced more stringent measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, extended the border of the city until 1 May.
The Portuguese Parliament voted on the extension of the state of national urgency for 15 days; the vote was adopted by 215 votes to ten, with one abstention.
Zoonotic origins of human coronal viruses
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SRAS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have reversed the trend to reveal the extent to which HCV infection could be devastating and potentially fatal.
Most HCVs come from mice that are not pathogens.
The host intermediate reservoirs of some HCV are also known.
The identification of animal hosts has direct implications for the prevention of human diseases.
The study of coV-host interactions in animals could also provide a better understanding of the coV in humans.
Depending on the differences in protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four genres (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV). The Beta-CoV genre contains the majority of HCV and is divided into four lines (A, B, C and D).
Phylogenetic evidence has shown that mice and rodents play the role of a genetic source for the majority of alpha-CoV and beta-CoV, while birds are the main reservoir of gamma-CoV and delta-CoV.
To date, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) are known.
These include HCV-229E and HCV-NL63 alpha-CoV.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
The tracing of zoonotic origins of HCV provides a framework for understanding the natural history, the motor forces and the restrictive factors of the crossing of the species barrier.
It can also guide or facilitate the search for the SARS-CoV-2 reservoir, intermediate and amplifier with significant implications for the prevention of future infections.
Animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
In recent decades, seven HCVs have been identified.
The first strain of HCV-229E was isolated in the respiratory pathways of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966, and was then adapted to grow in pulmonary cell lines WI-38.
Patients infected with HCV-229E had symptoms of classical rhum, including headaches, extremes, nausea and throat, with fever and cough observed in 10-20% of cases.
The HCV-229E and the HCV-OC43 are both present all over the world and seem to be being transmitted mainly in winter, in countries with climate change.
Stores in Australia reduce quantities of toilet paper by purchase
On Sunday and Saturday evening, Australia's Woolworths and Coles store chains reduced their restrictions on the purchase of two-to-two paper and a package per purchase in all stores at the national level, respectively.
Monday, ALDI also introduced a package limit.
These limits have been displayed in the form of messages to boxes and on the Facebook pages of the channels.
The buyers apparently collected reservations for fear of COVID-19 and the need to limit themselves.
Wednesday, Woolworths also restricted the purchases of toilet paper for domestic deliveries to a package by order.
These measures resulted in the previous restriction of four packages per purchase introduced by Woolworths and Coles on 4 and 5 March, respectively.
Coles, in his press release of 8 March, said that with the restriction of four packages in force, "many stores are still in stock break at the time after delivery", and qualified for the request of "without before", while ALDI, in a Facebook publication Tuesday, described it as "unannounced".
Sales experienced a "strong increase" last week, according to a spokesperson of Woolworths.
Costco store in Canberra has also restricted the amount allowed to two packages last week.
In order to further reduce poverty, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased delivery frequency, Woolworths ordered an additional stock, while ALDI made earlier stock available for a planned promotion on Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, Executive Director of the Australian Retail Association, said that retailers are trying to increase stocks, but that local council restrictions on truck delivery schedules make the task difficult.
It provides for an increase in production costs, while suppliers try to respond to demand, and less promotions.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that after the early unlocking of stocks, some stores are unable to honor the promotion of Wednesday.
In an article published on News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, an expert in the distribution sector of the University of Technology University of Queensland, explained that stores re-supply stocks every night.
He noted that the toilet paper is a voluminous article, resulting in stocks of a small amount that, once exhausted, leave large spaces empty in the rays, strengthening the impression of a shortage.
“Coles and Woolworths consider [that] if the rays are full, if products such as toilet paper rolls and disinfectants can be [bought] and are available in large quantities, this will probably reduce panic,” Russell Zimmerman told ABC News.
Who Gives a Crap recycled toilet paper manufacturer said last Wednesday they were stock breaking.
Kimberly-Clark, who manufactures Kleinex toilet paper, and Solaris Paper that manufactures the Sorbent paper, stressed that they work 24/7 to maintain supply, according to News.com.au.
Domain.com, a real estate site, indicated that some real estate sellers offered free toilet paper to the first bidder during auctions in Melbourne, while fewer auction sales were organized because the buyers were on vacation during the long weekend of the Labour Party.
The Thursday edition of NT News, a daily newspaper printed in Darwin, included an eight-page listing for cutting and using as toilet paper.
The stores were at first reluctant to impose restrictions, according to a report of March 3 of ABC Australia, in which they announced that they were not planning to introduce purchase restrictions.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products also had a strong demand, including masks, disinfectants, dry products, hand hygiene products and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, it was observed Sunday night that the UK online supermarket Ocado limited the purchases of Andres toilet paper to two 12-roller packages.
The World Health Organization qualifies as the COVID-19 pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) qualified the current epidemic of COVID-19 (the disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2) of pandemic.
Although the word "pandemic" refers only to the degree of disease spread, not to the danger of specific cases, WHO has indicated the need to push Governments into action:
"All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries test, test, treat, isolate, locate and mobilize their populations within the framework of the response," said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director General of WHO.
"We are very concerned, not only with the alarming levels of propaganda and gravity, but also with the alarming levels of inaction."
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States, the pandemic is "without precedent".
He stated, in speeches published by CNN in February, that "except for influenza, no other respiratory virus has been observed since its appearance until its continued spread worldwide."
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar opinion, stating that "we have never witnessed a pandemic caused by a coronavirus."
He added: "And we have never witnessed a pandemic that can be mastered at the same time."
The new pandemic status follows the WHO decision in January to declare the epidemic an international public health emergency.
The director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said about the epidemic: "To short, the situation will get worse."
On Thursday, Associated Press announced that there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The pandemic of coronavirus from 2019-20 is an epidemic of coronavirus disease in progress since 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome of coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The epidemic was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, as an international public health emergency on 30 January 2020 and recognised as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 were reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
Nearly 364,000 people are cured.
The mortality rate is estimated at 4% in China, while in the rest of the world it varies from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and swelling.
Complications may include acute respiratory distress pneumonia and syndrome.
The time between exposure and onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it may occur between two and fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Recommended preventive measures include washing your hands, covering your mouth to touch, staying away from other people, and monitoring and restricting people suspected of being infected.
The world's authorities have reacted by introducing restrictions on movements, quarantines, fires, risk controls on workplaces and closures.
The pandemic has caused serious socio-economic disturbances worldwide, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, as well as widespread scarcity aggravated by panic purchases.
Schools and universities have closed at national or local level in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4 per cent of the world's student population.
False information on the virus has been circulating on the Internet, and incidents of xenophobia and discrimination have occurred against Chinese, other Asians of origin and appearance in East and South-East, as well as other people from regions with many cases of the virus.
Due to reduced travel and closures in the heavy industry, there was a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
The health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of the Province of Hubei) reported an unknown cause pneumonia home on 31 December 2019, and an investigation was launched in early January 2020.
Most of the cases were related to the Huanan Sea Fruit Market and it is therefore believed that the virus would be of zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the epidemic is called SARS-CoV-2, a virus recently discovered and closely linked to the coronaviruses of mice, the coronaviruses of pangolins, and the SARS-CoV. Subsequently, it was discovered that the first known person presenting symptoms had fallen ill on December 1, 2019, and this person did not have a clear link with the subsequent home of the fresh product market.
In the case of the first home reported in December 2019, the two thirds were found to have a link to the market.
On 13 March 2020, an unaudited South China Morning Post report suggested that the first case could be recovered as of 17 November 2019 in a 55-year-old from the Province of Hubei. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that, as the new cases seemed to decrease in China but suddenly increase in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had exceeded the number of new cases in China for the first time.
There could be a strong underestimation of cases, including those with positive symptoms.
On 26 February, relatively few cases had been reported among young people, 19-year-olds and less than 2.4% of cases in the world. UK Chief Scientific Adviser Patrick Vallance estimated that 60% of the British population had to be infected before they could achieve effective collective immunity.
Cases indicate the number of persons tested at COVID-19, whose test has been positively confirmed in accordance with official protocols.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3 per cent of its population, and many countries had official policies to test those who had only blessed symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March revealed that up to 23 January, 86% of undetected COVID-19 infections were estimated in China, and 79% of documented infections were the source of infection.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of infections in Italy was much higher than the reported cases.
The first baseline reproduction rate (R0) estimates of COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States concluded that it could be 5.7.
Most people affected by COVID-19 are cured.
For those who do not heal, the time between the onset of symptoms and death is between 6 and 41 days, the most common being 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths were attributed to COVID-19.
In China, on 5 February, approximately 80 per cent of deaths were more than 60 years old, and 75 per cent were suffering from pre-existing health problems such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Official records of deaths related to COVID-19 pandemic generally refer to deceased persons who have been tested positive for COVID according to official protocols.
The number of real victims of COVID-19 could be much higher, as it could not include untested deceased people - for example at home, in retirement homes, etc.
Partial data from Italy reveal that the number of supermortality during the pandemic is 4-5 times higher than the official estimates of COVID deaths.
A spokesperson for the Centres for the Control and Prevention of Diseases of the United States (CDC) acknowledged "We know that [the number of reported deaths] is underestimated", a statement confirmed by anecdote reports of the under-evaluation in the United States. Such underestimation often occurs during pandemics, such as the H1N1 swine influenza epidemic of 2009. The first confirmed death occurred in Wuhan on 9 January 2020.
The first death out of continental China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first death out of Asia took place in France on 14 February.
On 28 February, more than a dozen deaths per country were recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
On 13 March more than forty countries and territories reported deaths on all continents except Antarctica. Several indicators are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These figures vary according to regions and over time, and are influenced by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, the therapeutic options, the time since the beginning of the epidemic, as well as demographic characteristics such as age, sex, and especially health. The case-death report represents the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed over a given period.
According to the statistics of Johns-Hopkins University, the worldwide death rate is 6.0 per cent (97 039/1 617 204) as at 10 April 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, the estimates for the death report decreased from 17.3% (for those with symptoms occurring between 1 and 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms occurring after 1 February 2020). Other indicators are the mortality rate (lethality rates), which represents the percentage of people diagnosed with a disease, and the rate of infection (infection rates), which represents the percentage of people infected (diagnosised and undiagnosed).
These statistics are not limited in time and follow a specific population of contamination at the end of the disease.
Several scientists have tried to calculate these figures for specific populations.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine of Oxford University estimates that the infection rate for the pandemic in its overall ranges from 0.1% to 0.39%.
The highest value of this range is consistent with the results of the first randomized tests for COVID-19 in Germany, and a statistical study analysing the impact of the tests on the estimates of the mortality rate.
WHO maintains that the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and final duration of the epidemic are uncertain and may vary from region to region.
Maciej Boni of the State University of Pennsylvania said: "Uncontrolled, usually infectious epidemics stabilize and then begin to regress when the disease is missing from available hosts.
But it is almost impossible to make relevant forecasts at the moment when this will happen."
The Chief Medical Adviser of the Chinese Government, Zhong Nanshan, stated that "this could be completed by June" if all countries managed to mobilize to follow the WHO recommendations on measures to disrupt the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene & amp; Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 "will continue to circulate, potentially for a year or two".
According to a study by the Imperial College conducted by Neil Ferguson, physical distance and other measures will be required "until a vaccine is available (in possibly 18 months or more)".
William Schaffner of the University of Vanderbilt stated: "I think it is unlikely that this crown virus—because it is transmitted very easily—disappears completely" and that it "may turn into a seasonal disease, which is likely to reappear every year".
The virulence of this return would depend on the collective immunity and the extent of the mutation.
Symptoms of COVID-19 are sometimes quite non-specific and infected people may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Common symptoms include fatigue, production of respiratory secretions (mucosities), loss of odor, swelling, muscle and joint pain, throat pain, headache, chills, vomiting, haemoptysis, diarrhoea, or cyanosis. WHO states that about one in six is seriously ill and has respiratory difficulties.
The U.S. Disease Control and Prevention Centres (CDCs) review emergency symptoms such as persistent respiratory difficulties, pain or chest pressure, sudden confusion, difficult wakes, and face or bluetongue; immediate medical care is recommended if these symptoms are present. The subsequent development of the disease may lead to severe pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, and death.
Some of the infected individuals may be asymptomatic, without any clinical symptoms but with test results confirming the infection, then researchers have issued recommendations that persons who have had close contact with confirmed infected persons should be closely monitored and examined to avoid the risk of infection.
Chinese estimates of the asymptomatic ratio vary from a few to 44%.
The usual incubation period (the time between contamination and onset of symptoms) ranges between one and 14 days; it is more often than five days. Good example of uncertainty, the estimate of the proportion of people who have lost the habit was initially 30 per cent before falling to 15 per cent.
Some information on how the disease spreads remains to be determined.
The disease is supposed to be transmitted mainly during close contact and by droplets produced by touching, elevating, or speaking; this close contact corresponds to a radius of 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have revealed that touching without protection can design droplets at a distance of 4.5 metres (15 feet) to 8.2 metres (27 feet).
Some suggested that the virus could also be transmitted by droplets that would remain in the air for longer periods, which could be designed by speaking. Respiratory droplets can also be designed when expiring, especially by speaking, although the virus is not usually airported.
Postillos can be landed in the mouth or nose of other persons located next door or even inhaled in the lungs.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary re-animation (RCP) can cause respiratory secretions that are powdered and therefore lead to air propagation.
It can also spread when someone touches a contaminated surface, especially the skin, before touching his eyes, nose, or mouth.
If some fear that it may pass through the seals, this risk is considered to be low.
The Government of China has ruled out the possibility of a feco-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is more infectious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, but spread may be possible before symptoms appear and at advanced stages of the disease.
People were tested for disease positive up to three days before symptoms suggesting that transmission is possible before the development of significant symptoms.
Only a few asymptomatic cases confirmed in the laboratory exist, but asymptomatic transmission was detected by some countries during the contact search.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that if you do not know exactly what ease the disease is with, one person usually contaminates two to three others.
Exactly, the virus was detected at the end of three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel 304, after one day on cardboard, and at the end of four hours on copper.
This, however, depends on the humidity and temperature. Domestic animals and other animals have been tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, but the British authorities recommend washing their hands after touching animals, as after having been in contact with other surfaces that infected persons might have touched.
The severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, initially isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with Wuhan acute respiratory disease.
All features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus exist in naturally related coronation viruses. Outside of the human body, the virus is destroyed by the household soap, which dissolves its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is closely linked to the initial SARS-CoV.
We think it would be of zoonotic origin.
A genetic analysis revealed that the coronavirus belongs genetically to the genus Betacoronavirus, subgen Sarbecovirus (like B) associated with two strains of the couves.
It is equivalent to 96% of the total genome of another specimen of coronavirus of couves-souris (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there was only one amino acid of difference in some parts of the sequences of the genome between the pangoline virus and the human origin.
The overall comparison of the genome has so far revealed a maximum of 92% of common genetic material between the pangoline coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove that pangolins are the intermediate host.
The virus infection may be temporarily diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, but the final confirmation is by reverse transcription of the polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of infected or scan secretions.
A study comparing the PCR and scanning it in Wuhan suggested that the scanner is significantly more sensitive than the PCR, although less accurate, because many of its imaging features coincide with other pneumonias and pathological processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "the scanner should not be used to dissipate or as a first intention test to diagnose COVID-19".
WHO published several ARN test protocols for SARS-CoV-2, with a first release on 17 January.
The test uses the reverse transcription of the real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test can be performed on respiratory or blood samples.
The results are generally available within a few hours or days.
This test is usually carried out on a rhinopharynx extract, but a gorilla extract can also be used. Several laboratories and companies are currently developing serological tests, which detect antibodies.
On 6 April 2020, none of them proved reliable enough to be approved for general use.
In the United States, a serological test developed by Celex was approved for emergency use by certified laboratories only.
The characteristic imaging elements of the radiography and tomodensitometry (scan) of people with symptoms include asymmetrical periphery glass opacitys and a lack of pleural expansion.
The Italian Society of Radiology is currently an international online database of confirmed case image results.
Because of cutting with other infections such as adenovirus, the imagery without confirmation by PCR is limited to detect COVID-19.
An important study in China compared the results of thoracic scanners to the PCR and demonstrated that if the image is less accurate for the infection, it is faster and more sensitive, recommending that it be taken into account as a screening tool in the epidemiology areas.
Convolutive neuron networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed to detect the characteristics of the virus in the image on both radiographs and scanners.
The strategies for preventing the transmission of the disease include having overall good personal hygiene, washing your hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, and touching or tingling in a sink and throwing the sink directly into a trash can.
It was recommended that those who would have already been contaminated should wear a surgical mask in public.
Physical remoteness measures have also been recommended to prevent transmission. Many governments have banned or de-advised all non-essential movements to or from countries and sectors affected by the epidemic.
However, the virus has reached the stage of community transmission in vast areas of the planet.
This means that the virus spreads in communities, and some members of these communities do not know where or how they have been contaminated. Health professionals are advised to take care of someone who may be infected to take usual precautions and contact precautions, and to wear protective glasses. The search for contacts is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of infection and prevent future transmissions.
The use of data on the location of mobile phones by governments in this regard raised confidentiality issues, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations publishing a communication calling for limits to such surveillance.
Various mobile applications were launched or proposed on the basis of volunteering, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on respected private life solutions, such as the use of Bluetooth to record the presence of a user near other mobile phones.
Users will then receive a message if they have been in close contact with someone who has been tested positive for COVID-19. False ideas are currently circulating on how to prevent infection; for example, to clean up your nose and close up with the mouth bath is not effective.
There is no vaccine against COVID-19, but many organizations are currently trying to develop one.
It is recommended to wash your hands to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands often in the soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after having been in the toilets or when the hands are clearly salty; before eating; and after being wet, coughed, or eternal.
This is because outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by the household soap, which breaks its protective envelope.
The CDC also recommended the use of an alcohol-based disinfectant containing at least 60% of alcohol when soap and water are not easy to access.
WHO advises people to avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
Surfaces can be decontaminated in several ways (in one minute of exposure to the disinfectant for a stainless steel surface), including ethanol 62–71%, isopropanol 50–100%, sodium hypochlorite 0.1%, hydrogen peroxide 0.5%, and povidone 0.2–7.5%.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if a case of COVID is suspected or confirmed in an establishment such as an office building or a crack, all parts such as offices, toilets, common rooms, as well as common electronic equipment such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and automatic distributors used by sick persons be disinfected.
Health organizations advise people to cover their mouth and nose with a fold or a spoon when they touch or die, and to throw away any spoon immediately.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who would be infected, because wearing a mask can limit the volume and distance of the cartridges designed by speaking, elevating, and touching.
WHO issued instructions explaining where and when to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at Leeds University, "Bringing a mask can reduce people's propensity to touch their face, which is an important source of infection in the absence of good hygiene of their hands." The use of masks has also been recommended for those who deal with a person potentially affected by the disease.
WHO has recommended wearing masks to healthy people only if they face an important risk, for example if they are dealing with a person with a health problem with COVID-19, even though it recognized that wearing masks can help people not touch their face.
Several countries have begun to encourage their people to use masks.
In the United States, the CDC recommends the port of non-medical tissue masks. China specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks for healthy people, especially in case of proximity (1 meters (3 feet) or less) with other people.
Hong Kong recommends wearing a surgical mask in public transport or tied places.
In Thailand, health authorities encourage the population to make facial masks at home and clean them every day.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned public outputs without masks or any other means of covering their nose and mouth.
On 16 March, Vietnam imposed the mask on everyone in public places to protect themselves and protect others.
The Austrian government ordered that everyone entering a supermarket wear a mask.
Israel asked all its residents to wear a mask in public.
Taiwan, which has produced ten million masks a day since mid-March, imposed the mask on interurban train and bus passengers on April 1.
Panama has made the port of a mask mandatory for any exit, while recommending the manufacture of a handicraft mask to those who cannot buy it.
The masks were also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distance (also called physical distance) includes measures to control infections aimed at slowing the spread of the disease by reducing contact between individuals.
Methods include quarantines, travel restrictions and school closures, workplaces, stadiums, theatres and shopping centers.
Social distance methods can be applied while staying at home, limiting their travels, avoiding crowds, greeting themselves without contact and keeping a physical distance with others.
Many governments now order or recommend social distance in the areas affected by the epidemic.
The maximum number of meetings recommended by United States government and health agencies has been rapidly reduced by 250 persons (if there is no known presence of COVID-19 in the region) to 50 persons and later to 10 persons.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned the public meetings of more than two people. Older adults and those with underlying health problems such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory diseases, hypertension or a weakened immune system are at increased risk of serious illness and complications. They were thus invited by the CDC to stay at home as much as possible in areas affected by the epidemic. At the end of March 2020, WHO and other health agencies began to replace the term "social distance" with "physical distance", to clarify the objective of reducing physical contact by maintaining social links, whether it is virtually or by keeping away.
The use of the term "social distance" meant that social isolation should be used as a whole, rather than encouraging people to keep in touch with others through other means. Some authorities have published guidelines on sexual health to be followed during the pandemic.
They understand the recommendation not to have sexual intercourse with anyone with whom we live, who does not have the virus or has no symptoms.
Home isolation was recommended for people diagnosed with positive COVID-19 and those who thought to be infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper isolation, and many governments have imposed or recommended individual quarantine for entire populations living in affected areas.
The strictest individual quarantine instructions were given to people in the most at risk groups.
Persons who have been exposed to a disease affected by COVID-19 and those who have recently traveled to a country or region where the transmission is very important have been invited to sit in quarantine for 14 days from the moment they were able to be exposed for the last time.
The control strategies of an epidemic are endurance or suppression, and mitigation.
Adhesive is established during the first phases of the epidemic and aims to monitor and isolate infected people, as well as to introduce other measures to control infections and vaccination in order to prevent the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
When it is no longer possible to prevent the spread of the disease, efforts are turned towards the mitigation phase: measures are taken to slow this spread and mitigate its impact on the health care system and society.
Contingency and mitigation measures can be taken at the same time.
The removal requires more extreme measures to address the pandemic by reducing the number of basic reproductions to less than 1. Part of the management of an infectious disease epidemic is to try to mitigate the epidemic peak: this is called to apply the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of overload of health services and makes time for the development of vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can manage the epidemic include personal prevention measures, such as hand hygiene, masks and individual quarantine; public social distance measures such as closing schools and religious offices; public efforts to encourage the acceptance and participation of such interventions; and environmental actions such as surface cleaning. More drastic measures to smooth the epidemic have been taken in China as the severity of the epidemic has become apparent, such as the quarantine of entire cities and a strict ban on travel.
Other countries have also adopted a variety of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduced mass screening and quarantine, and issued warnings on the movement of infected persons.
Singapore has provided financial support to those infected who have become quarantined, and has imposed heavy fines on those who have not.
Taiwan has increased the production of masks and has penalized the acquisition of medical supplies. Simulations for Britain and the United States show that the slowdown (attenuation but not the elimination of the spread of the epidemic) and the removal (reversing the development of the epidemic) are facing major challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies can reduce health care demand of 2/3 and death of half, but cannot prevent hundreds of thousands of deaths, and health care systems are submerged.
The removal may be privileged, but it must be continued as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if it occurs in the first instance), because otherwise the transmission is rapidly rebounded when the measures are released.
Long-term intervention to eliminate the pandemic has a social and economic cost.
There are no approved antiviral treatments for COVID-19, but development efforts are under way, including existing treatment tests.
Taking medicines without an order against the rhythm or consumption of alcohol as well as rest can help to relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous infusions and respiratory assistance may be necessary.
The use of steroids can make the results worse.
Several compounds that have already been approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are currently being studied for the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO stated that some "traditional and artisanal remedies" may reduce the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
The increased capacity and adaptation of health care to the needs of patients affected by COVID-19 is described by WHO as a key response measure to the epidemic.
The ECDC and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have issued guidelines on the care of primary health care hospitals and services for the redeployment of resources at different levels, including by devoting laboratory services to the COVID-19 tests, by canceling non-emergency interventions when possible, by separating and insulating patients tested positive for COVID-19, and by strengthening intensive care capacities through the training of personnel and increasing the number of fans and beds available.
There are several theories regarding the place of origin of the first case (called a zero patient).
The first known case of the new crown virus could be recovered as of 1 December 2019 in Wuhan, in the province of Hubei in China.
In one month, the number of cases of coronavirus in Hubei has gradually increased.
They are generally related to the large sea fruit market in Huanan, which also sold live animals. According to one theory, the virus would come from one of these animals; in other words, it would have a zoonotic origin. An unknown cause pneumonia home was observed on 26 December and treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian at Hubei's hospital, which informed Wuhan Jianghan's CDC on 27 December.
On December 30, a group of doctors from Wuhan's central hospital warned their colleagues of a "sraas-like coronavirus".
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were recommended by the police for spreading false rumors, and another, Ai Fen, was recommended by his superiors for giving the warning.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission then issued a public opinion on 31 December and informed the WHO.
There were enough cases of unknown pneumonia reported to Wuhan's health authorities to initiate an investigation in early January. At the first stages of the epidemic, the number of cases doubled about every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, assisted by New Year's migrations and Wuhan's being a transport pole as well as a major railway station.
On January 20, China reported nearly 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
The following official data show that 6,174 people had already developed symptoms on 20 January 2020. On 26 March, the United States exceeded China and Italy by displaying the largest number of confirmed cases in the world. On 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases were reported worldwide; more than 97 000 people died and more than 364,000 were healed.
About 200 countries and territories had at least one case.
Because of the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area have restricted their travel and established border controls.
National responses included measures such as quarantine (also called home, shelter or bordering orders) and fire-fighting. On 2 April, nearly 300 million people, or about 90 per cent of the population, were subject to a form of bordering in the United States, more than 50 million people were confined to the Philippines, about 59 million in South Africa and 1.3 billion in India.
On 26 March, 1.7 billion people in the world knew a form of bordering, and a figure rose to 2.6 billion two days later — about a third of the world's population.
The origin of the first confirmed case of COVID-19 was dated 1 December 2019 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report suggests that the first case would be returned to 17 November.
Dr. Zhang Jixian observed an unknown cause pneumonia home on December 26, which she informed Wuhan Jianghan's CDC on December 27.
Initial patient genetic tests on December 27, 2019 indicated the presence of a coronavirus similar to SARS.
A public opinion was issued by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on 31 December.
WHO was informed the same day.
Doctors in Wuhan received a warning that they had "proclaimed rumors" about the epidemic.
The National Health Commission of China initially claimed that there was no "clear evidence" of transmission among human beings.
At the end of January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign, later described by the Secretary-General of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping as a "war of the people" for the spread of the virus.
In what was described as "the greatest quarantine in human history", a health cord was announced on 23 January to stop the journeys from and to Wuhan, which was extended to 15 cities in Hubei, affecting about 57 million people in total.
The use of private vehicles was prohibited in the city.
The celebrations of New Year's Chinese (January 25th) were canceled in many places.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan, which was completed in 10 days.
Another hospital was built as follows: Leishenshan, to treat additional patients.
In addition to new hospitals, China has converted 14 other structures to Wuhan, such as convention and stadium centres, to temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the government introduced new measures to launch the COVID-19 epidemic, including the issuance of health statements for travellers and the extension of spring holidays.
The universities and schools in the country have also been closed.
The Hong Kong and Macao regions have established a number of measures, particularly with regard to schools and universities.
Remote labour measures have been established in several Chinese regions.
Travel restrictions were adopted in Hubei and beyond.
Public transport has been modified and Chinese museums have been temporarily closed.
The control of population displacement was applied in many cities, and it was estimated that some 760 million people (over half the population) had to deal with some form or other restriction of movement; after the epidemic entered the world in March, the Chinese authorities took strict measures to avoid the virus being "imported" from other countries.
For example, Beijing imposed a quarantine of 14 days for all international travellers entering the city. On 23 March, in mainland China, one case had been transmitted within the country within the previous five days, in the event via a traveler returning to Canton from Istanbul.

On 22 February, among the 9 336 faithful members of the church, 1,261 or about 13% reported symptoms. South Korea announced the highest level of alert on 23 February 2020.
On 28 February, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, then 3,150 on 29 February.
All of South Korea's military bases were quarantined after three soldiers were tested positive for the virus.
The schedules of airlines have also been affected and therefore modified. South Korea has introduced what was considered the largest and best-organized program in the world to test the population in the virus, and isolate all infected persons and monitor and quarantine those who have been in contact with them.
The methods of screening included the mandatory individual reporting of symptoms by new international arrivals through mobile application, virus detection vehicles issuing the results the following day, and an increased test capacity to enable the test of nearly 20,000 people every day.
South Korea's programme is seen as a success in the control of the epidemic, although it did not put in quarantine the entire cities. South Korean society was initially divided on the response of President Moon Jae-in to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions calling for Moon's prosecution for the ill-management of the government's epidemic or, on the other hand, for its response.

The United Kingdom's response to the virus first appeared to be one of the most flexible of the countries affected, and until 18 March 2020, the British government imposed no form of social distance or mass quarantine.
As a result, the government was criticized for its manifest lack of reactivity and vitality in response to public concerns. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made an announcement, denouncing all non-essential social journeys and contacts, suggesting that people work at home as much as possible and avoid places such as pubs, restaurants and showrooms.
On 20 March, the Government announced that all leisure facilities such as pubs and sports rooms should be closed as soon as possible, and promised to pay up to 80% of workers' wages, within the limit of $2,500 per month, in order to avoid the crisis-related unemployment.

On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities to apply a travel ban in Wuhan, the representative of WHO Gauden Galea noted that, although it was not "certainly a recommendation from the WHO", it was "a very important indication of the commitment to contain the most concentrated epidemic" and said of a fact "without precedent in the history of public health". On 30 January, following confirmation of an inter-human transmission outside China and the increase in the number of cases in other countries, WHO stated that the epidemic constituted an international public health emergency (USPPI), the sixth USPI since the 2009 outbreak of A.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom stated that USIP was due to "the risk of global proliferation, especially for low-income and middle-income countries without robust health systems.
In response to the application of travel restrictions, Tedros stated: "There is no reason why measures are useless to interfere with international trade travel and trade" and "the WHO does not recommend restricting trade and movement".
On 5 February, WHO called on the international community to contribute up to $675 million to finance strategic preparation in low-income countries, calling for the urgent support of those countries that "do not have the necessary systems to detect people who have contracted the virus, even if it is at the point of appearing".

This virus may be on the way and you must be ready," adding that good response measures could help the world avoid "the worst".
Ryan then indicated that the current data did not allow public health officials to announce a global pandemic, stating that such a statement would mean that "we accept absolutely that every human on the planet is exposed to this virus".
On 11 March, WHO stated that the coronavirus epidemic could be classified as pandemic.
The Director General said that WHO was "extremely concerned about both the alarming levels of propaganda and severity and the alarming levels of inaction."

Several provincial directors of the Chinese Communist Party (PCC) have been reported for their duties following their quarantine management in Central China, a sign of discontent with the response of political leaders to the epidemic in these regions.
Some commentators believe that this action was intended to protect the Secretary-General of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping from the popular anger in relation to the crown virus epidemic.
Some high Chinese leaders, e.g. Zhao Lijian, rejected the first idea that the coronary epidemic would have started in Wuhan in favor of conspiracy theories that the COVID-19 would hold its origins from the United States or Italy.
The U.S. administration of Donald Trump has qualified the crown virus of "Chinese virus" or "Wuhan virus", stating that in China "censorship has now become a global pandemic", which has been subsequently taxed by some opponents and aimed at "distorting the attention of his administration's inability to contain the disease".
The Daily Beast has provided a telegram from the U.S. government that presents the main lines of a communication strategy that appears to come from the National Security Council, the strategy of which is as follows: "Everything comes from China.

Press bodies such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have said that China's efforts to send assistance to countries affected by the virus were part of a growing propaganda to gain global influence.
EU foreign policy leader Josep Borrell said there was "a geopolitical component involving a struggle for influence through rhetoric and "generosity policy".
Borrell also stated that “China is aggressively insisting on the fact that, unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner”.
China also called on the United States to lift its sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while sending priority to aid to the latter two countries.
The 100,000 masks given by Jack Ma in Cuba were blocked by American sanctions on 3 April.

The source accused Russia of embarking on an offensive of "geopolitical and diplomatic charm".
The president of Lombardy, Attilio Fontana, and the Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio denounced media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a medical aid plane to the United States.
The spokesperson for Kremlin Dmitri Peskov said that "by offering his help to his American colleagues, [Poutine] is part of the principle that when American manufacturers of equipment and medical equipment have gained speed, they will be able to do so if necessary."

The Iranian government has been heavily affected by the virus, with almost twenty members of the infected parliament, as well as fifteen other former or current political personalities.
Iran's President Hassan Rohani wrote an open letter to world leaders asking for assistance on 14 March 2020, indicating that his country had a problem fighting the epidemic due to the lack of access to international markets due to United States sanctions against Iran. The epidemic called for the United States to adopt common social policies to other rich countries, including a universal health system, a universal childcare program, paid parental leave and higher levels of public health funding.
Political analysts expect this to negatively affect Donald Trump's chance of re-election during the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have deteriorated due to the pandemic.
South Korea has criticised Japan's "ambigu and Passive Quarantine Efforts" after it announced that anyone arriving from South Korea would be placed in quarantine for two weeks on government-designated sites.
South Korean society was at the beginning divided on the response to President Moon Jae-in's crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions calling for Moon's prosecution for mismanagement of the government's epidemic or, on the other hand, for its response. The pandemic has enabled countries to adopt an emergency legislation in response.
Some commentators expressed concern that this could enable Governments to strengthen their power.

The coronavirus epidemic has been accused of several cases of supply disruptions resulting from a worldwide increase in the use of equipment to combat the epidemic, panic purchases and interruption of the operation of plants and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Agency has issued warnings on the lack of medicines and medical equipment due to the increase in consumer demand and the interruption of suppliers.
Several localities have also faced panic purchases that have led to the disappearance of the essential products, such as food, toilet paper and water bottles, rays, and scarves.
The technology sector, in particular, has warned of delays in sending electronic products.
According to WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom, the application for individual protection equipment has been multiplied by 100.
This request led to an increase in prices up to twenty times the normal price and also led to delays in the supply of medical devices for a period of four to six months.
This has also led to a lack of individual protection equipment worldwide and WHO warns that this will endanger health professionals.
In Australia, the pandemic offered a new opportunity for daigos to sell Australian products in China.
The activity created a shortage of infant milk in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government. Despite the strong prevalence of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and in the Wuhan region, and the strong demand for the following foods, these two areas were spared by severe food shortages.
The measures taken by China and Italy against the illegal stockpiling and trafficking of essential products have been a real success, thus avoiding the serious food shortages that had been foreseen in Europe and North America.
Thanks to its important agricultural production, Northern Italy has not found a significant decrease, but prices may increase according to industry representatives.
Food lines were empty only temporarily, even in the city of Wuhan, while members of the Chinese government uncovered pigs' reserves to ensure sufficient livelihood for the population.
Similar laws exist in Italy so that food producers store reserves for such emergencies.

Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the emergency measures put in place in due time by central banks and states.
Central banks react more quickly than they did during the financial collapse of 2008.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors due to the bans on travel, the closure of public space, including tourist attractions, and the recommendations of governments against any travel worldwide.
As a result, many airlines cancelled flights due to a decrease in demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Quantas, while the British regional airline Flybe failed.
The impact on the cruise sector has reached a level never before seen.
Several railway stations and ports have also been closed.
The epidemic coincided with Chunyun, a major tourist season associated with New Year's Chinese.
A number of events involving important crowds have been cancelled by national and regional governments, including the New Year's annual festivals, and private companies have also closed their shops and their tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many events related to the New Moon Year have been cancelled and many tourist attractions have been closed to avoid mass gatherings, including the Forbidden City of Beijing and traditional temple fairs.
In 24 of the 31 provinces, municipalities and regions of China, the authorities extended the New Year's holidays until 10 February, imposing on most places of work not to be reopened before that date.
These regions accounted for 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong has moved to its highest level of response to infectious diseases and has declared an emergency situation, closing schools until March and canceling its New Year's celebrations. The distribution sector has been impacted at the global level, with reductions in opening hours for shops or temporary closures.
Visits to traders in Europe and Latin America fell by 40%.
In North America and the Middle East, traders found a decrease of between 50 and 60 per cent.
This also resulted in a 33% to 43% drop in pedestrian traffic in shopping malls in March compared to February.
Operators of shopping centres around the world have imposed additional measures, such as the increase in clearing frequencies, the installation of thermal scanners to control the temperature of customers and the cancellation of events. According to an estimate by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession caused by the pandemic could leave between 14 and 22 million additional people in extreme poverty in Latin America compared to a pandemic-free situation.
In January and February 2020, at the peak of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
In China, a large part of some 300 million rural migrant workers were trapped in domestic or bordered provinces in the province of Hubei. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for help from the government.
The coronavirus epidemic could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate could reach 32%, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis estimates. The Indian border has left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (receiving a daily salary) to unemployment. Angus Reid's survey observed that 44% of Canadian households have lived on a certain type of unemployment. Nearly 900,000 workers have lost their employment in Spain since the confiscation imposed on mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment and 1 million British workers applied for universal credit. Nearly half a million German companies had their employees tapped into a part-time activity facility funded by the government called Kurzbeit.
The German part-time work compensation scheme was adopted by France and Britain.
The arts and cultural heritage sectors have been deeply affected by the pandemic, affecting the functioning of organizations as well as individuals, both waged and independent, at the global level.
The arts and cultural sector organizations have tried to maintain their mission (often financed by the State) to provide access to cultural heritage to the community, ensure the safety of their employees and the public and support artists as far as possible.
In March 2020, throughout the world and at different degrees, museums, libraries, showrooms and other cultural institutions were closed to new order and their exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or postponed.
In response, intensive efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and accelerated consequence of the disease, the abolition of religious services, major sporting events and other social events such as music festivals and concerts, technological conferences and fashion shows.
The cinema industry has also been disrupted. The Vatican announced that the celebrations of the Holy Week in Rome, which took place last week of the Christian period of Carème's imprisonment, had been cancelled.
Many dioceses have recommended that older Christians stay home rather than attend Sunday's Masses; some churches broadcast their religious services on radio, online and on-line or on television while others propose to practice their worship in "drive-in".
Like the Roman Catholic diocese of Rome, which closed its churches and its chapels and St. Peter's Square, which had become vacant from all its Christian pilgrims, other religious institutions also canceled their services and limited public meetings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras.
The Iranian Minister of Health announced the cancellation of Friday's prayers in the areas affected by the epidemic and the holy places were subsequently closed, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims as well as its inhabitants to the sacred sites of Mecca and Médine.
The pandemic has led to the most important interruption of the world sports calendar since World War II.
The most important sports events have been cancelled or postponed, including the UEFA 2019-20 League of Champions, the English Football Championship 2019-20, the UEFA Euro 2020, the NBA 2019-20 season and the 2019-20 season of the LNH.
The epidemic disrupted the organisation of the 2020 Summer Olympics, which was initially due to begin at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event would be "replanned beyond 2020, but not later than summer 2021". The casinos and other gaming facilities around the world closed and the live poker tournaments were either postponed or cancelled.
This has prompted many players to sign up online, and many online gaming sites have seen a significant increase in their number of new enrolments. The world of the show has also been touched, with several music groups having suspended or cancelled their concerts.
Many major theatres, such as Broadway ones, also interrupted all their performances.
Some artists have sought ways to continue to create and share their work on the Internet in place of traditional live performances, such as online and live concerts or online festivals created to make artists happen, spread and promote their works.
On-line, many Internet feeds on the theme of coronavirus have spread because many prefer humor and entertainment in the face of uncertainty.
Since the COVID-19 epidemic, an increase in prejudices, xenophobia and racism has been seen against people of Chinese and East Asian origin and against people from sensitive areas in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Incidents related to fear, suspicion and hostility have been observed in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Pacific region.
Reports dated February (when the majority of cases were still limited to China) described racist feelings expressed in different groups around the world that Chinese deserved the virus or received a justifiable punishment.
Some African countries have also seen an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many inhabitants of Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
Support was provided to Chinese, whether online or offline, and to the people of the areas affected by the virus.
Following the progression of the epidemic to new sensitive countries, Italians from the first European country to a serious epidemic of COVID-19 could also face suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens from countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea had at first signed petitions to ban Chinese from entering their countries in order to stop the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan has pissed off on Twitter.
The Chinese and other Asians living in the United Kingdom and the United States have reported an increase in the levels of racist insults, as well as aggression.
US President Donald Trump has faced the criticism of having qualified the crown virus of "Chinese virus", a term considered by its detractors as racist and anti-Chinese.
In Ukraine, protesters attacked buses transporting Ukrainians and foreign evacuations between Wuhan and Novi Sanzhary.
Students from North-East India, who share a border with China, and studying in large Indian cities would have suffered from the harassment associated with the coronary epidemic.
The president of the West Bengal Unit of Bharatiya Janata Party Dilip Ghosh said that the Chinese had destroyed nature and "that is why God took his revenge on them".
The remarks were subsequently condemned by the Chinese consulate in Kolkata, which describes them as "false". In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese inhabitants were endorsed by the pandemic, while foreigners were described as "foreign wastes" that should be "depleted".
Many access papers have been removed for all or part of their coverage on the crown virus.
Many scientific publishers have made their scientific articles available in connection with the free access epidemic.
Some scientists have chosen to quickly share their results on publishing servers such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory testing of coronary respiratory disease 2019 (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods for detection of virus and detection of antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of virus in samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the DNA of the coronavirus.
This analysis is specifically designed to detect only the SARS-CoV-2 DNA.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
The detection of antibodies (serology) can be used both for the diagnosis and monitoring of the population.
Antibody tests reveal how many people have contracted the disease, including those with too little symptoms to be reported or asymptomatic.
An accurate mortality rate of the disease and the level of collective immunity among the population can be determined from the results of this test.
Due to limited screening, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population in March 2020.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3 per cent of its population, and there were significant differences in the number of tests carried out in each country.
This variability is likely to significantly affect the reported mortality rates, which may be significantly overestimated in some countries.
Using the reverse transcription followed by a real-time polymerisation reaction (rRT-PCR), the test can be carried out on breath samples obtained using various methods, including nasopharyngitis or waiting sample.
The results are generally available within a few hours to 2 days.
The RT-PCR test performed from pharyngitis is reliable only during the first week of the disease.
Next, the virus can disappear from the throat as it continues to multiply in the lungs.
In infected persons tested during the second week, a sample may also be taken in deep respiratory pathways by aspiration catheter, or a cravat (expectation) may be used.
One of the first PCR tests was developed by Charité in Berlin in January 2020 with an inverse transcription followed by a real-time polymerisation reaction (rRT-PCR), and constituted the base of 250,000 kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom had also developed a test on 23 January 2020.The South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical quality SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on the PCR (PowerCheck Coronavirus) on 28 January 2020.
He detects the "E" gene shared by all beta-coronaviruses, and the RdRp gene specific to SARS-CoV-2.In China, the BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive emergency authorization from the Chinese National Medical Administration for a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on PCR.In the United States, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distribute their real-time RT-PCR diagnostic device to the public health laboratories through the International Reagent Resource.
Among the former versions of the test kits, a genetic test of three obtained non-conclusive results due to defective reactives, as well as a test cracker in the Atlanta CDC. As a result, an average of less than 100 samples per day were successfully treated throughout February 2020.
Tests using two components were not considered reliable until 28 February 2020, and it was only at this time that federal and local laboratories were allowed to start testing.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency authorisation.The US commercial laboratories began testing early in March 2020.
As of 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the availability at the national level of COVID-19-based RT-PCR tests.
This Diagnostics also distributed COVID-19 tests at the national level on March 9, 2020.
No quantitative limitation has been announced. The collection and processing of samples shall be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the VECTOR National Research Centre for Virology and Biotechnology.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Surveillance Service. On 12 March 2020, it was announced that Mayo Clinic had developed an infection detection test at COVID-19.On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA's authorization for a test that could be carried out in large quantities in 3.5 hours, allowing for approximately 4 128 tests in 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA granted an emergency use authorisation (U.S.) to Abbott Laboratories for a test on Abbott's m2000 system. The FDA had previously granted a similar authorisation to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid also received an U.S.A. from the FDA for a test of approximately 45 minutes.
The FDA approved a test that uses isothermal amplifying technology for nuclear acids instead of PCR.
Since it does not require a series of alternating temperature cycles, this method can provide positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these devices in the United States, and Abbott is planning to intensify manufacturing to provide 50,000 tests per day.A test using a monoclonal antibody that is specifically related to the protein of the nucleocapid (protein N) of the new crown virus is under development in Taiwan, hoping to provide results within 15 to 20 minutes, as a rapid flu test.
A bibliographic study in March 2020 concluded that “pulmonary radiography has a low diagnostic value at the first stages, while the results of the TDM [tomodendensitometry] may be conclusive even before symptoms occur.”
Typical signs of TDM include multi-lobe bilateral glass opacity with a peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution.
Subpleural predominance, crazy paving and consolidation develop as the disease develops.
A study comparing PCR to the TDM in Wuhan, at the origin of the current pandemic, suggested that the TDM is significantly more sensitive than the PCR, although less precise, several of its imagery results coincident with other pneumonias and diseases.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "TDM is not used for testing or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19".In March 2020, CDCs recommend PCR for initial testing.
The production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG, is part of the immune response to the infection.
These can be used to detect infection in people from about 7 days after symptoms, to determine immunity and within the framework of population surveillance.Tests can be performed in central laboratories (TLC) or by testing the patient's hair (point-of-care testing, POC).
Automated systems of many clinical laboratories are capable of carrying out these tests, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For TLC, a single blood sample is generally used, although serial samples can be used to monitor the immune response.
For the POC, one blood sample is usually taken by skin puncture.
Unlike PCR methods, no extraction step is required before analysis.On 26 March 2020, the FDA appointed 29 entities that have properly informed the Agency and which can now distribute their antibody screening tests.
As of 7 April 2020, one test was approved by the FDA under an emergency use authorisation.At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European authorisations for their test kits, capable of detecting IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The screening capacity is several hundred samples in a few hours, which is significantly faster than the PCR test of the viral DNA.
The antibodies are generally detectable 14 days after the infection began.In early April, the United Kingdom found that none of the test kits for antibodies purchased by the country were sufficiently effective to be used.
Hong Kong has put in place a plan to ensure that the suspect cases can remain at home, "the emergency service will provide the patient with a sample tube", the patients hoist inside, return it and receive the result of the test. British NHS announced that it is carrying out a pilot project to test suspected cases at home, thus eliminating the risk that a patient does not infect others by becoming in hospital or the need to disinfect an ambulance in case of use.In the context of the COVID-19 test for suspected cases, a health professional takes a sample by taking appropriate precautions.
The "drive" centres allowed South Korea to conduct one of the fastest and most comprehensive tests in the world.In Germany, the National Association of Compulsory Disease Insurance Doctors declared on 2 March that it had the ability to perform some 12,000 tests daily in the ambulatory environment, and that 10,700 patients had been tested during the previous week.
The costs are borne by sickness insurance when the test is prescribed by a doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
As of 19 March, drive tests were available in several large cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany was unknown, since only positive results are reported.
A first laboratory study revealed that at Week 12/2020, a total of at least 483,295 samples were tested until Week 12/2020 and that 33,491 samples (6.9%) had a positive result for SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, researchers from the Technology and Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method of analysis of 64 patients at the same time, by pooling the samples and not by testing only if the combined sample is positive.In Wuhan, an unaccompanied emergency laboratory of 2,000 square metres called "Huo-Yan" (Chinese: , i.e. "fire oil" in French is available on February 5, 2020).
Thanks to its 5-day construction supervised by Wang Jian, the founder of BGI, modelling revealed that cases in Hubei province would have been 47 per cent higher and that the cost of quarantine would have doubled without this screening capacity.
The Wuhan laboratory was quickly followed by Hua-Yan laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, in 12 Chinese cities as a whole.
At 4 March 2020, the total daily capacity was 50,000 tests per day. Multiple free models developed by Origami Assays were published to test up to 1,122 patient samples for COVID-19 using only 93 tests. These balanced models can be executed in small laboratories without liquid handling robots.
In March, insufficient shortages and amounts of reactive have become an obstacle to mass testing in the EU, the UK and the United States.
This situation has led some authors to consider the sample preparation protocols that involve heating samples at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genes to continue testing.On 31 March, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates were now testing most of its population per capita for the Coronavirus, and were in the process of intensifying the screening to reach the majority of the population.
These results were achieved through a combination of the ability to drive and purchase a high-speed laboratory at the population level with Group 42 and BGI (based on their "Huo-Yan" emergency detection laboratories in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory is able to run tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests daily and is the first laboratory of this capacity to be operational outside China.
Different test formulas targeting different parts of the genetic profile of the coronary virus were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted the German formula for producing low-income kits with no resources to develop their own kits.
The German formula was published on 17 January 2020. The protocol developed by the Centres for Disease Control of the United States was only published on 28 January, delaying the availability of tests in the United States. China and the United States had problems with the reliability of test kits at the beginning of the epidemic, and these countries, as well as Australia, were unable to provide sufficient kits to respond to the demand and recommendations of health specialists.
On the other hand, experts indicate that the high availability of tests in South Korea has helped to reduce the spread of the new crown virus.
The testing capacity, largely in private sector laboratories, has been strengthened over several years by the South Korean Government.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization recommended intensifying screening programmes as a better way to slow down the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic.The strong demand for large-scale virus spreads caused hundreds of thousands of tests to be delayed in private laboratories in the United States, and the reserves of Equivalence and Chemical Reactivities have been exhausted.
In March 2020, China reported issues related to the reliability of its test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDC had "defects".The government then removed the bureaucratic barriers that impeded private tests.Spain bought test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but it was found that the results were not reliable.
The company explained that the incorrect results could be linked to the inability to collect samples or to use the kits correctly.
The Spanish Ministry stated that it would remove the kits that had produced wrong results and replace them with another test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of test kits purchased in China by the Czech Republic have produced false results. Slovakia has purchased 1.2 million test kits from China that have proved to be defective.
Prime Minister Matovic suggested that they be thrown into the Danube. Ateş Kara of the Ministry of Turkish Health said that the test kits that Turkey bought in China had a "high error rate" and that it did not "use them". The United Kingdom bought 3.5 million test kits in China, but announced in early April 2020 that they were useless.
The screening, followed by the quarantine of those who obtain a positive result and the tracing of those who have been in contact with the carriers of SARS-CoV-2, produced positive results.
The researchers working in the Italian city of Vó, the place of the first death associated with COVID-19 in Italy, conducted two series of tests with the total population of approximately 3,400 people, at approximately ten days of interval.
Nearly half of those with positive results had no symptoms, and all cases discovered were quarantined.
With the restriction of movements in the community, this measure completely eliminated new infections.
Thanks to aggressive contact tracking, travel restrictions, screening and quarantine, the 2020 crown virus pandemic in Singapore has progressed much less rapidly than in other developed countries, but without extreme restrictions such as forced closure of restaurants and retail shops.
Many events were cancelled, and Singapore began to advise residents to stay at their home on March 28, but the schools returned at the scheduled date at the end of the holidays on March 23.
Several other countries also managed the pandemic through aggressive contact tracking, travel restrictions, screening and quarantine, but with less aggressive boundaries, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that countries that have performed the most tests, compared to the number of deaths, have much lower mortality rates, probably because these countries are more capable of detecting people with only slight symptoms or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries with no analytical capacity and whose national laboratories have only limited experience of COVID-19 send their first five positive samples and ten negative samples of COVID-19 to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories to carry out confirmatory tests.
Among the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the "Positive as % of Tests" column depends on national screening policy.
A country that does not test that persons admitted to hospital will have a positive value in % of tests higher than a country that tests all citizens, whether they have symptoms or not, the other factors are the same.
The washing of hands, also called hand hygiene, is the cleaning of hands to remove salads, fats, micro-organisms or other undesirable substances.
The systematic washing of hands with soap at some "key moments" of the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted by gold-fecal means.
It is possible to contract respiratory diseases such as flu or rum, for example by not washing your hands before touching your eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes).
It is important to wash your hands in the soap at five key moments of the day: before and after defecation, after cleaning a baby's face or changing his legs, before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling meat, fish or raw poultry.
If you don't have water or soap under your hand, you can wash your hands up. The World Health Organization recommends washing your hands:
before, during and after the preparation of meals;
before and after taking care of a sick person;
After changing the beds of a baby or cleaning a child who has gone to the toilets;
after being wet or wet/enhanced;
after touching an animal, animal food or animal waste;
The hygiene of hands in the medical environment refers to health practices related to medical procedures.
Washing hands before administering medicines or taking medical care can prevent or reduce the spread of diseases.
The main medical objective of hand washing is to eliminate pathogen agents (bacteria, viruses or other micro-organisms that may cause diseases) and chemicals, which may be harmful or cause diseases.
This practice is particularly important for people who manipulate food or work in the medical field, but also for the general public.
Hand washing has many benefits for health, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhoea; reducing respiratory infections;
as well as reducing the infant mortality rate in domestic shelters.
According to a 2013 study, improvement in hand hygiene practices could lead to a slight improvement in the growth of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates related to respiratory and diarrhoea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioural changes, such as washing hands in the soap.
This simple practice may reduce the mortality rate associated with these diseases by almost 50%.
The introduction of measures to promote hand washing could reduce by about one third the episodes of diarrhoea, a figure comparable to that obtained by providing drinking water to low-income regions.
Washing hands in soap reduces diarrhea episodes by 48% and is the most effective and least expensive way to prevent acute diarrhea and respiratory infections (IRAs). It is an act that must be done automatically in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the main IRAs, is the first cause of mortality among children under five years of age, making nearly 1.8 million victims a year.
Together, diarrhea and pneumonia cause the death of nearly 3.5 million children each year.
According to UNICEF, the habit of washing hands with soap before eating and after going to toilets can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, and reduce the deaths due to diarrhoea and one quarter of the deaths due to acute respiratory infections.
Hand washing is generally associated with other health measures under water, sanitation and hygiene programmes (WASH).
Hand washing also protects from impetigo, which is transmitted by direct physical contact.
Minor deleterious effect, frequent washing of hands can lower the skin by causing skin drying.
A 2012 Danish study revealed that excessive hand washing could lead to echemia or a dermatitis at the hands level, characterized by squeezing skin and removals, and especially frequent among health workers.
Hand washing is also considered to be one of the symptoms of compulsive obsessive disorder (TOC).
It is important to wash your hands in the soap at five key moments of the day to reduce the oro-fecal transmission of the diseases: before and after using the toilets (miction, defecation), after cleaning the cheeks of a baby (or changing its layers), before feeding a child, before and before and after preparing food or processed from meat, fish or crustaceans.
It is also appropriate to wash your hands properly to prevent the transmission of diseases, including before and after having healed a cut or injury, after having lived, bitten or wetted, after touching animal waste or having manipulated animals and after touching orders.
In many countries, the cleaning rate of hands to soap is low.
According to a study conducted in 2015 with 54 countries on hand hygiene, 38.7% of households on average washed their hands with soap. A study conducted in 2014 showed that it was Saudi Arabia that the rate was the highest (97%), the United States was in the middle of the table (77%) and China was showing the lowest rate (23%). Today there are several methods for changing behaviour and democratizing the use of soap for hand washing at the key times of the day. In developing countries, in particular, it is advisable to offer schoolchildren to wash their hands in groups at the specific times of the day in order to make children habitual use of the soap.
For example, the Department of Education of the Philippines has implemented a "primary health care programme" to promote children's health and education.
The disparity twice a year, associated with daily washing of hands in soap and daily brushing of teeth with fluorinated toothpaste, is at the heart of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
To better eliminate the microorganisms present on the skin, soaps or detergents should be added to the water.
The main action of soap and detergents is to reduce barriers to solution and increase solubility.
Water alone is not an effective cleaner for the skin as lipids and proteins, which are organic substances of the soil, are difficult to soluble in water.
An adequate flow of water, however, facilitates cleaning.
The solid soap, due to its reusable nature, may contain bacteria from previous uses.
A small number of studies on the transfer of bacteria from solid contaminated soap concluded that the transfer was unlikely because the bacteria are cut off with the mouse.
The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also indicates that “automatic liquid soap distributors are preferred”.
Antibacterial soaps have been strongly recommended to people who are concerned about their health.
To date, there is no evidence suggesting that the use of antibodies or recommended disinfectants allows the target of antibiotics in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which are resistant to many strains of organisms.
Therefore, even if antibiotic resistant strains are not the result of antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as announced.
In addition to the most complex formulations (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) used to regulate pH, benzoic acid, having an antimicrobial function, and other protective agents (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, extracts from plants).A rigorous analysis by the University of Oregon's University of Public Health revealed that regular soaps were as effective as antibacterial soaps for individuals and containing triclosan to prevent diseases and eliminate hand bacteria.
The hot water used to wash hands is not hot enough to kill the bacteria.
The bacteria multiply much faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, saltwater and soapy water is more effective than cold water and soapy water to eliminate natural oils that contain salads and bacteria.
However, contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that the use of tidal water did not contribute to reducing the microbial burden on the hands.
A hand disinfectant or an antiseptic is a non-aqueous hand hygiene product.
At the end of the 1990s and the beginning of the twenty-first century, non-alcoholic hand hygiene products (called hydroalcoholic solutions, hand antiseptic solutions or hand disinfectants) began to become popular.
Most are formulated on the basis of isopropyl alcohol or ethanol associated with a thickening agent such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) to obtain a gel, or a moisturizer such as glycerin in order to obtain a liquid or foam for greater ease of use and reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
The addition of diluted hydrogen peroxide strengthens antimicrobial activity.The disinfectants for hands containing at least 60 to 95 % alcohol effectively eliminate germs.
Hydroalcoholic solutions kill bacteria, multi-resistant bacteria (SARM and ELV), tuberculosis and certain viruses (including HIV, herpes, VRS, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis), as well as fungi.
Hydroalcoholic solutions containing 70% alcohol eliminate 99.97% (a reduction of 3.5 log equivalent to a reduction of 35 decibels) of bacteria present on the hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.999% (a reduction of 4 to 5 log) of bacteria present on the hands 1 minute after application. Hand disinfectants are more effective against bacteria and less effective against certain viruses.
Hydroalcoholic solutions are almost entirely ineffective against the norovirus virus (or Norwalk), the main cause of infectious gastroenteritis.A sufficient amount of disinfectant for the hands or hydroalcoholic solution must be used to moisturize or cover both hands.
The thumb and back of both hands, as well as the interstices between fingers and nails for about 30 seconds, should be faced until the liquid, mousse or gel is dry.
The U.S. Centre for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing hands rather than using hydroalcoholic solutions, especially when hands are clearly salty.
The increased use of these products is due to their ease of use and rapid disposal of micro-organisms; however, they must not replace an adequate hand washing unless you have water and hand-held soap.
The frequent use of hydroalcoholic solutions may result in skin drying if the formula is not reinforced by emulsifiers and/or skin hydrating agents.
The drying effect of alcohol may be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emulsifiers to the formula.
In clinical trials, hydroalcoholic solutions containing emulsifiers caused significantly less irritation and dry skin than antimicrobial soaps or detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in hydro-alcoholic solutions are rare.
The fact that hydroalcoholic solutions tend to cause annoying contact dermatitis has made them more attractive than washing hands in water and soap.
Despite their effectiveness, non-aqueous products do not eliminate the organic matter on their hands, but only disinfect them.
That is why hand disinfectants are not as effective as soap and water to prevent the spread of many pathogens, since they remain on their hands.
The effectiveness of non-alcoholic hand disinfectants depends heavily on the ingredients and formula, and has always been significantly lower than that of alcohol and alcohol-based disinfectants.
More recently, the formulations using benzalkonium chloride have shown a sustainable and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, whose efficacy is reduced after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin adverse reactions.
In low-income populations, many are those who do not have the means to buy soap, and who use ash or soil instead.
Cinderella or soil can be more effective than water alone, but less than soap.
Moreover, if soil or ash is contaminated by micro-organisms, it may increase the spread of diseases instead of stopping them.
As with soap, the ashes are also a disinfectant because, in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
WHO recommends ashes or sand as an alternative to soap when not available.
The U.S. Centre for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that the hands be properly washed to prevent the transmission of diseases, as follows:
Wet your hands with hot or cold water.
Current water is recommended because of the risk of contamination of stagnant water points, while the water temperature does not appear to vary).
Weave a generous amount of soap on your hands by rubbing each other against each other, not forgetting the back of your hands, between your fingers and your nails.
The soap removes the germs of the skin, and studies reveal that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap than with water alone.
Frutter for at least 20 seconds.
Fritter action creates friction, which helps to eliminate the germs of the skin, and longer frutting removes more germs.
Rinse enough in running water.
Cleaning in a stagnant water basin can lead to hand recontamination.
Dry with a clean or air-free tray.
Wet hands and wet hands are more easily re-contaminated.The most often forgotten areas are the thumb, wrist, spaces between fingers and under the nails.
Artificial nails and extended nail paints can accommodate micro-organisms.
A moisturizing lotion is often recommended to avoid dry hands; skin dryness promotes the emergence of skin lesions that may increase the risk of transmission of infections.
There are many economic alternatives to wash your hands when tap water and/or soap are not available. For example, coloring water from a well or from a well suspended and perforated well and/or using ash as needed in developing countries.In situations where water supply is limited (such as in schools or rural areas of developing countries), there are solutions to save water, such as tippy taps and other economic options.
A tippy-tap is a simple technology that uses a hook suspended with the help of a rope, and a pedal that allows you to pay a small amount of water on your hands and a soap bread.
Hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but the best way to dry hands in public toilets is to discuss it.
More and more research suggests that paper towels are much more hygienic than electric towels that are often found in toilets.
In 2008, a study funded by the paper industry, the European Tissue Symposium, was conducted by the University of Westminster (London), to compare the levels of hygiene offered by paper towels, hot-air dryers and more modern air dryers.
After the washing and drying of hands in the hot-mins, it was found that the total number of bacteria increased on average 194 per cent on the thumb pulp and 254 per cent on the palms.
Drying in the morning air resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria on the fingertips of 42% and on the 15% brakes.
After washing and drying hands with a paper tray, the total number of bacteria was reduced by 76% on average on the thumb pulp and up to 77% on the thumbs.Scientists also conducted tests to determine whether there was a cross-contamination potential with other toilet users and the toilet environment according to each drying method.
The air-jecting drying system, which breathes from the air outside the apparatus at speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is capable of expelling the micro-organisms from the hands and the apparatus and possibly contaminating other users of the toilet and the toilet environment in a perimeter up to 2 metres.
The use of a hot-air dry matter allows the spread of micro-organisms at a maximum distance of 0.25 metres from dry-water.
Paper towels revealed that there was no significant spread of micro-organisms. In 2005, in a study conducted by the TÜV Product und Umwelt, different methods of drying the hands were evaluated.
After hand drying, the following variations in bacterial count were observed:
There are many different dry-mint manufacturers, and dry-mints have been compared to dry-mint using paper towels.
Washing hands with disinfectants is an alternative during movements, in the absence of soap and water.
Hydroalcoholic solutions must contain at least 60% of alcohol.
The washing of hands in a medical environment became mandatory long after Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) to prevent diseases in a hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that emit reminders when hospital staff forget to wash their hands.
One study found that their use resulted in a decrease in infection rates.
Medical hand washing should last at least 15 seconds, using a generous amount of soap and water or ice to make each part of the hand wet and spray.
Hands must be rubbed against each other by passing between fingers.
In the case of nail residues, it is possible to use a hair brush to remove them.
Since germs present in the water are likely to stay on the hands, it is important to wash well and try with a clean dish.
After drying, the paper tray must be used to close the tap (and open the exit door if necessary).
This prevents hands from being retied to the surface contact.
The aim of hand washing in health structures is to remove the pathogen microorganisms ("germes") and to avoid transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the insufficient rate of hand cleaning remains unacceptable in most medical institutions, a large number of doctors and nurses who forget to wash their hands regularly before touching their patients, which facilitates the transmission of microorganisms.
According to one study, the correct washing of hands and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of catheter-related blood infections by 66 per cent. The World Health Organization has published a brochure describing the standard procedure to be followed to wash and rub hands in the field of health.
The draft guidelines on the hygiene of hands established by the Organization can also be consulted on the website to collect comments from internet users.
A relevant analysis was conducted by Whitby and al.
Devices available in the trade may measure and certify the hygiene of the hands if compliance with the regulations is impaired.
The World Health Organization defines "Five indications" concerning hand hygiene:
after exposure to the blood/biological liquid;
before an aseptic gesture; and
after having had contact with the patient. Adding antiseptic chemicals to the soap (known as "medicines" or "antimicrobials") provides the hand washing agent with an action to destroy the germs.
It is desirable to eliminate these germs before performing surgery or in environments where antibiotics-resistant organisms are very widespread. To "break" hands for surgical surgery, it is necessary to have a tap that can be opened and closed without touching hands, a chlorhexidine or iodine wash product, sterile towels to dry hands after washing them, a sterile brush to fry and another sterile tool to clean under nails.
All jewelry must be removed.
As part of this procedure, hands and forearms should be washed to the thigh, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
You don't have to shake your hands for 10 minutes.
When cleaning, you must avoid that water on the front door does not flow into your hands.
Once the hands are washed, hands should be dried with a sterile cloth and a surgical coat should be applied.
In order to reduce the spread of germs, it is preferable to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for your hands before and after taking care of a sick person.
Regarding the control of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that the main benefits of hand washing were obtained during the first 20% of the wash, and that there were only very few additional benefits to increase the hand washing frequency above 35%.
If hand washing is compared to an ordinary soap with an antibacterial soap, the rate of infectious bacterial diseases transmitted to food is more than three times higher. Similarly, by comparing hand cleaning with an alcohol-based solution and hand washing with an antibacterial soap for an average duration of 30 seconds each, the first decreases bacterial contamination by 26% compared to the second.
But soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based products to reduce influenza A virus (H1N1) and the difficult hand spores of Clostridium. In order to improve the hygiene of hands in health care facilities, it is possible, among other things, to train hand washing personnel, to make more alcohol-based products available to the patient and to send him written and oral reminders.
Further research is needed to identify the most effective interventions in different health structures.
In developing countries it is considered that washing hands in soap is a low cost and essential tool to preserve health or to eat properly.
However, due to the lack of reliable water, soap or facilities to wash their hands at home, at school and at work, it is difficult to achieve universal hand hygiene habits.
For example, in most rural Africa, it is rare to find taps to wash hands near private or public toilets, despite the existence of economic options to build hand washing stations.
However, low hand washing rates can also be attributed to tenacious habits, rather than to a lack of soap or water.
Promoting the washing of hands in soap and conducting awareness-raising activities in this regard can affect political decisions, convey the benefits of this practice and bring about a long-term change in behaviour in the population.
In order to complete this process, monitoring and evaluation activities are needed.
A systematic review of 70 studies revealed that local approaches are effective in increasing the rate of hand washing in low and middle-income countries, and that social marketing campaigns are less effective. As regards the promotion of hand washing in schools, the example of "The Three-Star Approach" from UNICEF can be cited, which encourages schools to take simple and low-cost measures to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, while respecting other hygiene rules.
Once minimum standards are met, schools can move from one to three final stars.
The construction of hand washing stations can be included in the hand hygiene campaigns that are carried out to reduce childhood diseases and mortality.
The World Handwashing Day is another example of awareness-raising campaign that claims to promote behavioural development.After the 2019-2020 crown virus pandemic, UNICEF encouraged the adoption of an emoji illustrating hand washing.
Few studies have examined the overall cost-effectiveness report of hand washing in developing countries compared with the number of healthy years of life (i.e. DALY avoided).
However, a review suggests that the promotion of the washing of hands in soap is significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of hand washing for human health, especially for people in vulnerable situations such as mothers who have just been hospitalized or wounded soldiers, has been identified for the first time in the mid-19th century by two hand hygiene pioneers: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the British "founder of modern nurses" .
At that time, most people still believed that the infections were due to the fertile odors called miasms.
In the 1980s, food epidemics and nosocomial infections led the American Centres for Disease Control and Prevention to actively promote hand hygiene as an essential means of preventing the spread of infections.
The emergence of porcine influenza in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 have led to a greater awareness in many countries of the need to wash hands with soap to deal with these infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, posters illustrating the "good hand washing techniques" were placed next to the vaults in public toilets and in office and airport toilets.
The expression "washing hands" refers to a person's refusal to assume responsibility or to be involved in something.
It is derived from a Bible verse from Matthew in which Pontius Pilate washes his hands of the decision to cross Jesus Christ, but this expression has spread widely in some English communities.
In Macbeth, Shakespeare, Lady Macbeth undertakes to wash her hands compulsively in order to try to clean up an imaginary spot, a symbol of her poor conscience in view of the crimes she has committed and that she has encouraged her husband to commit.
It was also found that some people, after remembering that they had committed acts contrary to ethics or had planned to do so, tend to wash their hands more often than others and to give more value to hand washing devices.
In addition, those who are allowed to wash their hands after having had this kind of thinking are less inclined to take other compensatory measures of "cleaning", such as volunteering.
Some religions prescribe the washing of hands for both hygienic and symbolic purposes. The symbolic washing of hands, which consists of using water and not soap to wash their hands, is part of the rituals of washing hands in many religions, including Bahaism and Hinduism, immersion (tevilah) and ritualization of hands (Nétilat Yadayim) in Judaism, the lavabo in Christianity and the Woodhu in Islam. The religions also prescribe the washing of hands for hygienic purposes, especially after certain actions.
According to Hinduism, Judaism and Islam, it is imperative to wash your hands after going to the toilets.
Similarly, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam demand that they wash their hands before and after each meal.
Controls of the risks of COVID-19 on the workplace
COVID-19 risk controls on the workplace indicate the implementation of health and safety methodologies to work for risk control for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Appropriate workplace risk controls vary according to the workplace and tasks, based on an assessment of the risks of exposure sources, severity of the disease in the community and individual risk factors for workers who may be vulnerable to COVID-19 infection.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in the United States, the lowest risk exposure jobs have minimal professional contact with the public and other employees. In this case, only basic prevention measures against infection are recommended, including hand washing, the encouragement of workers to stay at home if they are sick, the respiratory label and the maintenance of cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
Medium-exposure jobs include those that require frequent or close contact with persons without suspected or known COVID-19 but can be infected due to a current Community transmission or international travel.
This includes workers in contact with the general public, particularly in schools, high-density working environments and some high-volume retail environments.
Risk controls in this group, in addition to basic prevention measures for infection, include high-efficiency air filters ventilation, hygienic glasses and the provision of individual protective equipment in case of encounter with a person affected by COVID-19.
OSHA considers health and funeral workers exposed to persons with suspected or known COVID-19 as having a high risk of exposure, going to a very high risk if they perform procedures producing aerosols or taking or handling samples of persons with suspected or known COVID-19.
Appropriate risk controls for these workers include technical controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and individual protective equipment adapted to the task.
COVID-19 epidemics can have several effects on the workplace.
Workers may be absent because they have fallen ill, have to take care of other people or fear a possible exposure.
Trade models can change, both with respect to the goods requested and with regard to the means of acquiring them (in particular to run outside of peak hours or to use delivery or drive services).
Finally, the dispatch of articles from geographical regions severely affected by COVID-19 may be interrupted. A plan for the preparation and response to infectious diseases may be used as a guide for protection measures.
The plans take into account risk levels associated with different workplaces and tasks, including exposure sources, family and community risk factors and individual risk factors for workers such as advanced age or chronic pathologies.
They also lose the necessary controls to address these risks and emergency plans for situations that may arise as a result of epidemics.
Preparation and response plans for infectious diseases may be recommended by national or regional authorities.
The objectives of response to an epidemic include the reduction of the transmission among staff, the protection of persons at higher risk of medical complications, the maintenance of commercial operations and the reduction of undesirable effects on other entities of their supply chain.
The severity of the disease in the community where the company is located affects the answers applied.
The risk control hierarchy is a comprehensive framework used in health and safety at work to group risk control by efficiency.
Where the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are technical controls, followed by administrative controls and at the end of individual protective equipment.
Technical checks involve isolation of employees from work-related risks without having to rely on the behaviour of workers; they can be the most economical solution to be implemented.
Administrative controls identify changes in policies or procedures to work which require action by the worker or employer.
Individual protection equipment (EPI) is considered less effective than technical and administrative controls, but can help prevent certain exposures.
All types of EPI shall be selected according to the risk to the worker, properly adapted to the needs (e.g. breathing masks), properly and systematically, regularly inspected, maintained and replaced as necessary, and properly removed, cleaned and stored or received to avoid any contamination.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in the United States, the lowest risk of exposure jobs have minimal professional contact with the public and other employees.
The recommended basic prevention measures for all workplaces include frequent and minute washing of hands, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are sick, breathing label, including covering their mouth and nose to touch and strain, providing towels and trash, preparing for telework or working hours, preventing workers from using other tools and equipment and keeping clean and disinfecting the working environment.
The identification and rapid isolation of potentially infectious people is a crucial step in the protection of workers, clients, visitors and others at work.
The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States recommend that employees with acute respiratory disease symptoms stay at home until they have had enough fever, fever signs or any other symptoms since at least 24 hours without the use of fevers or other medications acting on the symptoms. They also recommend that flexible disease leave policies be applied, allow employees to stay at home to take care of a sick family member and inform employees of these policies.
According to OSHA, medium-exposure jobs include those who require frequent or close contact, at least six feet (1.8 m), of persons without COVID-19 suspected or known, but who may be infected by SARS-CoV-2 due to a current Community transmission around the company's headquarters or because the person has recently made an international journey in a region with a widespread transmission of COVID-19.
This includes workers in contact with the general public, particularly in schools, high-density working environments and certain high-volume detailed environments. The technical controls for this group and those at higher risk include the installation of high-efficiency air filters, the setting up of standard work hours, the establishment of physical barriers such as transparent plastic hygiene windows and the installation of a driving window for the client service. The administrative controls for this group and those at higher risk include the encouragement of workers who are at home or who are at risk of staying at home, the replacement of meetings in person by virtual communications, the setting up of standard working hours of work, the establishment of staff management agencies, the interruption of client's visits to non-requestorial care, and the establishment of care agencies in the field of administration, and management agencies, including the administration of the departmental staff, and the administration of the departmental staff, and the departmental staff of the departmental staff of the institution, and the departmental staff of the departmental staff of the institution.
Workers in this risk group rarely need to use breathing masks.
If a person falls ill on board an aircraft, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include the following measures: separating the patient from the other by a distance of 6 feet, designing a crew member to take care of the patient and offering a protective mask to the patient or asking him to cover his mouth and nose with the help of mosquitoes when he or she moves.
The cabin crew shall carry removable medical gloves when handling a sick passenger or touching organic liquids or potentially contaminated surfaces and, if possible, additional individual protective equipment if the sick passenger has fever, persistent cough or respiratory difficulties.
For commercial navigation, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, risk controls include the delay of the journey in case of disease and the self-insulation and immediate information of the on-board medical centre if a fever or other symptoms develop.
Ideally, medical monitoring must take place in the cabin of the isolated person. For school establishments and childcare, CDCs recommend a short-term closure for cleaning and disinfection purposes if an infected person has gone to a school building, regardless of community propaganda.
In the case of minimum Community transmission, social distance strategies can be implemented, such as the cancellation of educational outputs, assemblies and other important assemblies such as physical or choral education courses or canteen meals, by increasing the space between offices, by scaling up arrival and departure hours, by reducing non-essential visitors and by using a separate nurse for children with flu symptoms.
In the event of major transmission in the local community, in addition to social exclusion strategies, an extension of school vacations may be considered. For the order forces carrying out daily routine activities, the immediate health risk is considered to be low by CDCs.
Officers of the command forces who must contact persons with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 must follow the same guidelines as ambulances, including the port of an appropriate individual protection equipment.
In the event of close contact during arrest, workers must clean and disinfect their equipment and service belt before re-use by means of a sheet or spray removes and follows the standard procedures for the confiscation and reception of used EPIs, as well as for the confiscation and washing of clothing.
OSHA considers some health and funeral workers to belong to high or very high risk of exposure.
High-risk exposure jobs include health care, support, laboratory and medical transport workers who are exposed to patients with suspected or known COVID-19.
They become highly exposed workers if they perform procedures producing aerosols or sampling or handling of patients with suspected or known COVID-19.
Aerosol production procedures include intubation, induction procedures, bronchoscopy, certain dental examinations and procedures or invasive sampling.
High-risk funeral jobs include workers involved in the preparation of human bodies with COVID-19 suspected or known at the time of their death; they pass to a very high risk of exposure if they perform an autopsy. Additional technical controls of these risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with COVID-19 suspected or known, including when conducting aerosol production procedures.
Specialized negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in certain health and funeral environments.
Samples shall be handled using Level 3 biological safety precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients enter separate waiting rooms based on the suspicion of COVID-19. In addition to other HPI, OSHA recommends respiratory masks for persons who work at least 6 feet of patients with suspected or known SARS-CoV-2 infection and those who perform aerosol-producing procedures.
In the United States, N95 filter breathing masks approved by NIOSH or higher shall be used in the context of a complete and written respiratory protection program including adaptation, training and medical examinations.
Other types of respiratory masks can provide superior protection and better comfort for the worker. WHO does not recommend combinations, because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease rather than transmitted by organic fluids.
The WHO recommends the port of a surgical mask only by the check-in staff at the point of entry.
For those who collect breathing samples, take care of or transport COVID-19 patients in the absence of procedures producing aerosols, WHO recommends a surgical mask, protective glasses or face screen, a blouse and gloves.
In the case of aerosols, the surgical mask is replaced by a respiratory mask N95 or FFP2.
Given that the global supply of EPI is insufficient, WHO recommends limiting the need for EPI by means of telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, limiting access to a location occupied by a COVID-19 patient to people directly involved in his care, using the necessary EPIs to the specific task only, continuing use of the same respiratory mask without removing it for the care of several patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordination of the supply chain of EPIs and preventing the use of masks for asymptomatic individuals.

OBJECTIVE: [Covid-19] Lighten the burden and prepare the future
DATE/Time of dispatch: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
LICENCE: CC0: No reserved rights
We find ourselves in an exceptional situation this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is a clear demonstration of our global human connection and of our responsibilities to each other.
His challenges are unprecedented, but we know that our best response is based on the type of empathy, cooperation and community-wide strengthening that is at the heart of this organization.
The friendship and well-being we have observed among all our colleagues in e-mails, calls and instant conversations is a remarkable witness to the incredible human beings we have the chance to work with.
I could not be more grateful and proud of all of you among my colleagues.
Last week, someone told me of his gratitude for our work.
This person reminded me how important it is for the world to be able to consult Wikipedia at the moment, and the strong symbol that represents the fact that this essential resource remains online and accessible to all.
This is possible thanks to your work, which you maintain on the operational sites, ensure the payment of our colleagues or the security of our communities.
The world needs information provided by Wikipedia, now more than ever.
This is a time when not only what we do but also how we do it will have a significant impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and the role you play there, we will make adjustments to how we work together from next week.
Adjustments to our work and our time jobs
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the team met last night to discuss our approach and our use of time in the days and months to come.
During this discussion, we considered what we think would be an appropriate response to the situation we are facing and the best way to ensure the sustainability of the organization during this period.
We had first to eliminate stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to take back, don't worry.
All staff, contractors and contractors:
our daily working time target will be approximately 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week to a new order.
We will not declare holidays: if you are able to ensure more normal working hours, you can be useful to the mission.
However, the world is unpredictable at the present time, and if you need to take care of your loved ones, to race, or to consult a doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We're not watching your hours.
If you're sick, don't work.
That should go away without saying, but we say so.
No sickness or paid leave is required: just prevent your superior and help your team to review time schedules and jobs to ensure that the main areas of work are covered.
(If you have a positive diagnosis of COVID-19, please prevent Bryan from the Department of T&amp;C Ops for T&amp;C to help you and ensure that your situation receives the necessary attention from the management).
The hourly staff will be fully paid.
We have already announced it, and we will reiterate our commitment to honour our responsibilities to our subcontractors and our fellow staff members.
Everyone will be paid on the basis of their normal working hours under normal conditions.
This is true if you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a way to eliminate their stress related to the world around us.
What we do can be incredibly gratifying, especially in times like this.
Once again, the goal is to preserve you.
We simply ask you to communicate with your superior, so that we know what we expect and can take the necessary steps.
Some tasks are considered essential.
There are some things we must continue to do.
SRE, Ops HR, Trust &amp; Security and Fund Collection teams (including) carry out an essential work that may need strengthening.
We will initiate a process with all departments to assess the current objectives and focus on supporting the core tasks of our mission.
There is enough work for each and every one of us, we are just going to focus on the most essential projects.
Slowing down now won't hurt you any more.
We do not intend to "work twice as much to catch up with the lost time" when the pandemic is over.
We will not ask you to take extra hours to meet unrealistic times now.
We recognize that the circumstances have changed, and we will strive to set new goals and timetables if necessary.
What is the APP (Annual Planning)?
In order to adapt to our new reality and to the objectives of daily working time, we plan to adjust the deadline for the delivery of our annual plan 2020-2021.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan that provides for more time to prepare a budget to allow employees to focus on essential work, to take care of them and their loved ones while adapting to those who need or want to see their reduced schedule in the coming weeks.
This extension of deadlines significantly reduces the workload and pressure of current planning throughout the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Council next week and inform delegates and teams of the next steps as soon as possible.
Thank you to the APP team for your leadership in this regard.
Situation, exhibition and cleaning of the office
Last week, we learned that one of our San Francisco-based colleagues could have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, by excessive caution, we have called on an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all the surfaces of the San Francisco office.
They used an antiviral solution of hospital quality to disinfect all surfaces, as well as the entrance hall and elevator cassettes leading to our floor.
The building uses its own due diligence protocol that uses products to ensure the safety of its tenants.
We are convinced that the office will be well prepared when we decide to come back.
Our Washington DC office is located in a WeWork site, which shared with us and with all staff based in Washington DC its COVID-19 protocol.
Since last week, our Washington DC office has adopted a completely remote configuration according to the advice of San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues in New York know, we also discussed the idea of renting a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions continue but could be updated.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our usual colleagues at remote work were aware that adaptation can be difficult and wanted to offer you some advice:
Reduce meeting time to a maximum of one or two hours.
If longer meetings are required, consider distributing them over several days.
Define the meeting clearly, have a agenda and send the documentation in advance.
Make videos the standard, thanks to tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to encourage online collaboration and exchange.
To provide a coordinator to facilitate each meeting, someone to monitor the instantaneous conversation and the list of speakers, and someone to assist in taking notes (or taking collective notes).
Send an email to technical support if you need a comfortable helmet.
Use your well-being refund for breakfasts.
Join the #remote channel on Slack to talk to your colleagues about the distribution of work
The HR Operations Team is studying ergonomic guidelines based on webinars to support increased distribution of work in the Foundation.
Last week, we asked all the beneficiaries of the Community grant to cancel the public events financed by Wikimedia, such as the edit-a-thons, until the WHO announces the end of the pandemic.
We explained to them that we understood that our requests for cancellation and other restrictions could make it impossible to carry out their agreed grant activities and that no one would be penalized in the event of delay or modification of these objectives.
Next week we will publish additional directives on Wikimania and other thematic and regional Community conferences.
The general feeling of the international community seems to be both sadness over the turmoil and relief in the face of clarity and the possibility of focusing on its own communities, Wikimedia and others.
As far as possible, the CRT is working to create a page on Meta-Wiki to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and continue our communications with them.
Stay in touch despite problems related to COVID-19
We will send an invitation to your calendars for an extraordinary meeting of the staff next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07/00 PT.
We will take advantage of this moment to share other updates, answer your questions and spend time together.
This situation concerns us all and we are here to help you in any way.
From here, you can always find the information contained in this email, as well as all other essential information related to COVID-19, on Office Wiki.
The CRT will update these pages and collect all information at the same location.
We also strive to maintain regular communications with staff living in countries that are currently seriously affected.
If you have questions about travel, events, important workflow or coverage difficulties, or need help for whatever else, do not hesitate to prevent and work with the CRT.
We are here to support you and ensure the connection if necessary.
For any confidential or sensitive matter, please send an e-mail to Bryan Judah, Director of International Global Operations HR.
None of these changes should be seen as abandonment of our work and our obligations.
Rather, it is to recognize that at present our work and our obligations will probably have to be adapted in an unprecedented way.
These steps are those we consider necessary to support each other and to be able to continue our work, to provide our movement with the help it needs, and to offer the service that everyone can count on.
Our planned work will be here to wait for us.
For now, it is time to train and prepare for the important work that will come in the weeks and perhaps the months to come.
We need each one of you to get there, that's why you need to keep and take care of your families so that you can give the best of yourself at the time.
Finally, please: wash your hands and do not touch your face!
Katherine, the CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S), and the rest of the management team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robin A, Ryan M and Toby N).
b'Angiotensin 2 (ACE2) converting enzyme is an enzyme linked to the external (cell membrane) of the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney and intestines cells.
The ACE2 against the activity of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and increasing the Ang (1-7) which makes it a promising drug target in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. The ACE2 is also the point of entry into the cells of certain coronary viruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often designated as hACE2.
Angiotensin 2 converting enzyme is a metalloenzyme containing zinc on the surface of endothelial cells and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains an M2 domain of peptidease at end N and a collection area of amino acid carrier renally at end C.
ACE2 is a single-pass type I membrane protein whose active enzyme field is exposed to the surface of the lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ACE2 is raised from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme called sheddase; the resulting soluble protein is released in the bloodstream and finally excreted in the urine.
The ACE2 is present in most organs: the ACE2 is related to the cell membrane mainly of Type II pulmonary alveoleum cells, the enerocytes of the grey intestine, the arterial and venous endothelial cells and the arterial cells of the smooth muscles of most organs.
The expression of the ACE2 RNAm is also present in the brain cortex, striatum, hypothalamus and the brain trunk.
The primary function of ACE2 is to compensate the ACE.
The ACE stimulates angiotensin I hormone in angiotensin II vasoconstrictor.
The ACE2 turns the amino phenylamine amino acid into angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-He-Pro-Phe) and vasodilator angiotensin hydrolysis (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 may also raise several other peptides including [des-Arg9]-bradykinine, apeline, neurotensin, dinorphine A, and greyline.
The ACE2 also regulates the membrane circulation of the neutral amino acid carrier SLC6A19 and is involved in Hartnup's disease.
As transmembrane protein, ACE2 is the main entry point in the cells of certain coronary viruses, including HCV-NL63; SARS-CoV (SRAS-origin virus); and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19-origin virus).
More specifically, the binding of the S1 specular protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 to the enzyme field of ACE2 to the surface of cells results in both endocytosis and translocation of the virus and enzyme in endosoms within cells.
This process of entry also requires the start-up of protein S by serum serum protease TMPRSS2, the inhibition of the protein is currently the subject of research as a potential treatment. This leads some to believe that reducing ACE2 levels in cells can help fight infection.
However, several professional companies and regulatory bodies have recommended continuing the standard treatment with the help of ACE and ARB inhibitors.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012 showed that "the use of ACE inhibitors has been associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to witness subjects."
In addition, "the risk of pneumonia has also been reduced in patients treated with an ACE inhibitor who had a higher risk of pneumonia, particularly those with CVA and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors has also been associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were less convincing than for the overall risk of pneumonia."
Angiotensin 2 recombinant human enzyme (rhACE2) is present as an innovative treatment of severe pulmonary lesions and appears to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in the porcelesoids affected by acute respiratory distress syndrome induced by lipopolysaccharide.
The half-life of rhACE2 in man is approximately 10 hours and the duration of action is 30 minutes in addition to the duration of effect (length) of 24 hours.
Several conclusions suggested that rhACE2 could be a promising medicine for people who are intolerant to the classic renin-angiotensin-system inhibitors (SRAs) or for diseases with high angiotensin II circulation. rhACE2 per infusion has been evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The COVID-19 applications are mobile applications designed to facilitate the tracing of contacts in the context of the pandemic of coronavirus 2019-20, i.e. the identification of people ("contacts") likely to be in contact with an infected individual.
Various applications have been developed or proposed, with the official support of the Government in certain territories and in certain jurisdictions.
Several infrastructures have been developed for the design of contact tracking applications.
These systems, in particular those based on the geographical location of application users, raise issues of privacy.
There are other less intrusive options, including the use of Bluetooth signals to record the proximity of a user with other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced direct integration into their Android and iOS operating systems of a functionality that will support these Bluetooth applications.
The Chinese government, in association with Alipay, has deployed an application in China that enables citizens to verify whether they have been in contact with people with COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities. Singapore has, as far as it is concerned, chosen for an application called TraceTogether.
Developed by a local IT community, it has been provided in an open source and will be returned to the government. North Macedonia launched "StopKorona!" a Bluetooth application to track exposure to potentially infected people and quickly communicate with health authorities.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of 14 April 2020, the application was pending approval by the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government stated that the tracking of contacts was at an advanced stage of development and could be deployed over the coming weeks.
Australia and New Zealand are considering implementing applications on the TraceTogether model in Singapore and on the basis of the BlueTrace protocol. Russia wishes to introduce a geoperage application for patients with a COVID-19 diagnosis and living in Moscow to ensure that they do not leave their home.
Ross Anderson, a professor of safety engineering at Cambridge University, raised several possible practical problems related to the use of application-based systems, including false positives and the lack of potential effectiveness if only a small part of the population uses the application.
In response to concerns about the spread of false or harmful "coronavirus" applications, Apple only allows "official" or generally trusted organizations to add coronavirus-related applications to the App Store.
Google and Amazon have applied similar restrictions.
Stimulants for the protection of privacy have expressed their concerns about the implications of coronavirus applications in mass surveillance, in particular the possible decommissioning of the surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic once the threat has been removed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for the limitation of this type of surveillance.
These organizations have laid down eight conditions for compliance with government projects:
monitoring should be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
extensions of control and surveillance should include extinction clauses;
the use of data should be limited to the objectives of combating COVID-19;
data security and anonymity should be demonstrated;
digital surveillance should ensure that any exacerbation of discrimination and marginalization is avoided;
any sharing of data with third parties should be defined in the Act;
protection against abuse and appeals for citizens in the event of abuse should be provided;
The "significant participation" of all "relevant stakeholders" would be mandatory, including those of public health experts and marginalized groups. Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter Without Borders) (RSF) in Germany also published checklists.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple aims to address the problem of the persistence of surveillance by removing the tracking mechanism of the operating system of their devices as soon as it is no longer necessary.
Some countries have used a network geolocation system instead of applications, which eliminates both the need to download an application and the ability to avoid tracing.
In Israel, network tracking was approved.
Network solutions with access to gross geolocation data present important potential privacy issues.
However, all systems based on central servers do not need access to personal location data; several systems have been created to use central servers only for communication, which allows respect for privacy (see section below).
In South Korea, a system not based on an application was used to track contacts.
Instead of using a dedicated application, the system has collected tracking information from various sources, including data on the tracking of mobile devices and transactions by map, which they have then associated to send SMS warnings to potentially infected people.
In addition to the use of this information to warn potential contacts, the Government has also made localization information accessible to the public, which was allowed as a result of the profound changes to the privacy laws of the information after the MERS epidemic that affected the country.
This information is accessible to the public through several applications and websites. Countries such as Germany have considered the use of centralized systems that preserve privacy.
The details had not yet been communicated on 6 April 2020.
The tracking of privacy contacts is a well-established concept, supported by a large volume of research data since 2013. On April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy solutions, using, among other things, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology to record the proximity of a user with other mobile phones.
However, the PEPP-PT project is a coordination effort that combines centralized and decentralised approaches and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracking (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN, previously named Contact Event Numbers, CEN), Privacy Sensitive Protocols and Mechanisms for Mobile Contact Tracking (PACT), among others.
These protocols ensure that the identifiable personal data never leave the device and that all the corresponding inputs are carried out on the device.
The MIT Media Lab Privacy Group is currently developing SafePaths, a platform for the use of privacy conservation techniques in the collection and use of location or contact data to monitor the spread of COVID-19.
This technique is based on the results of the White Paper "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintenance Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" published in March 2020. Enigma MPC's SafeTrace platform, a company developing privacy protection technologies originally based on the MIT Media Lab, is another similar effort.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and authorities, without compromising confidentiality.
On 5 April 2020, the TCN International Coalition was founded by groups gathered around a common approach and protocols that are essentially equivalent, in order to reduce fragmentation and ensure global interoperability of tracking and warning applications, an essential factor for their adoption by a wide public.
On 9 April 2020, the Government of Singapore announced the publication of the source code of the BlueTrace Protocol used by its official application.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, which control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative to track contacts, stating that it would preserve privacy and associate Bluetooth Low Energy technology and a privacy-inspiring cryptography.
They also published the specifications of the basic technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system should be deployed in three phases:
deployment of tools for governments to create official coronavirus tracking applications that respect privacy
direct integration of this functionality into iOS and Android. Google and Apple plan to solve the problems of the adoption of the monitoring solution and persistence by initially distributing the system by updating the operating system and later removing it from the same way once the remote threat.
The replacement of a medicinal product (also called reorientation, replication, re-appointment or change in the therapeutic indication of a medicinal product) means the conversion of an approved medicinal product for a disease or other medical condition for which it was originally developed.
This is a scientific research axis currently being studied to develop safe and effective treatments against COVID-19.
Other research axes include the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 and plasma transfusion of convalescent people. SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 therapeutic target proteins, each of which has several binding binding sites.
The analysis of these binding sites offers the realistic project of developing an effective antiviral drug against the proteins of COVID-19.
Among the most important target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are papaine type protease, NRA polymerase dependent NRA, helicase, S protein and RAP ribose phosphatase.
Hussein A A, and al. studied several candidate compounds that they then optimized and analyzed to determine their structural similarity with the most approved medicinal products to accelerate the development of a powerful anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug in their preclinical study to recommend in the design of a clinical study.
Chloroquine is an antipaludene medicine also used against certain autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that related chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would be part of the four medicines studied in the Solidarity clinical trial.
The Governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, announced that New York State tests on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would begin on March 24th. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulphate and chloroquine phosphate under an Emergency Use Authorisation (USA).
Treatment has not been approved by the FDA clinical trial process and is only authorised under the US as an experimental treatment for emergency use in hospitalized patients but cannot receive treatment in a clinical trial.
The CDC stated that "the use, dose or duration of administration of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-COV-2 infection" has not yet been established.
Doctors have indicated using this medicine "when there is no other option".
A Turkish research team in Istanbul conducted a small study on the use of chloroquine in association with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
More extensive studies are underway at Duke University and Oxford University.
The NYU Langone Medical School carries out a safety and efficacy test on the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials conducted in Wuhan and Shenzhen confirmed that favipiravir was “clearly effective”.
35 patients in Shenzhen were tested negative within an average of 4 days, while the duration of the disease was 11 days in 45 patients who had not received it.
In a study conducted in Wuhan in 240 patients with pneumonia, half received favipiravir and the other half received omifenovir.
The Italian Medicines Agency has reminded the public that the evidence for medicinal product is false and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would purchase the medicine in Japan for its reservations and that it would use the army to deliver the medicine to university hospitals where the medicine would be used to care for patients affected by COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has opened up opportunities for the Trump administration to buy the medicine. The medicine may be less effective in serious cases of the disease where the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or those trying to produce.
A study on lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of the antivirals lopinavir and ritonavir, concluded that "no benefit was observed".
These medicines have been designed to inhibit the replication of HIV by binding to protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify these drugs to find a compound that would be associated with SARS-CoV-2 protease. There are criticisms in the scientific community about the use of resources for drug relocation especially developed for HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international solidarity test.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as treatment for Ebola virus and Marburg viral infections. Gilead Sciences then discovered that remdesivir had an antiviral activity in vitro against several philoviruses, pneumonia, paramyxoviruses and coronaviruses.
A problem with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to a more severe disease and transmission.
Some early pre-test studies suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. Several clinical trials are underway, two of which were conducted by universities in Cleveland; one on people with moderate pathology and the other on those with more severe forms.
There are three ongoing clinical trials on vitamin C intravenously for people who are hospitalized and severely ill with COVID-19; two placebo-controlled patients (China and Canada) and one with no control (Italy).
The State of New York began tests on azithromycin antibiotics on 24 March 2020.
The Japanese National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) provides a clinical trial on Teijin alvesco (cyclosoneide), a corticosteroid for inhalation used for asthma, for the treatment of pre-symptomatic patients infected with the new coronary virus.
An angiotensin 2 converting enzyme form, a Phase II trial is underway with 200 patients to be recruited in severe cases in Denmark, Germany and Austria to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and pulmonary complications in patients with moderate COVID-19 symptoms.
The study called COLCORONA recruits 6,000 adults aged 40 years and over who have been positive diagnosed with COVID-19 and have moderate symptoms that do not require hospitalization.
Women who are pregnant or breast-feeding or do not have an effective method of contraception are not eligible.
Several anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is widely used to treat patients, which encourages the Italian Medicines Agency to publish guidelines on its use.
A multicentre study involving 300 patients and studying the use of sodium enoxaparin in preventive and therapeutic doses was announced in Italy on 14 April.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, a large number of researchers have focused on the replacement of approved antiviral drugs that have been developed for prior epidemics such as MRS, SARS and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese Directives
Umifenovir: Umifenovir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese Directives
Some antibiotics have been identified as potentially resistant to COVID-19 treatments:
Tocilizumab (anti-receptor-IL-6): approved by China.
Tests are also under way in Italy and China. See Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has passed the clinical trials, many developmental attempts are under way.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that no vaccine was expected against SARS-CoV-2, a virus of disease origin at least 18 months ago.
In April, five vaccine candidates were in the course of Phase I safety study.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major epidemic was declared worldwide in 2020, generating important investments and research to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
As defined in April, the imperatives of the ECE initiative for the development of a vaccine are speed, manufacturing capacity, large-scale deployment and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists indicated that 10 different technological platforms were running research and development projects in early 2020 in order to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The objectives of the main platform in Phase I safety studies include:
Nuclear acid (ADN and RNA) (phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Viral vector (phase I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologicals, type 5 adenovarial vector)
As reported by ESCI scientists in April, 115 total vaccine candidates are at the first stages of development, 78 (79 according to the Milk Institute) confirmed as assets and 37 other announcements, but with little public information available (presumed in planning or design).
A Phase I-II test carries out preliminary safety and immunogenicity tests, is usually randomized, placebo-controlled and conducted in several centres, all with more precise effective doses.
Phase III trials usually involve more participants, including a group of witnesses, and test the effectiveness of the vaccine in the prevention of the disease, while monitoring the adverse effects at the optimal dose.
Among the 79 active development vaccine candidates (confirmed early April 2020), 74 were not yet in the evaluation phase on the human person (still in preclinical research).
Around 24 January 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was studying the potential of a molecular penis vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate an immune response.

On 12 March 2020, Medicago, a company of Québec biotechnologies, in Quebec, indicated to develop a coronavirus-like particle through partial funding of Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
The vaccine candidate is being researched in laboratory, with human tests scheduled for July or August 2020.
Earlier this week, the Guardian announced that US President Donald Trump had offered CureVac "a large amount of money to gain exclusive access to the vaccine against COVID-19", which led to the German government's protest.
On 17 March 2020, the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech for the joint development of a NRNm-based vaccine.
The NRNm BNT162-based vaccine candidate is currently in preclinical phase with the start of clinical trials expected in April 2020.
On 17 March 2020 in Italy, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company, announced that it would have preclinical test results in April 2020 and that the test on the male of its final vaccine candidate could begin in autumn.
In France, on 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Innovations in Epidemic Preparation (CEPI) announced an investment of $4.9 million in a consortium for the search for a vaccine against COVID-19 including the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, thus bringing CEPI's total investment in the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 to $29 million.
The other ECI investment partners for the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 are Moderna, Curevac, Inovo, Novavax, University of Hong Kong, Oxford University and University of Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, the Russian health authorities announced that scientists had begun testing the animals of six different vaccine candidates.
Researchers at the Imperial College London announced on 20 March 2020 that they are developing a self-adampered RNA vaccine against COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of the sending of the sequence by China.
At the end of March, the Canadian Government announced funding of $275 million for 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against COVID-19, including several vaccine candidates in Canadian societies and universities such as Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan.
At almost the same time, the Canadian government announced an allocation of $192 million to develop a vaccine against COVID-19 with projects to create a national "Vaccine Bank" containing several new vaccines that can be used if other coronavirus epidemics occur.
On 2 April 2020, researchers at the Pittsburgh University Medical School indicated that PittCoVacc, a potential vaccine against COVID-19 in mice, said that "subunits of SARS-CoV-2 S1 administered by microhails triggered an important response to the specific antibodies of the antigen [in mice] observed 2 weeks after immunization".
In Canada, on 16 April 2020, the School of Pharmacy of Waterloo University announced the design of a DNA-based vaccine candidate in the form of a potential nasal spray.
With the help of bacteria, DNA will be designed to replicate into human bacteria to produce harmless particles similar to virus particles that could stimulate the production of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 through the immune system.
In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry and three universities shared their resources to access IBM superintendents, associated with Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google's computer resources.
Some vaccines have heterogeneous effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they can offer benefits beyond the disease they prevent.
Another randomized test in Australia is to include 4,170 health professionals.
Vaccines under development may not be safe or effective.
Initial research to evaluate the effectiveness of a vaccine using animal models specific to COVID-19, such as transgenic ACE-2 mice, other laboratory animals, non-human primates, indicate the need to implement Level 3 biosecurity limitation measures for the handling of live viruses, and international coordination to ensure standardised safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested on non-human animal models.
In 2020, there is no cure or protective vaccine against SARS which has demonstrated both its safety and its effectiveness in humans.
According to research documents published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medicines to treat SRAS was a priority for governments and health agencies around the world.There is no proven vaccine against MERS.
When the MRS spread, it was thought that existing research on SARS could be used as a model for developing vaccines and medicines against an infection in MRS-CoV.
In March 2020, one single HIV vaccine (ADN-based) had completed phase I clinical trials in humans and three others were currently underway; all vaccines were viral vectors, two were adénovular vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one was MVA vectors (MVA-MERS-S).
Publications on social networks have spread a theory of the plot that the virus at the origin of COVID-19 was known and that a vaccine was already available.
The patents quoted by various social media publications refer to existing patents dealing with genetic sequences and vaccines for other strains of coronavirus such as SARS coronavirus.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (CVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by coronavirus 2 associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough and swelling.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhoea, sore throat, loss of taste and abdominal pain.
The time between exposure and onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it may occur between two and fourteen days.
While most cases generate moderate symptoms, some develop into viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
On 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases were reported worldwide in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have been cured. The virus is mainly spread during close contact, often by drops produced by touching, squeezing or talking.
These droplets, produced at the end, usually fall to the ground or on surfaces rather than present an infectious risk over long distances.
People can also be infected by touching a contaminated surface, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces up to 72 hours.
It is the most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although the infection is possible before the onset of symptoms and during later stages of the disease. The standard test method uses the reverse transcription of the true-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The use of masks is recommended for those who think they are infected by the virus and their caregivers.
The recommendations on the port of mask by the public in general vary, some authorities recommending their use, others recommending their use, and others imposing their use.
There is currently no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries in the six WHO regions.
People infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or develop flu symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, swelling.
Emergency symptoms include difficulties in breathing, pain or persistent thoracic pressure, confusion, walking difficulties and face or blue lips; in the presence of these symptoms it is recommended to consult a doctor immediately.
Uncommonly, upper respiratory symptoms such as elevation, nasal discharge or throat disease may be observed.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea have been observed in different proportions.
Some cases in China initially presented only chest pressure and palpitations.
In some cases, the disease can cause pneumonia, the failure of several organs and death.
That's what we call the incubation period.
The incubation period of COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but can last up to 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of infection. Reports indicate that all infected persons will not develop symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers in transmission is not yet fully known, but preliminary elements suggest that they may contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of infected people with no symptoms is currently unknown and studied. Korean Disease Prevention and Control Centres (CCDCs) reported that 20% of all confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during hospitalization.
The Chinese National Health Commission began to include asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on 1 April; of the 166 infections found today, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of the test.
Expectation and salt can both carry important viral loads.
The fact that you talk louder gives you more freedom than the fact that you talk normally.
A study in Singapore revealed that touching without protection can design droplets at a distance of 4.5 metres (15 feet).
Although the virus is generally not transported by air, the National Academy of Sciences suggested that bioaerosol transmission could be possible and that air collectors positioned in the corridor outside the patient’s rooms produced positive samples of viral DNA.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary re-animation (RCP) can spread respiratory secretions and therefore lead to air propagation.
Although there are concerns about the spread of seals, this risk is perceived to be low. The virus is the most contagious when people have symptoms; although the spread may be possible before symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that if you do not know exactly what ease the disease is with, one person usually contaminates two to three others.
Exactly, the virus was detected at the end of one day on cardboard, three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) and at the end of four hours on copper at 99%.
This varies, however, depending on the humidity and temperature.
The soap and detergents are also effective if properly used; soap-based products degrade the protective lipid layer of the virus, which disables and eliminates the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant) are less effective. In a study in Hong Kong, salt samples were taken on average two days after the start of hospitalization.
In five out of six patients, the first sample revealed the highest viral load, while in the sixth patient the highest viral load was on the second day tested.
The coronavirus 2 associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new coronavirus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome, initially isolated in three people with pneumonia associated with Wuhan acute respiratory disease.
All features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in naturally related coronation viruses.
Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by the household soap, which breaks its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is a close relative of the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the most affected organs of COVID-19 because the virus accesses host cells through angiotensin 2 (ACE2) conversion enzyme, which is the most abundant in the lung type II alveolar cells.
The virus uses a specific surface glycoprotein called "spicule" (peplomer) to bind to ACE 2 and penetrate the host cell.
Acute cardiac lesions have been reported in 12% of people admitted to Wuhan's hospital in China and are more frequent when the disease is more severe.
The rates of cardiovascular symptoms are high due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression, but acute myocardial lesions may also be associated with ACE 2 receptors in the heart.
ACE 2 receptors are strongly expressed in the heart and in the heart functions involved.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolic disease (25%) has been observed in patients with COVID-19 intensive care unit and may be associated with adverse prognosis. The autopsys of people who died from COVID-19 showed diffuse alveolar damage (ADD) and inflammatory infiltrates containing lymphocytes in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a tropism for the epithelial cells of respiratory pathways that express ACE-2, patients with severe COVID-19 have systemic hyperinflammatory symptoms.
These are in particular GM-CSF secretive T cells that have been associated with the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes secreting IL6 and severe pulmonary pathology of patients with COVID-19.
Lymphocytic infiltrates have also been reported at autopsy.
WHO has published several test protocols for the disease.
The standard test method uses the reverse transcription of the chain reaction by real-time polymerase (rRT-PCR).
The test is generally carried out on respiratory samples obtained by rhinopharyngitis; however, a nasal or waiting sample may also be used.
Generally, the results are available within a few hours, up to two days.
Blood tests can also be used, however, they require two blood samples taken at two weeks of intervals and the results have little immediate value.
Chinese scientists have been able to isolate a strain of the coronavirus and have published the genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world have been able to develop independently chain polymerization reaction tests (PCRs) to detect the virus infection.
On 4 April 2020, antibody tests (which are likely to detect active infections and previous infection of a person) were under development but not yet widely used.
The Chinese test experience revealed only 60 to 70 per cent accuracy.
The FDA in the United States approved the first test at the nearest patient on 21 March 2020 to be used at the end of this month. The diagnostic guidelines published by the Zhongnan University Hospital of Wuhan suggested methods for detecting infections based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.
Multi-lob side glass opacity with a peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution are typical symptoms visible at the beginning of the infection.
Pleural domination, crazy paving (interlobular septal thickness with variable alveolar complication) and consolidation may occur with the progression of the disease.
Few data are available on microscopic lesions and COVID-19 pathophysiology.
The main pathological findings at autopsy are:
Macroscopy: pleuresis, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary oedema
Four types of viral pneumonia severity can be observed:
moderate pneumonia: pulmonary oedema, pulmonary hyperplasia, extended atypical pneumonia, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyte infiltration and formation of multinucleated giant cells
severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (ADD) with diffuse alveolar exudates.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA) and severe hypoxaemia.
Pneumonia ongoing healing: organization of exudates in alveolar cavities and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: Disseminated intravascular coagulation (CIVD); Leuko-erythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, avoiding tied places, often washing your hands in water and soap for at least 20 seconds, having good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends that the mouth and nose be covered with a wiper when it is tossed or eternal and use the inside of the thigh in the absence of the wiper.
Proper hand hygiene after touching or eternal is recommended.
The CDC recommended covering the face using a fabric in public places to limit transmission in case of asymptomatic individuals. Social distance strategies aim to reduce the contact of people infected with large groups by stopping schools and places of work, reducing displacement and canceling important groups of people.
The distance directives also include compliance with a minimum distance of 6 feet (1.8 m) between persons.
There is no known drug to be effective in the prevention of COVID-19. Since a vaccine is not expected before 2021 at the earliest, a key element of management of COVID-19 is to try to reduce the epidemic peak, which is also called "placing the curve".
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash their hands often in the soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after having been in the toilets or when the hands are clearly salty; before eating; and after being wet, coughed, or eternal.
It also recommends the use of a disinfectant solution for alcohol-based hands containing at least 60% of alcohol, but only if water and soap are not available. For areas where disinfectants for the hands of trade are not available, WHO proposes two formulae for local production.
In these formulae, antimicrobial activity is derived from ethanol or isopropanol.
Peroxide of hydrogen is used to eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol, it is not "an active substance antiseptic to the hands".
Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
People are treated with supportive care that may include water treatment, oxygen therapy and support of other vital organs affected.
The CDC recommends that people suspected of being carriers of the virus wear a simple facial mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to treat cases of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still analysed.
Personal hygiene, lifestyle and healthy nutrition were recommended to promote immunity.
Support treatments can be useful for those with moderate symptoms at the early stage of infection. WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations for the care of people hospitalized for COVID-19.
Rehabilitation and pneumologists in the United States have collected therapeutic recommendations from several agencies in a free resource, the IBCC.
In April 2020 there was no specific treatment of COVID-19.
As regards symptoms, some health professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) rather than ibuprofen in the first line.
Precautions should be taken to minimise the risk of transmission of the virus, especially under conditions of care when conducting procedures can generate aerosols, such as intubation or manual ventilation.
For health professionals caring for people suffering from COVID-19, the CDC recommends placing the person in an isolation room adapted to airway infection (AIIR) as well as using standard precautions, contact precautions and airway transmission precautions. The CDC stresses the guidelines on the use of individual protective equipment (EPI) during the pandemic.
The recommended equipment is: PPE blouse, respiratory or facial mask, eye protection and medical gloves. If available, breathing masks (face masks) are privileged.
The N95 breathing masks are approved under industrial conditions, but the FDA has authorised the use of these masks under an emergency use permit (U.S.).
They are designed to protect air particles such as dust, but their effectiveness against specific biological agents is not guaranteed for unspecified uses.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends using facial protection screens, or last resort, handicraft masks.
Most COVID-19 cases are not severe enough to require mechanical ventilation or other alternatives, but a certain percentage is.
The type of respiratory assistance for people with respiratory impairment associated with COVID-19 is actively studied for hospitalized people. Some evidence indicates that intubation can be avoided by using a high-speed nasal canal or positive double-level respiratory pressure.
It is ignored whether one or both of them produce the same benefits for people in a critical state.
Some physicians prefer to maintain invasive mechanical ventilation when available because this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to a high-speed nasal canal. Serious cases are more common in older adults (over 60 years of age, in particular those over 80 years).
Many developed countries do not have sufficient hospital beds per person, which limits the ability of the care system to deal with a sudden peak of the number of cases of COVID-19 sufficiently severe to require hospitalization.
A study in China showed that 5% of cases were admitted to intensive care, 2.3% needed respiratory assistance and 1.4% died.
In China, approximately 30 per cent of people hospitalized with COVID-19 are finally admitted to intensive care.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex with the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA) during COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes more difficult.
Ventilation devices offering high pressure control modes and high PEEP are needed to optimize oxygen release and minimize the risk of pulmonary injury associated with ventilation and pneumothorax.
High PEEP may not be available on older ventilation devices.
The search for potential treatments to be started in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are the subject of clinical trials.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although new medicines may not be developed before 2021, several currently tested drugs are already approved in other indications and the tests are already advanced.
An antiviral medicine may be tested in people with severe disease.
WHO recommended that volunteers participate in tests on the effectiveness and safety of potential treatments. The FDA has granted temporary authorisation to plasma of convalescents as experimental treatment in cases where life is seriously or immediately threatened.
It has not been submitted to the necessary clinical trials to demonstrate its safety and effectiveness for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application to manage the epidemic.
Users are asked to enter their name and an identifier.
The application is able to detect "close contacts" using surveillance data and therefore detect a potential risk of infection.
Each user can also control the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, application not only recommends self-quantain, it also alerts local health authorities. The analysis of massive data from mobile phone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone location and artificial intelligence are used to locate infected people and people with whom they have been in contact in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Government of Israel allowed security agencies to locate mobile phone data from persons suspected of having coronavirus.
The measure was aimed at ensuring respect for quarantine and protecting people who could have been in contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared aggregate data on telephone location with the German federal government agency, the Robert Koch Institute, in order to analyse and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia has deployed facial recognition technology to detect people who do not respect the quarantine.
In Italy, regional health minister Giulio Gallera said he had been informed by mobile telephone operators that "40 per cent of people continue to move".
The German government conducted a 48-hour hackathon weekend with more than 42,000 participants.
Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid has launched a global appeal to find creative solutions to prevent the spread of the crown virus.
People may suffer from quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of infection themselves.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying that "increasing social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic recession are a perfect cocktail to harm people's mental health and well-being".
The disease may develop moderately with little or no symptoms, similar to other common respiratory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis.
Moderate cases are generally recovered within two weeks, while severe or critical cases require three to six weeks.
Pregnant women may present a higher risk of severe infection with COVID-19 according to data from similar viruses, such as SRAS and MERS, but data are missing for COVID-19. In some cases, COVID-19 may affect the lungs and cause pneumonia.
In the most severely affected cases, COVID-19 can move rapidly to a acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA) causing respiratory failure, septic shock or multivisceral failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include septicaemia, coagulation disorders and cardiac, renal and hepatic lesions.
Coagulation disorders, in particular an increase in prothrombin time, were reported in 6% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19, with renal failure observed in 4% of patients in this group.
Approximately 20-30% of people affected by COVID-19 have a high rate of liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the mean time between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, five of which were hospitalized.
However, patients transferred to intensive care had an average duration of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In an early case study, the mean duration between the onset of symptoms and death was 14 days, with a total beach of between six and 41 days.
In a study by the Chinese National Health Commission (NHC), men had a mortality rate of 2.8 per cent, while women had a mortality rate of 1.7 per cent.
Histopathological examinations of post-mortem pulmonary samples present widespread alveolar damage with fibromyxoid cell exudates in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes were observed in the pneumocytes.
The lung image is similar to a acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA).
In 11.8% of the deaths reported by the Chinese National Health Commission, heart injuries due to high levels of troponin or cardiac arrest were observed.
According to March data from the United States, 89% of hospitalized people had pre-existing diseases. The availability of medical resources and the socio-economic conditions of a region may also have an impact on mortality.
The estimates of the mortality rate of the disease vary because of these regional differences, but also because of methodological difficulties.
The under-numbering of moderate cases may lead to a reassessment of mortality rates.
However, the fact that death is the result of previously contracted cases may indicate that the current rate of mortality is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to develop severe COVID-19 symptoms and presented a higher risk of intensive care or death than non-smokers.
The Hong Kong Hospital Administration observed a 20 to 30 per cent decrease in respiratory capacity in some people who are ill, and pulmonary scanners suggested organic lesions.
This can also lead to an intensive post-care syndrome after healing.
In March 2020, it was unknown whether a previous infection had long-term effective immunity in patients with disease.
Immunities are considered to be likely based on the behaviour of other coronaviruses, but cases of healthy subjects of COVID-19 followed by positive coronavirus tests at a later date have been reported.
These cases are considered to be an aggravation of a latent infection rather than a reinfection.
It is thought that the virus is natural and of animal origin, by the spread of the infection.
The real origin of the virus is unknown, but in December 2019 the spread of the infection was almost exclusively caused by a human transmission to humans.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19 published in January 2020 in The Lancet revealed that the earliest date of onset of symptoms was 1 December 2019.
Official WHO publications indicated the first occurrence of symptoms on 8 December 2019.
Several measures are generally used to assess mortality.
These figures vary according to the regions and over time, and are influenced by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, the therapeutic options, the time taken since the beginning of the epidemic, as well as demographic characteristics such as age, sex and health.
At the end of 2019, WHO has affected emergency pathological codes CIM-10 U07.1 for confirmed laboratory deaths of the infection in SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 for cases of COVID-19 diagnosed from a clinical or epidemiological point of view without infection in SARS-CoV-2 confirmed laboratory. The death/case report reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed in a given time interval.
According to the statistics of Johns-Hopkins University, the world death/case report is 6.9 per cent (153 822/2 240 191) as at 17 April 2020.
Other measures include the mortality rate (CFR) which reflects the percentage of diagnosed individuals who die from the disease and the rate of infectious mortality (IRF) that reflects the percentage of people who are infected (diagnostic or not) who die from a disease.
These statistics are not limited in time and follow a specific population of contamination at the end of the disease.
Although all infected persons do not develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies may indicate the number of people who have been infected.
In the epicenter of the epidemic in Italy, in Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600 inhabitants, 80 of them (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, the disease spread through festivals and young people, generating a relatively low mortality rate, and all deaths associated with COVID-19 may not have been officially classified as such.
In addition, the German health system has not been affected.
In the Netherlands, approximately 3% of people may have antibodies, according to an assessment of blood donors.
69 deaths (0.004 per cent of the population) were confirmed as related to COVID-19.
The impact of pandemic and mortality rates are different in men and women.
Human mortality is higher in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The highest risk is for five-year-old men, the difference between men and women who are only 90 years of age.
In China, the rate of death was 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women.
The precise reasons for this gender difference are unknown, but genetics and behavioural factors may be involved.
The immunological differences in gender, the lower prevalence of smoking in women and the development of comorbidities in men such as hypertension at a lower age than in women could have contributed to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of infected individuals were men and 72% of the people who died from COVID-19 were men.
In April 2020, the U.S. government did not collect data related to the type of infection in COVID-19.
Studies have shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SRAS affect men and women differently.
A higher percentage of health personnel, particularly nurses, are women and are at increased risk of being exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease would be "COVID-19".
WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO means crown, VI means virus and D means disease, 19 being the first identification of the epidemic: December 31, 2019.
This name has been chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location (e.g. China), an animal species or a group of persons, in accordance with international classification recommendations to prevent stigmatization. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called coronavirus 2 associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses "COVID-19 virus" and "COVID-19 responsible virus" in its public communication.
The disease and the virus are both commonly referred to as 'coronavirus'.
During the initial epidemic in Wuhan, in China, the virus and the disease were often called "curonavirus" and "curonavirus of Wuhan".
In January 2020, WHO recommended using provisional disease names 2019-nCov and acute respiratory disease 2019-nCOV for the virus and disease, in accordance with the 2015 Directive against the use of places in disease and virus names.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were published on 11 February 2020.
Given the capacity limits of the standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers print care equipment as well as ventilators and breathing parts.
For example, when an Italian hospital needed an emergency breathing valve and the supplier could not provide it in time, a local startup redesigned and printed the 100 required valves in one night.
Following the initial epidemic of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, false information and disinformation emerged about the origin, extent, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease and quickly spread online.
It seems that man is capable of spreading the disease to some other animals.
Studies have not been able to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No medicinal product or vaccine is approved for the treatment of the disease.
International research on vaccines and drugs against COVID-19 is currently being carried out by government organizations, academic groups and industrial researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the "SOLIDARITY Test" to evaluate the therapeutic effects of four existing antiviral compounds with the most promising efficacy.
There are no vaccines available, but several agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 both use the ace 2 receptor to penetrate human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are researched.
First, researchers are trying to create a whole virus vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, is intended to cause a rapid immune response from the human body in the event of a new infection with COVID-19.
A second strategy, based on subunit vaccines, is to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, these research focuses on specular protein S that helps the virus to infiltrate into the ACE 2 enzyme receptor.
A third strategy is that of nuclear acid-based vaccines (ADN or RNA vaccination, a new vaccination technique).
Experimental vaccines resulting from all these strategies should be tested in terms of safety and effectiveness. On 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine started with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains an harmless genetic code copied on the virus that causes the disease. Antibody-dependent activation has been suggested as a potential challenge in developing a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, but it is controversial.
In April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials are underway.
Seven trials evaluated already approved anti-malaria treatments, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
The converted antiviral drugs constitute the majority of Chinese research, with nine phase III clinical trials on remdesivir in several countries whose reports are expected to end April.
A dynamic analysis of clinical development of vaccine and medicinal products against COVID-19 was also in place in April 2020. Several existing antiviral medicinal products are evaluated in the treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir associated with beta interferon.
Provisional data suggest the effectiveness of remdesivir in March 2020.
Clinical improvements have been observed in patients treated with remdesivir for compassionate use.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the United States, China and Italy. The chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
However, some ask for an independent analysis of the research work.
The Chinese and Korean health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, Wuhan's Institute of Virology, although recommending a daily dose of one gram, indicates that the double dose is highly dangerous and could be fatal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA authorised the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine under an emergency use authorisation at the discretion of physicians caring for patients with COVID-19. The 7th edition of the Chinese directives also includes interferon, ribavirin or Umifenovir against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are required to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide was recommended for the continuation of an in vivo study after demonstrating a low-concentration inhibition of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that initial specular protein starting with serum transmembrane protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 via interaction with the ACE 2 receptor.
Studies on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have major limits that have prevented the medical community from adopting these treatments without further studies. oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytokinic shock may be a complication at subsequent stages of the severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have cytokinic anti-choc properties. Tocilizumab was included in the guidelines for treatment by the Chinese National Health Commission after a small study was conducted.
Phase 2 testing is under way, not randomized at national level in Italy, after showing positive results in people with severe disease.
Associated with a serum ferritin blood test to identify cytokinic shock, it must counter such developments that are suspected to be the origin of the death of some affected persons.
Interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA on the basis of retrospective case studies for the treatment of refractory cytokines syndrome caused by a different cause, treatment by CAR T cells in 2017.
To date, there is no randomized and controlled evidence indicating that tocilizumab is an effective treatment of CRS.
The transfer of concentrated and purified antibodies produced by immune systems of persons who have been treated with COVID-19 to persons who need it is under study as a non-vaccinal method of passive immunization.
This strategy has been tested for SARS with little conclusive results.
Viral neutralisation is the expected mode of action by which passive antibody treatment can generate a defense against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms such as cellular cytotoxicity dependent on antibodies and/or phagocytosis may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibiotic treatment, for example using monoclonal antibodies manufactured, are under development.
The serum production of convalescent people, consisting of the liquid part of the blood of healthy patients and containing specific antibodies to this virus, could be increased for a faster deployment.
Coronavirus diseases, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan's central hospital, then contracted COVID-19 and died after drawing attention to the spread of the virus.
