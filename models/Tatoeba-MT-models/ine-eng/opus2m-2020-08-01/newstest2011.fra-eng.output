What's going to happen? CSSD knew neither Voldemort nor pastry in Prague.
The new members of the CSSD at the capital mayor's office will apparently have to overcome a real language barrier to understand themselves at the municipal council with their former and new colleagues of the ODS.
Newspaper.cz has "tested" the new members of the municipal council belonging to CSSD, namely whether they know the Argot that was born in the last years at sea, when they were partners of the current coalition leading to Prague.
The vocabulary coded that Prague's political cream was launched during the previous century by Mayor Pavel Bem describes some of the personalities, situations, and causes of the metropolis.
It is surprising that it has been discovered that the new elected people do not understand well the known terms.
At least they say it.
"Who is Valdemort."
"I really don't know."
"I am a youth in Prague's politics," said Lukas Kaucky, who chose culture to test the vocabulary of the "paradise".
And with regard to the political vet, the Karel Brezina elected in the same way.
For example, the sense of "golf hole".
"It's the only expression you suggest I use."
Otherwise, I don't use the harp.
From the vocabulary, of which the daily Aktualne.cz published the expressions in June of this year before the pre-sector Congress of the ODS, the editor chose 6 examples, in priority those related to the mayor of Prague.
The Socialists had to explain the meaning of "Voldemort", "the largest golf hole in Prague", go to the pastry, "bovine nerve", "trahison of the capital" and "control".
Three of the electors agreed for the Quiz, the fourth- Antonin Weinert, who must lead education in Prague in the future - promised first an interview but then failed to intercept the phone.
The fifth election Petr Dolinek has firmly rejected the test.
"I don't care about all these things and how the representatives of civil democracy have fun: I won't give my opinion."
"I am currently dealing with how we will understand in our programmes," he replied.
As we have already heard, the election of Lukas Kaucky would not seem to recognize in the legend above that it is the influence of Janousek on entrepreneurs and friends of former Roman Bem.
"Voldemort" says nothing aa'Kaucky and the only expression he has become in the test is "the largest golf hole in Prague".
"This is the Blanka tunnel," says Kaucky and immediately adds: "But I know the newspapers."
"I'm gonna have to pay for a language course," he said.
Not only the Matador Karel Brezina but also Lukas Plachy, the choice for the environment, know that the golf hole is the Blanko tunnel.
The two social-democrats know who is really Voldemort and Lukas Plachy knows the place where to find the character - he thinks of "go to the Pastry".
"It's, I think, going to a company," Plachy is ready to assume it's the headquarters of Janousek's companies.
At the same time, Brezina remembers that he draws his knowledge instead of newspapers and not from any vocabulary he would use.
According to the test candidates, there is no lexical argument in social democracy.
"I have consulted with colleagues and it appears that we have not really had anything like this."
"Abbreviations and symbols are used instead," says Peter Hlinsky, Chairman of the Socio-Democrat Party, who members of the Party call Hulda.
"My name was Briza at school, but I don't know if my colleagues call me that, with Karel Brezina about nicknames.
The daily Actuel.cz tested the name and it works.
The election of Weinert is Papy for the members of the Party or the least friendly little old, the representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to it before the election by the crackdowns during the party's sponsorship, is referred to as "the little game".
Surnames are also the only people who admit to using social-democrats inside the party.
It seems that Hulinsky does not like to hear Hulda very much, but the newspaper Akutel.cz has registered another nickname for this Prague president.
"Doctor in law of mattress" seems to recall that Petr Hulinsky received his title as a doctor in law of JUDr. at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to reduce the torture of the "storks", published a brochure.
In Burkina Faso, reported female witches have common traits.
They are part of the old generation, they cannot work for health reasons, they are free and have no children.
The one that becomes "sorcer" is isolated so as not to threaten the rest of the village.
"Man has very rarely this destiny."
"We do not judge young women in good health because they participate in work and host children," says a sister in the capital of this West African country, Burkina Faso, in a special establishment of more than 100 women who have been rejected by society.
The local government has decided to take action against this unusual "social measure".
He published a brochure that should help limit hunting to witches.
The case has a "hic".
"More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso don't know how to read," reported the newspaper Die Standard about the disadvantage of written education.
In other African countries, it is common to charge sorceress.
In Ghana, neighbor of Burkina Faso, Amy Hemma, a 72-year-old woman died after being tortured by three women and then burned with the oil they had sprinkled on her.
It's the BBC server who sent this information.
The criminals say it was the wrong eye.
According to their version, the oil used to serve ritual ounces has become inflame with the contact of the woman.
The oil flamed, it seems, when the team wanted to "fight the evil spirit" of the woman.
The isolation of "sorceres" is approved by people at all levels of education.
The newspaper Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso as saying: "Human minds eaters have always been a danger," he said.
While Burkina Faso is trying to reduce the hunt for witches, the Gambia has seen the President participate in it not later than last year.
"The Gambian President Dzammi, after the death of his aunt, launched a great hunt for witches who seemed to have participated in his death and would have been tried by the black magician to kill the President as well."
"From the bells of Guinea near the rescue, they led to the presidential farm in Kanilai, under the protection of policemen and the personal guard of the President, men and women selected by chance in the villages of Gambia," said Amnesty International in a message.
On the farm, prisoners had to drink a plant-based potion with hallucinogenic effects that added to other effects on the kidneys and intestines.
Two prisoners didn't survive.
On international pressure, about a thousand people were released.
The tenant of Bakal: The chickens are warm, he signed a higher rent.
An imposing old man came out from the RPG Byty's client centre door of the "carbon bar" Zdenek Bakal, the largest private owner of apartments to rent in the Czech Republic.
He carried under his arm a file with three new rental contracts for three apartments: his daughter, his daughter, and his son, who is being punished.
Deregulation has increased the rent to these three persons.
Instead of paying 3500 the son will have to settle from next year for an apartment 2+1 of second category 4100 crowns.
"And there is no hot water and heating works on solid fuel," shows the finger on the new contract of his son the man who has the power to sign.
"But I signed it anyway," he explains on the basis of anger and half remanded.
The City Association of BytyOKD.cz apartments, which described the new rental conditions as "immoral and inconspicuous", advises tenants not to sign and wait until December 7, when a notice will be published to explain the method to be followed to claim.
But man reacts to this by a gesture of his hand.
"One word of this, the other word of another thing" by squeezing the ankles.
The region of Ostrava becomes the laboratory of deregulation.
After New Year, this is what most of the apartments in the Czech Republic expect, whose rents do not correspond to the market price.
Aktualne.cz has therefore decided to visit the "laboratory" on a personal basis.
The RPG waiting room in Havirovska Street is one of four in the Ostrava region and is already full on Tuesday at 09 in the morning.
Just next to the door is a guard of a security company with a device to call customers.
A special button, "loyer 2011", is lit on the touch screen.
One pressure and one paper with a lucky number from the device.
You don't have time to read your "157" number that your number is already starting to light up on the large screen under the top of the waiting room.
In a second fraction it's your turn.
After a short while, an old couple arrive to learn about the rent, but the new rentals don't seem to concern people in the waiting room.
The majority of people have come to solve common problems such as demand for repairs, insurance events and others.
In the Ostrava region, more than 44,000 RPG portfolio apartments receive mail with new dance contracts in their mailbox since about mid-November.
RPG Byty offers increases in rent from 15 to 38 percent.
the special guide for new tenants has been open to the public since 18 November.
"it's been working for almost a week, so it's still on the test" answers, after a moment of hesitation, the employee behind the door when the client presents himself as a journalist.
The derailment and former minor apartments in Bakal are a very sensitive local subject.
The Vice-President of the Parliament and originating in the Ostrava Lubomir Zaoralek region of the Socialists-Democrats made this a fairly sustained statement before the elections and is now filling in the local newspapers.
"20 years after them, I want a new floor."
"They didn't even change a whore... in the toilets, relax in the introduction of the man mentioned.
However, according to employees, these are retirements that come to ensure that they will receive a refund on the new rental price if they sign as promised in a special offer.
It is a half-refund of the rent that other tenants will receive who will have signed their new contract before 15 December.
But the "deregulation" of the Havirovaska street is not really overloaded by questions.
"One of the 360 customers who came yesterday, only 40 to 50 came to rent it," says the employee in the guillet.
And yet RPG offers both on its website and in the windows of individual interviews on rents when necessary.
If both parties do not agree on the rent, an independent court will decide.
'It is not a threat, but only to inform about the unique and legitimate way in which to act legally', says RPG on its website.
"No one's going to court here" thinks one of RPG Byty's employees and the man in the street in front of the customer centre gives him reason.
"I have 13000 retirement crowns and I have 5,000 crowns left to eat, I don't have enough to go to court," he said.
The employee suddenly feels uncomfortable.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaoralek in the media asks that no one sign and so people wait," she says.
The rental regulation ends in the Czech Republic with the beginning of 2011 and increases, according to RPG Byty, are an economic necessity.
"And, moreover, current rents still do not reach the required level for the simple maintenance of the housing fund," recalls Pavel Klimes, director of the residential portfolio of RPG Byty, who is just the neglect of the housing fund that makes the tenant angry is the main reason for the increase in the rent.
However, in 5 years between 2005 and 2010, RPG was able to invest in 4 billion apartments with tenants, in four years from 2011 to 2014, this is expected to amount to 5.2 billion.
The large screen hooked to the ceiling in front of the back of the Havirosvka Street's waiting room, however, repeats some of the information indicated in red.
'The increase in rent in 2011 is 15 per cent and is not less than 31200 apartments or more than 90 per cent of RPG apartments".
"And this will always be at a maximum of 7.50 Czech crowns per month", says the screen.
The 38 percent increase is only 400 apartments in the RPG portfolio.
"In these cases, this is an increase in a very low amount of 19.66 Czech crowns at m2," adds RPG.
The next year the rent will remain the same for 2600 apartments.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not lead to a radical but progressive increase of 4-8 years.
It adds other commitments: all the money from the increase in rent (cf. the graph) is given to apartments in the form of heating savings - new windows and heating.
Those who sign the agreement on the increase in rent have priority.
The maternal school is also part of offices that include architects.
the administrative building Avriopoint de Brno is the new headquarters of Arch. Design.
No one could have expected it to also cover a mini-school with everything you need - color walls, imaginative furniture, toys and finally a playground of miniature games on the terrace.
Since October last year, children of Arch. design employees can go there.
Arch. Design. whose workshops have produced a large number of constructions in Brno, has imagined its mini-maternal business school since the first constructions of the Avriopoint building.
It employs about 90 people, especially children, and it was important for women architects and project managers to be able to return to work quickly.
At the same time as low-time employment contracts, the maternal school is a bonus offered to its employees by Arch. Design. as part of its social program.
The builders and architects thus have the opportunity to work together with care for children.
They are the employees of Arch.Design.they themselves who imagined this maternal school and with the support of the management they were able to obtain a European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The primary school is funded by the European Social Fund through the operational programme of human resources and the State budget of the Czech Republic.
Through funding resources (up from 2.8 billion Czech crowns), they were able to purchase equipment and equipment and, after two years, to provide qualified staff and to set up the road.
After using the funding fund (two years) Arch. Design. has an obligation after 3 years to run the mother's mini-school on her own funds.
The project's preparation lasted a year, and it was the Economy rating company that helped make the request for funding.
Childcare is provided by a qualified staff, a nurse and a maternal teacher take care of children all day. Children can go to the maternal school without limitation but they have more than three ensembles most.
Since there can be only 5 children present at the same time, there can be more to replace them during the day.
The functioning of the school is flexible according to the needs of the parents and the children of all employees have the same right to use this school without looking at the hierarchical position.
Although it is an individual care and education, the school curriculum is comparable to that for pre-school education.
Children only play but a quality education is also ensured - from the start to the preparation of school banks, English is taught.
The class is equipped not only with imaginative toys and games but also with a computer that children can use.
The presence of small children in society creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can control their child at any time and do not have the stress of a delay in looking for children in a school away from their parents' workplace.
Parents therefore use their working time in the most productive way.
It is not surprising that there is a natural relationship of loyalty between the employee and the employer.
Arch.Design.s is thus registered among companies offering a choice bonus for recruiting new employees and who are friendly to the family and through this program reinforces the marketing of HRs.
The ossuary house still fascinates after 100 years. Take a look inside Gaudi.
The roof resembles the back of a prehistoric sari, the staircase to a spine of dinosaur and the balconies to open fish guillas.
That's how Casa Battlo's house is in Barcelona by architect Antoni Gaudi.
Due to its organic forms, the house received from the premises the nickname of Maison en oss.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stones, pieces of tiles and mosaics, facade reminiscent of stairs and everywhere present of curves, this is all that is typical for Art New of Antoni Gaudi.
The front face of the house takes place its dream lines, its beautiful colors and textures that remind nature and animals.
In a more detailed observation, we see geometry, rhythm and order thought precisely.
In the night the facade of the house becomes even more dramatic and is lit in such a way that the impression of color brightness is strengthened.
The enrollment and twisting of forms also appear in the interior with the same measure.
The wood in waves copies the window frames, the balustrades, the decorative elements of the doors, the eyepiece and the blades.
The house Battlo is located in the Eixample district in the shopping street Passeig de Gracia at number 43. It was born of the construction of a house of 1877 by architect Emilio Sala Cortes.
The reconstruction took place for two years and the house completed in 1906.
The investor, Joseph Battlo, a wealthy entrepreneur, first insisted on demolishing the old construction and construction of another new one, but quickly accepted Gaudi's idea of an unusual and better market reconstruction.
But the idea of Casa Battlo as a multi-housed house was not thought of by Gaudi alone.
Architect Josep Maria Jujol worked with him.
It is precisely on his project that decorations for an apartment representing the owner of the building and the use of the mosaic for the facade were born.
Other artists and creators also worked for the facade.
The joint work for Casa Battlo's plans began with a successful cooperation between Jujol and Gaudi.
Jujol participated in the construction of Gaudi Casa Mila and Guell Park, where there are other works of Gaudi.
The premises have named the hot house just after its completion due to its organic forms "the House in Osus".
Others, considering the specific mechanism for opening windows, called it "the house that dances".
It is said that above the construction there is a sword similar to that of Saint Georges the patron of Catalonia.
Other elements of construction sculpture contain hidden religious motives.
Gaudi thought for the house a unique system in its central heating time, with aerial events and typical fireplaces.
Their 45-degree inclination seems strange.
During the creation of Gaudi did not comply with the construction directives at that time and were not allowed to interfere with them.
At the beginning of the construction, he obtained permission from the city to build, knowing, of course, that the data on the reconstruction plans were so vague that two years after the completion, the municipal council was horrified and requested changes.
He was not pleased, for example, with the members of the municipal council that the construction pillars affect the public side.
There was never any change, but, on the contrary, only 15 days after the call of the city of Josep Battlo requested permission to rent the two highest floors.
The owner moved to the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a common living room and in the third room and a private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewelry store.
The whole six-storey house is shared by a staircase through which you can access up to an independent roof terrace.
All right angles and straight lines were cancelled by the basic elements of reconstruction and their replacement by curved walls.
Gaudi also works on the modern concept of space linkage.
The common part can be fully connected by opening the hall doors and the high society can communicate comfortably or be limited to private space for more intimate interviews.
The house with the reconstruction of Gaudi also received new facades a non-traditional roof and two additional floors.
Gaudi's game with light is also impressive, blue and white glass tiles with which the inner court is decorated and with the gates of light.
The two-colour game gives maximum light on all floors of the house.
It was enough just to bet on the principle that white reflects more than the shadow that absorbs the rays of the sun.
The Casa Battlo house that was registered in 2005 in the UNESCO World Heritage Fund may have been visited by everyone.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and beautiful apartment available to the public.
The owners decided to take this step in 2002 on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
They continued their visits because they found that it was a profitable business and they expanded the area of visits to common spaces and to the granier including roof terraces.
The ticket to the monument is not really expensive and costs 16.50 euros; students, retired persons, groups and card holders have 20 percent discounts.
The sum is still above the entry price in the other buildings of Gaudi in the city.
If you want to feel the real atmosphere of the house with its fantastic tours, you must quickly find a friend among the people of the building and visit the house completely.
How to choose a mattress and a mattress: women have other criteria than men.
No ostentatious framework, but rather the quality of the bed area, so mattresses and mattresses provide a real basis for a good bed.
They must, of course, complement themselves harmoniously in order to please a particular user.
During the choice several things are decisive: weight, size, age, health status and the gender of the owner.
The type of interior in which the mattress will be placed is also important.
A typical example?
For example, in the countryside house where latex mattresses are not constantly sleepy is not appropriate because they "heat" gently.
They also have a higher weight than standard polyurethane mattresses.
It is necessary to return them frequently.
If they also do not have enough ventilation channels in their hearts and they remain on a solid board, they retain moisture. From the moss can also form.
The habit is also decisive in the choice.
Anyone who passes the light of time abroad where you often use very thick mattresses with a supple layer will find it difficult to feel well on a low and hard surface.
"That's how all the hockeyists who come back from NHL complain that they can't sleep there."
"For their tired shoulders, their feet and their ribs, they needed mattresses with a succulent layer of hairy moss."
"Such mattresses are also recommended for people who suffer from diabetes who have a nervous system disorder that therefore mistake "information" of joints and skin," explains Silva Adamkzykova, who specializes in refurbished furniture.
That's why a few years ago the mattress with the peacheous mousse conquered hockeyists as well as other customers.
"Today everything goes well, Tempur, the Italian Magnifex but also the Czech Tropico have suitable mattresses for example.
You don't need to be a NHL guy to be able to appreciate a hairy moose.
That "miracle" just works.
It optimizes its rigidity and shape according to the absorbed heat or adapts to the heat of your body.
Nothing pressures you and you will not come back in the night as after a difficult match.
You just sleep better.
Parseus mousse also works as a protection against scars.
For selecting the mattress depending on your size, add the length of the feet, or about 21/34 cm.
A man and woman of a size of 180cm need a bed of 210/220 cm.
The minimum width for each double bed should be 90 cm or 180 cm.
For single beds, single beds, for example, it is recommended to take at least 120/140 cm.
It's convenient in case of a visit.
'However, it is a simple rule for the width of the bed: when you are lying on your back you should put your hands comfortably with slightly folded strings. Helena Prokopova, President of the Association of Burreliers-Mathelasiers and Decorators who have been devoted for several years to the problem of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture and teaching it in specialized schools.
For a double bed each needs its own bed and mattresses, however, during the purchase of the right to choose the height of the mattress.
Otherwise you will only be left to climb the floor to different heights and this is not feasible on all bed frames.
Mousse mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, spring mattresses at least 15 cm, which counts for the shape and aeration layer at least three centimeters.
"To touch or in position sits on the mattress you must not feel the springs," says Héléna Prokopova.
Each mattress requires a well-defined type of sleep.
The bed-bed, when mattresses and mattresses are united as siamois sisters, has nothing to do in the bedrooms to sleep.
The mattresses are very bad; we don't have to wash it, which is usually done today.
And since during the night sweats normally from 0.2 to 0.75 l of sweat it is clear that after 5/7 years, the mattress begins to recall a large (and closed) talis.
For this purpose, specialists refuse to make the claim for a life of 25 years for a mattress or life guarantee.
But it's all hers.
And for this, an experience advice on the part of the sellers: for a 120/140cm mattress, give up, for the coating of the mattress, to the hygiene or washing, but instead add a protective mattress that you can easily remove and wash.
And even though today it is common to make clothing with a zipper closure for all, that is to say that after opening we have two parts (for washing and washing machine size it is very important!) otherwise handling for large models (and for one person) becomes when they are removed from a fight between a light weight and a heavy weight on a ring.
Do you have a rigid bed in your bed instead of a sleeper?
Never!
Maximum for a bed for visitors for one night only.
However, equip the board (if not there) with air holes and use the spring mattress with a minimum height of 15cm with bags (from Germany) and an air layer.
A polyurethane mattress should not be part of such a bed.
For single-position blades with 14/18 blades, latex mattresses or sandwiches (maybe the combination of latex and coconut nuts), are the ideal but it will always be better for you to have a mattress with more blades, 28 and above, where the blades are doubled in the bottom of the kidneys and it is possible to regulate their rigidity.
For multi-position mattresses it is not necessary to take spring mattresses because it does not respond to position changes.
Alongside the rigidity adjustment of the blades you can also install what is called a shoulder blade.
This is a special bond of the blades that allows pressure to even bend the blade so that the shoulder of the sleeper "integrates" well.
For men who have "the shoulders as wide as the back", it's really an important thing.
This is already considered by the matriles manufacturers who for the "males" have begun to use a shimmering zone at the shoulder level.
But they also think about women - again they offer them a softer surface at the hips.
For the most difficult customer there are pillows or plates with what is called a multi-force suspension.
The pressure decreases in more points and decreases tension.
But of course, attention, as soon as you use a bad earring (large and inflated air) on good mattresses and sommeer, the "plus" disappeared.
The basic rule is a simple earring: the ear must support the head and its points must only reach the shoulders, so that the muscles of the shoulders can rest.
The recommended size is 50X60 cm that Scandinaves by example prefer.
When lying on the side, the ear must be raised (with the shoulder blade or the rammolly area in the mattresses) the height of the shoulders.
Modern mattresses still have something in common with the first based straw and grass.
Manufacturers still use natural materials or mixtures.
The trend is also with the bio mattress.
Oil-based raw materials, from which polyurethane is produced, are replaced by natural oils, such as soya oil.
Almost all known manufacturers just use soybean.
"The bio qualifier for mattresses means that the heart is made from natural products," explains Petr vasicek of the company Tropico Plus.
Natural materials are also used for mattress coverings; one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can add micro-capsules that develop forest or lavender fragrances.
There are differences between men and women.
While the extract of bubble plants for the matellas coating absorbs heat and cools the body, "frozen" the man, the clothes "heat" the women.
Red pepper extract accelerates blood circulation and is therefore hotter for low sex.
The current favorites?
The mattresses made from cold foam (it has more pores with a cellular structure disrupted so more breathable than standard polyurethane and has more elasticity.
The combination of different stiffnesses of the cold flies gives polyzone mattresses that know exactly where the head, the bottom of the back and the feet are.
You will pay a quality mattress from 7,000 crowns and more.
Those who are characterized by their health parameters have less VAT and are taken as health instruments.
In the Czech Republic, Gumotex reached its first place.
Saving for mattresses and mattresses is not easy.
There may occasionally be two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex company that offers Duofreeze mattresses with memory memory mousses worn on the cover for 11990 crowns.
Of course we can take the second free.
The age of peaches or viscous flies with an open cell structure and a large thickness was started with the material Time at a "cosmic" rhythm.
This began as a matter for NASA because astronauts were subject to enormous load factors.
The Tempur melts to the heat and hardens, on the contrary, to the cold.
It therefore perfectly adapts to the warm human body and distributes it with optimal pressure.
It is ideal for this against bad sleep and for increased comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic muscles are used not only for mattresses but also for products for health, such as special cushions for feet that lighten the legs and the surrounding system.
Czech manufacturers use, for example, the EucathermC or Twinsaver mousse or the same type.
Follow-up devices are increasingly being asked by parents who want to monitor their children.
The fear of their child is increasing, leading more and more people to think about monitoring them through a GPS.
The system, set up at the beginning to search for cars, can also be used to track the movement of people and help in some cases, such as the one of the little Anicka Janatkova.
The instrument is now as large as a box of lamps but will soon be the size of a watch.
The case of little Anicka has given birth to a large number of people and they have begun to look for ways to better protect their children.
Even if the price is to disturb their privacy.
"We are trying to tell everyone that this is not spying but only another way to reduce the likelihood that there is another tragedy," says Petr Pilin of the company Macro Weil, who is one of the suppliers of tracking devices on the Czech market.
"I assume there may be cases of misuse of such devices, such as putting them in the bag of a person who is not aware, but I have not yet met such cases."
"Most people are customers who actually buy the product for security reasons," adds Pilin.
According to him, children should always know what purposes "the box" is used and how to use it in case of emergency.
Children's psychologist Dana Bockova points out that if the child doesn't want to wear such a thing on him, he will get rid of it.
'And even the smallest ones can show great creativity when it comes to getting rid of something explicitly when they don't want to be under control.'
"The mobile phones, which can cut themselves like these tracking devices, have already brought the parents to long expectations," Bockova says.
According to her, the fact that this type of device can help in the event of aggression is very controversial.
"If this is a prepared kidnapping, the author will do everything to ensure that the child does not have an electronic device that can locate it."
"At present, it's the phone."
"As soon as the tracking devices develop, they (criminals) will also seek them because the sale will be supported by an advertising campaign."
"In such cases, criminals will always be in advance on the police," says the psychologist.
It also admits that such devices can help in an attack not prepared by a pedophile.
According to Robert Cech of the RC Monitoring company, which offers tracking services for both cars and people, claims that having this type of device can help, even if it is destroyed in the event of an aggression.
"The apparatus may be measured in such a way that it is in regular emission after a specified period".
"In the event that the device is destroyed, it remains the last position of the person concerned."
'The most expensive devices also have a terminal meter that immediately signals the position of the person who has slipped and is in a position that is lengthened without moving,' says Cech.
According to him, smartphones that are intelligent, which are equipped with a navigation system, can offer a comparable service after having formatted it with a special prologial.
The problem with the current tracking systems is that it is a device similar to that which is carried in relation to the size of a lamp box or to the smallest telephone devices.
We can always lose them.
According to Pilina of Macro Weil, this is why tests are being carried out now to make devices similar to common digital watches.
"This will have the advantage that any attacker will not be able to recognize the tracking device."
"Or he'll realize after a while, which will give the police a little more time," he adds.
Whether the tracking device is developed in the form of a bracelet or pendant, it will always use the same technology as to track cars.
This is a combination of a GPS positioning system (which is commonly used in self-navigation) and a function of a mobile phone that alerts the current position of a vehicle.
The army has so many detonating wires that it could make the tour of the Czech Republic with it, but it can only hold two years.
The army has purchased 445 km of cables used for explosives.
Already last year the Ministry of Defence had purchased 224 km.
The army therefore has reservations for 225 years.
The problem is that the length of life of the cord is two to four years.
The army bought detonating wires to the anonymous company STV Group for 40 million crowns.
The General State gave the reason for the purchase of an enormous amount of detonating wires to MF DNAs that soldiers use 60 km per year.
According to the reserve calculations made by military pyrotechnics, which MF DNAs contacted, it turns out that even the generals, officers with a command, secretary or household personnel should have an explosive exercise every year.
Alexandre Vondra, Minister of Defence and Vlastimil Picek, commander of the army are no exception.
Only to argue the annual consumption of the army of 60 km of detonating cables.
This distance corresponds to 25,000 explosions.
And even if it was true, the Army's reserves could be subpoenaed for 10 years.
If, on the contrary, it would be true that for each of the new professionals' basic training, it is sufficient for more than 2 m of detonating wires, as the experts say, this means that the army with its new purchase has ensured - including the consumption of special units and engineering - reserves for the 225 years mentioned.
However, the rapid intervention squad soldiers recently complained to Minister Vondra that they had almost no ammunition for their poing weapons and that shooting sessions were limited due to cash needs.
We don't talk about the lack of body clothes.
"And I don't mind if they buy us a lot of detonating wires."
"And that's their decision and they really know what they're doing."
"for us the army is a good client that we as traders strive to contain," says STV Group's sales director Jan Decky.
Jan Pejsek, spokesperson for the Ministry of Defence, argues the purchase of hundreds of miles of detonating wires because the army will have these "munitions" in reserve for 10 years.
However, Jan Decky of STV Group reports only four years of life of detonating wires and the police and military pyrotechnics for only two years.
"If they are perfectly stored in deposits, it may even go up to four years," says one of the two who does not want his name published in the light of the military's criticism.
The life span of each ammunition must be tested to see if it remains integrated and does not threaten the soldier's life.
However, these tests are not free and still cost money.
The other argument of the department is a discount due to the quantity of 445 km of cordless detonators.
"They cost us 60 percent less than last year's supply of 245 km," says Pezek spokesperson who interprets the opinion of the defence department's buyers.
Only to compare: the annual consumption of detonating wires by police pyrotechnics who neutralize the ammunition of the Second World War or those after the Soviet Army does not exceed 1500 metres.
And the police are still only ordering the amount of ammunition needed to be used before the end of their life.
This has been developed for safety reasons for pyrotechnics and to be able to obtain more flexible types of more modern and reliable detonating cord.
the Ministry of Defence today has major problems for the neutralization of dozens of tons of ammunition coming from the Warsaw Pact when the strong Czechoslovak army of two hundred thousand men was preparing to move, head of the Rhine.
What awaits in a few years this Czech army that MF DNAs contacted: neutralize hundreds of kilometers of detonating old cordage that it buys today "in the good market".
So far, I have benefited from contacts that I have obtained through the competitions.
The free sale of his hotel helped Lukas Pytloun for the winner of the best individual Entrepreneur's competition.
The winner of the Best Individual Entrepreneur's competition last year was Lukas Pytloun, 28-year-old entrepreneur.
His adventure towards success is like in a movie.
Lukas Pytloun likes to travel.
And abroad, it has been found that in Liberia there was a lack of quality accommodation site at a reasonable price.
From his savings on what he had gained when working abroad and with the help of a bank loan he bought a small building of 5 apartments in half demoli.
Knowing that he was still studying in the third year of higher education, it was a courageous action.
"The relationship between quality and the price of accommodation in our region has given me the desire to do something," says Lucas Pytloun.
He started renting the first newly built apartment to foreign workers.
He reinvests the benefit in the building that he converts into a pension with 54 beds.
Since then, his actions as an entrepreneur have enabled him to open 4 guesthouses in Libérec, two style restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of nearly 300 beds of all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable among them was until recently the four stars Pytloun hotel design.
This year he was given another quality of the same quality.
"We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrova U Tise where we sold our concept of franchise and other candidates for the franchise of Pytloun hotels," number 1 of entrepreneurs last year.
"And for the sale of the license for the operation of a large-scale hotel the victory in the company's competition for the year has served well, adds Pytloun with appreciation.
The victory has brought him more popularity and to be known in Liberia and its surroundings.
"People recognized me in the streets, often congratulated me, and, I must say, it was very nice," he recalls.
It recommends participation in this competition to all those who are trying to do something.
It is not necessary to win but any opportunity to be visible is good.
He says he is still using his contacts and knowledge that he could not otherwise have obtained.
"With those I met through the competition, I started to maintain business relations regularly.
According to him, the success-related reputation has also had an impact on employees.
And he's got about 70.
"I observe, above all, the loyalty and pride of being committed to something that has been generally recognized."
"It is not, and far away, the only result of my personal work, but the result of a good work of all of us together.
"Only my name is pushed forward," says Lucas Pytloun with modesty.
I wish my successor a better year than the one we had in Farmet.
The euphoria of victory was rapidly replaced by the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to the goal of the Farmet winner has the worst moments behind him.
The one who came to find the prize in Slovansky dum for the first place of the competition for the Vodaphone year last year is Karel Zdarsky the owner of Farmet.
The Board has rewarded the efforts with which it has transformed a tool workshop to Ceska Skalice into a 100 million crown business firm.
'I can say that the reward not only encouraged me and my collaborators and increased our confidence in itself to fight competition', says today the winner of the competition last year.
At the beginning of Farmet's history there was a desire to do something useful.
And so when the state offered Karel Zdrasky's father to rent the small workshop as compensation after the confiscation of the goods by the communists, he did not hesitate long, refused a career in a company where he was working at the time, and created a company with some friends around his father for the manufacture of plastic baths.
Not long after they started specializing in the vegetable oil press.
He became the largest automatic press manufacturer in Central Europe after 18 years.
The company was even known in the unspecialized public after the success of the competition through the media.
"Not only have our customers started to really get to know the Farmet brand, but also the foreign partners who started to realize that they were working with a society that has achieved the greatest success in its country of origin," says Karel Zdarsky.
But last year it did not happen to Farmet only in the euphoria of victory.
The assessment of the company was made from 2008 and in part 2009.
And just in 2009, it was the most difficult year for the sale of engineering machines.
At the top of the crisis, which did not really affect citizens, companies were forced to stop their investment projects and start limiting their purchases of new materials and technologies.
"We have obviously not escaped this situation."
"Business figures fell by 40 percent, and we had to limit our production and even license," explains Karel Zdarsky.
A viable society must know that from time to time it is necessary to take unpopular measures.
But they managed the situation correctly and preserved the benefits even if they were less than those they had before the crisis.
However, in Farmet, they continued uncompromisingly investing in research and development.
"We have built with the resources a training and research centre, strengthened the presentation of society in international exhibitions and won the main rewards in national exhibitions," Zdarsky says.
Everything makes us think the crisis is behind them.
Business figures are increasing and with them the number of employees is also increasing.
"A new winner I wish this pleasant feeling of victory but in a calm atmosphere," says Karel Zdarsky.
The investigation that eliminates the foolish regulations.
The absurdity survey of the year is for the fourth time part of the business plan.
Some absurd regulations could have been deleted.
The little glorious winner of this year's investigation into the absurdity of the year was the obligation to provide in the offices of documents that officials can obtain online.
More than a third of the 4,000 voters voted in favour.
For example, the social affairs administration asked for a paper extract from the trade register while the civil servant could obtain it in two clicks of mouse.
It's changing because of the investigation.
"The Czech Social Insurance Administration will no longer ask for extract from the trade register for insurance payments checks," said Jana Buranova, spokesperson of the Czech Social Insurance Administration (CSSZ).
To highlight all the regulations and decrees that companies and entrepreneurs must comply with in the Czech Republic and to eliminate those who are absurd is the meaning of this year's absurdity contest.
This survey is still this year for the fourth time a part of the business clan organized by Hospodarske noviny and has even more popularity.
If 3000 votes have been taken last year, at least 4000 votes have been cast this year.
And it's not surprising, there are the most diverse legal obligations in our country that only stop the company, and, more and more.
"We may be among the number of documents to be completed for tax returns at the top of the world," says Karel Havlicek of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
Simplification of enterprise activity has become a proclaimed goal of all governments in recent years.
Compared to the whole world, the situation in the Czech Republic is not improving at all.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic is in 74th place with regard to the conditions for the company, 8 more than last year.
The Year's Absorbity Competition was launched for the first time in 2006 and continues every year according to the same scenario.
Anyone who can report on the administrative and bureaucratic absurdities of April to the end of September each year, the last time before the closing of the competition.
To report on the website www.firmaroku.cz. Then the contest organizer selects seven candidates for the "antiprix" and allows the public to vote during October on the website www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and on www.ihned.cz.
The absurdity that has received the greatest number of votes is declared winner.
Until the last survey last year, it is one hundred, or more precisely 105 regulations and decrees that have lost their sense of existence.
The notes are sent by entrepreneurs as well as professional associations and teachers.
Among the "finalists" of the competition, for example, among the nominees are the obligation that motorways and fast-track maintenance vehicles pay wages, or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees repeat two offices and two toilets every two years.
the list of seven proposals is published on the competition website.
The announcement of the competition, which always begins at the beginning of November on Place Venceslas in Prague, is part of an event that regularly participates in the personalities of political and public life.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodova, Director of the Association for Small and Medium Enterprises in the Czech Republic or Petr Kuzel, president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, attended the final moment of the competition.
'Economic prosperity cannot work when the state puts tingles in the legs of entrepreneurs and for this reason my goal is to eliminate, every year, at least three dozen paragraphs that today only complicate the company', said Martin Kocourek, Minister of Industry and Trade.
The effort to eliminate absurd orders is not a sword in the water.
In 2007, what people disliked was the obligation of entrepreneurs to report three days before the individual company office to the place where the company was located, the intention to go to an exhibition or pilgrimage with a stand.
This obligation was deleted with the amendment of the Individual Enterprise Act.
The second most prevalent obligation in 2007, which was to declare at the Labour Office a service trip for a foreign employee in 30 days, was deleted with the Act on what is called the Green Card.
And everything is okay until the third session of the competition.
The absurdity of 2009 was the determination for physiotherapists to have a large mirror in their cabinet, a refrigerator and two automatic balances.
This was changed by order of the Ministry of Health last year the obligation to have a refrigerator was removed.
A new category rewards companies responsible socially.
Environmental, humanitarian, training or sports projects have been evaluated.
This year's novelty of the Hospodarske Noviny competition, which has been in existence for 5 years, is the category called the Responsible Firm of 2010.
The objective of this competition is to support the reasonable and fair company.
"We want to support companies that monitor the environmental impacts of their businesses and conduct a socially responsible activity," says Patrick Bartholdy, regional manager of the mobile phone operator, Vodaphone, who is the guarantor and promoter of this competition, as in the case of the competition for the rebel of the year.
For this first year of this subcategory of the 2010 company competition, organized by Vodaphone, companies that have failed with a single long-term goal for the company were registered.
The adventure of each of them is rich in inspiration and an independent article would be to be edited.
Although their business is different from each other, they can be regarded as supporting and predictive activities as the denominator of their efforts.
In one case, this applies to persons with disabilities and to the personal or health problems of their employees.
Among the fourteen finalists for the whole Czech Republic is not the Pragois Prologic Society and Netera, which supports the creation of informal sports teams of their employees who then participate in numerous tournaments in various sports disciplines.
Another example of a firm in charge of the Pardubice region is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main contributor for 17 years to the trust fund that sponsors children with disabilities.
Taking care of employees with health problems can still be cited The old Podebrad paper manufacturing plant that employs more than 70 percent of them and for this purpose has obtained the title of the company Responsible for the Central Bohéme region and which has been the third in the region in the competition of the company for the year organized by Vodaphone.
In Olomouc, it is MiRyz Soft, a financial company, who has earned to introduce hours of work and even reduced to 35 hours a week on average and, without, proportionally, a reduction in wages.
The jury also gave him the title because it buys the Czech manufacturers in priority, supports a ditoyan activity in the vicinity and concerns the environment.
"We strive to recycle as much as possible so that our business and administration have the least environmental impact," explains Miluse Ryzanrova, the executive director of society.
the company responsible IT Log in of the Usti Region also thinks about the health of its employees and has set up an ergonomic chair and keyboard for each laptop, encourages their work at home and uses catering services from a local protected plant for its actions.
"We also support the Foundation The Man in the Shadow that helps the local Roma community," said Ondrej Suchy, the representative of society.
In the final grade, there is also a laundry and cleaning company in the Karlovy Vary region, which participates in the pension insurance of its employees in the form of bonuses above standards.
"In our society, we contribute to food, transport, skills and recreation," said Joseph Strapac of the company building bruntal Czasch, winner of the Moravia-Silesia region.
They were automatically registered in the responsible company category, all regional finalists for the Vodaphone year firm's competition, who had replied to the questionnaire in the attached part of the registration document and had referred it to the organizer before 15 August.
The incorrect or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were withdrawn from the competition by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the companies in high school had not answered the questions, they could not participate in the competition of the responsible firm but were not disqualified from the "principal" competition of the Vodaphone Year Company."
"Independent registrations are not possible because they are a subcategory of the main competition of the Year's Company," explains Karel Goldman of the Bison&Rose organisation agency.
In the Lands Fund in Plzen, police arrested during a public competition
In the building of the Lands Fund in Plzen, the anti-corruption police have been arrested in recent days.
The detectives passed the menott to the local contractor and traded in real estate Lubos. G.
He had tried to manipulate just a call for public tenders for the settlement of a return request in such a way that the proposed land was obtained by a certain candidate.
This guy was supposed to pay a half a million crowns to Lubos G..
"For the moment, I can only confirm that the police continue a person for a crime of initiation in the context of a call for tenders and a public competition," said Plzen Parquet's head, Plzen Antonie Zeena, who knows that it is prohibited to provide more explanations because the investigation is underway.
Police officers released this 46-year-old contractor after 24 hours.
To know how it could influence a public competition, we can only speculate about so little official information.
On a question of Pravo, the spokesperson for the Lubomira Cerna Land Fund indicated that police officers had actually been arrested in Plzen on a separate workplace and that during the public competition.
"He was a client and in no case an employee, she specified.
The public competition according to Cerna has as its real name "Call for rights to land transfer under the Land Act" and is set up when several eligible legal candidates appear.
"These persons propose, in the context of the appeal, a higher value of their right to reinstatements that must be settled before the value of the land is announced."
"In accordance with the rights proposed, a classification of purchasers is established and the Land Fund then transfers the land to the person who proposed the highest rights," explained the spokesperson of the Fund.
Lubos G. had, of course, information about the persons who had registered in the appeal and, as he himself is, a beneficiary because having purchased a large number of refund rights, he had proposed to the candidates in the field not to participate in the competition.
And he certainly fell down by retreating.
Which would explain why he had so much money in his possession at the time of his impalement.
Lubos G. had far above the standards in the FdT (Fonds des Terrains).
He was in the case of FdT ex-Chief of the FdT Vaclav Sankot who was prosecuted for publishing land for which the construction decision had already been issued.
Lubos G. had obtained, for example, land for the construction of public communications, specifically in place and where access to the industrial area of Borske Pole was to be built.
Later he exchanged it with the mayor for a building in the historic center of the city whose value is far higher.
The mayor was obliged to accept because otherwise she could put the construction at risk by blocking the land.
Households will pay an additional one hundred crowns a month for housing.
From January onwards, households will have to pay a supplement not only for all types of energy but also for water and sanitation, heating supplies and in some places rentals will also increase.
So from January onwards, families will have to pull out of their wallet up to a hundred crowns a month more than now.
Electricity increases by 4.6 percent, the gas of almost 2 percent more expensive, in some places you will have to pay up to a tenth more water supply and in many places central heating supplies will also be more expensive.
The increase in electricity should give the apartment households 100 crowns per year more than currently.
However, all suppliers have reduced the prices of electricity given the sensitive development to encourage the production of renewable energy, including photovoltaic batteries.
Gas increases moderately but of course when people need it most to warm up and therefore have the greatest consumption.
So we can also count a hundred more crowns.
Although electricity and gas are increasing throughout the Czech Republic, the change in the price of central heating differs from city to city.
These are mainly the largest commons that plan price increases.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Kraloce will pay for the central heating almost 50 crowns per month from January, the Liberian families will pay more than 1,000 crowns annually.
For the people of Prague, an increase of 9 percent for water and sanitation is being prepared in case the city increases infrastructure rents.
If the rents do not change the thresholds they will pay an additional 6.8 per cent.
The price in Prague will still be among the lowest compared to the whole country.
In northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and sanitation increase by 7.4 per cent.
For example, rent prices will increase significantly in the 450 thousand rental apartments from January to the end of the regulation.
For example, CPI Byty, which has almost 2,500 apartments in Usti nad Labem, has decided to increase up to 100 percent.
Those who do not agree with the new increase in rents will be translated into courts by society.
Regular rents paid by people in nearly 300 thousand apartments could increase the next year by 10%.
The Czech children swim at the rum and fernet. The beer is no longer fashionable and it acts mildly.
Fernet, rum, vodka and in an exceptional way also the best brand of whiskey are stolen to parents.
These are drinks that most often bring those who are healthy, who are not yet 15 years old, in the hands of the doctor.
Children who are cared for at the hospital for relapse do not make the exception.
This results from the experience of doctors who encounter cases similar to hospital admissions.
"Beers or wines are no longer fashionable because it takes time to be healthy."
'The trend is really strong,' says Pravo Ludek Pelikan, head of the Children's Department of Horovice Hospital in Central Bohemia.
"When they manage to chip a papa bottle in the closet, it's sometimes whiskey but it's the fernet and vodka that prevail."
"The vodka has this advantage that they can mix it with fruit juice and thus not feel it," explains the head of the department.
Eva Jurinova, spokesperson for the Motol Hospital, also gives her reason.
"In general, it's from the rum or the Fernet."
"It's alcohol today, especially in elementary schools."
"In some cases, it was Slavovice that they brought back from the house," Jurinova added.
According to the Chief of Department Pélikan, seeing children aged 13 to 14 years of age at hospital admission is a normal phenomenon.
Before working in Horovice since last year, he was in Motol where he spent ten years in pediatrics where ambulances were bringing students from the wide area completely ivorian.
"A young girl was hospitalized four times
"She began her 12-year career when she was taken with 3.5 per thousand alcohol in the blood with an additional mix with ecstasy," the doctor described this particularly important case.
"She was at the Hollywood Exhibition Park at a party."
"What's interesting is that it doesn't seem weird to the mother that her daughter is missing for 48 hours," said the Department's Director.
It is just the disinterest of parents or their tolerance outside the common face of their rejection of alcohol that is the main cause of the development of child alcoholism.
According to experts, however, there is no mention of dependence, in its strict sense, on children.
"There is chronic alcohol dependence on alcohol for several years with all the phenomena that result from it but that it is not found in children."
"To those who use alcohol repeatedly, it is rather a significantly disadvantaged socio-family background," explained the Chief of the Pélikan Department.
According to Jurinova spokesperson, approximately forty children Ivres were hospitalized this year until mid-November at the pediatric clinic in Motol.
Only cases with severe poisoning require hospitalization are included in the statistics.
Ivorian children who are after emergency care brought home by their parents or by the police are not counted.
In addition to children who sit and drink a bottle of alcohol after school, Pelikan insists on three seasonal waves with which we can count: the day of the witches, the holy Sylvestre and the end of the school year.
"They drink in spite of bad results or on the contrary they celebrate the beginning of holidays."
"Of course I lived on the day of witches an admission of 7 Ivre children at once," Pelikan said.
The child who spent the night at the hospital in detoxification under medical control is paradoxically in a better position than the one who came home and suffered the next day of the "wood mouth".
The headaches in the morning caused by dehydration and lack of glucose are eliminated by a glucose infusion and nutrients required by the body.
"They're better lots because they spend an excellent evening and then a gentle awakening and nothing hurts them."
"They are only surprised at the place where they are," adds Pelikan, knowing that from time to time this causes the good mood of the patients at least with the note to pay for their care.
Transport by ambulance and hospitalization on bed of intensive care can go up to tens of thousands of crowns.
"From time to time, I have applied this as an educational tool, counting on how much Irritability these children have cost and that they could spend all summer in seasonal work to repay one evening," Pelikan added.
However, according to him, health insurance companies in their regressive management, which should be able to recover from parents the care-related burdens, do not deal with cases of children who are ill.
Two L-159 planes are for the first time in foreign hands in Spain.
Two L-159 of the five aircraft in total, against which the Ministry of Defence exchanged Casa C-295M transport aircraft, took off Tuesday for Seville in Spain where the Casa-EADS aircraft manufacturer is based.
This is the first time that devices of this kind become the property of someone other than the Czech army.
However, they were abroad as part of exercises or demonstration flights.
These are bilateral versions of the L-159T1 that were still in service in the Czech army and were in flight.
The remaining devices are single versions of the L-159.
They are stationed for the moment at Aero Vodochody and the commercial intermediary - the company Omnipol - took them into account last week.
According to Jan Pejsek of the Ministry of Defence's Press Department, Vodochody's physical departure is currently unknown.
'The L-159 scheduled aerodromes for the exchange have been taken on long-term stored aircraft without causing additional charges or investments for the Ministry of Defence.'
"The L-159 T1 biplaces were exchanged in the state," said Pravo Pejsek.
He said that the army will not remain undiluted as the department signed an agreement with Aero Vodochody in May 2009 with a value of 200 million crowns for the transformation of four L-159 mono-places unused in two bi-places.
The army took delivery of the first apparatus in July, the second being scheduled for delivery at the end of this year.
According to Pejsek EADS, it has undertaken to introduce aircraft into the equipment of certain countries of the Alliance.
"The contract clearly states that the person who takes the L-159 aircraft into account is EADS and that they will serve for the training of NATO pilots."
"It is therefore the case of the one who takes into account how to achieve this," Pejsek said.
Hospodarske noviny announced, some time ago, that the Spanish army was not interested in L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 for a Casa aircraft and the purchase of three other aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns was initiated last year by the government of Mirek Topomanek.
The Department of Defence did not launch an appeal and contacted EADS directly.
the defence management argued that the exchange ensures a future export of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army has purchased 72 devices in Aero Vodochody and only uses 24 devices, which are willing to sell the rest.
The purchase of Casa will probably have judicial implications.
However, the European Commission complained against the Czech Ministry of Defence before the European Court of Justice because the aircraft should have been selected as part of a European call for tender and in no case by directly contacting a manufacturer.
The army has already taken over three Casa planes, the last one should arrive at Prague Kbely airport in two weeks.
A longer index than the yearbook is a low risk sign of cancer
Men who have the index longer than the index are exposed to less risk of having prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published on Wednesday by the British magazine Cancer.
This may depend on the level of hormone male testosterone.
"Our conclusions show that the relative length of the finger is a simple test of the risk of prostate cancer, especially for men 60 years ago," said the co-author of the Ros Eeles study, professor at the University of Warwick for cancer research.
The finger could thus help determine which men should submit to the prostate cancer test, including by combining with the genetic risk or other aggravating factors such as family health history, Eeles added.
During the period 1994-2009, she followed with her colleagues in Great Britain more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer and at the same time nearly three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had the index of the right hand shorter than the yearbook.
For them as for 19 percent of those who had their fingers of the same length, the same probability of prostate cancer was found.
However, in the case of those with a longer index than the index, the risk index fell to 33 per cent, for men before 60 years the risk reduction reached 87 per cent.
The length report of the two fingers mentioned - formed during the prenatal period - indicates, among other things, different levels of sexual hormones to which the child is exposed in the uterus.
Unless testosterone corresponds to a longer index.
Previous research has shown that it is just testosterone that helps develop prostate cancer.
Professor Vacla Paces, a renowned Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, said to CTK that he is aware of this study, but he does not seem to think that the relationship between the length of fingers and cancer is "completely demonstrated".
The Czech Republic is under snow, motorways D1 and D5 are closed.
Czech Republic as most of Europe is this morning covered by snow.
On the roads and sidewalks, most of the time of the compact snow, the sailors worked all night in many places.
The D5 motorway is closed in the morning between the 89th and 93th kilometers in the direction of Rozvadov due to several truck and car accidents and the D1 motorway in Brno in the direction of Prague is the same.
The driver of the Central Automotive Club (UAMK) told the information
At the 91st kilometer a truck was hit, at the 93rd two heavy weights were hit, the accident caused injuries.
Several cars were also found in the hole.
The problems are also on the D1 motorway to 185 kilometres towards Prague.
Two trucks went down there.
Drivers should leave just after Brno at 190 km or go to Brno and then enter at 182 km in Kyvalka.
A row of cars several kilometers has formed in this place.
Also on the D11 motorway, there is an accident and, this, just on arrival in Prague.
In Prague, there is a snow layer of several centimeters of thickness, the thermometers indicate - 7 degrees Celsius.
Car rows are created in Prosek for example, Sterboholska Street is also closed.
The safest means of transport is the subway.
Tramways are delayed, for example, by the line between Place Charles (Karlove Namesti) and Place of Peace (Namesti Miru).
At eight o'clock in the morning, the major state of the Prague crisis still has to meet.
The railways and the airport also face problems.
The Czech Railways have already had to remove 7 fast connections due to snow.
The lines from Prague to Kralupy or from Prague to Beroon have problems
Travelers should monitor the current situation.
Ruzyne airport has been closed since Wednesday 11 a.m. at night until 5 p.m.
Most of the roads in South Moravia are already rolling, but by rerouting surveillance.
On the road of Vyskov, three side roads are impracticable, on the road of Brno it begins to have snowflakes and on the road of Blanco chains are mandatory to pass certain communication routes to the places above.
The Vyskov region is one of the most affected areas.
Until now, the axes are closed: Rousinov-Slavkov, Bohdalice-Kucerov and Saratice-Milesovice
To clean them, you may need to send snowflakes and snowflakes.
We can't estimate for the moment when they'll be rolling.
On the road of Hodonin, caution is strict in the White Carpathians region.
On the roads that are, given the protection of nature, only maintained by the aperture of inert products, there is also a layer of 5 centimeters of snow warned CTK.
In the Czech Republic, it fell between two and 10 centimeters of snow; it fell most in northern Bohemia, with often up to 18 centimeters of snow.
In the Moravia-Silesia region, it fell up to 15 centimeters of snow.
The snow disappeared gradually in Czech Republic.
Americans have a new "smart weapon"
The U.S. Army sent a new "smart" weapon to Afghanistan, known only as XM-25.
The generals believe that this new automatic rifle will influence the conflict there with the Taliban and will "change the game" for their benefit.
The new weapon is like a super precise cannon
Its projectiles are guided by laser with precision of a few meters.
The 25 mm caliber special ammo developed for this rifle and containing a highly breaking explosive actually works like small grenades.
The ammunition can be programmed in such a way that they will explode into contact with the target but also at any point in their ballistic route.
It can therefore be used against an enemy hiding behind an obstacle, a wall or a hole.
It is no longer protected from above and when it falls upon a deadly rain of steel cracks, it can also put it out of control.
According to Richard Audette, who took part in the development of XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon to use the "smart" technology.
"The soldier uses it essentially in such a way that he finds the target, sends him a laser radius that determines the distance, thus obtaining a specific point of view, according to which he corrects his target site and relies on relaxation.
"Let's say you've targeted 543 meters."
"When you press the rest, the weapon is loaded and pulled at the distance of 543 meters more or less 1, 2, 3 meters," Audette said.
400 localized jobs
The Fujitsu group relocates its subsidiary from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July next year, 400 employees will transfer their place of work to Astro Park, which is currently located at the office building of Place Mareinbader in the Bad Homburg region.
The Japanese group Fujitsu relocates its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As stated on Wednesday, the giant specialist in computer manufacturing and maintenance, next year in July, the 400 men and women's workplace, located so far in the Marienbader square of Bad Homburg, will be transferred to Astro Park, a huge complex of offices located on Lyoner Straße Street of the Niederrad Quarter in Frankfurt.
A Fujitsu spokesperson explained that in the medium term, the group should group 100 other jobs still scattered in the region.
The rental offer was extremely attractive. In addition, Astro Park’s open-air offices are better suited to the employee’s working mode.
In Bad Homburg too, Fujitsu was just a tenant.
Director General Bernd Wagner said: " Frankfurt-Niederrad is a major location for us with remarkable infrastructure."
It states that the connection to the airport is just of great importance to a global company such as Fujitsu.
The new move of an important company inside the region yesterday caused the joy of the winners and caused the disappointment of the losers.
The Head of Economic Affairs of the Municipality of Frankfurt, Mr. Markus Frank (CDU), said that once again, a "planetary actor" had been so conquered.
It is an "extraordinary profession of faith regarding the site of implantation".
Fujitsu is suitable for the city and its installation is an important fan for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi (the greens), regrets Fujitsu's decision.
The management soon informed the municipality of this intention.
"It goes without saying that we have offered our help to this company," said Mr. Korvisi.
However, friendly relationships could not have changed the difficulties of the computer manufacturer facing the owner of the Marienbader Place building.
In the end, economic reasons would have been decisive.
It is now about avoiding that such an exceptional place remains unoccupied for a long time.
"I hope the building owner and dancer will be cooperative."
Ten years ago, the building of the Place de l'Hôtel de Ville, used so far by Fujitsu and the nearby "vertical little" as well as the rest of the buildings of the Place Marienbad, were part of the controversial construction project of the thermal station.
The fruit of a joint project of the municipality and a private project developer, a new entrance to the city was created between the station and the City Hotel. This resulted in many criticisms, not only because of the impressive design of the surfaces that used to be part of the parking lot, but also because of the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the company of rating and investment advice, Feri, the computer manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, and Fujitsu, the computer manufacturer at the time associated with Siemens, moved into the buildings.
In 2006, the German Group of Immobilien-Chancen Specialized Frankfurt bought the buildings occupied by Fujitsu at the same time as the real estate fund Morgan Stanley. A year later, these buildings were sold back to the Spanish company Falcon Real Estate Investments SA based in Madrid.
The Fujitsu group, located in Tokyo, is considered the third largest supplier of computer products in the world.
For example, it makes computers and servers available to businesses and also provides essential services.
Its branch established in the Rhine-Main region is one of the most important in Germany: Fujitsu has a lot more employees in Munich.
The subsidiary, Fujitsu Technology Solutions, leaves Bad Homburg to settle in Frankfurt-Niederrad. The other subsidiaries present on this site are Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
For this, 7000 square meters have been rented in the Astro Park building.
This twenty-year-old complex, whose name reminds of its star-shaped plan, covers, among other things, the headquarters of the Confederation of Electronic and Electrotechnical Industry.
Server expulsion by Amazon - Threats against Mr. Assange
Wikileaks is experiencing more and more difficulties.
The Amazon Internet Service Provider expelled its servers from the site specialized in disclosure of confidential documents.
This attitude may hide political pressure from the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic notes.
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr. Assange, apparently lives in England.
In the United States, Wikileaks is being attacked with more and more force.
The Wikileaks cyber-activists group no longer has access to its server hosted so far in America and is now looking for a host in Europe.
During this time, the prominent US Senator Joe Lieberman called the other countries and businesses to boycott Wikileaks.
And the founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange, who is wanted by Interpol, is probably staying in Britain, according to the information published by newspapers.
"Wikileaks excludes the Amazon server."
"Freedom of expression in the country of freedom," said cyber-activists on Wednesday (local time) from revelations via the social Twitter network.
Earlier, the cyber company, Amazon, had removed Wikileaks documents from its servers.
After the publication of the secret diplomatic notes, the cyber-activists used the Amazon Web Service (AWS) to reach the largest number of documents.
Through Twitter Wikileaks continues his revelations: "Formidable, our dollars are now spent on caring for people in Europe."
When freedom of expression poses a problem in Amazon, "they should stop selling books."
The CNN television channel, quoting Mr. Liebermann's office, reported that Amazon had banned Wikileaks from using its servers after the investigation carried out by Senator Joe Lieberman's collaborators.
The president of the Senate Committee for the Protection of the Territory had threatened the Amazon site to orchestrate a boycott against it, reported the British newspaper "The Guardian".
"I would have liked Amazon to take this step earlier in the light of previous publications by Wikileaks of classified information," said the senator.
At the same time, Mr. Liebermann called on other countries to refuse to use servers on the platform.
"Wikileaks acts illegally, monstrous and unscrupulous. In doing so, it endangers our national security and endangers our lives throughout the world," according to an independent senator.
"No company aware of its responsibilities, whether American or foreign, should help Wikileaks to disseminate the contents of stolen documents."
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr. Assange, who is sought by the Swedish authorities because he is suspected of rape, is on the list of persons sought by Interpol.
According to information published by the London newspaper "The Independent", 39-year-old Australia lives in Great Britain and Scotland Yard knows exactly where it is.
The cyber-activist has consistently qualified intrigues orchestrated by his detractors the prosecutions committed to his encounter with Sweden.
Wikileaks spokesperson, Kristinn Hrafnsson, told London that threats had been made against the site.
"Some calls have even been made for the murder of Julian Assange."
That's why Assange is particularly afraid of his safety, Hrafnsson said.
That's why Wikileaks' founder keeps hiding.
Hrafnsson was clearly responding to statements made in North America.
In America, the former governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, demanded that Wikileaks be prosecuted and executed for treason.
In Canada, the Chief of Government adviser Mr. Stephan Harper stated on television that Mr. Assange should be "killed" and that Mr. Obama could "use a Drone".
During this time, a controversy broke out between the White House and Mr. Assange.
Robert Gibbs, spokesperson for American President Barack Obama, described Mr. Assange as "sudden and absurd" the fact that Mr. Assange had demanded the resignation of Secretary of State Hilary Clinton if he was responsible for the order given to the diplomats, and had recently announced that he would commit himself to espionage activities.
"I don't know exactly why we have to deal with the opinion of an individual who owns a website," says Mr. Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much more important than the statements of a website."
The U.S. government now fully passes to the testing bank the protection of its databases.
According to a White House communiqué, Mr. Russell Travers, Deputy Director of the Anti-Terrorism Control Centre, was appointed responsible for combating leaks.
Mr. Travers is responsible for putting in place "the necessary structural reforms" made essential after the disclosure of diplomatic cables by Wikileaks.
The White House also has the will to verify the means by which the entire administration exchanges and protects information.
In addition, the U.S. government announced that it would take care of the security of dissidents and militants if they were ever threatened by the revelations of Wikileaks.
"We have done everything we can to get in touch with them," said the spokesman of the Department of State, Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if necessary."
The University of Ice
At the "Gelato University" in Bologna, ice confectioners are prepared for the best seasons of the year.
The three-day initiation course for future glaciers has been very successful and attracted by visitors from around the world.
In fact, where does all the ice come from?
Glacier and the ice machine.
The ice cream, i.e. in German the ice confectioner is slightly out of date, manufactures the cream according to all the rules of Italian icemaking art.
The ice turbine removes the ice cream from the refrigerated glass using a spatula, it has it in the glove and then starts to sell it.
To find out, we don't need to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But whoever wants to know more about the ice can not avoid "Gelato-University" from the Italian firm Carpigiani.
The manufacturer of sorbitants founded the ice university in 2003 so that ice creams coming out of his machines would respond everywhere to the Italian ideals.
The three-day start-up course for future glaciers has been very successful and attracted by visitors from all over the world.
Special courses on chocolate ice are also offered and are extended for several days. Practical meetings are also organized in private ice cream.
In the midst of the quarantine crisis, a number of people dream of a new career, others just risk to realize their burning desire for smooth ice.
This time, there are 40 participants from 19 countries across all continents from Brazil to Saudi Arabia passing through Hungary.
Jacky, a professor of artistic education from California, is a fan of the Slow Food movement. He wants to offer a European product of quality in the country of industrial ice in the future.
Anke de Berlin is a business manager and after a few years she wants to take a few things out of this trialsome job for the nerves.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening a glacier in Cairo.
One man from Malta and another from Brazil would like to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars, and the Canadian household woman came because her children love Italian ice cream.
The master of the glacier Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal features of the perfect ice.
It is decisive not only good taste but also good flexibility and good consistency.
However, Luciano does not forget during the training the cerise on the garden of national superstructure and, in general, of the south: "Italian ice is just the best: and then it still retains a sacred dose of romanticism."
The first step in manufacturing seems quite simple.
Luciano translates basic ingredients such as milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilisers into a large blender that heats up to 85 degrees thanks to an electronic program, then cools immediately to four degrees.
It then opens a tap installed on the machine: a white base pasteurised cream, based on all kinds of ice creams in milk.
The trainer is immediately questioned: Is it possible to manufacture ice using only natural substances without stabiliser?
How can we give free course to the personal pleasure of the experiment?
Mr. Luciano warned against being misled by the spirit of time.
The one who speaks only of "made from natural ingredients" has perhaps used stabilizers: most often a natural product, such as guar grain flour obtained from guar haricot.
It is obviously possible to make ice without using a stabiliser, only it is necessary to sell it within 24 hours, otherwise it will melt and the customer will hang nothing but ice pellets.
Some changes in the base mass are allowed.
This becomes more exciting with the aromas.
Master Luciano establishes the difference between the ingredients acquired in the fruit or confectionery of the supermarket.
In addition, there are powder and pasta.
"the suppliers will all try to show you dozens of aromatized ingredients."
"However, you should just try."
Also in fruit sorbet recipes with sugar and fresh fruit.
It is in the ice creams made from the white base mass which, by adding eggs to it, becomes a yellow cream and, when added from cocoa powder, constitutes the basis of all possible desserts to chocolate.
Now, all participants in the process must switch to the use of ice-cream machines.
Luciano invites them from time to time to produce four kinds of ice: vanilla, chocolate, moka and noiset with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla flavour or other natural ingredients.
The different kinds of fruit ice cream are also subject to the same experience.
More aromatic substances, more fruit purées: from the point of view of taste, this is not absolutely better.
The ice on the nuts does not necessarily contain the taste of the nut, when it consists mostly of nuts.
The very popular kiwi ice is made from the group using more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
"Only a balanced mixture correctly reflects the taste of ice," says Luciano.
The manufacture of ice is a calculation exercise: if you use the fish purée with a lot of sugar, you need to reduce the amount of sugar in the basic recipe.
A sugar supplement is needed for ice cream in lemon.
Luciano presents a device with which it determines the sugar content of the different types of fruit (the vineyards are used to measure the degree of Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, the tables facilitate calculations.
The manufacture of ice no longer requires as much physical intervention as ever.
It's not just the machine manufacturing the base mass that helps.
There is also a device that simultaneously beats the ice mixture available to make it octave and brought it back to negative temperatures.
In spite of all automations, light panels are not excluded.
The Brazilian Gustavo barbows with fruit purée from his head to his feet and thus smashes his fellow students when the control of the colossal ball mixture escapes him.
Master Luciano is of the opinion that a "such incident may occur during each course: it is only a matter of time."
The controllers in an ambiguous position
According to some sources, the industry that experiences the cultivation of genetically modified plants has clouded the European Food Safety Authority.
This charge is now formulated by the Testbiotech expert group, which is considered an independent institute for the assessment of the consequences of biotechnology.
"This sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we are well informed," said Mr. Christoph Then, Director of Testbiotech, Munich on Wednesday.
Some information indicates that the president of the Efsa Group of Experts on Genetically Modified Plants, Mr. Harry Kuiper, and other Efsa experts are under contract with the Ilsi Pressure Group.
The latter is funded by such groups as Monsanto, Nestlé or Bayer.
Mr. Kuiper worked hard to develop the test requirements of the Efsa for genetically modified plants and was therefore clearly in a conflict of interest situation, according to the criticisms made by Mr. Then.
The requirements drawn up correspond to the positions of the Ilsi pressure group by paragraph and thus bear the trade mark which would, in essence, be controlled by the authorities installed in Parme in Italy.
It is already the second time that Testbiotech denounces a conflict of interest.
A senior executive of the Efsa has recently joined the Swiss agri-food group Syngenta without condition or transitional period.
A short time ago, even the Central German Radio (Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk, MDR) had revealed the existence of personal relations between the European Union authority responsible for control and industrial lobbying, which has raised suspicions of both the German Federal Agency for the Environment and European Members.
However, Efsa does not accept the existence of any conflict of interest.
An opinion indicates that all reliable data, including those of industry, are exploited as long as they are of good professional quality.
Experts working on behalf of the Efsa are not prohibited from contacting this sector.
But they should make them public.
Mr. Kuiper admitted that he worked for the International Life Sciences Institute (Illsi) based in the United States.
This body is considered to be a neutral forum bringing together experts in science, industry and policy, among other things, to assess the risks of biotechnology without being the balance of a lobby.
In this case, independent experts such as Mr. Then disagree with the fact that genetically modified plants are accepted without any animal feeding test and that the impact of these plants on the environment has not been tested.
"We want to know what, for example, are the effects of genetically modified corn caused by the field," says Mr. Then.
The current practice is to test only isolated proteins and not the entire genetically modified plant, which does not allow reliable results.
"If you don't look for the risks, how can you find them?" Mr. Then asks about one of your accusers.
That is also Mrs. Angelika Hilbeck's point of view.
This scientist has been doing research in the field of genetics since 1994 and is currently working at the Zurich Polytechnic School.
In this region as well as in the United States and now in Europe, the industry is increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists.
That is why there are still hardly any researchers who are not related to companies.
In the opinion of the companies, critical studies would not be published.
Ms. Hilbeck said that "the industry controls security research".
The Stone Trace
Uli Gsell sought it out, a total of about 400 kilos.
Monday afternoon, she was in front of the Stuttgart station with her tube on her back.
There was a manif.
He was denying it.
The story is known: In September the excavators came and began to demolish a large part of the north wing.
The Stuttgart world was no longer the same: several thousand people protested against the S21 project, the transformation of Stuttgart's central station into a underground station that would cost several billion.
A large part of the wing was in ruins when the demonstrations led to the conclusion of the construction work.
Broken in 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
The Muschelkalk (the coquillier limestone) of Crailsheim, a thick and thick peacock built badly between 1914 and 1920.
Mr. Gsell is a 43-year-old sculptor living in Eastfieldern.
A few fragments have been found.
"These stones are relics."
"They don't have to disappear."
He declares with enthusiasm: "a modest and good market rock, simple and terrestrial."
He said that by cutting her off at the show, he felt the smell of cigarette smoke.
He still doesn't know what he'll do about this fragment.
The rocks have time.
Oli Gsell, too.
the traces of Stuttgart's stones lead to a former munitions deposit of the French army in a forest near Tubingue, where Manuel Rongen built his empire of stones.
This 44-year-old man is trading old stones.
He bought all the stones from the demolishment that happened in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were destroyed or if they disappeared in the dump," he said in his office located in a hut, which was once a guard post.
He reported that he was subjected to insults and threats when in September the newspapers reported that he had bought the rest of the north wing to the demolishment company.
But he has been negotiating for days with the opponents of the S21 project.
And he explained to them that he could do nothing to resist the demolishment.
And if it does, then the most reasonable thing would be to continue to use the stones.
Approximately 200 S21 project opponents subsequently brought one of the parallel stone pipelines with an average weight of 80 kilos, the value of which is between €6.50 and €14.
Some keep it as a memory in general while also hoping to do so during a reconstruction.
Rongen had acquired 500 tons, 25 full loads of a truck.
About half of them are still trapped in the forest, the rest being sold for a long time.
Owners of gardens, landscaped gardeners, Particuliers.
They came from everywhere and carried everything that could enter the trunk and the trailers.
The scandal stones of Stuttgart have long been transformed into "Mauerle" or the limits of grass strips.
"In fact, this stone is nothing special," said Mr. Rongen.
"it was this political component."
He enters his car all over the country, turns his vast empire of 20 hectares.
He did legal studies that he had abandoned, and later he started to study biology before taking an interest in computer science and eventually becoming a career.
And a stone amateur.
The stock of 40000 tonnes.
He collects his treasures all over Germany.
He claims that he is the greatest merchant of ancient stones.
He's getting cold.
Sand stones carved with art are placed on the snow.
"At the same time, they were part of the Marienbrücke bridge in Dresden."
Elbsandstein, yellow, hot, say it with enthusiasm.
"My favorite stone."
He's on his way up through the forest.
It shows a bag of fingers: Peter of red sand, previously part of the Karlsruhe station.
And so on.
"Feel the travertine."
The parallel piper was thus part of the Neckarstadium Neckarstadium in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow of stones and stories, the crossing of Cannstatt from the police prefecture, the red granite from the Holy Blasien Cathedral, the tuft from the hospital of Heilbronn.
What a work, what an effort, what a sweat!
When Mr. Rongen thinks that since the stones were carved by hand and moved by simple coats and carts pulled by cattle, he becomes quite respectful.
"It would be a scandal if such a heritage were set up."
He didn't become rich, even less rich.
But this career today employs 14 people. In addition, stone cutters, a sculptor, a forgeron, a glass blower and a gardener were installed in the forest.
"We work hard, but it's gratifying," says the waste recycler.
Next time, he has to go to Cologne.
There are also stones to save.
Fighting talent to win the high potential
The counter knows a living fluency.
16 students go shopping for small bread in the salmon, tomato sauce and white food.
The technical university of Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Volkswagen invited students in design and mechanical engineering to a workshop.
As part of a kind of competition of ideas, they need to talk professionally about the car of the future with the designers of VW, and, passing through, know the company Volkswagen.
Today, many companies do not hesitate to go to the body in the competition for better brain damage and to engage, like Volkswagen, in multiform cooperation with universities.
Their mission: Recruit the most qualified graduates as far as possible in the amphitheaters before they arrive on the employment market and are not courted by others.
And since universities do not publish statements on the performance of their students, we try to detect exceptional talents in practical projects and to trust them.
On the second day of the workshop organized at the technical university of Brauschweig, the automotive group modulates the talents.
A young lady in the staff service shares styles, bonuses and cards with the Volkswagen logo.
She talks about the timetable for professional internships and student jobs for young talent; she shows them the ways to access the group's presence.
It is Nico Selle of Braunschweig Technical University who is responsible for the project undertaken with Volkswagen.
For him, there are mutual benefits for both sides: "Students come into contact with this industrial sector and gain experience."
"As for the Volkswagen group, he can get to know the students, look closer to the serious candidates and appreciate those who are online as collaborators."
According to Mr. Selle, such cooperation is unusual.
What's new is the offensive we're trying to attract students.
"At the same time, the focus was on the professional project," says Mr. Selle.
The fight for the conquest of new graduates will be much closer.
In the sector's goods, companies can no longer recruit their employees by making a trio on a candidates' Cyrillic.
But they must boast of their reliability and, above all, courtesy of highly qualified labour.
These are especially the graduates from the engineering branches who are in an excellent position to negotiate.
According to the association of German VDI engineers, more than 40,000 engineering positions remained unoccupied in October.
And according to VDI's forecasts, the gap in engineering positions will continue to increase.
Roman Dykta goes after talent for KPMG, audit office, accounting expertise and advice.
It organizes expensive events aimed at recruiting talent, such as the KPMG-Race cruise race, a type of paper rally where competitors need to find their way through GPS coordinates.
The company will send eight promising students next year to travel in this way to the United States.
Participants can easily visit KPMG's branches and know the company.
The person who is required to participate shall decide in advance after two selection procedures.
Only the cream cream of many candidates will flow to the United States.
According to Mr. Dykta, the means used for seeking higher potentials in universities are becoming more and more important.
"We want to get out of the lot through the cruise race."
"To us, a simple cruise was too little."
For the talent hunter who is Mr. Dykta, the account seems to be there.
"To this day, we have remained in touch with all those who took part in a similar action last year."
"Some of them are about to finish their studies and want to send their requests to our company soon," he said.
Apart from direct clearance in the campus, small and medium-sized enterprises are doing everything in their classic way by participating in professional fairs where they are being hunted for their brains.
"We try to reach graduates by participating in the professional salons."
"For example, in the solar technology room," says Ms. Sitha Stübe, Director of Human Resources at Solarworld, who manufactures photovoltaic panels.
This company is located in Bonn employs about 1500 people in Germany.
Ms. Stübe was aware of the problem associated with the problem.
Currently, 35 posts are submitted to the competition on the company's website.
"At this point, it is very difficult to have vacant posts."
"The cost is expensive and takes a lot of time," he says.
Another way to establish contact is to pass through university professors.
Solarworld has established cooperation with various higher education institutions, such as the University of Fribourg.
"The professors indicate that the student has the opportunity to do professional exercises or write his final study project at our home."
Honorable advertising campaigns are announced among solar specialists.
This is why the company is trying to make its advertising by exercising other qualities: personalized environment, flat hierarchy and easy communication.
"Sometimes a large group can't do that," says Ms. Stübe, head of staff.
Long ago, money no longer plays a major role in job search.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good promotion opportunities are the other determining factors.
According to a study conducted by the Institute Great Place to Work, Solarworld occupies 55th among the top 100 employers in Germany.
The Institute is an annual honour table of German employers.
To this end, he questioned employees about their degree of satisfaction with regard to their work and their context while looking at employees' framework conditions.
The head of staff, Ms. Stübe, hopes that this investment will increase the image of society among job seekers.
"I think that the candidates refer to external evaluations in relation to a potential employer," she said.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the German Academy DEBA (Deutscher Employer Branding Academy, DEBA) advises companies who want to build a good reputation as an employer by applying a long-term strategy.
He advises his clients to show more authenticity.
And, according to Mr Kriegler, this means first of all taking internal action.
"The best way for an employer to become attractive is to go through his own collaborators," he says.
This is called, according to the jargon used in the sector, the internal image strategy, i.e. the creation of the employer's brand image within its own actual.
"the satisfied collaborators form the best messengers."
When dealing well with his employees and they identify themselves with the company, they make only their employer's publicity to their friends and knowledge.
"It's like playing in an orchestra," says Mr. Kriegler.
Obama brakes new oil drilling
There will be no new oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico along the coast of Florida, the state of the south-east of the United States, in the coming years.
The Washington Government has issued a ban on an equivalent ban and has thus definitively annulled its initial plans.
Even beyond the Atlantic coast, new drilling remains for the time being prohibited.
The Secretary of Interior Ken Salazar made this announcement on Wednesday.
It is the explosion in April of the Deepwater Horizon drilling platform, which is the source of this strict ban, which must remain in force for at least the next five years.
With regard to this accident, which cost 11 employees their lives and leads to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, who was under pressure from the opposition and this sector of activity, had indicated that he was willing to authorize new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
The participants in this solution want to reduce the dependence of the United States on foreign countries on oil supplies.
The question of the responsibility of the devastating black tide in the Gulf is not, to this day, definitively resolved.
The British oil group, which faces claims for compensation of several billion, is at the centre of the charges.
A committee of inquiry established by Obama must present its findings during December.
In October, the Secretary of Interior Ken Salazar had lifted the ice from the hole decreed after the explosion of the platform.
Following this decision, various oil groups had immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With more stringent controls and more severe safety signals, Obama and Salazar want to prevent a new catastrophe.
The competent supervisory authority, which has discredited itself after many corruption charges, is currently subject to deep reform.
At the same time, Mr. Obama announced that they would eliminate the profitable tax niches of gas and oil groups.
Activists in this sector are now publicly warning against the fact that the flow of food in the Gulf would be significantly lower than it has been so far.
"The aim of the government is to put a stop to the rapid growth of the gas and oil sector" according to the results of a current survey carried out in the sector by the BDO audit firm before the ban on drilling issued on Wednesday.
Furthermore, the American Energy Alliance deplores the uncertainty that characterizes this sector: "No one knows exactly what will change with regulation."
Investments in new support projects have been postponed to new order, to the detriment of growth.
The country of Ogoni is dry
The water flowing into the rivers is brown; it smells similar to that in the fuel station: Because of a runoff, billions of litres of crude oil have destroyed the country of Ogoni in Nigeria.
Men live in the fields of aviation, corruption and oil refining.
Celestine Akpobari has a good intention.
"Don't get exhausted," the environmentalist campaigner throws at journalists to calm them down: "You still have enough oil bubbles in front of the water lens."
The 37-year-old Nigerian tried to photograph a young man immersed in the boiling water up to his chest, as well as the fat train that surrounds him: this scene seems almost beautiful in the glass of water at the colour of the rainbow.
We can't see that the ground floor is filled with brown crude oil nappes.
On the shores of the Bodo-Jetti River, Esther Badom reports that, therefore, she collected shrimps by whole seals here.
But in the meantime calm waters have completely tari.
Five years ago, an enormous amount of oil fell from an oil pipeline that had exploded into the huge marquesa.
Fishermen living in the small nearby town of Bodo must now return for six hours to reach the fishy waters: The country of Ogoni located in the heart of the Niger Delta is considered one of the most polluted regions in the world.
The entire extent of the ravages jumps into the eye as you pass through the mangrove marshes through watercourses.
Instead of a clear water, the motorboat pours a brown grading water. Whoever dives his hand in it removes any oil cover.
The roots of small mangroves emerge from the ground as a control rod. The isolated palm trees leave their palms hanging sadly.
We are looking for birds' nests, as we usually meet them in wet areas: If the offboard engine stops, a fantastic silence lies on this paradise of times that looks like a service station by the smell it smells.
"What is happening here is a war against the environment," says Mr. Celestine Akpobari of a sad air: "Our life is characterized by a permanent danger to health."
The comparison of wars is made.
The region where the Ogoni live is a battlefield occupied for decades: more than 60 years ago, the first European explorers entered here; the first resistance was organized in the 1980s by author Ken Saro-Wiwa. He was later executed. In 1993, the Shell Group had to interrupt its production activities in that region because they had become very dangerous to its employees.
Today, the return to Ogoni country is prohibited to this company: While more than 2 million black gold barrels are pumped daily thanks to more than 5,000 drilling wells and 7,000 kilometers of oil pipelines throughout the Delta region, three times as large as Switzerland, the oil fields in Ogoni country are unexploited, because the situation is too unstable for this oil group.
All a few hundred meters stand up in the water of steel drills as strange sculptures: The heads of drilling holes are deeply affected by "Christmas trees".
They are up to 50 years old, most of them are torn by corrosion up to the reference.
Akpobari considers that a drilling head of this nature breaks down from time to time in pieces, because a constant flow of crude oil flows into the water.
According to experts estimates, more than two billion litres have collapsed on the ecosystem in 50 years: Every year, the amount of oil equivalent to that that took place at sea during the "Exxon Valdez" super-oil accident 21 years ago outside Alaska, one of the greatest environmental disasters in the history of humanity.
Who should bear responsibility for persistent environmental pollution? The answer to this question divides the actors.
For the Shell group, the sabotage and syphonation of oil pipelines are responsible for more than 90 per cent of pollution. Environmentalists consider the explosions of drilling heads and perforated oil pipelines as the main causes.
In 2008, American researcher Richard Steiner appealed to the Shell Group to apply Nigeria's safety standards much less stringent than anywhere else in the world: Only the rate of failure of conduct is "even higher than then".
Some forms emerge from mangroves to a place that, in view of the distance, resembles an abandoned workshop, full of camouflage and installed in the open air: they are completely naked and covered with camouflage up to the neck.
A sparking fire under one of the many tunnels that are both connected to the tubes, both scattered without cause on the site must be detected: a small clandestine refinery.
The crude oil is heated in the tunnel for several hours, explains Michael, the team leader.
In the first time, the fuel penetrates into a container by passing through tubes, then at the end of the lead of kerosene drops falls and finally it is obtained from diesel.
This is how Michael and his four employees produce four 300 litre Diesel barrels daily: "It reports 34,000 Naira", approximately $22.
Delta residents take advantage of the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil-producing country in black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
Illegal refiners can sell at a price less expensive than the ridiculously low 40 cents of Euro per litre of Diesel: because they purchase their raw material free of charge.
It is offered by the "protectors" who are putting the oil pipelines on the ground across the country of Ogoni. According to experts, the country thus loses at least 16 million litres of crude oil throughout the Niger Delta.
Only a small part of the raw material temporarily stored is illegally cleaned: The organized crime networks that are also among its high-ranking politicians and military members, charge the lion's share in tanks and the bradden on the world market.
The militant Akpobari considers that the debate on whether to attribute environmental disasters or, rather, subversive activities to the population or the lexist mode of production is purely academic.
"If oil companies were not perceived as intruders and if the foundations of the fishers' lives were not so deeply destroyed, there would be no sabotage, no flight and illegal refineries."
But, in the meantime, Ogoni's relations with Shell were so much worse that it was only the group's withdrawal. "Perhaps operators with other nationalities, like the Chinese, will be doing better."
So Michael gets nervous.
"It's a long time for you to get rid of" announces the robust oil worker.
"Soldiers can appear at any time."
If the illegal refiners are surprised by the special units of the armed forces, they will certainly not be the subject of arrest, but at the most they will offer them pot-wines.
Even soldiers from the northern part of the country will be able to benefit as well as all Nigerians from the raw material.
"At any rate, this trick has caused our country to fall well down," says Akpori.
Investigators discover construction failures in A380 reactors
The A380 is obviously suffering from a major security problem.
By examining an emergency landing device, the investigators discovered a possible construction failure that could lead to "the reactor's catastrophic failure."
The air carrier Qantas now wants to bring a complaint against the reactor manufacturer.
At the beginning of November, Airbus passengers belonging to the company Quantas had apparently had a greater chance: During the investigation carried out, the Australian Air Safety Authority found that the reactors of certain A380 devices had a serious safety problem, and it warned against a possible construction failure.
This potential failure could lead to serious consequences: it can cause fatigue and leakages at the level of connection of the oil pipeline, is indicated in a position taken this Thursday by the administration of the ATSB.
It could have led to a "catastrophe of reactors".
The reactors manufactured by Rolls-Royce and equipped with 20 aircraft from the A380 series are concerned.
The airbus of the company Quantas, which had to land urgently on 4 November in Singapore, is among them.
The Australian airline has now initiated judicial proceedings against the English reactor manufacturer.
She filed a judicial complaint with an Australian federal court based in Sydney, which allows her to take other legal measures against society.
The manager of Quantas, Mr. Alan Joyce, said that his company would claim damages for the incident at the beginning of November.
Parts have been removed and the wearer surface has been damaged during the engine fire.
According to Rolls-Royce, it is oil inflammation that is the source of damage.
After this incident, at least 40 reactors must now be replaced in the world.
Australian investigators announced that other safety tests will be carried out on superjumbos that are also equipped with the reactors in question.
The security recommendations are the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said ASTB spokesperson Martin Dolan.
The security problem is considered important enough to inform all parties concerned.
After the emergency landing of his plane, the air carrier Quantas had immobilized the entire fleet of A380 for a week.
Singapore Airlines temporarily immobilized three of its eleven A380.
Lufthansa replaced, as a precaution, the reactor of an A380.
The two-storey plane is the world's largest line plane.
The fall of snow on the whole territory causes chaos in transport
Germany all over white: In one night, snow fell on almost all the country.
Chaos reigns on all roads, trains and planes are immobilized.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
Winter makes Germany grueling: By glacial temperatures, almost the whole Republic is covered with snow on Thursday night, leading to chaos in many places.
In the north and east, the snow cover reaches 15 centimeters per place.
Traffic is severely restricted on several motorways and many roads.
Of the national A7 in Flensburg, winter service staff worked permanently, but they were unable to finish the snow that kept up.
In addition, rapists have danced the coast of the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Bureau for Maritime Navigation and Hydrography (DSH) expects that the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein with water levels can reach 1.2 metres above normal.
The snowflakes on highways and on federal roads have caused serious problems in Saxony.
That is why the Weathermedia Bad Time Alert Center announced the level of violet alert was announced in the Saxon Switzerland: in fact, it is the highest level.
By places, it fell 30 centimeters of fresh snow that the strong winds and fresh winds scattered.
Several trucks and cars were stuck there at night.
Even in the Saxe-Anhalt country, police authorities have reported serious road disturbances.
On motorway A2, snow and wind caused a disruption of traffic and caused noise.
In Thuringia, snowfalls affected motorways A4 and A9.
According to the Deutscher Bahn, serious rail traffic disturbances took place in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are snowing on the railways, falling trees on the railways, the catheters or the damaged needles.
In Saxony, interregional transport was interrupted by Leipzig-Nuremberg.
In Salfeld, Thuringia, an ICE train to Munich had to stop its journey.
Firefighters and paramedics had to provide the 165 passengers on the train with blankets, food and drinks.
Snow winds blew the roads.
The snowflakes have led to many flight cancellations in the main airports of Germany.
According to a standard password and flight information, some cancellations are already announced in Munich.
A spokesman for Fraport indicates that 40 flights have already been cancelled in Frankfurt on Main.
The winter service provides a permanent service.
It is true that the passengers at the airport are no longer numerous, although almost 400 beds are made available.
Accidents occurred on many roads on Wednesday afternoon.
On the night of Ostholstein, a truck driver lost his life during a collision with a train at a level crossing.
The train driver was slightly injured.
Due to the snowfalls on the roads, a similar accident occurred not far from Nuremberg: even here, a truck was hit at a level crossing because the vehicle was immobilized there.
The driver lost his life.
Four passengers were injured in the train, which is why the road from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was closed until morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died when her car crashed on a sliding shoe in Aschapenburg.
However, meteorologists announce a good news: snow will always be soft and dusty, but it will turbulence in the case of light rafts.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea will be affected by violent and fast winds.
However, it is very cold, up to 15 degrees per place.
The Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twins.
The deutsche Bank seeks to separate itself from its emblem: According to the information reported by newspapers, this financial institution seeks out buyers for its two office buildings located at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
This building could report up to EUR 500 million.
The Deutsche Bank has just decorated the headquarters of the group: The twin towers located in the Business Quarter have been modernized; pending, the bankers had to return to their former place of service.
Dorénavant, the financial group is obviously seeking to recover the costs of renovations and it is looking for a buyer for its two buildings, as the newspaper "Financial Times Deutschland", quoted as a spokesperson.
This spokesperson did not indicate the reasons for the proposed sale.
He said, "We check whether it is more interesting to take care of the buildings themselves or sell them, and reinstate them later."
This is how Germany's largest financial institution has already given up its seat, shortly after.
It was only in the middle of 2007 that the bank had acquired the twins for an amount of EUR 272 million from the holders of own funds, and they were then rehabilitated.
The energy optimization transformations amounted to approximately EUR 200 million, according to some indications.
A sale obviously reported a lot of money to the bank.
According to the information provided by the newspaper, experts in this business sector estimate the value of the tours, which were rebaptised in the meantime "Green Tours", at approximately Euro 500 million.
According to the spokesperson, it is currently not known whether the buildings will be resold to a bank-owned fund or an independent investor.
Thousands of people are crying to the missing minors.
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people had an idea for the displaced minors who were declared dead as a result of several explosions in a mine.
The safety situation of the sinister well continued to be alarmed.
Just two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred at Pike River Mine near the town of Greymouth.
29 minors between the ages of 17 and 62 had been raised on the ground.
A probe had been introduced into the sintered well, but no trace of survivors had been found.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and other explosions that followed, no relief teams were able to descend into the mine for security reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and the administration considered that minors had no chance of surviving.
Until here the bodies could not be repaired.
Today, parents and friends have organized a celebration in memory of the dead.
Thousands of people had gathered under a sun blowing in Greymouth south of the New Zealand island.
They noticed two minutes of silence.
In memory of the 29 minors assembled, 29 tables were installed on which names, helmets and lamps could be seen.
The photos and personal effects, including the clothes and surfboards, were also present.
The flagships have been laid before all public buildings in the country.
New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told participants at the commemorative party that New Zealand had given hope that the minors would return to the surface.
"But they never came home."
Mr. Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was stabbed in the pits, said that he could not refuse to accept the death of his son until he had seen his remains.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the victims' parents, several foreign diplomats participated in the commemorative party.
Minors of South African and British origin were also collected during the first explosion on 19 November.
Succorists began to light a fire inside the South Island coal mine in New Zealand.
Police chief Gary Knowles explained to journalists that when the mass of explosive gases is moved, the burning temperatures inside the mine are beginning to fall.
Go to hell, warrior!
Is Splatter an artificial film?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn explores the limits of the old genre through his film, "Wallala Rising", the epoch of the fighter.
To what public did the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn well think by turning "Wallala Rising"?
A warrior Viking (Mads Mikkelsen) has only one eye made captive; he is released from his burrow and, with an almost supernatural force, eliminates his opponents one after another. This seems ideal for young men's spectators seeking a bloody action, just because our hero uses brutal methods of murder. When he is a bad humour, he pulls the intestines of his enemies without waiting for them to die.
On the other hand, until the end of the film, the citizen does not say a word on his real name. Even the other characters escape, at the top of one or two sentences, some exuberable screams of agony.
Otherwise, we don't say anything and celebrate in the incredibly beautiful mountain landscape of Scotland, which is the decoration of the Vikings' universe, about a thousand years ago.
It would be more ideal for mature filmmakers with an interest in existentialism and excellent travels.
When a film aims at several target groups, it is a pity that these groups are mutually excluded.
The director Winding Refn is considered, since the release of "Pusher", his trilogy regarding the Faroche and full-style drug dealer, as a kind of Danish Quantin Tarantinon, but he refuses to bring a little bit more humor to the dominant current or introduce a little less brutality to the art and test cinema.
Most art cinema sympathizers must experience horror in the face of the brain that spreads around and into the intestines.
Lovers of action films die in boredom, when the village gets on board, for reasons that can be freely interpreted, with a group of violent Christian missionaries in a ship destined for Jerusalem; they are drowned for eternity by the calm and noise before the crew arrives in America and continues to grumble.
It is not surprising, then, that "Wallala Rising" did not find any film distributor in Germany and that it exists only in DVD format.
It is mainly because of the magnificent images of the misery that have earned some attention, but also because the image of a film striking, from time to time, hides behind a pretentious and bloody appearance.
It is not dialogue in this film, nor a coherent action, all is ambiance, a feverish dream transformed into a film.
The viewer can't escape.
Refn gives him hardly a moment of relaxation and slowly cuts his throat with glacial images and a lubrous sound band, but especially with an unsatisfied hate that gnaws from the heart of characters.
Only a young blond boy, who faithfully stands beside the castle, preserves some innocence, all others are animated by anger.
Above all, the bourgeois hero whose mobiles are never known, but who comes back from hell at any time to fight enemies and provisionally allies by becoming warriors, may be sent by the Devil himself.
It represents the upheaval, but perhaps also, nothing but for those who are, in any way, able.
"Wallala Rising" is an enigmatic film that can be hated or admired, which for the sake of passion, enthusiasm and surprise.
A traumatic experience.
Mysteryal landscaping work
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has new indications regarding a nuclear programme developed by Syria.
But this country refuses to take a stand on this issue, even less to submit to the agency's controls.
On the night of 5-6 September 2007 to midnight, at least four Israeli fighter F-15 I aircraft attacked a mysterious cubic shape building in the Syrian territory.
It is located on the shore of the Euphrates; the largest city nearby is 30 kilometres: it is Dair as-Sur.
Its name is found in the IAEA documents because it is the question of the reactor that Syria has built with the help of North Korea in a stone parallel pipeline, in a valley marked by the absence of electric current.
According to a United States briefing on information services, the CIA, dated April 2008, would be well qualified to produce plutonium, the current reactor known as the nearby locality, El Kibar, which would allow the manufacture of nuclear weapons.
On the other hand, this technique has been valid since the 1950s.
The CIA has shown a presentation video containing soft satellite images.
Through computer-aided animation, it indicated the likely location of each reactor component before the destruction of the power plant, which represents a miniature copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
In addition, she presented the photos showing the nearby building, even the inside of the building.
It seems that the reactor was about to be put into service, but it was not yet equipped with fuel bars.
Today, more than three years after the Israeli bombing, we have barely more information than at the time, and even, over time, the mystery is becoming more and more widespread.
The former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memories that prior to the attack, the CIA was certain that Syria had built a reactor to El Kibar, but had little evidence showing that the country had developed "an active nuclear weapons program".
Some information agents in Europe prefer to be more cautious about this and speak only of a "presumptuous reactor", even though they consider the CIA's presentation as "pleasable".
They lack tangible evidence, as well as the IAEA.
Inquired about the way in which he made sure that he had dealt with a nuclear reactor, a high-ranking United Nations diplomat gave only a laconic answer in the summer, claiming that the IAEA had " enough documents to ask questions".
The Syrians must have rushed away the ruins of the "unused military building" and made a methodical landing of the land.
However, in June 2008, an IAEA team of experts led by former Chief Inspector Oli Heinonen, discovered in El Kibar traces of uranium produced by men.
In addition, the IAEA has received from a Member State images of commercial suppliers' satellites showing the moment that directly followed the attack. It appears that the latter are more eloquent than those presented by the CIA.
However, these photos are not available on the market because the anonymous commander, perhaps Israel, acquired them exclusively.
It is therefore impossible for the IAEA to establish their authenticity objectively.
Syria has always ensured that it has never carried out a secret atomic program and that it has not built a reactor.
Damas argues that uranium found on the site comes from weapons used by Israel.
But the IAEA rejected this argument after analysis of the particles by qualifying it as infrable.
Since then, Damas has refused any discussion about this, as well as about satellite images.
Furthermore, Syria does not allow the controllers to carry out a second inspection on the El Kibar site and refuses access to the wreckage of the building destroyed by the bomb.
But even Israel keeps silent.
Confirming the official position, Ehud Olmert, then Prime Minister in exercise at the time of the attack, recently stated: "We will never make any comments on this".
This is how the investigation into this case has taken place since June 2008 without a result being achieved and that it "becomes increasingly a serious credibility problem of the Agency", as recognized by a high-ranking Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna, it is finally a serious violation of the nuclear-weapon-ban treaty.
The IAEA considers that in order to make progress, it is necessary to clarify the existence of the three other installations that must have "a functional relationship" with the alleged reactor.
To date, inspectors have not indicated what facilities they are here, what their function is, or what they are suspected of being.
According to the information published by the newspaper "Süddeutsche Zeitung", they are known within the IAEA under the names of Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandarayah, respectively, as neighboring cities.
Washington's Independent Institute for Science and International Security (International Institute of Science and International Security) identified these sites and discovered on satellite images a complex near Masyaf that would most likely be one of the suspects.
It is possible that it is located in a military base or directly beside it; that is exactly why Syria refuses access to the three sites to IAEA inspectors.
In Vienna, it is said that the Syrians argue that the inspection group is actually spies who would be sent on behalf of the United States by IAEA to spy on military facilities.
In fact, it was information provided by US secret agents that drew the attention of nuclear inspectors.
The IAEA has information, including satellite photos, indicating that vehicles have made shuttles between the three sites and the parallel stone pipe in order to transport substances.
A high-ranking Western diplomat said in Vienna that at least one of the facilities could "use fuel production".
There would be "no indication of sensitive activities", such as the enrichment and treatment of uranium; processes that are essential to the production of nuclear weapons.
This type of reactor certainly works through unenriched uranium.
However, there is a rigidity of plausible assumptions regarding the following fundamental issues: where uranium should have come from and where the plutonium needed for the manufacture of the bomb would have been separated later.
It is ignored whether the engravings, which could hide high-value traces, have been stored in the three sites.
When hundreds of earth trucks have disappeared, no one will have any information on the location of the gravitational storage.
For the IAEA, it is unlikely that Syria had examined al-Tibni salt mine in 1998, located only a few kilometres from El-Kibar, on the other side of the Euphrates, to see if it could be suitable for the storage of radioactive waste.
By recently analyzing photos taken by satellite on behalf of the famous Jane's Intelligence Review magazine, the former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley has established a link between them and the reactor in question.
However, satellite photos show that Syria has undertaken landing work in the three suspicious sites and has moved huge containers when the IAEA began requiring access to these sites.
It may be a coincidence, but it has not contributed to the avoidance of suspicion.
It says in the diplomatic environment that the IAEA has spent several months preparing a plan on the inspections to be carried out. This plan should allow Syria to preserve any military secrets. Only the investment time shows how much interest the inspectors have in this case.
During this time, Damascus also ended this proposal.
A year ago, if Western diplomats in Vienna had not reported the destruction of the reactor, the emergency would not be reported in this case, for example, Glyn Davies, the US ambassador who has been referring to the special inspections for several months, one of the most powerful means available to the Atomic Agency to carry out its controls.
The Director of the IAEA, Yukiya Amano, who had to propose these inspections, has certainly already spoken of "an option to which I am open in the future", but he is still reluctant.
This means a huge risk: on the one hand, it requires a majority in the IAEA Board of Governors and a large number of the 35 countries that are represented there have no desire to see the situation of escalation.
on the other hand, like this diplomat who gives thought, "Would it be useful if they finally found nothing"
Love in Wartime
It's been bad ever since Angelina Jolie made her debut in summer as a realist.
She wrote the scenario herself: it is a story of love between a woman originating in Bosnia and a man of Serbian origin.
There's nothing more to know about this story, but that's enough to cause trouble.
A persistent rumor indicates that the Muslim woman fell in love with her Serbian drunk during the war in Yugoslavia.
Bosniak women's federations immediately protested. In response, some of the shooting sequences planned in Sarajevo were moved in the last minute to Hungary.
Meanwhile, the film was directed in Hungary, but in the post-production phase, protests continue in Bosnia.
According to information published in a Bosnian newspaper, Bakira Hasecic of the organization of war-victim women addressed Angelina Jolie through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and requested to meet the actress. Jolie herself is an ambassador of UNHCR.
She is not a diplomat. A few weeks ago, she proposed to these women to meet them in Hungary, but they declined this offer.
"The meeting must be held in Bosnia," says Hasecic.
There have been no love stories in the concentration camps, and Jolie's scenario says long enough about his attitude towards the victims.
The Guardian reports that Hasecic ' s organization subsequently recommended to the United Nations High Commissioner for the Quality of Goodwill Embassy in Angelina Jolie.
But in fact, what kind of scenario did Jolie write?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which received copies of its script, granted a tour permit to Sarajevo after a few hesitations, but we do not know why it did not then come.
The young author herself ensures that she does not pursue political goals with her film, which is by making a lot of effort that she has become aware of the Yugoslav conflict. She maintains that she wants to exert the terrible consequences of the war and to give all parties the opportunity to express themselves.
However, it remains vague about the content.
This is how a second synopsis of the film circulates on the Net. It is quite different: Lovers knew well before the beginning of the war. They meet again when the woman, a Bosnian Muslim, is deported to the Serbian concentration camp where the man works as a guard.
Which is still a big difference with the version "a victim of rape falls in love with his bull."
That Jolie's film started well before the war, of course.
The pressure exerted on her, as Jolie says, is "injustice and based on wrong information".
Now, only Hollywood fans can find peace: By illegally putting this scenario into the Net, as many others have before.
Let's get out of here!
Tonight, everything goes well again with the Irish.
no trace of concentration.
That is why the local team is overdominating visitors from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
Fans shout with joy at the bottom of a strong music, they shake their feet.

Cian Tanner is a quiet individual; this subtle drinking game and the computerist reserved, these two behaviors are really not going well together.
And yet, the 26-year-old man seeks to have fun, to turn away from the terrible issue, which will result in the future.
The pleasure of playing in Las Vegas is not included in its projects. In January, he will conduct recruitment interviews in New Zealand.
"I'm trying a strange feeling, however," he says.
"The country is so far away and I don't have a job."
Finally: Her girlfriend is already waiting for her in Auckland, "at least two, she has done her desired job as an event project manager, perhaps a good sign," said the young man smiling.
Because of the country's dark perspectives, two of Tanner's three sisters tried their chance abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, lives in Sydney, and his brother Colin now serves as an IT consultant in London.
Young people go: The situation of most families living on the island is similar to that of tanners.
Experts from the Institute of Economic and Social Research indicate that 100,000 Irish people will soon leave their country.
They even provide for a number of 200,000 migrants by 2015.
This represents a huge loss for a small country of 4.5 million people.
If these forecasts are fulfilled, it will be a similar rate of emigration to that which Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of economic boom in which the Irish enjoyed great relief, sorrow now takes its place.
However, the economic crisis is particularly affecting Irish young people, well-trained, who have so far only known moments of happiness.
The loss of employment and social unemployment seemed absurd in the years of economic boom.
Everyone had a job, there's money in excess.
But, in the meantime, three people under thirty years of age are unemployed.
The Irish Times newspaper publishes a lot of readers' letters written by young immigrants, who complain: "In Ireland, everything goes away."
"There should be an upsurge against politicians and bankers, but the one who has the opportunity, goes along with our country for a whole generation."
"The last one to leave the light."
The law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Students' Union, sees a darker future because the government does nothing but throw dust at the eyes and offers no prospect of the future for young people.
"They reduce minimum wages, but they have no strategy to create new jobs," says a 20-year-old student.
She sees her friends crash from a practical internship not paid to another.
She states that her greatest concern is to emigrate herself in four years.
"It's a sad and depressing thought."
However, men like Stephen McLarnnon try to address this issue positively.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo" hall, which offers full support on the theme "Working abroad".
"But working abroad is an extraordinary opportunity for new people in the profession to take the first steps in the stages of the professional hierarchy," he said.
Its website shows photos of surfers in Australia and snow surfers in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not a gallery, but it also guarantees freedom and pleasure.
For six months, Seán O'Donovan has known what it means to be based elsewhere.
As there was nothing else to do in Ireland for this 29-year-old engineer, he is now working with 15 Irish colleagues in the construction sector in Germany.
A fashion house is just off the ground in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he will continue to work on other Hannovre or Berlin projects.
Meanwhile, O'Donovan rarely visits his home country because he participates in an additional job in order to be able to complete the loan he has contracted to build his home in the country.
"The situation is already a little tough," he says by breaking the threshold of his house for the first time after a long time.
"I earn money in Germany to build a house in Ireland where I don't live practically anymore."
It bursts with a smile that's embarrassed by passing through the cold rooms.
The small house is located in a residential area with well maintained front gardens, expensive large brands cars are parked on access roads.
Four years ago, O'Donovan bought the house together with his sister for an amount of 380,000 euros, financed 100 percent by the credit.
"There were moments of madness, no doubt the money was easy," he said.
Is he afraid to see everything collapse because of the credit?
O'Donovan thinks for a moment, recalls hot tea and says, "I don't have children to entertain and I'm young; even everything goes through, I can go to zero."
The building engineer does not like the complaints he often hears in recent times.
"No one should suffer from hunger, our situation is not as dramatic as what we once lived here on the island," he says.
"Working abroad for a while, that's not what can get worse, maybe that's what makes us feel Irish first.
He then laughs and talks about his father who went to England during the last great economic crisis.
"He was back after he had spent seven years there and, in Ireland, life continued, simply."
This idea please Cyan Tanner.
Leave the future and discover how life goes elsewhere.
In his palm trees, he has already had a few years of work in London. That is why life must not be so easy in New Zealand for him and his girlfriend.
But there is still one thing that worries you well these last days: the festival to be held on the occasion of its 27th anniversary in Dublin.
He's afraid she can't turn into a goodbye party.
"Only, not much emotion," he says by drinking a long gorge of beer.
"A good-bye, it seems all the same worrying."
"Let's call it an evening of goodbye, all relaxed, bringing some friends together, with some drinks and some games."
The Democratic Routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to increase, as did the support for private enterprise.
Crime has become more worrying than unemployment.
And Brazil is seen as more influential than the United States in much of the region.
These are some of the conclusions of the last Latinobarometer survey taken in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
As the survey has been conducted on a regular basis since 1995, it has followed changes in attitudes in the region.
Two related elements are the results of this year's survey, carried out in September and early October.
The first is the fairly sunny mood of Latin America.
The second is the growing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased significantly in several countries around the South American Pacific (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has reached an average of 6% per year since 2002, support for democracy has increased from at least 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It has also increased in Mexico, where the economy has recovered after a strong decline in production last year.
However, only about half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the region, are convinced Democrats, reducing the regional average (see Table 2).
Some 44 per cent of the region's respondents expressed satisfaction with the way their country's democracy worked in practice; this was the same as last year but with a strong increase of 25 per cent in 2001 (Graph 3).
Some 34% said that they had confidence in their country's Parliament and 45% in their government, the same as last year in both cases; but they grew sharply compared to 2003 (17% and 24% respectively).
Ten years ago, economic problems in Latin America broke down support for democracy.
If this has been good during the global financial crisis, it is certainly due to the fact that many countries in the United States have suffered only a brief recession and have received a strong recovery.
In addition, a social security network has helped to protect the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty increased only slightly in 2009 and decreased again this year to 32 per cent.)
But the mood varies considerably from country to country (see Figure 4).
Brazil's good economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, translates into a widely shared sense of progress
What is more rare in Mexico and Central America where recession has been more severe and violent crimes have worsened.
It is only for the second time since the survey began that more respondents across Latin America as a whole have cited crime rather than unemployment as the most important problem for their countries (see Table 5).
Some 31% say that they or one of their relatives have been the victim of a criminal act during the past year; however, this figure is down by 38% last year and is the lowest since 1995.
More robust economic performance is reflected in the increase in support for the private enterprise and the market economy: approximately 71% of the region's respondents say the private enterprise is essential for development, compared with 56% in 2007 (see Figure 6).
Some 58% believe that the market economy is the only system that will make their country developed, compared with 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents to Venezuela are of this opinion (and 80% support the private company); although their left-wing president, Hugo Chavez, is expropriating many private companies.
Brazil is the largest manor in the region, mentioned by 19% of respondents (18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged compared to last year) and Venezuela (9%, down by 11% since last year)
But the United States is considered to be the country most influenced by respondents in Mexico and most of Central America, while Venezuela enjoys this distinction in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Attenuated vote
No one was expected to have perfect general elections in Haiti on 28 November.
But it was far worse than the visitors who wanted to help the country sintered and drowned in fear.
Voting boxes and a new ballot were presented, ballot papers distributed in the cupboards, desiccant polling offices and intimidation
The polling stations would open late at night.
Many Haitians, including many who were displaced after the January earthquake, would be in the neighborhood to find a place to vote.
Some of them ended up abandoning.
A dozen presidential candidates, including a number of alleged supporters, have denounced the fraud and have claimed the cancellation of the election.
Protests, sometimes violent, exploded across the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the senior official in Haiti of the United Nations, views the event as "a pretty good election in many respects".
Observers of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community aptly stated that they did not "believe that these irregularities, as serious as they are, had necessarily invalidated the process".
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, whose opponents are liable to René Préval, the unpopular president, and his candidate, Jude Célestin, must announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The second expected tour is scheduled for January.
All hope in the election is not lost.
The two opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rap musician, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, withdrew from their initial call for the vote to be declared null.
But there may be problems if Mr. Célestin, who has little or no perceived support in the electors, is declared by the electoral authority as having reached the second turn.
With an angry cholera epidemic, and more than 1 million survivors of the earthquake still living in tents, it was feared that participation would be.
On the occasion, many Haitians wanted to vote but were prevented from doing so because of the disorganization.
Nearly 250,000 identity cards needed to vote were not yet distributed shortly before the election.
The problem is important.
Donors see the election of a popular and legitimate government as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And so, clearly, the Haitians do it themselves.
The point of feet towards the center
The weeks after becoming suddenly widowed, Cristina Fernández, president of Argentina, benefited from a wave of public sympathy that improved her approval rate of 20 points, at more than 50%; this is her highest level since she was elected in 2007.
However, turning this into a successful second term campaign during a election next year could depend on Ms. Fernández's choice, apparently in mourning, according to which she would abandon or not the intransigence of her late husband, predecessor and former political partner, Nestor Kirchner.
And in this respect, the signs remain confused.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued to manage economic policy, even after his wife succeeded him as president, had the habit of developing budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend additional income on their own initiative.
Mrs Fernández's government lost its majority in Congress last year on paper.
But the opposition is divided, and the situation has faded into dissatisfaction following Mr. Kirchner's death from a heart attack on October 27th.
Some of the dissident members of the Peronist movement to power joined Ms. Fernández.
But after chaotic meetings (where a parliamentarian struck one of his peers on the face and others accused the government of corruption), Congress did not approve the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to argue," said the president.
Currently, the 2010 budget will be implemented next year, leaving the president an even greater margin of manoeuvre for voluntary spending.
The economy is heating heavily: it is likely to grow by almost 9% this year.
The official rate of inflation is now 11.1%, but many private estimates and union wage claims are close to 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took up his duties in 2003 when Argentina was afraid of economic collapse, made a priority of growth and poverty reduction rather than inflation control.
He refused to deal with the IMF, harassed the private sector and provided INDIC, the statistical office, which conducted falsifications of official inflation statistics.
Can Mrs Fernández now moderate these policies?
She called for talks between private companies and trade union leaders.
And its officials say they want to limit wage increases to 18% next year.
The economy was stimulated by high global prices of Argentina's agricultural exports.
Inflation, however, led to a sharp increase in growth in 2002.
That may be why Mrs Fernández shows signs of a desire to restore Argentina's financial relations to the rest of the world.
This year, the Government concluded an agreement with the obligors who had refused to re-establish the debt for which Argentina had not settled its maturity in 2001.
Now Ms Fernández looks to be edging towards an agreement with creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which it is worth some $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners have always stressed that this could not involve monitoring by the IMF, as it is customary.
But last month, Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economics, announced that the Fund would provide "technical assistance" to design a new national price index for consumption, which is similar to a prelude to the sanitation of INDIC.
It is not clear whether Mrs Fernández wants to remain in politics beyond the end of her term of office, now that her husband is no longer with her.
If she does, she needs to gain the support of the middle class, among which Kirchnerism is very protracted.
When the Argentines return from their summer vacations in Mars, the wave of sympathy for her will have reflected.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide whether or not to repudiate, without noise, many policies of her husband.
A Half-Hurra for China
Taiwanese voters are heading towards a kind of closer union with the continent.
What does Taiwan think of his older brother on the other side of the desert?
More than 7.5 million electors were presented on 27 November, or 70% of eligible persons, to elect mayors and municipal councillors in five urban districts, as part of what is considered a general assessment of the President, Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma himself became a substitute for the feelings of the continent, having established innovative business links, including a partial free trade pact, in the largest reorganization of relations with China since 1949.
Mr. I did my test, but it's all right.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) won three out of five mayors, he failed to win the majority.
Instead, the Democratic and Progressive Party (DPP), which turned to full independence of Taiwan, won almost 50% of all votes for the 45% KMT.
If it had been a presidential vote, Mr. Ma would have been in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, his party's vote fell by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP has attracted voters, even with KMT in municipal councils.
The event revealed most of the main subjects of the Taiwanese elections, including pick-up trucks and mass-assembly flags with girls who danced at least.
An attempt to commit a mysterious murder has also been carried out.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, honorary president of the KMT, held an election tour for a KMT candidate on the eve of the election.
A man from the crowd shot young Mr. Lien, just through the face, hurting him and killing a passerby.
Bizarrely, it was not determined whether the shooter wanted to hurt Mr. Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
In any case, says Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PDP, the murder had consequences on the election by leading the suspicion of the DPP and turning the voters to the KMT.
Perhaps the biggest winner of the elections was China.
It was striking how far the issue of the continental part itself was absent.
Instead, the candidates submitted plans for public housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its actual independence and hates the military threat of China.
Thus, KMT tends to avoid interfering with the Government of Beijing.
But this time, the DPP also refrained from waiting for the anti-Chinese feeling.
This is the response to a new awareness that Chinese companies are essential to Taiwan's economic survival.
Mr. Ma, for his part, claimed confirmation of whether his China policy was acceptable to the Taiwanese majority.
It can be expected that the Government of Beijing will continue to provide commercial facilities, in accordance with its strategy aimed at reducing Taiwan, from returning to Berchail.
China has not lost the time to send a negotiator to Taipei to organize a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
Of course, she would also like to see political integration; but let's start at the beginning.
It is better to wait for this after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP has reinvented itself in any way.
Two years ago, he went badly: his former boss, Chen Shui-bian, had been sent to prison for corruption charges.
From 2000 to 2008, he was a proponent for explicit independence.
But a new generation of moderates has seen the day under the leadership of Ms. Tsai and the PDP work hard to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai was greeted as a DPP candidate to the presidency, like Su Tseng-chang, who served under Mr. Chen.
Their party is doing its best to show that he can also engage with Beijing.
Ms. Tsai announced plans for a panel of experts to act as a point of contact between DPP and China, provided that their interviews could take place without preconditions.
Ms. Tsai told the Taiwanese public that her party presented a "reliable alternative" to Mr. Ma's hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems to be exasperated by this change.
In a statement issued from his cell, he stated that the candidates of the PDP would have achieved better results if they had insisted that Taiwan was a separate country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatic, not to blame the presidency.
Even without Mr. Chen's intervention, the DPP will have trouble selecting among its potential candidates.
KMT must do an introspection of itself.
Mr. Ma's assessments were weak; despite a vertigo economic growth, KMT's candidates did not want to campaign with him.
Its unpopularity seems to be largely due to unemployment and the widening of the gap between rich and poor.
A KMT spokesperson says that his cabinet and his local antennas will be replaced.
The good results of the PDP suggested that Taiwan's support for reconciliation should be limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent editorialist, "the point of no return has already passed."
Grammy Awards nominations: the jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise selected in the category "Best New Artist"
Perform at the request of a president, and people are required to learn about it.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer who was handcuffed by President Obama to perform at his Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in 2009, marked one of the Grammy Awards surprises this year with a large nomination in the category of the "best new artist".
Considering that Spalding is a well-known figure on the jazz scene since his 2008 album, "Esperanza", the nomination remains a bit mysterious but it is compatible with the Grammy Awards rules that an artist should not leave more than three albums before registration; which "establishs the public identity of this artist."
His ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", certainly marked a step forward and, given its slightly engaging vocal style, its skilled pop and funk hand and its Latin influences, it is possible to draw at least one line pointed at Spalding compared to Norah Jones's elusive success in 2003, the closest equivalent for Grammy Awards voters, taking into account jazz productions in this category in recent years.
In addition, Grammy Awards voters have just honored Vijay Iyer Trio's "History" in the " instrumental album" category, a turning on a re-registration frisson that was one of the main favorites last year.
Among these yesterday, "Moody 4B" by veteran saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" by keyboardist John Beasley will be in competition.
Trombone Shorty, supported by the loud voice of New Orleans and often invited to HBO's "Treme", was honored in the contemporary jazz category; he also strongly leaned towards a certain merger with Stanley Clarke's albums, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The secret Society of the Wild Darcy James Argue, familiar with the steampunk, has gained some well-deserved recognition in the large group; in competition with the rich room-jazz of Billy Childs Assemble and the eternal adventurer Dave Holland whose album "Pathways" of his octet's live was a great example of the democratic hand of this bassist as group leader.
Grammy Awards nomination: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey lead in classic categories
The classic nominations for the 53rd annual Grammy Awards include a mix of landscapes of musicians and composers from around the world.
In the head of the nominations, we quote Michael Daughterty's "God Ex Machine" for piano and orchestra, with five "yes"; and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse", an electric orchestral work, with three "yes".
Among the nominees who have links to South California, there is Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his Symphony n°4, "Los Angeles", a work that was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra and which opened the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The Madolin Concerto of the composer based in Los Angeles, Avner Dorman, is also in high school for a reward.
The classic appointments are divided into 13 categories covering orchestral, opera, choral and soil recordings.
A category for the classic producer of the year lists five candidates: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
The appointments for the classic album are the Symphonies n°3 and 4 of Bruckner of the Royal Orchestra of Concertgebouw; "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" of Daugherty of Nashville Symphony Orchestra; "Dreamhouse" of Steven Mackey of the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrifium - the art of Castrati" showing various artists; and the "Requiem" of Verdi of Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the opera category, the nominees are "Lulu" of Berg de l'Orchester du Royal Opera House, "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" of Adolf Hasse du Ars Lyrica Houston; "L'Amour de Loin" of Kaija Saariaho of the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; "The Enchanted Wanderer" of Rodion Shchedrin of the Orchestra and the Chorus of the Theatre Marinesky; and "Ivanhoé" of Arthur Sullivan of BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
The composers who are in place for the Grammy Awards for the contemporary composition include Pärt for the Symphony n°4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machine", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatten Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Wandererer Enchanted".
Pärt's Symphony n°4 was first at Disney Hall in January 2009 in an execution recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra, led by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The work of about 30 minutes is renamed "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the ex-magnet of Mikhail Khodorkovski oil, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concerto" was appointed for his solo instrumental performance with an orchestra.
The composer of Los Angeles said he had just written the work of 15 minutes especially for the interpreter at the Avi Avi Vital Mandoline, who played the concert with Metropolis Ensemble, in New York.
"I wrote it using the sounds of the Middle East and a large number of bands and rhythms of North Africa," said Dorman in a telephone interview.
The head of the orchestra Pierre Boulez, 85 years old, received an appointment in the category of orchestra benefits, for having led the Symphonic Orchestra in Chicago in a recording of Stravinsky's works.
Among the instrumental soloists who received an appointment, let's quote the pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; the organist Paul Jacobs, the violinist Julia Fischer and the harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
This year, there are only appointed vocalists; here are Anne Sofia Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucie Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the category of classic blends, soprano Jesse Norman received a nomination for his recording "Racines: my life, my song"
The Temecula mosque project is approved by the Planning Committee.
A Moscow project in Temecula received unanimous support from the local planning committee after more than five hours of public witnessing, often passionate.
Critics took up the project by claiming that it was promoting both terrorism and traffic bottlenecks.
But the commissioners decided on Wednesday night that the new religious centre would respect local laws and that it would be aesthetically impressive.
"Many people have come to support it: Christians, Jews, Bahais, you mention it," said Hadi Nael, President of the Islamic Centre of Temecula Valley, taking the floor on Thursday morning.
"I'm proud of it, as an American citizen."
"It shows that justice brings it."
"The opposition is really minimal," he added.
"They just have very strong voices."
"We have good people in this valley."
The meeting began at 6 p.m. and lasted until almost midnight with, most of the time, people speaking for or against the centre, in the short speech time also distributed, according to the Press Enterprise.
The discussion continued on the website of the newspaper.
"There is no more America," wrote one speaker.
"It's another monkey planet with Miss Liberty dead in the sand."
"America has fallen."
The planned Islamic centres also raised protests in other parts of the country, including the Ground Zero, instead of the attacks of September 11, 2001, in New York City.
Imam Mahmoud Harmoush denounced violence in the Temecula Valley.
Her congregation of 135 co-existing families in Riverside County for years but she wanted a larger and better space than the warehouse she rented on a shared property with a water filtration system manufacturer.
The new mosque of 24,943 square feet in the Mediterranean style architecture would be composed of two mines and would rise to 43 feet high.
It would occupy a site of 4.32 hectares on the streets of Nicolas approximately two miles east of the Chaparral high school.
The opponents can still appeal against this project to the municipal council.
A microbe tolerating arsenic raises the possibility of new types of life on Earth, or elsewhere.
The discovery of a foreign bacteria, which can use arsenic as one of its nutrients, expands the field to find new forms of life on Earth and perhaps beyond.
Although researchers have discovered the unusual bacteria here on Earth, they say it shows that life has opportunities beyond the major elements that have been considered essential.
"This organism has a dual capacity."
"It can develop with either phosphorus or arsenic."
"That's why she's very special, even though she's far from being a really "foreign" life form," commented Paul Davies C. W. of the University of Arizona, co-author of the report appearing in the online edition of Thursday's journal Science.
Six major elements have long been considered essential for life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
But researchers have discovered that the bacteria, discovered in Lake Mono, California, are able to continue to develop after replacing phosphorus with arsenic.
"We wonder what is still possible," said Ariel Anbar D. of the University of Arizona, co-author of the report.
The discovery is important in the search for life beyond Earth because researchers must be able to recognize life, to know what life looks like, says Anbar.
The study focuses on a microbe found on Earth.
However, the announcement of a press conference to discuss it, which did not disclose the details of the bottle, generated widespread speculation on the Internet that the report could reveal the discovery of an extraterrestrial life.
That wasn't the case.
The discovery "shows that, in other planetary environments, organisms could be able to use other elements to act on biochemistry and that all "standard" elements, which we consider absolutely necessary for life, could not be fixed," commented Charles Cockell, professor of planetary and space science research at the Institute of Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
"This work is new because it shows the substitution of one element to another in basic biochemistry and the biochemical structure," Cockell added.
It wasn't a lucky discovery.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the NASA Institute of Astrology, who conducted the study, chose Lake Mono because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar; thus, it has speculated that one microbe exposed to both substances could be able to replace one another.
"Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is really similar to that of phosphorus."
"As a result, organisms have difficulty distinguishing these elements separately."
"But arsenic is different enough so it doesn't work exactly like phosphorus; it penetrates inside and somehow rubbers the work of our biochemical machine," Anbar explained.
The researchers collected the known bacteria called GFAJ-1 and exposed it to increasing concentrations of arsenic to which it could adapt and grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus but the fact that it can live with arsenic at the site raises the possibility that a life form using arsenic can naturally occur, either on Earth or on another planet or the moon where arsenic is more frequent.
Jamie S. Foster, associate professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said that the idea that arsenic could be replaced by phosphorus was not new; but nothing has ever shown that this could work.
Arsenic was more frequent at the beginning of the existence of the Earth, she said; thus, the researchers issued the hypothesis that the first forms of life could have used it.
This suggests that there may be other ways to form life, not only the way life on Earth was formed at the beginning," said Foster, who was not part of the Wolfe-Simon research team.
The research was funded by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Institute of Health.
The last two stolen exhibition dogs were found in Compton
The other two dogs on four flights outside a motel in Bellflower were found, the sheriffs of the Los Angeles County announced it on Thursday.
The four exhibition dogs - two akatas and two pembroke gallois corgis - disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole the Chevrolet Express truck in which they had spent the night outside a motel 6 of Bellflower, the authorities announced.
Two of the dogs were recovered on Wednesday afternoon and the other two were found at the end of Wednesday evening, said Steve Whitmore, the spokesperson of the sheriff's department of the county of Los Angeles.
"The good news is that dogs are going well," says Whitmore.
"They're in good shape."
"They were returned to their legitimate owners."
Whitmore refused to say exactly where the dogs had been found, in which neighborhood and in which circumstances they were discovered.
"An investigation is under way."
"We don't mean it," Whitmore said.
"We follow orders."
Dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were unable to join to provide a comment on Thursday.
They were gathered on Wednesday afternoon with their two Akitas in a shelter for animals in the county located in Downey.
The sheriff's assistants found the truck and the two dogs separately in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month-old female - were healthy and excepted, the authorities announced.
But Bunny and Peter, the cogs Rickard and Peek planned to show regional competitions this week, on behalf of the Japanese dog owners, were brought to their discovery on Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend as part of the National Championship "AKC/Eukanuba" of Long Beach, where they were expected to present Trace.
The other dogs were expected to participate in the competitions of other trials scheduled in the days prior to the exhibition "AKC/Eukanuba", Peek said in the Times on Wednesday.
South California is one of the stops of the canine exhibition tour for almost one month of the couple.
Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked in the motel.
They often stay in the motels and get their truck outside, right next to the window of their room.
They brought three other dogs - a boxer cock, a Parson Russell terrier and a Breton Spaniard - who stayed with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and the basket, with a thicker fur, in the truck where it would be cooler.
They have a little open windows so dogs can have fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the truck flight at 6 p.m. on Tuesday.
Peek said they would offer a reward to anyone who could drive them to the cages, with a micropile installed to identify them.
It is not clear whether a reward has been granted on Thursday.
The lion is ready to redecorate again, the restructuring of MGM awaits no more than the final green light of the court
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally got the green light to start back to zero.
A federal bankruptcy judge in New York officially rented the "pre-packaged" plan on Thursday by creditors that about $5 billion of debt would be erased; opening the way for the entertainment company, with 86 years of existence, to focus its efforts on the production and distribution of films and television broadcasts.
With Thursday's decision, according to which the plan met the requirements of the United States bankruptcy code, there is no legal obstacle to MGM's surrender under the supervision of the founders of Entertainment Spyglass, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the general directors of what will be an alleged studio.
Staff will be brought back to approximately 320 out of 400 at the start.
MGM will not really emerge from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase has concluded a $500 million credit facility to finance new MGM operations and productions.
It is currently licensed by the investment bank, which itself amounts to $75 million, and should be financed by mid-December.
The studio restructuring process began in May 2009 when the Moelis & Co. investment bank was set up to advise the management on how to place its finances because it did not have the means to pay interest of $300 million a year.
In August, Director General Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, an old Enron PDG and a well-known expert for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper's attempts to solve MGM's financial difficulties and satisfy more than 140 studio creditors took much more time than planned.
After several months of discussions, the parties agreed, at the end of 2009, to place the company on sale.
However, the sale of auctions attracted few bidders, none of whom were willing to pay the sum of 2 billion more of whom the creditors were looking for.
In the spring of this year, it had to be repeated when the MGM team had begun to work on a restructuring plan which, after months of internal disagreements and debates, was finally approved by creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially comes out of bankruptcy in the following weeks, Moelis and Cooper will receive multi-million-dollar premiums for their work.
Moelis & Co., who has already earned $1.2 million, will receive $9.5 million.
Cooper companies, which have collected $375 000 per month for their corporate management services, will receive a 4 million-dollar "success premium".
Barber and Birnbaum intend to relaunch the production of MGM, which was released only one film this year, and set up an annual list of seven or eight films that would be released from 2012.
They also intend to co-finance two films based on "the Hobbit", with Warner Bros
The studio must conclude a separate loan between $265,000,000 and $275 million to finance its share in these two films, which must be made by Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, who holds approximately 18% of MGM's debt, tried to make a merger of the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, where he is the principal shareholder.
However, the recent discussions between the two companies did not lead to an agreement.
Tech Toys to maintain your balance of gift budget
Although the main candidate for this year's most wonderful play is the IPAD, followed perhaps by Microsoft's video game system, Kinect, both can make an important break in your gift budget.
Consider that, for the price of an iPad, you can buy five BMX bikes at $99 and that a Kinect game costs the same price as 10 strings to classic jumping beads, or about 48 Play-Doh boxes.
But there are ways to keep your budget balanced.
Recently, I visited three national toys vendors - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and Wholeesele Club of BJ - to see the electronic toys I could buy for less than $80.
It is clear that Moore's Law has evolved, the technological toy of this year is likely to have more strength; however, the same price otherwise slightly less, compared to last year.
In addition, while there are generally fewer new toys associated with websites, two of the most famous of these, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And button piles are increasing, as well as rechargeable piles toys.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, except if otherwise indicated.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13 for 3 years and more) are pellet toys of the size of an Indian cock who sing a note when you push them on their belly.
A pressure is equal to a note, and a second allows to compose a song.
If you buy more, they will sing in harmony.
Attention: Once you start supporting, you can no longer stop.
To combine the song with the dance, Dance Mickey Star (Fisher-Price, $60 for 2 years and more) is the best choice.
With the inspiration of Elmo Live's technology last year, the 14-inch animtronic doll plays role-playing games like Simon Says and can make the moon dance thanks to its innovative joints with wheel locking.
Children who have tried the toy use Mickey as a dance instructor while their parents complain about a lack of volume control.
If you are a child in the 1980s, you will remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
He is back (Hasbro / Playskool, $40 for 3 years and more), with a back bag full of questionnaire game cards designed to turn a car ball into a session with a self-correction and a van classer.
If you are suspicious when your child holds your smartphone, here are three autonomous alternatives.
The VTech Mobigo ($60, for 3 to 8 years) is the least expensive and easier to use, with a qwerty keyboard, although the games do not educate as effectively as Explore Leafster ($70, for 3 to 12 years), it is the first major revision of the Leafster range, with a more recent and brighter screen.
No version is compatible with the old cartridges.
Fisher-Price's iXL ($90, for 3-7 years) uses an iTunes type system to offer games and books and is equipped with an entry for SD card that allows you to display family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for 8 years and over) is a set of five blocks almost larger than a lightbox, each with its own LED screen.
The goal is to form words by placing the blocks online before time runs out, it is ideal for an impromptu spelling contest.
In addition, toys have a kind of online connection.
Based only on their presence in toys stores, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child an online Penguin Club pet, for example, you can get a Penguin Disney Club 2"Mix'N Match Figure Pack, $5, for 6 to 12 years) that includes a piece marked with a hidden code.
When you buy the online code, your child gets enough credit from Club Penguin store for two items of choice.
It can be roller skates or a pet plays Puffle.
A little bigger than the hair at the end of your toothbrush, Hexbug Nano ($10, for 5 years and more) is the last micro-bot with a button.
The beastly false moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone pastes in random directions.
It's fun to do a block labyrinth to see if she can find her way through.
It is also solid.
Ours has resisted a fall from the kitchen table and even a momentary passage into the mouth of our dog.
Bringing a softer side to maintain order in China
Tang Shenbin held a position in the city as a city sergeant in training by severely inspecting his nerves, by issuing low-voice orders with military authority.
He wanted female Chengguan members, who were in charge of the public order in China, to be afraid and despised for their arbitrary repression and for violence, to convey a certain impression to a set of spectators.
"Be right!"
"You're standing!"
Show them, he says, "What do beautiful girls look like?"
Four girls who had barely passed adolescence in white gloves, clothes and identical olive-coloured pants, looked at you.
Four pairs of black heels, aligned to the rule.
Four perfectly treated hats pierced at the top of hair attached by a white and blue-red knot.
"Personally, I think they have an average appearance," said Mr. Tang, with a sharp look.
"The models are beautiful."
More than one government has tried to refresh China's image of urban inspectors.
One city demanded that all new recruits have a higher degree.
The Guangdong province exchanged the grey-green uniforms against a more engaging blue.
Wuhan, in Central China, replaced them with strong eyes: in 2009, a report reported that 50 officers had surrounded an uncontrollable snack carriage by throwing black looks, firmly for half an hour, until the co-bearer picks up his affairs and parts.
Xindu, a city district of 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, chose to do a large image operation.
Since 2003, the district has completed its 13 women street police in the urban area, especially chosen for their appearance, age and age.
The idea is to give the degross police a softer, more feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson might have difficulty drawing attention to this underground urban brigade of China.
And for that reason, critics will say.
Unlike the police, these officers are allowed only to comply with municipal orders by imposing fines or other administrative sanctions.
But Chinese media spread news of a different reality.
In January 2008, the Inspectors of the Province of Hubei beat an observer to death after using his mobile phone to film them as they spread a protest against a waste dump.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing inspectors, torn down and put online, describes how to effectively beat criminals without blood.
This year in Shanghai, a paste colporteur was abandoned with a brain injury after a bazaar with five officers.
A video game featuring violence, available on-line download, shows Chinese inspectors trained to beat street vendors.
"Chenguan marked the government," lamented China Daily last year, a national publication, after a single discussion on tactics.
The newspaper demanded a "real full cleaning."
The skeptics say the approach is far away.
After the district went through an announcement in October to find eight new women's recruits, an editorial, published in The Beijing Evening News, wondered whether women had real jobs or if they were just a touristic entertainment.
The answer seems to be a little bit of both.
The district's announcement required female candidates between the ages of 18 and 22 to have a beautiful silhouette and "the five features of the face in the right order."
They must have a size above the average, either 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 1⁄2 inches.
Retirement at 26 years of age is compulsory.
Officials stated that work was physically too painful for women over 25 years of age.
"It's their image that's important," said a certain district officer at Rednet.com, an almost government website.
"First, the external qualities of the candidates will determine if they are appropriate; it is the size, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes the temperament and the "internal qualities."
The Chengguan women are like flower vases, he said, adding: "In addition to being vases, they will have other responsibilities.
Zheng Lihua, Deputy Director of the City District Management Office, does not subscribe to this description.
But he noted that the requirements for height were the standard standard in many Chinese job offers for both sexes.
This is the case with regard to the order of the face.
That this means beautiful is a subject of debate among the Chinese.
Of course, persons with disabilities or disabilities are not required to apply.
"We can't let a person who is boxing or a boss come to serve here," says Mr. Zheng.
"He wouldn't give a good picture."
Liu Yi, who patrols the place Baoguang near a monastery, is aged 22 and has the games pummeled with a finely curved mouth.
She did not consider the development of her appearance as a sexist, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked for an unscathed air.
Xu Yang, his 21-year-old fossilist colleague, said: "Our job is to present the image of the city."
They did not oppose their mandate being limited, they said, because they were more ambitious in their careers than simply chasing sellers in the streets where they were supposed to limit their activities.
Every morning, the team faces a dozen traveling merchants who move quickly on foot or by bicycle, trying to sell as little bread or tofu bags as possible before taking the flight.
"Master Wang, you must leave."
"We've already told you several times!" said Mrs. Xu, while a salesman ran away on foot, temporarily leaving his bike-cartret to the ground.
Agents describe their functions as monotonous rather than burned.
"It's almost the same thing every day," said Huang Jing, aged 20, who studied marketing after work.
"Great routine."
One reason is that female agents do not have the power of their male counterparts to confiscate the goods of the sellers.
They can only threaten to report offenders to their superiors.
This tends to protect them from sudden public exhibitions of animosity against bureaucracy that are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of the province of Yunnan, rebelled after spreading false rumors that Chengguan agents had killed a salesman.
On one night, more than a dozen policemen and Chengguan officers were injured, 14 government vehicles were overturned or set on fire.
Xindu has so far escaped such violence.
But calm is not quite guaranteed.
Just two pastes of houses from the place Baoguang square, where female officers patroled this morning, more than 50 people gathered at the corner of the street.
The agents confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk rather than in a store, as the regulation imposes.
The owner of the motorcycle created the scandal.
A 15-minute iron arm followed before the policemen, in the face of the disaster, broke down a rope-cut path to their vehicle and left at any speed with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40 years old, a coordinator attached to the male team, remained behind, his white badge returned to hide his name.
Like female officers, coordinators - 40-year-old or older men - play a purely supportive role.
Unlike them, they are not trained to maintain a hidden image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we fight physically," says Mr. He knows of a neutral tone.
"Most of the time, it's the public who starts."
Prosecutors will not indict Senator Ensign
The prosecutors of the Department of Justice raised criminal charges against Senator John Ensign, resulting from a case involving an assistant of an old campaign and his efforts to obtain a lobbying job for the wife's husband, announced on Wednesday the senator's lawyers.
The decision ends the most serious legal threat faced by Mr. Ensign, the Republican of Nevada, who was considered a potential Republican candidate for the 2012 presidential election until the scandal around his case does not make the major national titles last year and damages his career.
Mr. Ensign's office stated that he was "very happy" with the decision, as a result of a one-year investigation.
The senator could still be exposed to disciplinary measures taken by the Senate Ethics Committee.
Mr. Ensign's lawyers stated that the Department of Justice had "informed that Senator Ensign was no longer the subject of the investigation and that he had no intention of holding any charges against him in this case."
The Ministry of Justice abstained from commenting on this.
The announcement came as a kind of surprise for many ethics lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice, according to which there would be significant evidence indicating that Mr. Ensign would have conspired to violate a federal criminal ban on lobbying.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents, first reported in October 2009 in the New York Times, indicated that Mr. Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, one of his assistants, to obtain a lucrative lobbying job to win the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, on the Senator's case with her.
Mrs. Hampton once served as a treasurer during an Ensign campaign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political funders to find work for Mr. Hampton and then defended their rights after they hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them; in accordance with documents and interviews.
Since Mr. Hampton had recently been a collaborator of Mr. Ensign, he was banned for a year by the law from lobbying with his former employer or the Senate as a whole.
Ethics experts argued that the unusual agreement between Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were close friends before the case, seemed to contradict the ban on the turning door of lobbying.
According to the evidence that has been made public, "there seems to be prima facie evidence of a plot to violate and substantially violate the law of the rotating door," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in the defence of clients in an investigation by the government.
Although the Department's judge refused to explain the reasoning leading to the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethical lawyers said that the Department seemed to be embarrassed by political prosecutions after a number of high-level rebates by its section of public integrity, including the decisions made last year to abandon the prosecutions against former Senator Ted Stevens who was accused of prosecution.
The federal prosecutors are clearly afraid of taking up arms, Melanie Sloan, the Director General of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a group of defences that received several complaints against Mr. Ensign in the case.
"This basically says high-ranking government officials can now assume the laws don't apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, chief lawyer for Mr. Ensign, said in an interview that he had received a telephone call from a prosecutor from the Ministry of Justice on Monday and a follow-up the following day, saying that the department was not looking for charges against its client.
Mr. Ensign's counsel team had cooperated with the prosecutors to try to convince them that the senator, as his office had reaffirmed him on Wednesday in a communiqué, "had acted in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins refused to state the legal arguments he had made in the prosecutor's office.
"I am not able to enter into the details of my discussions with the Ministry of Justice unless we think that they have made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Electoral Commission decided to abandon an investigation following an independent complaint by the ethics group, claiming that Mr. Ensign's parents paid $96,000 to Hampton in violation of federal electoral law.
The electoral commission stated that it did not have enough evidence to prove that money was all but a gift.
NV Energy, an important Nevada company that has long supported the senator, is a company for which Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find lobbying work.
An e-mail sent in December 2008 showed that, after the company welcomed Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensign's cabinet chief John Lopez contacted Mr. Hampton and told him that he was "marting" the Ministry of the Interior on an issue in dispute.
Mr. Ensign also participated in a lunch with Mr. Hampton and another customer from Nevada, Allegiant Air, and asked the Transport Secretary to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after he had hired Mr. Hampton to do lobbying.
When news of the case surfaced last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his voters and resigned from his position as leader of the fourth republican Senate.
After maintaining a low profile for several months, Mr. Ensign stated two weeks ago that he intended to serve a third term in the Senate.
In announcing that Mr. Ensign was no longer the target of a criminal investigation, his spokesman, Jennifer Cooper, said that the senator hoped that the ethics committee would follow the example of the Ministry of Justice and put an end to his investigation.
Senator Ensign is pleased to continue his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada, she said.
Cheshire's call to Twitter
A half a dozen of them were being tapped away in the ranks of the hearing room.
They sent all the minutes of horrendous witness reports on Twitter.
In the end, the defence said that there were more than 140,000 messages on the rape trial and children attached to their bed in a house that had been burned.
On Thursday, the trial followed by Steven J. Hayes, who was found guilty of the murder of three members of the Cheshire family in Connecticut, should result in an official end where the judge would impose the death penalty, voted by the jury.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already filed elements in the court that are missing appeals, which are likely to occupy the courts for years.
What is causing is that intense reports on the trial - as well as widespread and widespread use by Twitter journalists - have created a "circuit atmosphere", so widespread and instantaneous saturation with fire details that the jury has been badly influenced by the public's passions.
The application could prompt judges to discuss whether new technologies require new rules in the hearing rooms.
"I have experienced this during this trial; I think that there is a real danger, the introduction of new technologies in the hearings violates the rights of the person to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullmann, lawyer of Mr Hayes, lawyer.
The trial judge, Jon C. Bleue of the Supreme Court of State, finally rejected the claims in the trial made last week, claiming that the media were "soundly controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury would have been encouraged by passion.
But this does not seem to be the last word on the issue.
The appeals course has been recognized for decades that the media coverage of known cases may raise questions about the fairness of a trial.
In a 1966 judgment that took place, the Supreme Court of the United States annulled the condemnation of a osteopathy of Cleveland, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, supporting in his decision that there was a "carnival atmosphere in the trial " because of the media.
The crime is considered by some to have been the inspiration for television broadcasts and the movie "The fugitive".
Some lawyers have stated that the courts of appeal to review Mr. Hayes' conviction a half century later may be curious given the argument that new rules might be necessary to manage the means of communication of the hearings, unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a general reason to worry about the impact of the new media" in large-scale proceedings, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford's Law School who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that she was arbitrarily applied.
Professor Donohue said that some appeals judges might be intrigued by the idea that the limitation of instantaneous communication from hearings could allow for fairer trials.
The Twitter case is just one of many other described by Mr. Hayes' lawyers, likely to be discussed for years; this delays execution.
Defence lawyers also claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes would have suffered injury when Judge Blue refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jury members by showing them macabre photos of criminal scenes when selecting the jury.
Some of the jury members said they had been horrified by the photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years old, and his daughters, Hayley, 17 years old, and Michaela, 11 years old.
Defence lawyers claim that they will also challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty and that they will argue that the judge unjustly expelled one of the jury, who had been criticised to the prosecutors, and that he has abused the pressure on a verdict by making the unusual decision to bring the jury to a decision in a weekend.
The jury was not kidnapped.
But their arguments on the effect of the intense media coverage of the trial could be the greatest source of interest.
They noted in a dispute against the verdict, filed last month, that the case dominated the media scene in Connecticut and that it was discussed during the election campaign by the candidates at the governor's office and the United States Senate.
They maintained that the computer media was constantly waiting for the flames of the emotion of the case.
"The daily shelling of media tweets, cameras and journalists in front of the courthouse," the lawyers wrote, "was nothing like what had been seen here in New Haven, and perhaps even at the national level."
Their focus on the coverage of the Twitter system is controversial.
In the interviews, some journalists said that the assertion that the new instantaneouss were more fire-like than those reported more slowly was a ludicrous view that would undermine the Court's policy of media coverage of future trials.
However, some lawyers said that appeals were often attracted by the arguments that social and technological changes required an adaptation by the courts.
Mr. Hayes' lawyers insist on this claim.
In their case, they refer to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966 that had reversed Dr. Sheppard's conviction because of the media coverage of the trial and they stated that they would invoke the need for new rules for the new media.
"This case," they wrote, "is that of Sheppard v. Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can civilisation bring the clavicles closer together?
After a campaign marked by invective and negativeness, a minimum of civility broke out in Washington this week.
Is this a preliminary sign of genuine bilateral cooperation in advance or an illustrative moment before the rapid return to the partisan struggle in the capital?
The Tuesday meeting between President Obama and Congressional leaders produced no insight into the major issues to be dealt with during the session of the "houseyard".
But of course there was at least a poly discussion on the differences between the two parties and the recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than another episode where each camp wanted to highlight points.
The public meeting on Wednesday of the Committee on the President's Deficiency was also civilized, despite the political differences that remain among the members.
It seems clear that the close interaction of several months has created mutual respect transcending the ideological gap; however, it still divides the members.
It is hardly enough to say that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
Both parties are now in a period of mutual testing and testing with a view to obtaining signs of cooperation and compromise, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and voter patience for a renewed partisan war.
That is why the Tuesday meeting and subsequent comments of the participants revealed a minimum of demands or charges.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deep to suggest a rapid change in the climate that has existed over the last two years.
With regard to taxation, expenditure, health care or rights, both parties remain thousands of miles away.
However, the November election had moderated Washington, at least in the short term.
"There is no doubt that things have changed on the tone," said Pete Wehner, a Bush Administration official, now next to the Centre for Ethics and Public Policy.
"It's inevitable after the elections.
The elections create partisan passions and then they come together.
That's good."
On certain issues, including those on the agenda of the session of "boxed Candad", Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush's tax cuts will expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favour of that.
Both parties want to find a way to preserve one or all of them, either permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, a compromise can be considered on the extension of unemployment benefits, only because Republicans cannot afford to give the impression that they are in favour of tax reductions for the rich, while refusing unemployment benefits to unemployed workers.
After Tuesday's meeting at the White House, more optimism is planned on a possible agreement on the issues raised during the session relating to the "box cand", with the ratification of the "New START" pact.
But William Galston, of the Brookings Institution, warned that fruitful cooperation on the most pressing problems of the "lame duck" session would not necessarily lead to a better understanding between the two parties when the 112th Congress will meet in January.
Instead, he says, a period of disagreement is likely, or inevitable.
"When things have to be done, psychology in the short term will return to one of the confrontations," he said.
Wehner also expressed his widely shared skepticism that civilization would lead to genuine cooperation.
"I consider most of what is happening between today and 2012 as a pre-show or shadow boxing compared to the main event of 2012, he said.
The reasons are closely linked to the composition of the new republican majority in the Chamber and the electors present in the tea that contributed to its creation.
However, Republican leaders are aware of the dangers if they go too far, they know that they must try to be at the top of their promises to reduce public spending and repeal the new Health Care Act.
These partisan positions are now clear in the initial responses to the recommendations of the deficit commission which include reforming the tax code and increasing certain taxes, retiring retirement age and reducing expenditure.
Co-Presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have chosen one of the most difficult tasks in Washington, and they themselves have imposed the issue of the deficit on the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes to the committee, composed of 18 members, to issue their plan as an official recommendation, and they have had difficulty reaching that number.
The largest resistance remains among the group's electors; this suggests that there are tax issues, at least today, few of the reasons or willingness to compromise.
Galston provides for two phases in the fights between the White House and the Republicans of Congress.
The first will come next year in the form of partial confrontations, given that the Republicans contest Obama's budget, tax and health care, and will then be followed by a greater period of bilateral cooperation.
What would be the cause of the change?
Public opinion.
It is widely proven that, despite the partial spirit of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see both parties working together.
If confrontation leads to an impasse, as in 1995, then both parties will closely observe the public's reaction.
The person who will be deemed to be lost will have to change his mind and find compromises.
But that would be an optimistic point of view.
The partisan spirit and polarization are greater today than they were in the mid-1990s and there seems to be a greater ideological gap between Obama and Congressional Republicans than there was then between President Bill Clinton and Republicans.
At the same time, the militants of the two parties see 2010 as a simple prelude to a more consequent election in 2012.
In view of this reality, the civilization exposed this week could be appreciated by many Americans.
But it will take much more effort on the part of both sides to find an area of understanding on the issues that still divide them.
Revealed American documents describe Moscow as a haven of corruption
The control of the city is between the hands of a "Kleptocracy" and makes it pass to Kremlin some of the pot-win and the protection money it collects, reported the US Embassy in Russia in a note in February.
The police and the Federal Security Service carry out huge rackets that help explain the high cost of life in Moscow, he said.
They collect money not only from legitimate companies but also from organized criminal groups.
Each layer of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called the "vertical power" - takes part while money is on the top of the scale.
The service note, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyle, was posted Wednesday by Wikileaks on his website.
The note is based on sources whose names have been exported.
It was written while Iouri Loujkov was still mayor of Moscow; and he is largely responsible for corruption.
He was released in October by President Dmitri Medvedev, but since then there have been few cleaning traces.
Loujkov and his wife, Elena Batourina, who has a leading construction company, have always denied corruption charges over the years; and he has received several defamation proceedings on these charges.
In September, he said what followed a Russian television channel, when he was interrogated on a documentary suggesting that he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it's throwing, it's anything."
The Russians believe, to a vast majority, that their society is corrupt; according to polls.
But it is unusual to find the information contained in an embassy account; and it is inconceivable that it would be for diplomats from a foreign country to do so.
The direct link between the Moscow City Government and the crime has led some people to call it "disfunctional" and to say that the government was more functioning as a cleptocracy than a government," according to the embassy note.
"The criminal elements enjoy a " krisha " (the term used in the criminal world/mafia that literally means " roof " or protection) that passes through the police, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior (MVD) and the prosecutor's office, as well as through the entire bureaucracy of the Moscow City Government.
"Analysts to identify a three-level structure in Moscow's criminal world."
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"The FSB, the MVD and the militia are at second level."
"Finally, regular criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
"This is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill a gap in certain areas where the city does not provide certain services."
The report indicates that the FSB is distributing the money of the largest companies and that the police are targeting the small ones.
One source, he said, "explained that Moscow's business owners understood that it was preferable to obtain the protection of the MVD and the FSB (rather than organized crime groups) because, not only, they have more weapons, more means and more power than criminal groups but they are also protected by law."
"That's why the application for protection by criminal gangs is no longer as high."
The note notes that, although the collection of money is extended, protection itself may be unequal; even those who pay are sometimes subject to arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly see their business closed under one pretext or another.
Medvedev mentioned the fight against corruption several times, but he admitted little progress.
The embassy's note transmits income accounts to men who bring suitcases, probably filled with money, up to Kremlin.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev depends on bureaucrats," said in a recent interview with Gueorgui Satarov, director of the "think tank Indem" in Moscow.
"But it's part of this bureaucracy."
"It is not part of a political class because it does not exist in Russia."
Without politics, without opposition, without separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
According to the Indem, the cost of corruption would be more than $300 billion a year at the Russia-wide level.
The country has been classified 154e in a recent survey on the overall perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (the countries are classified at least as corrupt).
The disclosure of the note by the US embassy, which had not been realized that yesterday late in the evening, at the time of Moscow, would certainly remove the discontent within the Russian government; although Loujkov could be blamed, to some extent, for the failure of Moscow, this could be an opportunity for Kremlin to show that he was in the process of solving the problem.
Interviewed by CNN by Larry King, Putin suggested that WikiLeaks' documents could be a manufacturing and reacted in anger to the allegations that U.S. diplomats had disclosed to the appellant Batman and to Medvedev of Robin.
"The problem is based on the fact that it is our interaction, an important factor in domestic policy in that country," he said.
"But to be honest with you, we didn't suspect it would be realized with such arrogance, such pressure and, you know, in opposition to ethics."
Former Red Khmer fighters forced to face the past
In a class room with poorly lit concrete walls of poor quality, the principal of Anlong Veng's secondary school mentioned the man who had built it, the last head of the Red Khmers, Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves your Mok."
"He was a good leader; and he cared about his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years old.
Known as "the mouth" for its brutality, when he was at the head of the Red Khmers, this commander remains popular in this isolated base of former Red Khmers in northwest Cambodia where he has built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructures; and where thousands of former soldiers of the organization still live today.
But this year, 12 years after the Red Khmers went to the government, long-term loyalty was finally challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum for truth and reconciliation enabled victims to face publicly those who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed a high-school manual that for the first time taught the story of the Khmer Red to the children of its former soldiers.
And in July, a Cambodian court, jointly headed with the United Nations, issued its first sentence on a former member of the Khmer Red, condemning, at 35 years of prison, the former head of Tuol Slang, Kaing Khek Iev's famous torture centre, known as "Duch".
In view of this evolution of the situation, anxiety has increased among the former fighters of the Red Khmers of Anlong Veng, complicated by the efforts of reconciliation and their desire to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
"There are feelings and fears among the former Khmer Reds but they are powerless to do whatever it is," said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodian Documentation Centre, an independent agency that carries out research on the regime.
"For them, life under the Red Khmer was glorious, but the regime became a symbol of evil."
"The situation generates divisions within families."
Under the rule of the Red Khmers in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, about 1.7 million people were executed or were killed by hunger, disease or overcrowding.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overturned the government of Pol Pot-United in 1979, the rest of the regime and its army fled to the border of Cambodia with Thailand.
There they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last of the movements arrived in December 1998.
While Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla of their base located in the western mountains of Cambodia and in the jungle, Ta Mok prepared a follow-up to Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a United Nations-sponsored peace agreement led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Red Khmer fighters began to make a defect in the government, culminating in the capitalisations of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998 and Ta Mok, who had taken the lead, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the mountains near Dangrek.
He died in a prison in Phnom Penh in 2006 awaiting trial.
Without their benefactors, most of the former Red Khmer fighters were overshadowed in black poverty, common in rural Cambodia; and many remain nostalgic in the movement.
Although some elite red Khmer officials have held their positions as local leader in exchange for having deposited the weapons, they are not qualified farmers in the low grade and file.
"These people received very little follow-up after the capitulation," Sok Leang of the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which organizes public forums throughout Cambodia, including Anlong Veng, said.
"They are surrounded by the agrarian utopian ideology of the regime."
"They were raised in a context where business is a foreign concept."
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Red Khmer as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before moving into 1998 as a poor rice grower.
"Life under the Red Khmers was good," he said.
"It's Mok feeds everyone."
But now life is difficult because we have to meet our own needs."
The current Khmer court has also raised concerns here.
At the beginning of next year, the court should begin the trial of Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former red Khmer minister.
The mandate of the court is to judge the high leaders and the main perpetrators of the crimes, but he did not say if he continued beyond those four cases.
It would take more to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
The latest media speculations turned to Im Chaem, 64 years old, former district chief in the province of Banteay Meanchey under the Red Khmer rule in the 1970s.
In 2007, she told the Cambodian Documentation Centre researchers that she had monitored the construction of the Trapeang Thma dam, a project where thousands of forced workers would have found death.
Recently, during a stormy evening, Im Chaem returned from work in the field near his wooden house on pilots, on a dirt road outside Anlong Veng.
While the sun shed long shadows on the dry grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss his past in the Red Khmers.
If the court were to call her, she would refuse to go.
"Cambodge is in peace and stability," she said.
"If there are more persecutions, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who deformed the Red Khmers in 1978, also warned on several occasions that instability would occur if the court continued several suspects; although experts and historians contest this.
"Cambodge must cross a hole and bury the past, as he says.
But facing the past is all that Cambodia must do to move forward, says Youk Chang, from the documentation centre.
"The reconciliation in terms of Khmer is to reconnect broken pieces," he said.
"We must put these pieces together so that we can understand."
The centre produced the first handbook approved by the government on the Red Khmers, "A history of the Democratic Kampuchea, composed of 75 pages."
He distributed it to Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the Department of Education's history manuals, designed for high schools, which contained less than four pages on the Red Khmers.
As in most Cambodia, young Anlong Veng know only a few details about the Red Khmers, despite the city's ties to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19-year-old student at Anlong Veng High School, said that the new manual helped students to understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted with skepticism when he came home with the book to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the manual and the court," he says.
"They don't know exactly how many people the court will continue."
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, the manual and the court start to have an impact, he said.
However, the Red Khmer maintains a powerful attraction here.
In the heights of the Dangrek mountains, a path, invaded by the bad grass and covered with plastic bags, leads to a black sue rectangle, covered with a rolled table roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a tire pile after his death in 1998.
Noum Sothea, aged 31, said she didn't know much about the man who was burned in this place.
"But he has a great spirit; and many people go there to pray," she said.
It was the anniversary of Noum Sothea and later that day she planned to walk to the last place of rest of Pol Pot where she would leave a bunch of mature bananas in the hope of bringing luck.
Belarus agrees to give up its military-quality uranium stock
The Government of Belarus announced on Wednesday that it would abandon its highly enriched uranium stock, an essential component for nuclear weapons; this decision is part of a surprising victory of President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear materials worldwide
The agreement was published in a joint communiqué published after the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met here the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Belarus, Sergei Martynov, in the margins of a security summit.
The U.S. government had tried for years to convince Belarus to give up highly enriched uranium and seemed to have cleared the horizon last spring.
But US officials told Washington Post that certain classified operations have been carried out with Belarus in the last two months to eliminate 187 pounds of military-quality uranium from a research centre in Belarus.
This opened the way for a Wednesday agreement to eliminate the remaining material of approximately 500 pounds, according to a civil servant who mentioned the condition of the anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter.
The agreement appears to be one of the most important outcomes of the 47-nation Nuclear Security Summit, organized at the Obama initiative, where Belarus was excluded.
Apparently, it was beneficial to provide an invitation to the former Soviet Republic following the summit in 2012.
"I am really fascinated by the fact that they want a seat at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit.
"This proves to me that this process is working," said Ken Luongo, president of the Partnership for Global Security, a Nuclear Security Promotion Group.
Clinton has qualified the "very significant, important step" agreement made by Belarus.
Obama committed himself in Prague in April 2009 to secure all nuclear materials that are vulnerable throughout the world in the coming four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries to rid themselves of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries have done so under George W. Bush's administration.
At the Obama Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexandre Loukachenko said that the nation would never renounce its uranium.
"We have kept high-rich uranium, hundreds of kilograms of what is mainly military-quality uranium and low-rich uranium," said Mr. Loukachenko.
"It's our product... we're not going to make salt bombs, and we're not going to sell it to anyone."
"We're going to use it for research purposes, that's all."
Belarus approached the United States a few months ago; however, it was of interest to reach an agreement.
The first implementation to eliminate the uranium from Belarus, in October, was particularly complicated, as the material had been slightly irradiated, said leaders.
It was loaded on a special train that traveled more than 1,300 miles to an installation in Russia to be stored and disposed of, said leaders.
The second operation was completed on Monday and was carried out by aircraft, according to the officials.
The U.S. government spent $13 million in its efforts, largely to replace Belarus' research facilities with low-rich uranium; inadequate for weapons.
"A detailed coordination and organization have been implemented to strengthen confidence", leading to Clinton's agreement, Andrew Bieniawski, a director of the Department of Energy Specialized in the Global Threat Reduction, said.
According to the estimates of the James Martin Non-Proliferation Study Centre, Belarus had at least 88 pounds of military uranium this year, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus seeks to eliminate its stocks by 2012, according to a joint statement.
The relationship between Belarus and the United States has been strained for years, mainly due to the harsh repression by Loukachenko of Human Rights.
But Wednesday's statement would suggest a potential renewal.
"All by welcoming the progress made on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus have recognized that greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remained essential for improving bilateral relations; and essential to the progress of the country and its citizens," she said.
Government issued no objection to CIA flights
The government has issued no objection to CIA flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners in the direction of Guantanamo across the Spanish territory, according to a telegram from the US Ambassador to Madrid.
This is demonstrated by the documents filtered (cables) by Wikileaks to the newspaper El País, who add that the first vice-president of the Government of that time, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, had asked that the Spanish Executive be informed to "be able to demonstrate that they were adequately monitoring foreign aircraft crossing Spain".
In June 2006, after a report by the Council of Europe, which charged with complicity in practices contrary to human rights to dozens of countries, including Spain, there was a meeting between former North American Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The Vice-President acknowledged that the report of the Council had "suddenly surprised the Government of Zapatero out of play" and stressed that Spain had nothing to hide.
"From Vega he stressed that Spain has no objection with regard to intelligence flights above the Spanish territory."
"They only want to be informed" in order to avoid being "taken away by lack," says Aguire in a cable.
The secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of that time, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, told the ambassador that the Spanish Executive "wanted to give this case the lowest possible profile, even though, as it was in the hands of judges, the Government had limited influence".
In turn, in January 2007, prosecutor Vicente González told the Embassy that he was not going to block the judge's initiative to request the declassification of documents from the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Department of Defence on CIA flights.
"These reports contain no incriminating elements, no sensitive information," the Embassy explained after speaking to the prosecutor.
The United States has nevertheless expressed concern about "the apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" more than about the classified information of the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to deal with the case discreetly between Governments," Aguirre regrets.
In March 2007, during a lunch between the US Ambassador and the Minister of the Internet, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he commented that "even though Spanish judges are jealous of their independence and will do what they consider appropriate", he had instructed his collaborators "to avoid comments from a burning rhetoric, trying to reduce the temperature".
The Ambassador also expresses concern about the PP's action in this case.
"Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience suggests that PP will certainly take advantage of any indication that the Government of Zapatero has tolerated or deliberately ignored the actions of the United States that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if those revelations have negative consequences for the Government of the United States," she said.
The parishioner who passed to the nuns complained on the network of "accelibration" of being a mother
The young girl was talking about the child when he was already dead and she had a blog: "Tear to Galician"
Monica Juanatey Fernández is "Muki" on the network.
With this nickname she used as soon as she was little, she communicated with a cousin and at least a friend; the two origins of Noia, the village of Coruña to which she originated.
The messages are dated 2008.
To hear them, you need to know his sentimental life, which ABC builds with the help of his parents' testimony.
The 30-year-old Galician girl had entered into an industrial relationship with Ivan Tunez in 1998.
Their relationship lasted a year.
Shortly after they separated, we knew she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was with him, but his ex never let him test his DNA.
We discovered another little friend shortly after that.
The elite was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighboring town.
She lived with him for a long time.
Caesar had lived with them.
When the young girl went to the Balearic Islands to search the labour market, the little girl stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her to Palma for a week.
But according to the content of his communications, it is understood that their idol has broken, they have separated.
In March 2008 she was in Minorque alone, and wrote: "Alberto is very strange and watched because I came to work there."
"When I told him, it showed him a good thing, but of course, he now takes into account what it means to be with the child all day long and not have the freedom to do what he wants to do."
And then she's talking about a mobile message she just received: "I want you to come back this month or give me an address to send you the child."
She complains, "If he doesn't like it, he leaves the dog with my mother, and I'll take it when I get back," she says.
In May, she spoke of the return to her village: "This week I will leave, but I will only stay there until 19, because the 20 I have to introduce myself to a job so I can't lose it."
She explains that if everything was okay, she would have taken her elder with her.
"He will stay with the right person, that is to say with me, and I will never leave him out of my life with another person if this person is not my mother," suspicious intent, taking into account their bad relationships.
In July, there was another post.
When she tapped it, it was assumed that the child, who had arrived on the island on 1st of this month, had allegedly been murdered on 10, was dead.
"Cesar's happy on one side, but he's not happy on the other."
"On the one hand he's with me and this place he likes a little bit, but on the other hand he goes to school almost every day."
She's talking about moving to Majorque.
"There will be (the child) in a few hours of summer and how I save some money from the baby-sitter."
On 17th, greetings and complaints.
"A very big diocese on Caesar's side, who asks me when it's time for you to come."
"Alberto says he sent you I don't know what videos to email, you see, when he wants him, he finds me, shit."
Another 30, "The child is fine, he goes to summer hours to learn Catalan.
On Victor, his current partner, there is one: "I'm ahead of money."
On the Internet she has messages in blogs dedicated to animation and manga.
She had one of her in the MySpace universe, now blocked, where her name was "Muki the prison liberator."
"Tear to Galician (epigraph) " .
The last man who lived with her, carefully, says she's sorry to feel guilty.
He doesn't want to think that everything happened because she didn't tell him that she was a single mother.
Monica went to the provincial penitentiary in Palma yesterday, from the centre of juvenile detention in Minorque.
The officer's lawyer, Carlos Maceda, explained that she did not remember how the events had happened, "and she had no intention of harming the minor."
Before she had agreed to drown Caesar in the bathroom and deposit his body in a suitcase.
The defence and the prosecutor requested a psychiatric trial.
Members of the People's Party would gain 4 seats in Congress and the PSC would lose 9
With the results of the 18th century, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After the significant increase in votes and Members registered in the last autonomous elections, the Catalan PP has already targeted the generals because, whether there is progress or not, the prospects are more than positive, because the number of votes that this training receives in these dual committees is normally what it receives in the Catalans.
Thus, the Catalan peoples received 610,473 votes in favour to the 2008 generals, while the 2006 autonomouss received 316,222 votes.
Last Sunday, the PPC obtained 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend is maintained, desired by a deviation from the PSC's vote and the confidence of the PP's electorate, analysts calculated that, if there were general elections, the PSC could have gone from 8 to 12 MPs in Congress, while the PSC would also win four (now 10) and PSC would lose no more than 9 (now 25).
These calculations would indicate that the Catalan place is fundamental to PP and PSOE.
According to the population analysis, ERC would lose a Member - he has three now - while ICV would keep a Member or win one.
But if the electoral agenda is held, the next meeting would take place in May 2011 for municipal comedians, where the people can also be determined at the end of the socialist hegemony in the four capitals of the province and their relations with the head of the General Council of Barcelona, one of the administrations that manipulates the highest budget - EUR 661 million for 2011.
Both nationalists and peoples agree with the fact that PSC could lose the mayors of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the Socialists would not get the majority to avail themselves of their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Taking into account the republican debacle, it would not be fantastic if this training lost its representation in the Barcelona Mary - it is necessary to obtain 5% of the votes.
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
Nationalists are convinced that they can be the protagonists of the fall in the capital of Tarragona, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP recorded only a difference of 500 votes compared to PSC, including Major Angel Ros, maintaining very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they met several times.
Popular people have also recorded progress in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Currently, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to form lists in a maximum number of localities.
The Catalan cell has facilitated thousands of passports to Al Qaida
In addition to the seven prisoners in Barcelona, there were three in Thailand
The seven Pakistani and Nigerian officers detained by the General Information Commission of the Police of Barcelona formed a jihadist cell that, directed from Thailand, facilitated passports to various groups of Al Qaida, including "The Tigers for the Liberation of the Tamil Land" (LTTE) and "Laskar e Taiba" (Let), the last to be the author of the Bombay attacks that killed 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of the Interior has given great importance to these investigations, in order to ensure that with "the Kampai operation" the Al Qaida falsification device was "weak" at the international level and "as a result, its operational capacity".
Researchers estimate that the cell, in the two years during which it was active in Catalonia, has been able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, or they have been falsified and then distributed to groups that would integrate the Al Qaida criminal galaxy so that its "combatants" can cross European borders and other Western countries with total impunity.
The decommissioned cell is not the only thing that the jihadist network was operating in Europe, so that other European police units were involved in the investigations, except for Thai services, so there could be the following days of similar beatings in the European Union on Tuesday night in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Ashar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade), another one was held in Thailand, with the capture of Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thai Siriklaya Kijbumrung.
They were those who led the cell implanted in Spain and other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network - including part of which was hit in 2009 - mainly flew from tourists the passports that met the conditions marked by the name "Islamic World Front".
That is to say, the documents were to be on behalf of young men aged between 25 and 45 years, with a validity of several years and without printed visas.
Researchers point out that so far no detail has been found that connects prisoners in Catalonia with the Bombay attack, even though the author of this attack, "Laskar e Taiba", was one of the recipient groups of passports stolen in Spain and then forged in Thailand.
However, it should be recalled that a few days before the attack was committed, a shipment agency was sent from Catalonia through a few thousand dollars that had been "invested" to buy mobile cards that were used after the members of the "commando" who killed 106 people.
The police found themselves in a lot of documentation.
PP asks Mas to suspend tax complicity
The PPC leader, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to personally expose his conditions to Arthur Mas to support his investment as President of the Generality, identical to those exposed during the campaign, and which sum up giving priority to the recovery of the economy and the lack of philo-sovereignist adventures such as the economic complicity that the nationalist leader wants to address half of his mandate.
The President of the Catalan Peoples arrived at your meeting with Arthur Mas with the certainty that he had obtained 18 Members in the elections last Sunday, a number more than enough to make him like himself, because the candidate of the U.S. requires that at least one of the formations of the opposition abstain from the investment vote.
A possible agreement with the PP depends on the future alliances that nationalists want to keep in Congress during the general elections, but, for the time being, the conversations that Mas has today with the rest of the political leaders are in Catalan key.
And with regard to the President of the PP, to support an investment "it should eliminate all sovereign and independent speeches", and the economic complexity - similar to that of the Basque country - that the convergence leader wishes to submit even to the referendum.
Both leaders jointly supported their efforts to weaken the political apparatus of a very excessive autonomous administration and to eliminate the tax applied to inheritances and donations.
Details of the Mas investment negotiations will be taken care of by PC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who has promised a hard opposition - , Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will do so with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Citizens) and Joan Laporta (Solidarita Catalana).
The geriatric claims that the dead were not due to the "no measures"
The owners of the Olot Centre do not remove the possibility that their night nurse killed more than 11 elderly people
The leaders of the hierarchy La Caritat d'Olot (Gerone) offered yesterday a press conference to highlight the damage caused to the institution by the criminal behavior of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who killed at least eleven elderly people who he was responsible for during the period he worked there.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, was accompanied by the Centre's lawyer, Joan Cañada and announced that "the desire of the Caritat would be to be able to prosecute the responsible" for the dead, but "the legality and responsibility compel us to take over the procedural situation of civil liability".
And apart from the social discrimination the entity may suffer because it has not detected the criminal activities of the night nurse, the great threat to Caritat now takes the form of an important compensation that legal representatives of the victims' parents already calculate.
Joan Vila Dilmé admitted that the first crime of August 2009 and that from that day on he did not stop killing.
The judge mentioned in the sentence that he ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the geriatrics - which he suspected that in many cases no doctor would personally explore the deaths but, given the age and pathologies of the patients, the formality took place by telephone.
The Caritat, through its director, categorically denied this situation yesterday and said that "the lack of measures could at no time have been the cause of what happened".
La Caritat's lawyer added that "in this case there is only an indication of the folly of any other person who is not accused".
The person who was already baptized as the "Ange de la Mort" admitted 11 murders earlier today and details that he committed the first crime on 29 August 2009 and a month and a half later he killed a second grandmother.
In this case, he caused death by injecting an insulin overdose, unlike the first crime he had committed with a mixture of sedative pills.
The Director of La Caritat mentioned that it was difficult to control the access of the centre staff to doctors.
Insulin injections and sedative cocktails had been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in her desire to alleviate internal suffering, used to kill them.
But laboratory analysis will clarify if Vila does not lie by saying that he sought for his first victims a less cruel death or, on the other hand, burned them inside by giving them as negative as he had already admitted that he had done with the three women he killed in the 12-17 October period.
The Caritat does not believe the statements made by the night nurse, nor the number of murders committed, nor do they eliminate the possibility that the number would be greater and justify their attitude by the different versions Vila gave in his visits to the Court of First Instance and the lack of logic in changing the way he killed after successfully committing eight murders.
That is why they declare that they will remain available to justice to clarify the scope of the facts.
ECB's threat
The investors reacted suddenly yesterday to Trichet's yesterday's threat that "markets should not underestimate our response capacity".
The differentials of the devices have been forced down and the European banks' shares have increased by more than 5%.
However, we must no longer underestimate the ECB's ability to cheat and the euro has barely recorded an increase, which is an important signal.
What happened yesterday is typical of a liquid market that collapses in the same way that it collapses, recovers, but is motivated by closes of short and very speculative positions.
The institutional investor will delay losing fear.
A month ago, the ECB called us today to withdraw liquidity measures and we will have to retire for the fourth time in two years and those remaining.
The Bundesbank required the completion of the public debt purchase plan due to its inefficiency and the elimination of all extraordinary cash measures and leaving only unlimited weekly access.
Following the Irish crisis, we hope to extend the current liquidity measures "at least until March" and maintain the sale of quarterly unlimited access auctions at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity at least by June.
We hope that we will continue with the bond purchase program and even give the signal to intensify it.
If they do not meet the expectations generated, they will reverse the excellent reaction of yesterday's markets and if they continue to be blind to withdraw the liquidity measures, that God helps us!
Just as during their May meeting in which they claimed that they had not even planned to purchase bonds and that they had collapsed the markets, the story could happen again tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced the basooka Monday and Wednesday he said he had already bought a lot, causing a new collapse in the market.
Yesterday's one-year deal in Portugal was very poor.
The Treasury issued only 500 million to 5.28 per cent compared to 750 million to 4.81 per cent of the previous survey.
Even so, the types in Portugal have dropped 30 basic points throughout the curve, and clearly reflecting a change in market sentiment after the words of Trichet.
The figures of the Allied and Bank of Ireland were published in Ireland.
The estimated figures represent 10,000 million in the short term and 15,000 potential and they have a deadline until February to obtain private capital or will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after not having detected the problem in July with the stress test, the figures are assumed in the Assistance Plan and help reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday, the Government will have to obtain parliamentary approval of its new budget and it has not yet had sufficient support, so Ireland remains in an uncertain home.
Angela Merkel moderated the tone of her speech to relieve tension before the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December, in which it was necessary to find a political compromise that demonstrated that we are a union and that we all interpret the same partition.
The problem is that Germany wants to interpret Wagner and the rest of the Hyme of Beethoven's joy.
In Spain, the President had the opportunity to present yesterday the plan of action approved by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous communities and financial entities, reduction of deficit, liberalization, privatisation, measures to re-activate employment sound to investors' ears like the four seasons of Vivaldi.
The double effect of Trichet and ZP explains the fact that the Spanish Stock Exchange amounted to 4.5%, the double that the rest of the European Stock Exchanges.
Unlike February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain has been rapid and radical and we benefit from the surprise effect.
Today, there is a three-year commitment that will benefit from the Trichet effect, so we hope that this will resolve with a strong demand and help resolve doubts about our refinancing capacity.
To ask for a Assistance Plan, Spain would be self-immolation.
They would give us a liquidity line that we do not need, the Treasury has more than 40,000 million available in cash, the triple compared to March, very expensive types and they cut access to sine die markets.
However, the strategy must continue to be that of Caesar's wife, "other than the being, the appearance".
Courage, we can get out of it!
The President of Eulen will challenge the council of Vega Sicilia requested by his sons
The storm does not stop in the open conflict within the Alvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Álvarez, the founder of the group, will contest him because he considers him to be "no right", the court council of El Enebro next 16, requested by five of his seven sons, in which they will try to make their majority stand up and take advantage of the management organs of the company's owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Alvarez and his sons Jesús David and María José grant their legal battery for the new chapter of their dispute for the control of a part of the group.
The founder of the largest holding of business services for companies does not appear to be willing to surrender in his dispute to be present in the management bodies of El Enebro.
Of his board of directors, five of his seven sons were excluded who were appointed administrators at the shareholders' meeting on 18 January this year whose dispute is registered in the Register of Commerce and Societies.
El Enebro's judicial council for the next 16, convened by the Magistrate Commercial Number 2, again opened the box of toners within the Alvarez family.
The appeal to the judge to set up the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only mechanism that guarantees the assembly's convening.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is described by David Álvarez as a "despiteless appeal from the applicants to try his five sons, has through a procedural argument, clearly violating the Law and abusing the right, to validate and correct the assembly radically void on 18 January", according to his official spokespersons.
This argument will be the basis for a dispute once the assembly has taken place, considering that it is "no full right".
The same protagonists, who maintain a discreet silence, have already tried unsuccessfully that the magistrate convenes an assembly in June.
In El Enebro, an estate company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, David Alvarez's sons control 100% of the capital.
However, the founder of the group of services seeks 51% of the capital, according to family protocols.
This case is the fundamental issue that the judge must decide after hearing the application for a complaint for which there is not yet a reported date.
Red Bull triumph in F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
A software creates improvements to real-time cars.
As soon as Red Bull entered the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history in this select universe of speed was marked by surprise and success.
At first, no one took into account the options of a new curry that had just arrived, despite the upward course of the last season, last November, in the last stage of the championship, they all set off on the Ferrari triumph of Fernando Alonso.
Without diminishing the skill as a champion pilot, German Sebastian Vette, and not the ability of the Renault engine that drives his car, in the world of Formula 1 we talk about the legend of the "secret weapon" that the Siemens multinational company has put into the hands of Red Bull to turn it into a winning team.
This is actually a powerful process simulation software that the German company launched on the market in 2007 with very far-reaching objectives of high car competition.
Named PLM, this powerful computer tool was used to create assembly chains for manufacturing plants from around the world, energy stations, high precision instruments.
The aim is to reproduce, faithfully simulate the product or process before it is actually built, thus avoiding the inevitable defects and costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft or Nissan's most famous utility vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, responsible for the Siemens industrial division, explains that the use of this computer tool in its Formula 1 plant allowed Red Bull to create and run "in a short time, almost in real time", the changes, changes and improvements detected during the race and trial.
Russwurm explains that the 1992 scurries had an average of 10 technicians in their teams who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements to vehicles each season.
In the Red Bull team today, 180 young high-skilled professionals are working, who are equipped with powerful computer equipment to analyze and design all kinds of changes to the housing.
Siemens’ leader explained that the PLM software is capable of analyzing and improving all the elements of Red Bull’s cylinders except the engine, which is Renault’s sole responsibility.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
Changes can shift from the virtual reality of the simulator to reality within 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
As a unique limitation of this madness of technological development there is the amount of $40 million that each Formula 1 team can spend as a limit each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has installed the high-tech plant to create and produce its bolids in a village 50 kilometres from London.
These are two buildings where visits, especially for journalists, are limited.
Everything that's going on down there is considered "top secret."
The staff for this duty account for 580 people, including two pilots, the Vettel and Mark Webber champion.
Red Bull's Formula 1 hero is no doubt the latest Sebastian Vetell champion.
Among the enormous technological resources that the energy drink brand has put into service its participation in the circuits, there are other hidden protagonists, whose activity is invaluable and zero notoriety.
The plant's technology director, Steve Nevey, said five years ago that R+D's progress in racing cars contributed 50% of the wins and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have changed and technology accounts for 85% of success, while pilots contribute 15% of the added value.
Nevey admits that the Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computer, because "they are unpredictable gladiators".
HP will install 20 clean stores in two years with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened his first exclusive store in Barcelona in collaboration with his partner Pont Reyes.
This will be the first of the 20 trade network between 80 and 100 square metres that the multinational plans to install in Spain over the next two years.
The company will account for this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multi-brand centres such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte English.
The Vice-President of HP Spain, Helena Herrero, has given as an example the remand store located on the Grand Via de Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with which she has worked for 30 years.
The North American Group prepared a plan to implement 200 brands in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes 20 Spanish establishments.
The first openings were those in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, the one in Barcelona being the third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the next possible stores, even though she admitted that Madrid could be the next destination.
The HM Personal Systems Director has ensured that the philosophy for the implantation of stores will always be the same, with the support of a local distributor with the experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American Group advises and deals with the design of the exclusive furniture of stores (with products that can be affected in an interactive way), which will hold an identical image in Europe.
In addition, HP covers the training of the staff of the institutions.
Helena Herrero denied that it was a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive trading network claims "to improve the service offered to customers and SMEs in the purchase, assistance, post-sale and even packaging".
The Barcelona store includes a space with a global pioneer pilot program that solves the possible problems of HP computer equipment in guarantee.
An online service connects with a technical centre located in Maastricht, the Netherlands.
"So in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can often take two days."
"This system is specially designed for SMEs and users, as large companies have already contracted technical assistance services," Helena Herrero said yesterday.
Sabadell bet on 'fly' a million customers at its rivers in three years
More optimistic than other leaders, Banco Sabadell's deputy administrator, Jaime Guardiola, believes that 2011 will be a tough year for the banking sector, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the passive war.
In spite of this, it provides for a fragmentation of the margins of interest, which will be tried to offset partially with increases in commissions and credit prices.
Sabadell expects to capture a million special customers within three years, his task to perform.
Sabadell has found a way to operate over the next three years and has the ability to survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The Bank will launch in 2011 a new management plan that will hold a three-year maturity.
The objective, apart from surviving without the need to use FROB's public subsidies, is to gain a market share by the capture of a million new special customers - 700,000 if you borrow those who can get out of the bank - its great task is to carry out, because so far this bank has lost more SMEs and companies than the particular client.
This year he captured 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share to individuals is 3.5%, while it exceeds 10% in companies.
Another basis of the 2011-2013 plan is the productivity parity, or what is the same thing, austerity, with cost reduction as an objective, whose challenges will be explained by the bank when it presents the results of the exercise.
Few banks are currently reluctant to set goals and make them public, as the financial crisis has disrupted all plans in the global banking sector.
Sabadell, in fact, will complete this year's plan for Optima, established four years ago, even though the plan initially was for three years, but the market situation has determined its extension for an additional year.
Customers who let the savings box escape will be their main goal.
During a breakfast organized by APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 would be a "hard and transcendental year".
The executive, in fact, thinks that the outcome of the crisis in Spain "will be slow".
In addition, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create jobs", which is essential for the survival of the banking business, he insisted.
And even if he thinks that the liability war - which penalises margins - is reduced, the risk premium price that banks and cash pay for its emissions to obtain liquidity is already moving at the credit price to compensate for the loss of margins.
"The aspect of liquidity and funding is structural and will be a pressure factor on credit."
"We haven't closed the tap, but the differences are higher," said Guardiola.
Banesto has already ordered his network to limit long-term credit and increase the price of differentials - see CincoDías of 22 and 27 November.
He also noted that the banking sector's trend now is "to increase commissions", but "there is a competitive framework".
Sabadell's management plan is based on organic growth even though, as always, the group does not eliminate the possibility of carrying out corporate operations.
It is not in vain that he ensures that in Spain "we will demand larger dimensions."
"Everything will move next year," he said.
He states that capital needs are "greatly increasing" and some Spanish financial entity could enter the red numbers.
And he points out that FROB can replace the market in fund-raising in the case of new recapitalisations.
After ensuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of the markets, he has reduced the importance of some bankers already predicting as a new liquidity crisis.
He points out that we cannot issue, but rather than what happened in June, we can obtain short-term funding through rest, which will alleviate the crisis.
ECSC rejects the possibility of a second wave of mergers among the boxes
The Director General of ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday the possibility of a new wave of mergers of savings boxes and again insisted on the speed with which the restructuring of the sector is carried out.
When the Spanish savings funds concentration process began, there were several entities that ensured that they were not allowed to participate in this first phase and that they were reserved for the second phase.
However, the Director General of the Spanish Confederation of Caisses d'Épargnes (ECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday the possibility of producing this new wave of operations.
"I think that most of the mergers have been made, we cannot say that the incorporation of Cajasol into the Banca Cívica group is a second phase, these are adjustments."
"Most have been fully accomplished; instead of 17 it is possible to go to 13 or 14, but all major processes have already been carried out under the supervision of the Bank of Spain, which has worked very hard in this operation as well," said the leader.
In the statements during a breakfast of the Association of Leaders and Executives of Aragón (ADEA), Olavarrieta stated that the concentration process is "at the highest possible speed and we must be very satisfied with the way it is achieved in the times set in the past, not now, in business plans with the Bank of Spain", he emphatized.
"The 45-cash transition with an average of 28.500 million assets to 17 with 75.500 million is an even process in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% to be much larger to be consistent with Basel," he said.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there is a number of rather unlucky views on the slowness of the process" that demonstrate "a lack of seriousness and meaning", because "what the Bank of Spain has to do is remind us that we must respect the deadline before the end of the year".
The Director General of ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday ensured that Spain has the most stringent financial system across Europe and "probably" of the world and that it has given people who doubt it a "no knowledge".
The leader noted that given the current economic situation, "we can stay very calm" with the situation of financial entities and savings funds, a system that started a "very important" concentration process and "gos to the greatest possible speed".
He also recalled that the Spanish banking sector was well aware of the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and the German red line
Berlin has chosen to remain in the euro, but it has set the conditions for the Union as a whole.
Market tensions have led to a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero announced new adjustment methods, ranging from tax reductions for SMEs, the regulation of private investment agencies or the abolition of EUR 426 without professional contribution to the privatisation of 49% of AENA, the management of Barajas and El Prat airports and 30% of the State Lottery.
On the other hand, Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, joined the criticisms of Chancellor Angela Merkel with regard to his responsibility for decommissioning the current crisis.
How should these movements be interpreted?
It should be noted that Merkel's position is not an error in its communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another restriction of the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And there Germany has a radically new vision of what its future must be, which shocks with that of maintaining the former traditions of most of its partners.
In the face of European resistance, Germany is beginning to speculate on the three possible outcomes of the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, integrated by itself, Austria and the Netherlands, among other countries, and the south would leave the monetary area.
The second, the recovery of the Mark, even though it now seems to be science fiction, with a very favourable opinion, almost 50% of the population.
The third, a new concept of the euro, in line with the German proposals for greater macroeconomic control, budgetary rigour, fines to countries that violate them, possible suspensions of payments from one of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and it has long been defined, so now there is no room for excuses.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission stimulated deficits, the German Government invented a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of differences between what Germany thought should do (tax rigour and fiscal stability) and what its European partners, including France, were doing.
The second blow of the Central European country was when Merkel difficultly extended the decision to save Greece.
Since then it has been the subject of a fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public opinion and the publication were against Greece's rescue.
Finally, by the end of October, Merkel once again expressed a clear position, calling for the reform of the Union Treaties to enable a country to recover and at the same time oblige private lenders to bear part of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European because it has speeded up the Irish crisis and the rest.
But his proposal, although slightly sweet, was approved and, in the following months, we should attend the Union reform process that makes these measures possible from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that it will not cross.
And she tells us all that, even if we now have to take measures with which we cannot agree too much, from that date on, the former operation of the euro would have ended.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary zone, in which countries that violate the rules will be severely punished, they may be required to declare themselves at the end of payments and, in this case, the private sector will also bear a portion of the costs.
Germany tells us that we must follow a tough path of growth with high savings and investment rates, consumption moderation, productivity and competitiveness improvements and positive external balances.
An alternative based on debt and construction, with huge gaps in the balance of payments, such as the one that presided over Spanish growth in the years of boom, will simply not be tolerated.
It's clear.
And it would be wrong not to hear it.
This is not just about bringing the public deficit back to 3% in 2013.
What we're asking is much harder.
And what he must not do in these circumstances is fool ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will bring us a greater calm.
And that we know how to seize the opportunity we've been given, until spring 2013.
President Zapatero seems to have also heard this form and his double statement (the reforms promised after last Saturday's meeting with the big companies and the announcement of yesterday's new measures) suggest that, despite Merkel's criticisms, we have opened the way to the thesis that must be ordered from house to house.
But the red line that Germany has drawn is there, and they don't seem to move it.
And among the possibilities we are considering, we cannot rule out the possibility of abandoning an over-scrupulous monetary zone from a few countries.
And in this case, Germany will always be able to tell us that she had warned us.
Sports and fraud of the law
Russians like Alonso and Ramos against Ajax demonstrate the ingenuity but not the will to escape a penalty.
The original expulsion by two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) during the 23rd November match against Ajax in the League of Champions has made a lot of ink on the anti-sportive character of such behavior and whether the two players should be punished by UEFA.
As we know, a few minutes before the match (which their team had already clearly won), the two players deliberately lost the time when they made mistakes to determine the arbitrator to show them the second yellow card.
Thus, and given that Real Madrid will end up being the leader of its group, both players will meet the regulatory sanctions during the next match of the barrier match against Auxerre and will be able to pass without cardboard to the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA Disciplinary Committee punished with two matches the team's coach José Mourinho and various economic sums for the players involved.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances like this or similar is not a new practice, but rather frequent in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is based on the ethos, unwritten rules, but followed, of this sport.
A part of the debate that emerged in this case is due to the fact that this has been the protagonist of a team of the Real Madrid entity (which in its Hymne shows the noble and honour and has on past occasions condemned to a fine to its players for similar acts) and to orchestrated dramatization, it seems by Mourinho, who adds an additional episode to his long history of hysterical and provocative technician.
In any event, the debate asks whether this type of behaviour is expressly prohibited by the regulation is contrary to the principles of sport, i.e. whether it is a violation of the law; because they are indeed actions that are in conformity with the sport regulation, but seem to be misleading.
The question is to examine the type of harm they cause in the sport spirit.
One of the things that understand the sports spirit is the physical integrity of the opponents, an aspect that with these actions has not been put at risk, i.e. there has been no violent play.
Another of these assets to which it is alluded with the right game is to avoid that the team of the criminal players benefit from an unfair way of the opposite team, which is not the case anymore.
However, the paradoxical fact of the action of the Real Madrid players is that it does not fit to be normally characterized as fraud or fraud of the law, because its violation of the rules has not been made in secret to try to avoid punishment, but their action has precisely tried to be as obvious as possible to receive the punishment of the arbitrator.
They waited and volunteered to accept the penalty.
Another issue is the type of advantage that offenders gain from the alleged intentional errors.
Here it seems necessary to note that we do not put ourselves in a competitive disadvantage situation and we do not gain an advantage in the same match, because obviously the result of the action implies leaving their own team with fewer players.
And this is not a useful strategy for the next match, as the club could not rely on these players.
Of course, the advantage is that players will start the next phase of the Champions League without any cards that can threaten their participation in a future match.
But this is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indetermination, because the team could be eliminated all at once and for all, with this action the players carry out a sanctions match and pass on to the second round of cartons, in which the suspension due to the accumulation of cartons occurs with less than the first round.
So, recording the scales, it's not so clear that it's an advantage.
In the end, these actions are not contrary to the sports spirit, which makes even a part of the strategic decision making that makes the most of what the rules allow.
In our case, the players did not act to avoid the application of the sanctions (this would in fact be a clear case of fraud of the law), otherwise they chose the moment when they submitted to it.
They made a strategic decision without enjoying or escaping the penalty.
Although the frontier between genius and fraud of the law is widespread, on this occasion I think we have had a clear case of genius.
The controversy seems to me to be due to two factors: there were two auto-expulsions and the way the directive was transmitted to provoke them.
The harm caused by these actions to the principles of sport is not as ethical as aesthetic.
Offensive offers to capture Christmas dinners for groups in NCBs
The dictatorship of the calendar concentrates this year on an avalanche of reservations for days 16 and 17.
There is a proliferation of self-funded celebrations by employees who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the bull and the lottery, when December comes, they also come back to dinner groups before Christmas that continue to be the oxygen balloon for Barcelona's restaurants and entertainment, but which because of the crisis have resulted in an offensive price adjusted to catch the majority customer: almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros in dinner or lunch, coincides with business men and associations in the interviewed sector.
To complete the accounting complicated, this year's calendar (as the night of Saint Sylvestre falls on Friday) concentrated the applications in the week of December 13th, which has so far resulted in an avalanche of dinner reservations for the days pic (on 17 and 17) and almost nothing the previous week.
Since 2008, which is the origin of difficult times, there have been many companies that have eliminated collective money for budgetary reasons.
To maintain tradition, many employees organize them by paying for their own pockets.
Whatever the situation, they all ask for battle prizes, confirms the President of Gremi de Restauração de Barcelona, Gaietà Farrás.
The representative of the boss now does not hesitate to predict how the festivals will be this month.
"People think a lot before booking."
"They want to get out, but they pay a lot of attention to prices," he says.
The case will go well "for those who give quality at good prices and with good service", he adds, and recalls that customers tend to go down a level with the crisis, so that the euro round has become majority in demand.
In a survey in various centres of the centre, there is a collapse of applications for the night of 17.
The Soteras Group points out that there is a genuine boom of applications for this Friday, with the claim to spend less than 30 euros, to which they responded by adapting their menus to the economy, with full formulas of 25 to 35 euros.
In the case of another group of the most powerful, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the speciality of the calendar assumed more anticipated reservations, even from the beginning of November.
"We made it impossible to maintain the same prices last year, with menus for all tastes from €19.95 to €30," they said.
AN Group, which includes El Mussol, Attic, Quu and a total of 23 premises, remains optimistic after having detected a lot of billing since the second half and good, although concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources of the group mention that the 18 will also be a hyperactive day at the level of groups of friends celebrating the holidays in advance.
At their six group menus they added one for Christmas, with 30 euros or more as a famous budget and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend 10% more than last year instead of demanding more details, such as Catalan wine produced according to the champagne method - 'cava'.
They also see the first signs of improvement in some companies again invite their employees and the feeling that the volume of groups has increased slightly.
On the part of the Fecasarm patronate (which includes entities such as the Bars, Restaurants and Entertainment Association of Barcelona), its Vice-President, Enric Gomà, is entrusted with the possibility of starting to see the end of the tunnel and argues that reservations are "animal" globally, even if the customers "negotiated to the maximum".
That is true, does the hope of the holidays not diminish, regardless of who pays, indicate.
Pakistan's nuclear programme brings great concern to the United States
Islamabad produces atomic weapons at "a faster pace than any other country".
Wikileaks filtration confirms the connection between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of correspondence between the US Embassy of Pakistan and the United States Department of State filtered by the Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous concerns caused by the Pakistan nuclear programme in Washington.
Apart from the enlightening and enjoyable details that offer about the content of the talks and thoughts of the US diplomatic representatives accredited to Islamabad, the documents reveal that cooperation between the two countries in the field of atomic security, instead of increasing, "decreases" and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons "at a faster rate than any other country in the world".
The particularity of the Pakistani nuclear programme - the fact that weapons are not assembled, but are stored by components to make their destruction difficult in the event of an attack - is one of the main reasons for concern in Washington.
This is how Ambassador Anne W. Patterson, in Pakistan, listed in a report prior to the visit of former National Security Adviser James Jones: "The proximity of certain nuclear installations in the territory under attack under the Taliban, the dispersion of nuclear materials whose short noise and vulnerability to the transport of nuclear materials."
The large number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programmes is envisaged, not only by the United States but also by Russia, as a proliferator and a reason for maintaining custody.
"Pakistan has to hire staff with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear installations; given the decline in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people working in nuclear or missile programmes," said expert Yuri Korolev, of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs during a meeting with his American counterparts.
The new documentation filtered by the Julian Assange portal is the ever-increasing cooperation between the United States and Pakistan in the field of nuclear proliferation and the high degree of Pakistani nuclear weapons production.
A launch from the Embassy in May, which describes communication with Pakistan as "frustrating", supports the following: "Transparency is often non-existent; assistance offers remain unanswered or eliminated".
In another message, Peter Lavoy, a national intelligence officer for South Asia, notes that "in spite of the economic catastrophe, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster pace than any other country in the world".
Ambassador Patterson also asked Washington, during a visit by the Chief of the Army, General Ashfaq Kayani, to explain "very clearly" to the person responsible that "the Pakistani Army must end with the tacit support of terrorist groups".
To the hunt of the chief of Wikileaks
Obama will be responsible for the anti-terrorist struggle to avoid new infiltrations.
Interpol issued a red warning to follow the movements and locate Assange.
All aspects related to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, form a complex labyrinthe where it is difficult to have certainty about the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red alert" to "localize and follow the movements" of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest order.
In addition, this is not new unless it is dated 20 November.
And he has nothing to do with the last filtration of more than four million diplomatic documents in the United States, but with the allegations of sexual abuse faced by Australia in Sweden.
In addition, Wikileaks' creative lawyer Mark Stephens ensures that "the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange".
The 20 international police force in Lyon (France) issued the order at Sweden's request, but it did not make it public until yesterday, after having been authorized by the authorities of that country.
Thus, the 188 countries of Interpol received an indication to identify or locate Assange "to obtain its provisional arrest and extradition".
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, according to the organization's explanations, consider the net call to notify a free way for the arrest -- which the national police body must carry out -- especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, such as the case of Sweden and England, where Assange is believed to be located.
The movement was angry with Assange's lawyers, who yesterday published a letter denouncing that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks was willing to respond by video-conference to Swedish authorities' questions.
They also recall that Assange requested and obtained permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, that we compare to the famous Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, head of Stalin's security.
"This seems to be a hunt, not a legal persecution," the missive reports.
While the world is looking for him - and in Australia his mother defends the innocence of his son -- Assange continues to be in an unknown place, but he was not afraid.
On Monday, he gave an indeterminate interview to the director of the Time magazine through Skype, a conversation in which he requested the resignation of the Secretary of State of the United States, Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be shown that it has been responsible for giving orders to US diplomats to the United Nations by violating the international treaties that the United States has signed, it should resign," he said.
His opinion was insulted yesterday by the press secretary of the White House, Robert Gibbs, who described the application for resignation as "ridicule and absurd".
"I'm not sure why the opinion of a guy with a website should interest us," he said to the CNN.
Obama himself has been responsible for the anti-terrorist struggle, Russell Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama's spokesperson's attempt to reduce the importance of Assange contrasts with the views that conservative politicians and commentators proclaim these days.
Peter King, the congressman who will chair the National Security Committee in the Lower House from January, asked the Department of State to study the possibility of including Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organizations "to confiscate their funds and continue to provide them with contributions or assistance".
Even further, Tom Flanagan, a Canadian President Stephen Harper's adviser, went back to his statements after saying that Assange should be "killed".
"Obama should turn it into a target and use an unmanned plane or something like that."
One person who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and possibly a presidential candidate.
"The person in the Government who has filtered the information is guilty of treason and anything other than execution would be too kind of punishment," he said to Fox.
Puigcercos seeks peace in ERC with Carod's appetite eyelids
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet offers a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercos seems to have found the recipe to resolve the fifth internal revolution within the ERC, without north due to the loss of 11 Members and half of the votes.
The president of the party is aware that his threat of resignation is not sufficient for the followers of former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but at the same time he knows that the influence of this sector is now as diluted as his liar and that it cannot at all give him any headaches he had with other widespread currents.
That is why the leader of Esquerra will try to win his new criticisms with eyelids that allow him to wander to the municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 national councillors of the ERC will be able to decide on its confidentiality.
By ballots, not by raising your hand.
If the charodists want to drive a certain vote of penalization to the president, they can do so without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the leader of the class wants to avoid the image of division and the one of submission to his person.
In several interviews he claimed that he would not be considered ratified with half more than one vote, but he added, without mentioning the percentages, that a result "to Bulgaria" would not be good anymore.
People close to Carod require the president to put his position at the disposal of the militia, a gesture that does not apply when Puigcercós controls the maximum body between the congresses.
But since they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will try to agree with the executive a road map by May.
To this end, they hope to participate in the preparation of the strategic reorientation document that the management will submit to the vote of the National Council on 18.
His intention is to support Puigcercos in exchange for his promise to program the convention for the fall of 2011, which the leaders consider to be a sure fact.
The leader of the ERC agreed that the "polyphony" affects stability and that his goal is to make it possible once for all the organization to wash his family room.
In this line, the article that current advisor Josep Huguet signed in his blog is a symptomatic result.
Considering Puigcercós' ideology, the owner of Innovação thought that the leader would be "in exchange for various objectives" was as if it had been done.
And he numbered five of them, and two of them he highlighted.
The first, "recompose" the executive to represent at least 90% of the militia, i.e. include new figures coming from the carod sector.
The second can be the character of a big new one.
Huguet proposes that once and for all the assembly be liquid ERC as a operating mechanism.
It therefore advocates a reform of the statutes that enables congresses to be conducted through delegates elected by suffrage.
Ending with the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, was an obsession of the Puigcercos team, which has already fought in this regard in the last two congresses.
In fact, the 2008 Conclave Convulsions commissioned the management to review the assembly model at a specific constitutional reform conference.
This meeting remains unfinished because the internal market in recent years did not recommend addressing this issue.
Now, without critical sectors at the disposal, the time could be good for it to resume and close forever.
23 implemented in November; 290 in 2010
According to the MILENIO State of Mexico, a decrease of 4 cases was recorded compared to 2010.
In November, 23 persons were executed in the State of Mexico, four less than the previous month according to MILENIO of the State of Mexico.
The murders include the three women and the discovery of two bodies that were cut off in the Valley of Mexico.
During the previous month of the year, 390 deaths were recorded in theory related to organized crime.

One day after Nezahualcóyotl a 50-year-old gentleman was killed with eight shots of fire when he left his house to start the work of collecting orders.
On November 7, two 30-year-olds were killed by a blow of fire on each head in the San Pedro Xaloxtoc colony, the municipality of Ecatepec.

The man had an injury caused by a gunshot blow in the nude.
In the mid-month, two men were reported to have been executed in shelters and abandoned in the trunk of a vehicle in the streets of the Villas de la Hacienda department in the municipality of Atizapan in Zaragoza, at the same time as the victims were found two death alert messages.
One day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the Valle de los Reyes colony in the municipality of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby colony the rest of the body was found wrapped in a black plastic bag with a message signed by L'Incorrigible.
On the 17th, wrapped in blankets, two women were found in the hamlet of the municipality of Ixtapaluca and the next morning they located the body of a man in Huixquilucan who had been wrapped in a yellow and blue cover, being in principle identified with the name Mario Ríos, according to a message that his executioners had left beside him.
In Ixtapaluca, a woman's body was found dead in the hamlet of San Francisco Acuautla with gunshots in the nude.
On the woman's skin she was detected tattoos of Santa Morete and necklaces with her image.
By the end of the month, the body of a man was found on the side of a car in the municipality of Zinacanantepec with at least three impact of the ball and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the bodies of two men with their head enrubu year and a message were found in the community of Puente de Piedra in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the bodies there was a message signed in principle by a criminal organization, which said, "This is what happens to those who do not align themselves."
In Ecatepec, with signs of torture and with hands and feet attached, two bodies were found within a taxi abandoned behind the Centre of Justice of the San Agustín colony.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were found in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcoyotl.
The first one had been decapitated in the Cuchilla Ancón colony and had been wrapped in black plastic bags, attached to a canal rubber and a side message; while the second had been tortured and found in a plastic bag in the streets of Colonia Juárez.
Next to him, the officers found a Bristol with a message.
China maintains its targets for greenhouse gas reduction
The representative of that country in COP16 made sure that his country had made great efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and detailed that it maintained its bid to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by between 40 and 45 per cent by 2020.
China maintains its bid to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 per cent by 2020, assured Su Wei, a representative of that country at COP16.
In its first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei made sure that his country had made great efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and convert his industry.
In fact, he explained that over the past four years his country had invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Nevertheless, he made clear that China would not change its objectives, but would continue to work with the international community in this area.
He mentioned that the Chinese climate change strategy is divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity-building; institution-building; and support for pilot programmes.
Progress has been recorded in all these areas, including approval, last year, of a new Energy Act, which recognizes the objectives discussed with regard to greenhouse gas reduction, has been explained.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, federal authorities worked in a coordinated manner with governments and local authorities to achieve energy saving targets, efficient energy use and emission reduction.
Furthermore, it stated that there are various multi-year plans under way or completed, both funded by the Chinese government and by the governments of other countries.
For example, he referred to the Energy Efficiency Programme, which has been implemented over the past five years and has received investment from the United Nations (UN), the Government and the private initiative.
There is also a provincial climate change project, another for the change of fire-fighting lamps by economic lamps and another for mitigation and adaptation, he said.
At the same table, Martin Krol, the scientific adviser of the Government of that country on climate change, ensured that China's efforts were greater than we thought.
For example, it explained that per capita greenhouse gas emissions in China are three tonnes per person, while in the United States it is 100 tonnes; China is responsible for 9 per cent of the historical contribution to pollution.
Similarly, it has made unprecedented efforts in the use of energy, how to increase energy efficiency by 20% in the last five years and plans to do so by 2020, he said.
Legal expulsion of Espino: César Nava
The national leader of PAN said that the former Panist leader has the right to address the National Order Commission to claim what is right.
The national leader of PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that Manuel Espino Barrientos' expulsion was legal and that the former Panist leader had the right to address the National Order Commission to claim what was right.
In his interview prior to Gabino Cué Monteagudo's protest as governor of the state, he said that in any case, Espino's expulsion is a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Sonora Order Commission."
"Mr Espino has the right to address, where appropriate, a complaint to the National Council Order Commission, so that it is a decision taken within a competent body," he noted.
On the other hand, it has clarified that this is not the time to think about 2012 and there has never been an alliance for presidential candidacy on the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez declared himself convinced that Action National would be stronger after the internal elections of 4 and 5 December, where a successor should be elected.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is an aspect that has never been on the negotiating table, at least for the time being, it was an approach for the local elections that had succeeded and achieved its goal," he said.
The Panist leader mentioned that PAN was supported by 71 years of dialogue, which is why "internal competition doesn't scare us; on the contrary, "we will smell it and make us stronger," he said.
He said that the council would no doubt elect the best leader(s) that Action National needs for the next three years, so he would refer to "the person determined by the council."
"I'm completely quiet and open, I'd be proud to leave the party president's office to any of the five."
He predicted that the Party's resumption of the elections last July 4 will be reflected in the next dispute, even though "it is not the time to think about 2012."
"For the time being it is to accompany Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments that come from alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a cause for observation throughout the country, so that there is "a lot of hope for them, and I am sure Gabino will be at the height of expectations".
When we asked about PRI's criticisms against President Felipe Calderón because of his speech during his four years of government, César Nava asked the petitioners to reflect on the six years of former Presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas of Gortari.
"If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo y Salinas were better than those of Fox y Calderón; that they start defending them; that they leave 'armour'," he said.
He stated that the holder of the Federal Executive may make expressions such as those made in his speech in the National Auditorium, because there is no balloon in the country, and even less censorship.
Obama promotes the law for paperless students on Twitter
"If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, call your senators and ask them to approve this legislation," Twitté said the American president in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama has today met with national mobilization to support the Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message in his personal account of the social network Twitter.
"If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, call your senators and ask them to approve this legislation," Twitté Obama said.
Its short message maintains a cyberlink with a broader document that calls on the public to contact the senators immediately, as the vote on the legislation is imminent.
"With a vote we hope for soon, now is the time to listen to your voice," he said.
The message was released after the 42 republican senators threatened to block the vote of any legislation if the increase in taxes in Bush and government funding were prolonged.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 republican senators, could affect the vote of the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START Treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Questioned about the Republican blocking of the Dream Act and other projects, Presidential spokesperson Robert Gibbs said he was confident that once the tax problem is resolved, an agenda for the rest of the projects could be set.
"I think we have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that this tax problem must be solved before the end of the year..."
"I think we can get an agreement at a given time and then we can plan the rest," he said.
The leader of the Senate's democratic majority, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that he would ask for a "conclusion vote" for the Dream Act, which is why the initiative to legitimize undocumented students could be voted on from Thursday next to the Senate, even if the most likely would be next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act or the American Dream Act would legalize 800 thousand young people who arrived in the United States before the age of 16, they remained in that country for the last five years and were accepted by a higher education institution or the Army.
But the participants need 60 votes to approve the initiative, which is why they need the support of a large number of Republicans, at times when the partisan organizations of the protagonist project have an intense lobbying to ensure the approval of the Act.
The Democrats, the majority of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against and only one Republican expressed his support for the law, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
That is why the parties to the Dream Act require the vote of several Republicans if other Democrats decide to vote against the initiative.
Among the most Courtesy Republicans there are Senators Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and Senator George Lemieux of Florida, who completed the mandate of Senator Su Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch, Utah, and Kay Bailey Hutchinson, Texas, but they said they would not support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who supported him, John McCain, has not yet defined his post.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree with the fact that the biggest obstacles of the Dream Act are in the Senate.
With literature we put the finger on the wound
The second step in the Pleasures of the Language was a walk in which participants outlined the narrative
"The sex in the language, I understand, but... the finger on the wound? what do you expect of me?" asked writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second step of the Pleasures of the language, a cycle that celebrates the literature in Spanish and this time used the subtitle of her question (while another round table was dedicated to Sex in the language, she explained).
The finger on the wound "...we put in the womb", gently launched the Argentine writer to the public, most of the young people, who met at the International Book Fair of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this moderate table by Marisol Shultz and to whom Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero participated.
Luisa Valenzuela has read a text dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio that Shultz has defined after a great story, with Luisa as the first person as a protagonist who seeks to know what the "place" is, she goes from one doctor to another, without getting an answer, only tracks in the same narrative line.
From the infectionologist she concludes: "The patience is not my strength, it may be my wound".
In the end, after a frustrated approach with the traumatologist who cut his breath in the middle of the corridor, but who explains that wound is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: "the wound is what is actually opened, the symbol is the scar".
The breathed protagonist is relieved and concludes: "On the wound I only knew that it is open and that it does not exist," but is convinced that the pleasures and traps of the tongue must be very linked to them.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a succinct story he called Eloge at the invention, where the finger on the wound is not named but at a given time is discovered.
With the touch of magic realism, he spoke of a famous ensorcelicle who touched the clouds, made people return who had gone far away or repaired the veritues that a lady had lost, a story that came to talk next to America, the great news that had from the beginning had its own chroniclers and quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo as criticizing the excessive narratives of the conquerors.
"Cervantes who invented us all (the writers) laughed at false witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but in a way one would never have told the story of America with an imagination that was missing even the powder."
However, he pointed out that "the fools and liars have the best imagination" and here the reality converges with the lie, we no longer know which part of the narrative belongs to a band or another, where fiction literature reaches its apoge.
This is actually called the 'Tradition of Cervantes'.
"It's thanks to his legacy that we're what we're counting on."
In turn, author Mayra Montyero noted and applauded the variety of interpretations caused by the invitation of the FIL with its round table The Should on the wound.
The Puerto Rican Cubans have taken note of the great scourge of social violence that their country is experiencing - and Latin America is sharing - producing disputes about drug trafficking and trafficking.
"I think that good literature, good poetry refers to good songs as a tacit commitment that is not necessarily premeditated," she said, after quoting that the reality of literature is the communication and dimension of the commitment between the author and the readers, and that it is a "chemical reaction" of the author.
The evening ended with the intervention of the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, who also stressed "it must be on the wound of the committed writer".
He considered that in a world that lives at a high speed also with regard to intellectual habits and the control of consciences that turn to the advantage of dogmatism, "after every assertion there is a little no and behind every denial there is a little yes".
"To be masters of our own feelings and masters of reality, we must nuance: and nuance means many times to put a finger on the wound and disturb people who feel very comfortable by thinking of caricature, in white and black, in established ideas and without nuances, and also disturb the powers that prefer a world in white and black," he said, inviting us to recover the sense of writing.
Romano at the hunt for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano had three faults in finals he had high and low in his career, but he was able to reach the final three times.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, there are also two different styles that confront themselves, marked by their technicians, who find among themselves a contrast marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano had three faults in the finals, he had high and low in his career, but he was able to reach the decisive series three times, even though he has not so far put in the thousand and that is why this opportunity is very special for him.
Argentina ended up congratulating itself on the sub-champion medal, it remained a step behind the winners and curiously with the same team he played consecutive finals.
The holy strategy came to its first final as a coach in the 2002 Opening Tournament, when he held the Queens of Morelia with whom he lost with an overall result of 4-2 against Toluca; later, in 2003 he also came to the final duel and lost again with the overall result of 3-1 and this was precisely against Rayados.
With Santos Laguna already, in the 2010 Bicentenary Tournament, Rubén again suffered a reversal because his team had made an equal match of 2-2 against the Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the series of penalties he gained an advantage for 3-1 with two opportunities to get the title and finally three of his players missed 11 meters and he suffered the leap to the result of 4-3.
Rubén lost two finals with the Red Diablos and one with Monterrey, his rival at the tournament, so he doesn't want to be the same, he tries to get rid of the evil so that he can celebrate for the first time a title, even if he claims that the institution is more important to him.
"I want to be a champion, I don't want to break any statistics, it's for a club, it's not for a passion that I have, and therefore I'll get the title, but what I mentioned before is more important," said the driver when asked what his weaknesses would be in the finals.
He remembers a lot about the last final, of which he assures him that he has learned a lot, "the only lesson we can hold on to is that until the referee shuffles the final, we can't celebrate, we are prepared in the line, the players too, because the last time, with two sentences to get us ready to run, and I think it's a lesson, before the end of the game we can't celebrate".
He knows that this series could be defined by penalties, which does not worry him, because he trusts his players: "We never try to get to the series of penalties, we try to end up in the regular time, but sometimes we just get ready, the previous tournament we have been prepared, unfortunately fate has made us a bad turn, sometimes it's the emotions or the anxiety of keeping the title between our hands, hands he's escaped, this has served us as a lesson for this final and we hope that we don't get there anymore."
Romano now has the opportunity to no longer be a champion technician and to taste for the first time the glory offered by the titles.
The European Union changes the rules for obtaining the visa
People must go to the Visa Applicants Service centres before interviewing them in the Consular Section; the cost of waiting will be reduced.
As of 10 January 2011, the procedure for the treatment of visas at the United States Embassy and consulates will change.
With the new procedure, the majority of applicants will have to present themselves to the Visa Applicants Service Centres (ASC) before their interview in the Consular Section.
ASC staff will take the applicant's biometric information, which will be revised by the Consular Section before the interview.
The new procedure will bring certain benefits to the applicants, including the following:
The total cost of treating the visa will be lower, no longer will it be necessary to make a payment for a meeting, another payment for the treatment of the visa and another for the mail service to deliver the document.
The diplomat will make a unique payment that will cover the three services.
The current rate will remain the same: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 in the case of visas requested (including temporary workers visas) and $390 in the case of commercial and investor visas.
People who wish to renew their visa will not have to present themselves for an interview with the Consular Representative, they will only present themselves to the nearest CSC where they will present the documents and their fingerprints will be taken.
Due to the fact that biometric information will be taken into the CBSA, applicants wishing to meet for a second meeting to be interviewed in the Consular Section will remain there less time than before.
Similarly, visa applicants in the Consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the additional $26 service fee.
For further information on the new procedure for requesting the visa, please visit the following page: http://mexico.usebassy.gov/bolettes/sp101201_Visas-FAQs.html
NASA will announce the discovery of extraterrestrial life
The United States Space Agency cited the press to present tomorrow with a discovery that will have an impact on the search for living beings in space.
The National Administration of Aeronautics and Space (NASA) of the United States will communicate tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that could prove the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented at a press conference tomorrow Thursday, at 1:00 p.m. at NASA headquarters in Washington for astrobiology experts, the science that studies the origin, evolution, distribution and the future of life in the Universe.
When she quoted the press, NASA assured her that it would have an impact on the search for extraterrestrial life," resulting in speculation on the part of experts from other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are creatures like us and in hostile environments that we thought were uninhabited and put on the table the possibility of becoming intelligent beings like humans if their living conditions are improved.
It seems that we are talking about a microbe discovered at the bottom of the Mono Lake in the Yosemite National Park, California, which lives in an environment that we thought was too useful for any form of life, because the lake is rich in arsenic.
In any case, the creature uses arsenic as a way of living and this ability makes us think that a similar life could exist on other planets that do not have our voluntary atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, this proves that "there is another form of life, a second form of life, different from what we know."
The Space Agency will communicate the true scope of the discoveries at the press conference tomorrow, Thursday.
The conference will be attended by geobiology Pamela Conrad, who is studying the possibility of life in Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who is studying Titan (Saturne's largest satellite), with the prospect that his chemistry is similar to that of Earth.
Warm PRD, PT, Convergence and Block Pattern
With reforms to the Organic Act of Congress, the arrival of 'bipartism' is made possible.
The 60th came to settle when in Congress there was an opposition block led by the PRD, PT, Convergence and Jesús Manuel Patron Montalvo, who declared himself independent and the four questioned one thing: the arrival of 'bipartism' in the Chambers.
Before initiating the installation session of the 60th Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, de Convergencia; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, de PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, de PRD; and Patron Montalvo, 'tonna 'tonne' against the reform of the Organic Law, because it excluded them,
With this reform, have they reiterated, 'bipartism' is being started because now there are two people, from the same number of parties, who control Congress.
These four MPs, next to Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of PRD, were the only to vote against the Directorate chaired by PANist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, as Vice-President.
Corvera Quevedo mentioned that these reforms institutionally constitute the political marginality of PRI and PAN.
He said that the following days they would speak to the representatives of PAN and PRI to modify the scheme with political will and if they did not, they would be again served by the two parties, and in this way the opposing coalition would end.
"So far (the opposing coalition) is what I am looking at, because we are excluded from any decision, they have not even the political reference to consider the opinion of the rest."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, from Convergencia, mentioned that there are incidents with PRD, PT and Pattern and that is why they form a plural group.
We cannot allow the Congress, after being monopolistic, or "duopolistic" to continue.
"This is not the spirit of the reform of the law that there is eternal bipartism in Congress."
To begin with, this group starts with 5 legislators and they are now talking to other colleagues to make them more numerous, the Convergent has said.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of PT, explained that at present Congress has become a 'butin' between two, making an allusion to PAN and PRI.
"Before there was only one party, now they divide it between two."
Mr Montalvo asked to respect the person of the Member, to give him his place at the negotiating tables.
"That they do not leave out of the 5 dome agreements that are likely to be 9 Members, now at five that we see, separated into different fractions, we have decided to join us to find a place in the negotiating table, that is the problem, that in the reform they have done, that they have decided, that we are outside and that we do not agree with this reform."
$200 million more for "the supplier"
The Mairie de Mazatlán pays another check to the owner of the electrical equipment company.
Another check of about 200 miles of pesos for Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by Mary.
With this, the amount paid this second semester to the owner of the electrical equipment company is 1 million 200 miles.
According to the municipality's transparency page, this last check number 9258447 was issued last November 16 for the amount of 200 thousand 144.56 pesos, in the form of "supply clearing".
Treasuryer Luis Miguel López Moreno said that the Community would pay other amounts to this supplier, which was observed by the State's Higher Audit to sell at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total debt and, therefore, how many cheques will still be issued in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
"We didn't buy anything, we just pay him what we owe him, like the rest of the suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: on 24 September, two on 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and the last on 16 November.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal of the State, according to the provisions of the Act when a company is questioned by ASE, in order to avoid other governments using its services, the Treasury has ensured that they have not used its services again.
All this, after 25 July northwest had published a review of the checks issued by Mary to her suppliers, revealing that in the period March 2008 - July 2010, in the triennial of the Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the paid municipality of Camacho Palazuelos has more than 10 million pesos, through 42 cheques.
He also conducted transactions with Jumapam, covering checks of more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist sites must be cared for
Tourist entrepreneurs regret the accident of a foreign tourist because of the bad conditions of the Sánchez Taboada round-point in Mazatlán.
After the collapse of a foreign tourist in a crossroads of the Sánchez Taboada round-point, Mazatlán's tourist sector asked the authorities to pay attention to areas and sites that are under bad conditions and to design a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Traders of Zone Dorada, recalled that they have repeatedly asked for the image of the destination to be taken care of and that new activities should be replaced by others that tourists find bad.
He said that the bad condition of the streets and sidewalks had affected because tourists had just walked there and they saw the disorder and avoided close trades.
"Politicians don't know what it means to shut down a business one day and they don't know the luck we lose, but they didn't do the work for so long and without adequate planning."
Hotelier José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said the downfall of the tourist exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance on the part of the Mary.
"The municipality will have to assume its responsibilities and avoid this happening again, how to do so, so it has a preventive interview and not only does the correction," he said.
"We want to enjoy a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area we have to maintain it, but as inhabitants who deserve a clean place to live there and Mary has to change her strategy to keep the city well."
There are other sites that are neglected and incomplete, he said, such as Escudo and Venadito de Mazatlán.
"Today, because the tourist comes, this depends not only on promotion, there must be a good product, a city that has the property in its beaches, boulevards, permanent maintenance of tourist attractions," he said.
"We didn't pay attention to them, and this kind of fact emphasizes something that is familiar to everyone, maintenance is necessary."
Raúl Llera Martínez, under Secretary of Tourism Promotion, said the recovery of Mazatlán's tourist sites is urgent because they are not used properly and are designing a bad image.
He talked about a series of places that must be put together with the municipality and be a priority for having the city's up-to-date, clean, orderly and attractive because it has a tourist vocation.
"Happyly Mazatlán offers many historic and cultural sites and places that we should first order, clean and put us online to make them attractive so that we can add them to the inventory we have to make the promotion of this destination."
IP requests results at Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CCE, proposed that Members assume the great responsibility of being an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various challenges they face.
The Mazatlán business sector calls for a decent and free labour legislation between the parties and the Government Executive, because Sinaloa is convulsed and faces major problems.
Yesterday the 60th legislation was established by seven political forces, 19 PRI MPs, 13 PAN, three from the New Alliance Party, two from PRD, one from PT, one from Convergence and one from PVEM, a total of 40 popular representatives.
The list of expectations that new members of the Government Congress are a clean and committed management with society and the different sectors that need responsible legislative work and that the same models of party or paternism do not repeat.
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CCE, proposed that Members assume the great responsibility of being an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various challenges they face.
"We hope that the Members actually exercise their right, free of agreement between the parties, because the custom is that they make agreements to ensure their own interests and they turn into a carnival mask of the governors and leaders of parliamentary factions."
That is why I ask them to certify their commitment to establish the necessary bridges that the current Governor is making progress.
"We will make sure that they do decent work, especially with society and sectors, because the people of Sinaloa gave them their confidence in the past elections.
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, considered that one of the major challenges of the 40 popular representatives was to push and add forces by seeking the economic growth of the state, because the economic situation is now very complicated.
"The most important thing is that they stimulate economic growth, that they generate incentives for investment and infrastructure, and that will in a way stimulate the generation of jobs."
With regard to tourism, he asked that the new legislators give him the importance he had in the government budget to consolidate the Secretariat of Government Tourism.
"I understand that it is the second State Secretariat with a smaller budget and it is inconceivable as an important and generating economic activity of currency and investment and that it competes directly with the agro-industry."
Apart from the fact that resources must be classified into detonating tourist projects that help to secure the State and update the Alcohol Act that previous legislation has not been able to resolve.
We're looking for a king of magic
Puppies, cars and bicycles, among other toys, are the desire of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For their parents, the next day of the Mages will be difficult to fulfill their illusions, because their home is formed by no more than 12 people and a goat.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesus, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaiah, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Melchior, Balthazar and Gaspard will bring them the toys and clothes they so desire.
The family has a humble house in Colonia Salvador Allende and they live today because their father doesn't have a stable job.
"Sometimes it's very difficult for us because my husband doesn't have a job, but we sell mandarins and potatoes...and after the afternoon I go out with the 'plebs' to sell in the street," says Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the children.
Adelaida, 4 years old, wants a doll or a bicycle, and her three-year-old sister Isabel would like a Barbie doll.
In his turn, 10-year-old José Alfredo longs to have a 'monster truck' and for his little brother Jesus, 8 months, Cayettena suggests size clothing for one year.
"He told me (José Alfredo), 'I'd like to have this monster', but I told him 'we'll see, my son', because it was very expensive," he recalls with sadness Cayetana.
For older children, who were in school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
Maria Guadalupe, 11 years old, was wearing size 12; Isaiah, 10 years old, was wearing size 10, while Michael, 8 years old, was wearing size eight.
José Juan, aged 14, needs a pair of sports shoes, so a pair of size five and a half or six would help him a lot.
If you want to help realize the dream of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family you can participate in the campaign On Search King Mage, by giving a toy or money to receive from Northwest.
14 alleged drug traffickers arrested
A dozen searches were carried out in Austria on Wednesday as part of the dismantling of a cannabis production and sales network.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will face various charges.
The searches took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mostly in places that would have been used for drug production.
"Approximately 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of haschich, silver and production equipment were seized," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesperson for Québec Security.
All in all, eleven men and three women were arrested, including the two leaders suspected of this network, two men from Sherbrooke.
The detainees were to be compared to the Sherbrooke courthouse within hours of their arrest.
They could deal with charges of production of cannabis, possession in order to traffic, plot and steal services, among other things.
These investigations took place as a result of a long-lasting investigation, which lasted almost a year.
"It is from the information received from the public that allowed us to carry out these arrests," said Mr. Ruel.
Some 70 police officers from the regional investigation module of the Estrie de la Súreté du Québec, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphremagog Police Region participated in this police operation.
The illegal migration can continue without any problem
The draft law of the Conservatives, which, according to the Government, should solve the problem of illegal migrants ships, is of course to be fought while the three opposition parties indicated on Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I rely heavily on the Charter."
"I stand with a party that has created granite under your feet," said liberal leader Michael Ignatiff, while he was surrounded by MPs after the weekly caucus meeting.
The Liberals claim that the proposed bill, which would allow anyone from a ship identified as carrying clandestine immigrants to hold up to one year, would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The head of the Quebec Bloc, Gilles Duceppe, also indicated that he could not support the bill, because he took it to the wrong target.
"We are against and it seems that all parties to the opposition are against, so we will see what the government will do," said Mr. Duceppe.
The NPD's immigration criticism, Olivia Chow, rejected the criticism that her party was not strong enough about clandestine immigrants.
"Neo-democrats agree to take action against smugglers and that is what we do through another bill, the C-35," said Mrs. Chow.
"We do not support the draft Conservatives' bill because it takes refugees and holds children for at least one year," Ms. Chow explained.
The Minister of Immigration, Jason Kenny, accused opposition parties of playing politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
"Canadians say massively to MPs that they do not tolerate this kind of clandestine migration, these criminal operations that target Canada and treat the country as a paillasson."
"They expect Canada to take firm action," said Minister Kenny.
The Government did not announce a vote of confidence on its bill, which could have led the country to elections that led to its rejection.
One Conservative, however, told the QMI Agency that the government would ask for a vote so that each member who opposes would then explain himself in front of his voters.
The new unit does not do the same
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a permanent unit to combat corruption and collapse by Jean Charest, many observers continue to request the establishment of a public investigation committee on the subject.
The Minister of Public Security Robert Dutil argues that this idea does not date yesterday: Quebec would have consulted the New York Department of Research on this issue as of January.
The metropolis has a permanent unit on corruption since 1870.
However, Tuesday's announcement surprised more than one.
It should be said that at a permanent meeting of the Québec Police Services Council on 29 October, this measure was never discussed in spite of Robert Dutil's presence.
There was no longer any need for the Pakistani public security critic, Stéphane Bergeron, to call this announcement a "lapin out of a hat" and a "bricoled solution at the corner of a table".
Minister Dutil replied to those who feared that political power would have too much influence on the possible future unity.
"You're going to see the result when we're going to announce it, he's happy to say it."
"We are aware of this problem."
For the President of the CSQ, Réjean Parent, nothing can replace the establishment of a public investigation.
"The more Mr. Charest insists on not wanting to set up this committee of inquiry, the more people think like you and me that he has something to hide," he explains.
"The only way to have a commission of inquiry is to resign Jean Charest," explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
To get out of this impasse, he therefore suggests that Quebec give a special mandate to the Auditor General to investigate corruption and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the general auditor's mandate," he said.
He also believes that Quebec could give the verifier the same powers as a commissioner, thus enabling him to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent squadron is not the only project in the charts of the Charest government.
Quebec would also ask Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code to better adapt to this type of crime.
This request would be made by the prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law is not explicit in such investigations.
The Federal Minister of Public Security, Vic Toews, confirmed that his fellow Justice colleague, Rob Nicholson, is currently considering some of the amendments relating to this matter.
During the Spring 2001 operation, which hit the motorcycle groups, even though the Criminal Code was not adapted, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently introduced the Gangsterism Act.
High-monitored rivers
Several water courses remain under high surveillance due to heavy rainfalls that have hit several regions of the province since Tuesday.
A landing took place on Wednesday afternoon, in Shawinigan, Mauritius.
Two houses have been evacuated in a preventive manner.
In the evening, another glazing would take place in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, Lanaudière.
A road went down.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, heavy rainfall fell on several regions, from 40 to 70 mm of rain.
From 20 to 40 millimeters of additional rain were expected by Thursday evening, depending on the regions.
The sectors north of the river and in the valley of Outaouais were the most affected.
They could receive up to 100 millimeters of total rain.
As these precipitations must be added to the already accumulated snow source in certain sectors, several watercourses are feared.
Flood alert warnings were issued on Wednesday evening by the Québec Civil Security for the Oueau and Achigan Rivers in Lanaudière.
The rivers of the North, in Saint-Jerôme, in the Laurentides, and in China, in Lotbinière, were the subject of flood guards and would remain under surveillance.
In the Lanaudière region, the high precipitation caused some lakes, in Sainte-Julian, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a temporary bridge was taken due to heavy rains.
Ten residences had to be evacuated by preventive measure.
In Outaouais, the landing of certain lakes led to the closure of several roads, including in the municipality of Mansfield and Pontefract.
Civil Security remains on alert and closely monitors the situation, said Annik Bouchard, a security adviser.
For its part, the Centre for the Prediction of the Québec Crusades issued on Wednesday the warnings of strong crusades for several rivers, including Maskinongé, L'Assomption, Oueau, Achigan, Batiscan and du Loup.
Partially blame dupont
Québec Radio Animator Stéphane Dupont faced a partial reversal before the Canadian Council of Radiotelevision Standards (CCNR) for controversial talks about social assistance and Haitians as well as about its wholesale wave language.
The CCNR considers that Mr. Dupont and his team of CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their views, but that some of the issues contained "inaccurate information on social assistance, improperly negative representations of Haitians and gross language that do not fit broadcasts during the day".
The Council also concluded that a discussion on suicide, including the dissemination of the name of two persons who had committed suicide, did not violate the broadcasting codes.
CCNR had received several complaints about comments made during broadcasts between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made following a complaint from the Québec Joint Social Assistance Front.
The group complained that the amounts quoted in the issue were incorrect.
Animators should provide solid information rather than misleading information.
With regard to suicide, animator Stéphane Dupont felt that suicide was a gesture of laxity.
Most members of the Committee concluded that the vehicle message was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to the problems of life.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the "Dupont the Midi" episodes have dealt with a sensitive subject in a fair and appropriate manner."
No blame has therefore been held in its place.
The last dispute was about statements that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort were then delivered to a media-face that had caused many reactions.
CHOI's animator stated that he had made no donation to help the Haitians because it was not possible to know for sure that the people in need would really receive the money.
The Committee believes that these comments were not abusive, but that their cumulative effect was an indisputable negative representation of the Haitians.
"I've already given my three-day suspension over there."
"My file has been a virgin for a year and a half," said the animator.
In all decisions, the Committee deplores the widespread dissemination of language.
In each case, the CHOI-FM broadcaster collaborated "in addition to its obligation".
The consequences are minimal for the station, which, among other things, will have to announce these decisions once during the hours of great listening within three days.
A king of kung fu in Montréal
The Montréal of Algerian origin Nacereddine Zemmal has an extremely special course.
The athlete who excels in "sand" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and Thai boxing climbs on the world's tatamisms and rings in search of new challenges.
"I started practicing martial arts such as kung fu and kickboxing 12 years ago, in Algeria, Zemmal, installed in the metropolis since 2008 to evolve among professionals."
"In my case, I'm looking for fights a little everywhere, because for those who don't like the game on the ground in mixed martial arts, competitions are rare in North America."
Recently, the person who works as a security agent and as a commission for the UPS has just released bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Carate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) amateur World Cup in Edinburgh, Scotland, from 23 to 30 October.
"I won the categories of kickboxing full contact and Thai box, he explained."
"At present, I'm getting ready to go to China for the World Cup of San Show."
"The fighters who finished among the first four in the last world championship in each category were invited."
"I won the bronze in 2009 in Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished eighth."
"In 2007, in China, I finished the fifth grade tournament, while I arrived third in Toronto in 2009, did he add."
"What's interesting is that I've progressed to every competition."
"At this rate, I'll be first this time or next year!"
The "san show" or "sand" is an original discipline from China where punching and footing, as well as ground projections, are allowed.
The duels are originally on a platform and rarely in a ring.
The most famous Pugilist from this form of combat is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, well known in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal has only one event in his career, he will certainly respond to his presence at the super tournament "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of kung fu.
"This competition is the most famous and prestigious in China, explained the gaillard sympathique."
"It's a little like the Lumpinee Stadium (the largest stage in Thailand)."
"It was a great experience."
Zemmal won his first match, half-final of his category (80 kg) before losing in the end.
"The one who beat me was a real pro, did he analyze."
"There are four fighters per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The semi-final winners face the end of their category."
"Then the conquerors of each category face each one in order to crown a single champion, the king of the kung fu."
450 million in contracts without calls for tenders
Hydro-Québec granted $450 million in contracts to engineering firms for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, it is a consortium formed by BPR, Dessau, SM Group and Axor that has obtained the most important, the project management, for a sum of $295 million without tendering.
This consortium called Energy Management was formed in 2004 in conjunction with the Hydro-Quebec's choice to entrust the private sector with its responsibility to manage this important 5 billion-dollar hydroelectric project.
At the beginning of 2005, the Energy Management Consortium dismissed the lucrative contract without calling for public tenders.
For the Quebec Party, the use of business consortia poses a serious ethical problem that could eliminate competition and lead to an increase in prices.
"It's the new way to make a collision and bring down competition."
"That is, people, instead of doing this in secret, now make it open," Pakistani MP Sylvain Simard said yesterday in a press conference.
Earlier this morning, Mr. Simard raised the issue in the National Assembly because he said it was difficult to see how the public interest could be used in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, replied in the afternoon, denying that there was a collision for this contract.
"I'm starting to have my trip," she said, arguing that the PQ had been "unfair" and had "suddenly."
She said that "it would be the least of the things" that the PQ apologized for.
The formula of consortia is a common practice around the world.
This is usually a limited-time alliance that allows two or more companies to pool their respective expertise to respond to a call for tenders for a complex project.
The Eastmain project has a high level of complexity in view of the scope of the work.
The building is underway and has to leave until 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without the competition game acting; there was negotiation.
Thus, the formula of consortia is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As revealed last week by Le Devor, the formulation of consortia in the engineering sector is the subject of an investigation into the government.
A quick survey of the Quebec business register allows to name more than 200 consortia, some of which seem permanent.
For example, Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, including CIMA+, Genivar, SNC-Lavalin and other Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens, brings back to one and even moral person, Dessau.
With regard to the Energy Management Consortium, Minister Normandeau pointed out that "the territory of Baie James responds to particular labour dynamics and that Hydro-Québec has been particularly responsive since the 1970s".
The major project patron of the Eastmain project, Real Laporte, of the James Bay Energy Society (SEBJ), explained that the project's management contract was granted with grace.
"If you go to bids and there are few bidders, your prices will be higher."
"You have two choices: whether you take people who are in this market and you say: we will negotiate a satisfactory deal and with a good price."
"But the idea is that it is not the price that is important, that is the competence of people," said Mr. Laporte.
This contract awarded to the consortium Energy Management is part of a long list of contracts of more than $50,000 obtained by the Quebec Party.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, Le Dedor has counted 109 engineering and consulting contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to firms or their subsidiaries, including soil laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin recorded 22 contracts, Genoa obtained 16, Teksult 14 and Dessau 10, regardless of its participation in Energy Management.
All contracts were negotiated.
They total $449,783,344, including the Energy Management contract of $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard said that the four firms that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Group SM and Axor) are "well known in the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau has let it fall that the PQ is also linked to these firms that "finance it" before stating that it was rather its leaders.
Barometer of responsible consumption - "green" label does not inspire confidence
Greener, but frankly skeptical.
The Quebec consumer lacks confidence in actors for sustainable development, but also in equitable brands and environmental certifications to guide its choices.
Pis, even though he lies in a media universe where messages in favour of more responsible consumption are pulsating, he regrets a lack of credible information, lack of which he even qualifies as a brake to his commitment, indicates the Barometer of responsible consumption, whose first reading was delivered yesterday.
Even though they increased the consumption of products that were socially responsible in 2010, Quebecans seem to give very little credit to those who were trying to sell them.
Two thirds of them say they do not believe the environmental commitment of companies as well as the green advertising of companies, reveals the measuring tool developed by the Sherbrooke University's responsible Consumer Observatory.
Another finding is that half of consumers doubt the reliability of official certificates based on the said products but also the credibility of products and brands that appear to be eco-responsible, says the Barometer.
In the same vein, the speech of politicians on this issue is taken seriously by only 14.6% of Quebec.
However, information on responsible consumption seems to be essential to stimulate the current consumption of food by close to one third of Quebec's consumers.
In fact, the void and suspicious nature of the information would calm the fires of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the Barometer, after the highest price of these products.
In addition, one third of Quebecers also say that they are unfaithful to the alleged performances of green products or services they are trying to put in their hands.
On another note, consumers were almost half in 2010 to have changed their habits and, above all, changed their brand of one or more products to respond to their conviction.
At a height of 61%, they also promoted purchases from traders in their neighborhood and privileged the purchase of food products grown in their region, says the Barometer.
More green and responsible - the responsible consumption index has reached 64 above a maximum of 100 for this year - , the Homo consumus du Québec likes to appear as the king of recycling seeking to reduce its environmental footprint by worrying about animal protection.
However, its social and ecological consciousness seems to remain outside its car, says the Barometer: in 2010, almost 28% of Quebecers indicated that they had used public transport or recommended co-supply to defend their green interests.
The walk and bike were also supported by 39.1% of participants in this extensive behavioral survey, which has just taken its first click.
A State loan for eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, to whom it was asked to engage financially in the purchase of the eXcentris cinema complex by the Angus and the Parallel Society, agrees to cooperate, but only in the competition of a loan.
The Angus and the Parallel Development Society, which were expecting a seven million dollar donation from the Ministry of Culture to buy Daniel Langlois the eXcentris film complex on the Saint-Laurent boulevard by giving him his full film career, did not get what they claimed.
The Government agrees to be involved in the case, but under its own conditions.
Rather than the expected donation, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan whose amount would be lower than the initial expectations, which could be a viable solution to favourable conditions, at least in the opinion of the sources from the State offices.
A first action plan and an application of 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec in the last spring, but the requests have since been reviewed.
A proposal and action plan were sent to Minister St-Pierre by the president of the Society for the Development of Cultural Enterprises (SODEC), François Macerola, who is piloting the eXcentris file.
He got him a last report a dozen days ago.
But the counter-proposal of the cabinet arrived at SODEC on Tuesday.
The Parallel and Angus have until 31 December to respond.
However, it seems that the assumption of the gift of the State must really be dismissed.
We recall that the Québec Film and Film Park Owners Association opposed a direct investment by the State to support the purchase of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture did not have to finance real estate projects, which it did not do for other cinema halls.
On the contrary, several environmental stakeholders called for substantial economic assistance.
Daniel Langlois, the master of the sky, for ten years carried the author's cinema to his complex premises after financing his own construction, which could justify a derogation from the Treasury Board.
The lack of rooms for independent films is being created in Montreal, and eXcentris had been able to trust his clientele.
The company Angus and the Parallel, with their head Christian Yaccarini, piloted, on their side, a private funding campaign, hoping to collect $700,000 to push the acquisition wheel.
Since spring 2009, one of the three screens, Le Parallele, has continued to broadcast films to eXcentris.
The aim of future buyers is to reopen the three halls on February 27th by designing the very beautiful film by Xavier Beauvois Men and Gods.
But Christian Yaccarini didn't remember Le Deoir and we ignore what he and his group think of proposals at the bottom that are made to them.
The veil raised on a complex Canada...
The new American diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks raise the veil that the United States sees as the Canadians' inferiority complex to Americans, but they all betray the feeling of superiority to Canada.
Thus, US diplomats are surprised that every Canadian elector does not have Canadian-American relations in mind by voting and believe that President Obama's visit helped the conservative government to adopt its budget in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, located in the public square yesterday, offer more gruesome details than the substantial content to be placed under the teeth.
A cable dated September 22, 2008, in the full federal electoral campaign, relates how far the United States is not part of the issues discussed by the political leaders.
To the great surprise of the US ambassador to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins offered some explanations to this situation.
"An almost inherent Canadian inferiority complex may require Canadian political leaders to talk about internal everyday issues rather than make this election on the United States (as during the 1988 Free Trade Campaign)," he wrote.
The United States is therefore, in conclusion, "the elusive proverbial of this election: omnipresent but potentially too threatening to talk about it".
The ambassador understands from a much smaller point of view this "suffering silence" that both countries have an intense political and economic relationship.
" Logically, does he consider the ability of a candidate, a party and even more than a party leader to manage this essential relationship should be a key factor that voters have in mind by voting?"
The other expression of this sense of importance is in the cable sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, responsible for business in Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help ensure the government's survival when the vote of confidence begins in February on the federal budget, by which Canada will display its first deficit in more than a decade due to a resumption plan of $30 billion to $40 billion," writes Mr. Breese.
No mention was made of the fact that the government had to extend Parliament before Christmas in order to avoid being reversed by the coalition and that opposition parties would make their survival conditional on the quality of the proposed resumption plan.
Another communication, dated January 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkins, prevents Washington from increasingly negatively depicting the broadcast of the drama series to CBC from returning to the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about Border, Little Moscow on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O shows little subtle references to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or to the removals for CIA's muscle interrogations.
Another cable reports that, at their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked his French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe was ready to welcome some Guantanamo prisoners.
Mr. Kouchner replied yes, but on the basis of the "house by case".
At the end of the meeting, it was written, "He sent a paper to the State Secretary about Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Canadian Muslim."
"The secretary agreed to review the file."
Finally, let's note that the spirits are heating up about the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, a very close former adviser to Stephen Harper, said on the waves of CBC that the responsible for this massive escape should be "killed".
Mike Huckabee's echo in the United States.
A Global Plan to Renovate Light
The United Nations proposed yesterday in Cancún a plan for the renovation of domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries with a view to achieving a greenhouse gas reduction (GGE) corresponding to almost a third of the additional reduction needed to stabilise the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is in the crowd of major concrete projects that the United Nations hopes to adopt in Cancún to compensate for the absence of binding commitments to reduce by industrialized countries.
According to yesterday's plan, if the incandescent ampoules that are still monopolizing from 50 to 70% of the market were replaced by fluocompact ampoules or, better, by electroluminescent diodes (DEL or "LED") ampoules, the essential of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of GES emitted on the planet would be avoided.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This is the equivalent of 70% of the emissions of the planetary car park.
In Copenhagen, last year, large emitters such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed themselves to voluntary reduction plans that should bring GES global emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But it will have to be removed from this balance sheet another 5 Gt in order to stabilise by 2020 the rise of the climate to 2 degrees centigrade in order to avoid it becoming out of control.
In the incandescent ampoules, 95% of the energy is dissipated in the form of heat and the rest, or 5%, is produced by light.
With fluocompact ampoules, energy expenditure is reduced by 75% and with new LED ampoules, this need for energy is reduced twice again.
Fluocompact ampoules last from 6000 to 10,000 hours on average.
New LED ampoules, such as those launched by the manufacturer Philips this week - this company also participated in the study of the United Nations - have a living hope of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent ampoule, which gives an idea of the economy with a replacement plan that would apply to 100 countries.
All these new ampoules can also work with rheostats in addition to producing very little heat.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several specialists have posted reservations to the place of fluocompact ampoules as they contain mercury and need to be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries unless manufacturers put in place signs.
But, says the report, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the fluocompact ampoule, but the coal thermal power plants, which emit a lot of mercury to produce spent electricity in incandescent ampoules.
In the United States alone, these plants emit 25,000 tonnes of mercury per year.
The report details the gains that each country would make through this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would thus save one billion dollars a year in electricity purchases and eight million tons of CO2, or the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants whose construction would cost 2.5 billion.
Côte d'Ivoire expects nervously to announce electoral results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the publication of the results of the presidential election in Côte d'Ivoire after the deadlines have expired.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and announce the provisional results without further delay, he stressed a spokesman for the United Nations Chief of Staff."
"It calls on all Ivorian parties and institutions to prove responsibility and refrain from any initiative until the announcement of provisional results."
Despite the pressure from some foreign governments, the electoral commission let the upcoming Wednesday afternoon date pass without publishing the results, three days after Sunday's vote.
About forty minutes before the expiry of the deadline, the Chairman of the IEC had stated on television that the commission "was continuing to work" to announce the results.
The calls multiplied in the world on Wednesday to finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and the opponent Alassane Ouattara.
But the Gbagbo camp relies on the cancellation by the Constitutional Council of "fraud" votes in the north, held by the ex-Rebellion of the New Forces (FN) since the coup d'état failed in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, campaign director of the Ivorian President, said that the intimidation of UN voters in the north of the country had deterred the president's supporters from voting.
All elections could be cancelled if the complaints filed by Gbagbo were retained by the Constitutional Council.
However, Gbagbo's opponents believe that the highest court in the country is not neutral because it is led by Paul Yao N'Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the North who detachs all ties with the former rebels, considered the delay in announcing the results and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but he did not go until he claimed the victory.
His allies claim that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results because he knows that he has lost and that bringing a complaint before the Constitutional Council, after preventing the electoral commission from disseminating the results, would be illegal.
The second round of the presidency, Sunday, was supposed to coronate a country's reconciliation and reconciliation process in two years.
The United Nations warned the Ivorian political class on Wednesday that it could be held responsible for any violence.
Laurent Gbagbo finished the first round on 31 October, with 38% of the votes against 32% in Alassane Ouattara, who received public support from former President Henri Konan Bédie (25% in the first round).
Unemployment rate remained stable in France at 3rd quarter
The unemployment rate in France within the meaning of the International Labour Office (ILO) remained stable at 9.3% per metropolis (9.7% in the overseas departments), showing the adjusted seasonal variations (CVS) that were published by the Insee on Thursday.
The number of unemployed is 2,631 million in metropolis.
Data from the second quarter were confirmed at 9.3% of the active population in metropolis and 9.7% with DOMs.
Over one year, the unemployment rate is displayed above 0.1 points.
More broadly, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France did not work in the third quarter but wanted to work, whether or not they were available within two weeks to work and whether they were looking for a job or not.
The situation of young people on the labour market has further deteriorated, with a new increase in the unemployment rate, reaching 24.2% in metropolis (+ 0.9 points over three months, +0.5 points over one year) and 25% including DOMs.
In the third quarter, 637,000 young people between the ages of 15 and 24 were unemployed within the meaning of the BIT.
Seniors have experienced a slight increase in unemployment, 6.4% in metropolis (+0.2 points over three months and one year), 482,000 people aged 50 or over, and 6.6% with DOMs.
Only 25-49 years of age have been stable in the third quarter, at 8.3% in metropolis (-0.1 point in three months, +0.1 point in one year) and 8.8% throughout France.
The Insee no longer publishes monthly unemployment rates since 2006, after a discussion on its calculation method.
Eurostat, the European Union Statistics Agency, on the other hand, continued to do so and announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% for France (including DOM) after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guerini was examined and detained
Alexandre Guerini, 53 years old, head of waste and brother-in-law of the President of the General Council of Bouches-du-Rhône, was examined and seized at the Luynes house of arrest, near Aix-en-Provence in an investigation into alleged fraudulent public markets.
Alexandre Guerini has been examined for the abuse of social property, misappropriation of funds and public property, rape, active corruption, trafficking in influence and possession of ammunition, says his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guerini is combative and tends to explain all the questions the magistrate will ask him, not ghosts."
"It's easy to pursue it for a lot of reprehensible leaders, it's another thing to prove it," he told AFP his lawyer, Florence Rault, before his client's hearing.
Mr. Guerini, a brother of the strong man of the PS in the department, Jean-Noël Guerini, had, through his lawyers, had to send a memo to the judge before his hearing to explain himself.
One of his relatives, Philippe Rapezzi, was also examined on Wednesday night and crushed.
According to his lawyer, Me Lucien Simon, his client has never done anything but make the discharges he had to manage.
As to the allocation of the markets or the allocation of the funds related to their operation, he never knew, said Me Simon.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former Director-General of the Aubagne Aglomation Services, was examined on Wednesday for the diversion of public and complicit funds, and was released under judicial control with the prohibition of meeting the file's protagonists.
"My client has been able to provide explanations of the facts that are accused of him."
"The Master's Magistrate has taken into account that he is not deprived of liberty," said his lawyer, Me Yann Arnoux.
Four other persons had been examined and released on Tuesday to Wednesday night, with a judicial review for two of them, said the Deputy Prosecutor of the Republic of Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Director General for the Property of Marseille Provence Metropole (MPM), is being pursued for "trafficking and passive corruption".
Two officials from the Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Briguier's agglomeration are being examined for one for "destruction and diversion of public goods by one person in charge of a public service mission", the other for "complicated in the diversion of public funds".
Finally, the company of Alexandre Guerini, Jeannie Peretti, was examined for "the crime of abuse of social property".
Among those who have been confronted with Mr. Guerini is Mr. Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently found in a parallel case of fraudulent public markets affecting the Corse.
Investigators suspect that their companies have served to whiten the money of big banditism.
The investigation is carried out in the context of a number of open judicial information against X in April 2009 following anonymous e-mails, for alleged fraud in public procurement, particularly in the waste chain.
From a close source to the investigation, the research focuses, among other things, on the conditions for the allocation and operation of a discharge from La Ciotat, which collects the waste from Aubagne as well as certain cities of the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss case: Elysée exacerbated Syria's mediation
For more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher arrested in Iran for "sponsoring", held the opinion in Haleine in France, put diplomacy in alert, and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
Everything is carefully looked at by U.S. diplomats.
The American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by The World reveal some of the following.
They describe how the Elyse explained its strategy to the Americans, going to give them advice on dealing with their own "housing" crises in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how the French authorities have sought to convince Washington that the release of the young French had not been counter-participated by the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and sought by American justice for the trafficking of materials for the benefit of the Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, they put under a harsh light the way the French Presidency tried to manipulate the media to credit the idea that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad had played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss.
Actually, it was nothing.
A diplomatic telegram written on August 12, 2009 in Paris is entitled "Iran: French comments on how to manage accommodation cases".
The Elysate's strategic affairs adviser, François Richier, accompanied by the Director of the Orsay Quai for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, interviewed US diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method.
They advise the Americans to do so to repatriate their own nationals who are detained as a force in Iran.
"Fades of noise," they say, "martulate continuously" in the media the words "the fundamental human rights", "innocence", "immediate release".
It is necessary to make the Iranian regime more difficult, sensitive to its image.
"Make it as much as the Iranians ask you not to."
Because, in the course of attempts to discuss through discreet channels, "the silence won't solve anything", Iranians are "masters in dilatorial maneuvers".
Mr. Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners is "a family Iranian tactic: taking hostages for political blackmail".
He announced that Clotilde Reiss' release (which will take place on August 16th, the day she took refuge in the French embassy) "will require payment to Iranians of a large amount of money" (€230,000).
And he makes it clear that Elysate anticipates other hostage crises, a phenomenon that "will worsen."
Iranians could "in the near future arrest another of some 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss has been released from prison for 12 days, but remains blocked in Iran.
Information is disseminated: Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose United States claims extradition for illegal trafficking in sensitive electronic material to Iran, is released to Paris on a judge's decision.
The American embassy, like many observers, is asking about this disturbing coincidence.
The expansion of Majid Khakavand is a bad news for Washington, who is tracking Iranian illegal networks of acquisition of nuclear material.
Did France accept a trade?
The release of the Iranian against the French?
In a new interview with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September, François Richier assures that this is not the case.
Elise, he said, not only "was completely surprised by the judge's decision" but sought to oppose it.
"There were lively exchanges between the French presidency and the guard of the shields" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot return to the judicial decision," he observed.
Mr. Richier also wanted to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand remained under "close" surveillance of French information services.
The Elysée's advisor is a telephone number, hooked up, and then informs the American diplomat that the Iranian "is currently located in buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian embassy".
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, Elysée did not take up his efforts by means of media-organized communications and "flights", to make it clear that Syrian President Bakar Al-Assad played a "significant" and "influence" of "mediator".
The Americans observe this activity not without irony, and they find that the manipulation bears its fruit as several press articles affect the official French version.
A telegram dated August 25, 2009 refers to "the media 'blitz' of French officials".
On the basis of so much "gratitude" expressed towards Mr. Assad, the embassy in Paris is asked.
"Despite their full statements of praise, French officials privately acknowledge that they have only a vague notion of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document then focuses on the reasons that prompted Elysate to pay for this fiction.
The intense communication effort "is intended to validate Sarkozy's policy of opening up to Syria", he said.
A policy launched in 2008, which "had then been perceived by many critical voices in France and abroad, as prematurated and immetriated".
By "exaggerating the Syrian role", Paris seeks "to demonstrate to Syria what praise it can attract by playing a constructive role in the region".
The goal is also to "sow seeds of disagreement between Syria and Iran".
The American embassy knows it as a good source.
On August 11, François Richier entrusted him: "Of course, we don't know if the Syrians did anything."
"But we thanked them anyway."
"That should at least sow confusion among the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returned to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives it at Elysée.
In a communiqué, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in the liberation of our compatriot".
No online games for young Koreans last night
The South Korean government will adopt a "Cendrillon" law that will prohibit adolescents from playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, reported government officials.
A bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to ask online gaming companies to block access to these games after midnight, young people under 16 years of age, reported representatives of the ministries of culture and the family.
"Many children play these games all night and then have difficulty studying at school and having a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," said AFP Jo Rin, the departmental head in charge of the bill.
Online games will be available again at 6 a.m.
The companies will have one year to prepare for the implementation of the law, has it been specified.
The Government also intends to ask companies to limit the time of daily access to these games for the young people whose parents are applying for them, added the manager.
It will also make available to people who demand free software to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and newspapers regularly report various facts about an intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the undisputed champion of online game competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, against 58 other nations.
Global 2018-2022: Fifa designates the organizer countries
In full torture because of suspected corruption, the Fifa Executive Committee designates Thursday the world Cup organizer countries 2018 and 2022, a particularly political choice where influence struggles and lobbying risk taking the step on technical criteria.
One thing is certain, the 2018 edition of the Queen of Fifa competition will take place in Europe, traditional base of discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 will be much more exotic, the International Federation hoping to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a first on the African continent in 2010, or continue its implementation in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities of delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch Heads of Government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) provides the measure of the economic and political issues of a World.
Thus, the treatment in coils is likely to last until the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy between the candidates.
According to the Fifa assessment report, English, Hispano-Portugal files (2018) and American (2022) have better arguments than their competitors.
However, these considerations will not be too heavy for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the vote.
The Sunday Times, in the light of the revelations that led to the suspension for corruption of two members of the EC (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could thus have ruined his country's chances, a football club that only once hosted the World Cup in 1966.
The BBC released a layer of it on Monday, spreading a documentary that spans three influential members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
What is it about discontenting Fifa and embarrassing the English leaders, who have been engaged in intense lobbying over the past few weeks with David Cameron on the front line.
The head of government hopes to re-edit the success of his predecessor Tony Blair, who had won the JO-2012 organisation for London in 2005.
Will this intense activity be sufficient to reduce Britain's blow to the EC?
Nothing is less certain because the Duo España-Portugal does not lack anything with its already ready stages, expertise (World-82 in Spain, JO-92 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and its foot culture.
But the dark economic and financial prospects of the two countries could be a reflection of their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against English and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal only increase Russia's share, becoming a weight loss in spite of the shortcomings in its record (stations, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to make the move to Zurich and denounced a "disloyal competition in the preparation of the vote" in an adjourned speech to the charges of the English press against EC members.
"They're covered in mud, they're trying to compromise," said Mr. Putin.
For 2022, the United States, strong from the 1994 experience, appears to be the logical favourites.
First World Economic Power, headquarters of the main sponsors of Fifa, the country seems to have a long-standing advance on Japan and South Korea, which have built a very beautiful project separately.
But these new applications appear to be premature for two countries that co-organized the trial in 2002.
Another threat is the granting of the World 2026 to China, which would make Asia's chances for 2022 in fact run out.
With Qatar, which came out of the big game by offering futuristic stages, and Australia, Fifa would continue to expand to new opposites, but these two countries present more risks than certainty.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also see the weakness of the TV rights that European countries have achieved (due to the time-consuming decline) in the war on Fifa.
Second mandate: evidence
De Gaulle was really nervous.
Mitterrand thought he was shy.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac have not had the slightest hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy is even less than they are.
One mandate to the Elyssey calls it another.
So the current head of state will be the candidate in 2012.
But the evidence does not make a good household with the part of the mystery attached to the presidential function.
So it must be done as if the doubt was still there.
In one sense as in the other.
In 2006, even without believing it, the friends of Jacques Chirac claimed that a third term was not excluded.
On November 15, with a heavy air, Nicolas Sarkozy would ensure that he would make his decision "somewhere in the fall of 2011".
So that he would say in front of the UMP parliamentarians, Tuesday night at Elysée, the prospect of "two mandates" was a little feverish.
Was that the official announcement of his candidacy?
We were far away.
The President only recalled that the 2008 constitutional revision limited the number of five years.
He was making a statement, not an announcement.
This is not the first time he mentioned the Presidential, on the tone of humour, at such meetings.
"You've still been with me for seven and a half years," he had launched them in July 2009.
Rebelote in May 2010: "Don't think that I don't think about the next step."
His speech yesterday does not make him more candidate than he does; they do not make him less.
If they make comments, that's for a double reason.
The acceleration of the race to candidate for PS, on the one hand.
But it's not Ségolène Royal's high school entrance that drives Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal.
On the contrary, it is evident from its 2012 candidacy that many in the PS are calling for an early order of battle.
Bad surveys, on the other hand.
For the first time right voters would prefer the candidacy of François Fillon to Nicolas Sarkozy (46%) versus 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion at the UMP above," the Prime Minister immediately and politely responded.
"If he believes the possible defeat, he won't be a candidate," said Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always believe he can win," corrects Alain Juppe, who is clearly recognized.
Euro: the ECB is obliged to maintain its procurement of State securities
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year should be an opportunity to specify the modalities for the outcome of the crisis or, at least, to announce the conclusion of a number of non-conventional monetary policy operations to be completed at the end of the year.
The European sovereign debt crisis is binding, and the Frankfurt Emission Institute will no doubt not be able to be as peremptory as it is to exacerbate a situation more than it is today on European bond markets.
Political costs would be much higher.
Yesterday, at a press conference, the French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde welcomed the ECB's active role in resolving the debt crisis in Europe.
She did not want to say whether she felt that the central bank should do more, by increasing, for example, its sovereign bond purchase programme.
"I reserve my reflection on my European partners (...)".
At its hearing in Brussels by the European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, was no longer aware of his intentions, merely indicating that the programme for the purchase of State securities on the secondary market was "continuing" and that "we will see what we will decide" at this Thursday's meeting.
Only certainty: the ECB will keep its main management rate unchanged at 1%, its lowest historical level since May 2009.
In fact, the ECB's Treasury bond purchases doubled over the past week to nearly EUR 1.35 billion.
And, according to market operators' indiscretions, it would have made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese securities yesterday.
Overall, the Eurosystem's central banks have purchased €67 billion since May 2010.
Among market operators, the expectations of a continuation of purchases are no doubt (see page 29).
Nor do economists expect any significant change.
If lending operations of more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB's arsenal, the latter is still subject to unlimited liquidity allocations under generous conditions and for periods ranging from one week to three months.
Economists today expect this device to be extended for a few months.
"I can't imagine that she's seriously changing her program."
"If this were to take the risk of causing new tensions in the short term," says Michael Schubert, economist at the Commerzbank.
"A progressive release announced in the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely," anticipated by Norbert Bräms, an economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
On the basis of its public debt market interventions, "the ECB should maintain a volume of purchases of these obligations in order to encourage an ad hoc market," Norbert Bräms adds.
Given the importance of European banks' exposures to euro area sovereign debt markets, the issuing institution has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"He has to replace himself at any price with the lack of investors on the market and do so to prevent a package of performances paid by the most fragile states," said an important bond manager yesterday.
For if interest rates are to fluctuate, the States will be so much more prone to reduce or stabilise their income.
The euro is at this price.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government takes the back round
After a start of a worrying week for Italy, the situation was a little relaxed, yesterday, with the fall in mandatory rates at 10 years.
A return to caution.
At a meeting with the Minister of the Economy, the regional presidents said they had heard Giulio Tremonti describe the "indecryptible" situation and expect a "unpredictable" weekend, which the interested party then said.
On Tuesday in any case, the gap with the German long-term rates had reached the record of 210 basic points and the price of cover contracts against the risk of bankruptcy (CDS) had flown to 263 points, resulting in a certain flood in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain, the gap with German rates was more than 400 basis points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, was declared "strongly concerned" by "the turmoil of the markets" and a possible contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy of the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that she is like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, economist at Hudson Institute.
Clearly, its problem is the lack of growth and the atony of tax revenue that goes with, making the state at risk of being unable to meet its financing needs.
The latest Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is now expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the current Senate budget is expected to be 1.3% and 2% respectively.
Under these conditions, the European Commission estimates that the public deficit will still account for 4.3% of GDP next year (as against 3.9% foreseen by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (as opposed to 2.7%).
This is why the rumor of a new budget collection that could be put in place after the feasts, for an amount of €7 billion.
"If necessary, new austerity measures will have to be taken," said Commissioner for Economic Affairs Olli Rehn.
For the time being, Italy is receiving support from international institutions.
"The fundamentals of his economy are in order and his accounts are good, we repeat them for a long time," says Arrigo Sadun, Italian administrator of the International Monetary Fund in charge of Italy at the IMF.
"There is no problem in the immediate, short or long-term, because despite its significant debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, NDLR), the stabilisation efforts requested in Italy are less than those requested in other countries," observes Pier Carlo Padoan, OECD Chief Economist.
The question of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a censorship motion in the House of Deputies, following which early elections could be held at the end of March.
There would then be a limited period of time for decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans reflect on strengthening anti-crisis devices
Christine Lagarde still tortured her yesterday during a press conference in Paris: "The Europeans, I think we have shown her again on Sunday and at night, are obviously solid, determined, committed to defending their currency and their monetary zone."
Although all the relative, yesterday's rest on the rates of European State obligations has brought water to governments and the ECB's mill.
But we still cannot talk about a beginning of normalization.
The Standard & Poor's rating agency announced that it could degrade Portugal's debt note, the most targeted target today by speculation.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political visibility, particularly on banking systems," Estane BNP Paribas estimates economists.
As much as "political time is much slower than market time".
Aware of this hyatus and its dangers, European countries are intensifying discussions to strengthen existing anti-crisis devices.
Informal consultations between the most directly concerned Finance Ministers and, more broadly, with their G20 pairs are well on track.
This is also true of the meetings of the Eurogroup and the Ecofin at the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
On the menu, the result of non-conventional support measures for euro area countries in the market gluer (see above).
As for the European Fund for Financial Stability (ESF), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, started a tour of Asia in Singapore on Tuesday to inform the extreme-oriented investors of the developments of the crisis in Europe.
If the purpose of these visits is not to raise funds, it will certainly prepare the land.
The first EFSI securities issues are scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, a U.S. official representative entrusted to the Reuters agency that the United States would support a possible increase in funds mobilized by an additional IMF direct commitment.
The first-line countries, Portugal and Spain, are preparing to adopt structural reforms, particularly in the field of labour market organisation.
Reforms that add to closer austerity measures.
Lisbon and Madrid want to borrow a different path from those in Greece and Ireland.
Each and the other must avoid requesting international assistance before setting up their own budgetary corrections and deciding on structural reforms that are essential for lasting confidence.
Finally, European fund-payers focus on the options available to accelerate the process of standardising sovereign bond markets.
On 24 November in Paris, Axel Weber had first advanced the idea that if the EUR 750 billion mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not sufficient, the Union would not hesitate to hand over to the portfolio.
The economists of Barclays Capital, a leading player in the European sovereign debt market, believe that a mere EUR 100 billion would be sufficient, "preference" in the form of a direct injection of liquids.
The vehicle exists: it is the European Financial Stabilization Mechanism with €60 billion to date.
A council that has every chance of being carefully examined in European capital.
Especially if market conditions were to prevail.
Snow and vegetables: 24 departments in orange surveillance
Snowy episodes are still causing traffic difficulties, including on the secondary network in Britain, and are likely to disrupt certain economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in orange surveillance due to the risk of snow and glass.
The Eure, Eure- et-Loir, the Two-Sèvres and Vienna, have been added to the 20 departments already in orange surveillance, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, Dordogne and Gironde, later at night.
According to Metéo France, sustained snowflakes affect the north of Gironde and Charentes and it snows slightly on the Ile-de-France.
Snow layers ranging from 2 to 5 cm, precisely 7 to 10 cm, are expected for the departments concerned, and from 1 to 3 cm, up to 5 cm for the Parisian region.
The departments concerned are those of Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of the Low Normandy, Ile-de-France and Limousin regions.
Snowy episodes are notable enough to generate traffic difficulties and disrupt certain economic activities, Metéo France says.
In the Côtes d'Armor, several departments were prohibited from weighing more than 7.5 tons, including the Guingamp-Lanion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axes.
The traffic on the secondary network in Britain is very difficult, according to the gendarmies who recommend taking its vehicle only if necessary and the traffic of certain TER cars has been suspended for the day.
School transport was banned for Thursday in Picardie.
No specific measure was envisaged on Wednesday evening to limit the flow of heavy weights.
The prefecture "calls all motorists to the greatest caution on the roads and to adapt their conduct accordingly".
The Civil Aviation Directorate (DGAC) requested airlines to cancel on Thursday 25% of their flights at Roissy Paris airport and 10% in Orly due to future snowfalls.
The DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their company.
In Great Britain, Gatwick Airport, South London, and Edinburgh, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate on the modernization of transport in Ile-de-France has been taking its toll, billions have been raining.
At least in the discussion.
In particular, we refer to 23 billion for the Metro Grand Paris that must build the Société du Grand Paris.
In order to start this SGP, the State announced a capital allocation of EUR 4 billion.
In the theoretical scheme, this amount will then allow the SGP to borrow on the markets part of the financing of its double loop.
Today, we finally get to the first additions.
The Correctional Finance Act 2010, which was reviewed in the National Assembly Finance Commission this morning, contains the arrangements for finding the beginning of this money.
They are two: the creation of a special equipment tax and an increase in office tax in Ile-de-France.
The first, read in the text of the bill, article 15, is "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
It is encrypted: "The product of this tax is EUR 117 million per year".
The second is a redeployment of a tax on offices that already exists "to modernise, increase the product and affect this increase in the Society of Grand Paris".
How much did that report?
Mystery.
It is not encrypted in the text.
We're far from 4 billion.
"It is specified that these tax resources add to the €4 billion of the capital allocation that will be mobilised by the State and brought to the Society of Grand Paris in the course and as the project is planned," can be read in the explanatory statement.
At SGP, we can't find this shocking system.
"From the time you create revenue (the two taxes, ndlr), you can cover the studies over three years and then tap into the four billion after, we explain."
"This will be recorded in the budget and thrown in the form and measure."
The GSP estimates that the 4 billion will start to be registered in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This provision, in which the 4 billion promises are still to be made to the absent subscribers, could lead to a somewhat agitated parliamentary debate.
First public meeting on 7 December.
Avenger hackers and diligent spies
The WikiLeaks case has a double value.
On the one hand, it reveals a apparent scandal, a scandal that does not appear as a scandal but in the face of the hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at the international level, and prefigures a future dominated by regression.
But let's do it in order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation that each file consisting of a secret service (of any nation) consists exclusively of press cuts.
The "extraordinary" American revelations on Berlusconi's sexual habits do nothing but report what for months could be read in any newspaper (except those that Berlusconi owns), and Khadafi's tragic karicature profile has long been for sketch-sketch-sketch-sketch-sketch-sketch-sketch-sketch-sketch-sketch-sketch-sketch-sketch-sketch-sketch artists.
The rule that secret files must be composed only of new ones already known is essential to the dynamics of secret services, and not only in this century.
If you go to a library dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each book repeats (on the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templiers or the Rose-Croix) exactly what was already written in the previous books.
And this is not only because the author of hidden texts does not like to do unpublished research (he doesn't know where to look for news about the non-existent), but because those who go to occultism believe only what they already know, and who confirms what they have already learned.
It's Dan Brown's success mechanism.
I'm going for the secret files.
The informant is parsès, and parsès (or limited mind) the chief of secret services (unless he may be, I know, liberation editor), who does not hold as true what he recognizes.
The top secret information about Berlusconi that the American Embassy of Rome sent to the Department of State was the same as that which Newsweek published last week.
So why did the revelations about these files make so much noise?
On the one hand, they say what any cultivated person already knows, namely that the embassies, at least since the end of World War II, and since the heads of state can call or take a plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small representation exercises, have become centres of espionage.
Any film viewer knows this very well, and it is only by hypocrisy that we make it seem to ignore it.
However, the fact that it is repeated publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy and serves to put American diplomacy in the wrong light.
Secondly, the idea that a hacker can capture the most secret secrets of the world's most powerful country brings a clear blow to the prestige of the State Department.
So the scandal doesn't put the victims and the "bourbles" at risk.
But let us come to the deep nature of what has happened.
So, in Orwell's time, we could design all power like a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
The Orwellian prophecy had been completely fulfilled since, in order to control each movement by telephone, every transaction made, the visited hotel, the borrowed highway and so forth, the citizen became the total victim of the eye of power.
But when it is demonstrated, as it happens now, that even the crypts of the secrets of power cannot escape the control of a hacker, the control report ceases to be unidirectional and becomes circular.
The power to control every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - elected as the revenge of the citizen - can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power that no longer has the possibility of keeping its own secrets hold?
It is true that Georg Simmel already said that a true secret is an empty secret (and it will never be revealed); it is also true that all knowledge about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is actually an empty secret because it belongs to the public domain; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks did, that Hillary Clinton's secrets were empty secrets meant to take away all power.
WikiLeaks did no harm to Sarkozy or Merkel, but it made too much damage to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound caused by a very powerful power?
It is clear that in the future, states will no longer be able to put any reserved information online - this would be published on an office at the corner of the street.
But it is as obvious as with current technologies, it is worth hoping to be able to maintain confidential reports by telephone.
Nothing easier than discovering whether and when a head of state moved on a plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How can private and reserved reports be maintained in the future?
I am well aware that for the time being my prediction is based on science fiction and is therefore Roman, but I am obliged to imagine government officials who are discreetly moving in diligence to uncontrollable routes, being bearers only of messages learned from the heart or, above all, by hiding the rare information written in the talon of a shoe.
The information will be kept as a unique copy in key-closed drawers: the bottom of the Watergate spying attempt has been less successful than WikiLeaks.
I've had the opportunity to write that technology is now progressing into cancer, that is, rebounds.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet restored a telegraph on wire (phones).
Videocassettes (analogic) had allowed cinema researchers to explore a step by step, going forward and backward and discovering all the secrets of the assembly, while now the CDs (numerics) only allow to skip chapter in chapter, i.e. by macroporations.
With high-speed trains, we go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while on the plane, and the moves it includes, it takes three and a half hours.
It is therefore not surprising that communication policy and techniques return to riding cars.
One last observation.
On the other hand, the press tried to understand what was being done in the secret of the embassies.
Now, it is the embassies who are asking for confidential information in the press.
Climate: how France budouille its financing promises
A year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to examine the implementation of the rapidly unlocked financing promises (such as fast-start or early-implementation) made by the developed countries.
And the big French bottles are revealed.
In the Copenhagen Agreement, developed countries committed themselves to providing $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union has promised EUR 7.2 billion over three years and France EUR 1.26 billion (i.e. EUR 420 million per year).
At the opening of the COP16, the EU came out of the great game to persuade its partners of the reality of its commitment to fast start funding: a report detailing the action of its Member States, a press conference, a large side event, a brochure distribution...
The transparent operation is appreciated and appreciated at its fair value: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same with the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it has spent €2.2 billion in 2010, which puts it on track for compliance with its commitment of €7.2 billion in 2012.
But when you look at the details, things are more complicated.
This money must be, according to the Copenhagen Agreement, "new and additional", in order to ensure that an additional effort is made without being at the expense of the State Development Assistance.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement on what it means "new and additional".
While the European Commission had proposed harmonisation, some Member States whose France has blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that suits him best.
For example, the European Commission has considered 2009 as a reference: international funding is maintained, and it adds 150 million over three years to fast start funding.
Other countries have chosen similar references in terms of year-on-year or in terms of level of public development assistance.
On the contrary, France considers that the funding of "all new projects" in 2010 is "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to the expenditure of previous years or to the overall level of public development assistance.
In particular, the total amount of France's support to developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease), it claims to respect its commitment to "new and additional" funding...
Another crucial element, the distribution between gifts and loans.
Still, there is no rule and everyone chooses their calculation mode.
Some, like France, consider that 1€ loan is equal to 1€ given.
Of course, this is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be justified for some investments that are cost-effective (often projects related to the mitigation of emissions based on more efficient technologies), it is necessary to present a euro that will be recovered as equivalent to a euro that is given... Furthermore, it should not be taken into account under its commitments but only the cost of the loan for the borrowing country (it is the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France has only to make such a rationale: it 'respects' its commitment of EUR 420 million by making 91.5% of loans (EUR 389.8 million) and 8.5% of donations (EUR 36.1 million) - see the EU document to check for yourself.
It is the only country in the Union to use this massive loan.
Germany requires 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (in others) comply with their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the very great majority of the European Union puts 1€ to meet its commitment, France only makes 10 cents and considers that the effort is comparable.
Nice pass tour!
In summary, in its fixed start-up financing, France is working on a double escrow: on the one hand on the evolution of action over time and on the other hand on the reality of financial effort.
By spending only EUR 36.1 million, it can make it seem that it spends 420 million "new and additional" in line with its promises.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that Bercy has made the arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why would other Member States continue to lend if enough?) and in the negotiations as developing countries are not completely dumb...
The early funding chapter is only a relatively short-term issue compared to all climate discussions.
But it could be an additional sand grains in the huge machine that is the UNICEF.
Let's hope that won't be the case.
In any case, it is essential to learn lessons from this first year of early funding.
First, France could announce a change in its accounting mode for 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its commitments and equity with the other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France could advance discussions on long-term financing issues (another crucial chapter currently discussed): we will not escape from the question of "additionality" or the method of accounting for loans.
France could change its position to become as progressive on these issues as it is on others.
The hope is therefore based on the new Minister of the Environment, Ms Koscisko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprising announcement on the fast start of France and on its vision of "additionality" and use of loans would naturally increase the level of international confidence needed to move forward in the discussions.
Alert to child-injured pesticides
A 10-year-old child ingeste 81 different chemicals in one day, according to a study published this Wednesday of the Association Generations Futures (ex- Movement for Rights and Respect for Future Generations).
The association, which predicts that its results "have no significant statistical value in view of the low number of samples analysed, but are illustrative of the problem treated", bought between July and September food consumed in four meals and one in a day by a child of ten years in the Oise and Paris supermarkets.
These typical meals, including official recommendations - five fresh fruits and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 litres of water per day - as well as fries, were examined by laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The table is based on the following: 81 chemicals, 42 of which are classified as possible or probable carcinogenic and five listed carcinogenic substances, and 37 substances that are likely to act as endocrine disruptors (PEs), according to the studies of several institutions such as the International Research Centre on Cancer.
"Although, in almost all cases, the legal limits for each chemical taken individually are not exceeded, we see in our survey that the reality of consumer exposure to potentially carcinogenic and/or PE contaminants is worrying," notes the association.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a dozen possible carcinogenic residues and three averines like certain carcinogens as well as close to twenty residues likely to disrupt the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, provided for in the study, contains traces of six chemicals, although a fungicide is prohibited in France.
Even for Kenyan green haricots, including in lunch, which the study has detected traces of a powerful insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, the steak hashed, the tuna in the box, and even the bread bag and the chewing gum were truffled with pesticides and other chemicals.
In tap water the analyses revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
For dinner, the salmon steak was the most "rich" with 34 chemical residues detected and even the examination of the plastic seat used to heat the food on the microwave was not exempt.
The final risk for the consumer of this "contaminant cocktails" is "probably underestimated", according to the study.
The Alliance Europe Ecology-Les Verts (EE-LV), on the other hand, proposed "face to the urgency of the situation" to establish a moratorium on the use of pesticides in order to stop "the increase of civilisation diseases".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) revealed the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruits and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
