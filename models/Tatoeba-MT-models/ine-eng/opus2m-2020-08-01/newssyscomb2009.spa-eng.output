A triumph of the right populist in Austria, together constitute 29%
The early elections to the Austrian Parliament have brought about, according to the first approximate results, an appreciable weakening of both sides of the current great coalition and an express strengthening of the right-wing populist party.
Strong and special losses have been suffered by the Austrian People's Party (OPP), where the position of the current president, Wilhelm Molterer, is seriously shaken.
On the contrary, the leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZO), the head of the government of the state of Carinthia, Jörg Haider, prepares his triumphal return to national politics.
According to the approximate results, social democracy (SPÖ) remains as the strongest party in the country with 29.8 per cent vote, so it loses 5.5 per cent vote compared to the last elections in 2006.
Worse still, the GSP has ended up losing 25.6 per cent, almost nine per cent of votes.
They are the worst, literally catastrophic, results in the history of these two great Austrian parties since the post-war war and especially for the populars who convened these early elections.
At the beginning of July, when the OVP came out of the coalition, the people had a considerable advantage in terms of preference to the SPO.
It is clear, however, that the voters punished them for letting the government shipwreck.
Already in the first reactions to the results were heard speculations about the party's president's resignation and, to this day, vice-canceller, Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could be achieved by this Monday at the exceptional meeting of the party's presidency.
Such developments would obviously facilitate the path of the constant and closer starting point of the election results, i.e. the renewal of the large coalition between SPO and OVP.
In view of the fact that the strengthening of both sides of the right populist - the Liberals (FPO) have won approximately 18 per cent and the BZO, an eleven per cent of the votes - and that the Social Democrats at the same time expressed their fears that the same would happen in 1999 when the populists negotiated with the populists (then the FPO was a unit, but in 2005 BZO was demised) for a coalition government that had created a sanctions by the European Union.
For this evolution I clearly bet Haider who has already announced that he is ready to collaborate with any party and has already taken his turn to Vienna, national policy.
The Green Party has also managed to reach Parliament, although it has lost slightly and has descended from third to fifth seats among Austrian political parties.
No other party clearly exceeded the limit of four per cent and therefore is not part of Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: relations with India can be frozen
If it is not possible to solve the problem of Czech scientists who have been accused in India of illegally collecting scabbards, it could lead to a freeze on Czech-India relations, according to Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg.
This was how the minister in New York, after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart, Pranab Mukherjee.
"If this was not solved then yes, then it would certainly arrive at this freezing," he noted after the meeting organized by the Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, after the meeting, that the executive could hardly be involved in legal matters.
However, it stated that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was exonerated and punished with a fine, the government can negotiate with the local government of Darjiling in whose jurisdiction the case is concerned.
"Your problem could be solved," said the minister.
For Emil Kučera, sentenced to three years in prison, it would be best, according to Mukherjee, to appeal to the highest courts.
He could then apply for the exemption of the case and wait for the sentence to be released, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his colleague expressed himself in the same terms during the meeting.
"He advises to appeal to the Supreme Court and then pardon would be possible," said the head of the Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech party can enter the case is by obtaining a "legally competent support" for the convicted person, the Indian minister said.
On the other hand, he said that such support was already achieved by the Indian party.
"We have the greatest interest in maintaining the best relations with India, which have a long tradition.
Indians also recognize it," Schwarzenberg commented.
On the other hand, as the ČTK said, his colleague insisted that the Czech Republic consider the problem of Czech entomologists of great importance.
"We really consider it a terrible mistake to incarcerate and condemn these Czech scientists," he announced.
The Minister eluded the answer to the question of whether he had received from the Indian side the promise that he would deal with the matter.
"I've got enough promises," he said.
A Czech arbitration a battle in the seabed
I'm approaching an electronic wall map, which represents Australia surrounded by the sea.
It is not interested, however, in the continent but in a small point lost in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and along with it also the seabed that surrounds it.
At the same time, the region is as large as a single continent," says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to the team of thirty members working in the United Nations Division for Ocean Law and the Sea.
His head, Director of the Division, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the exhibition and sometimes completes it.
He governs this talent and enthusiasm for work.
The seabed hides to this day a world not known, rich in natural sources.
Oil and other mineral raw materials can be found, but also unknown organisms to this day, which in themselves carry the key to the development of anti-cancer drugs.
The foundation is greater than the solid land
The coastal countries have today started to debate very strongly the new territories under the sea.
According to the United Nations Treaty, these enjoy the rights agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay in Jamaica.
It is essentially the so-called Continental Border, which is sometimes extended to several hundred kilometres from the coast of the country.
Under the Treaty, it has exclusive rights in all the resources of the Continental Board.
"Simply, the continental border understands the part of the seabed and its surface, which is the natural continuation of the continent under the water.
It reaches the edge of the coast of the sea, and often, to the border of the two hundred thousand sea miles, i.e. pure economic zone," explains Mikulka.
The request submitted by the country concerned to the Commission for the purpose of delimiting the external borders of the Continent Border must be submitted with scientific technical documentation based on research and measures.
It is the result of a series of years of work preparation.
"One of our tasks is to organize a technical and legal expert assistance committee.
The Commission has so far dealt with five requests from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
For now, only those of the last three countries have come forward," Mikulka adds.
Not long ago, Australia's success had a global impact as it was the first that essentially expanded its maritime domain.
However, it also achieved New Zealand - the seabed area that the commission granted last week is 1.6 million square kilometers, that is, almost six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries have invested millions of pain in their study.
The profits that will be deducted from the use of the seabed will, as they promise, be invaluable.
Other states are also gradually submitting their requests.
They can do so up to ten years from the time they ratified the "Montego Bay Treaty".
Wherever the Continental Border ends, the region of the oceanic fund declared by the Treaty as "common heritage of mankind" begins.
Already here, no nation has an exclusive position.
The right of exploitation in these areas is administered by the Treaties established by international institutions.
"The seabed, however, is not a gold mine," says Director Mikulka with emphasis, adding "that its separate areas are legally and clearly restricted and its contractually defined regime".
Czechs in the Pacific
And today, part of the seabed also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It deals with other countries of the then Eastern Block within the common organization "Interoceanmetal".
This achieved it in 1991 with a Treaty as investors as well as a few other states, states called "the pioneer investor".
It has the power to operate in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean, between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the investor is something bigger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom there is an accident, it's something like a Marine replica of the Tatras.
"A total area of 75,000 square kilometres can be exploited.
The area is rich in polymetallic concrete deposits containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," adds Indian lawyer Pashi Rajan.
A Macedonian employee from the Division, Rober Sandev, brings us a sample of this kind of concretion.
It reminds us of a small potato or with a little fantasy, the Shem, which according to legend revived Golem.
During the release of the hostages, the command of German special forces was at the scene of action
To resolve the hostage crisis, the Government of Egypt had asked for help from Germany - experts came.
When the situation was serious, the Special Forces Command was ready, but the operation was not carried out.
More and more details are available on the circumstances of the release of 11 European tourists in Egypt.
According to data from the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior in the rescue action, the German special forces also participated indirectly.
Therefore, there were experts from the German army as well as GSG 9 officers from the federal police aircraft squad, from the Federal Criminal Investigation Office, as well as experts in the field of logistics of the technical charity.
As spokespersons of ministries reported on Monday night, the German forces did not need them because kidnappers, aware of violent liberation, let their prisoners go and fled.
The Government of Egypt accepted the help of Germany to use it as support in the place.
" Luckily it didn't come that time," said a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
On 19 September in the south of Egypt, the attackers had kidnapped a group of Germans, 5 Italians, a Romanian, and their 8 Egyptian companions.
Following the kidnapping in the southern desert region of Egypt, hostages were deported from one side to the border area between Egypt, Libya, the Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers was unknown until the end as well as the details of the release or possible ransom payments.
Meanwhile, the healthy and saved people arrived in Cairo.
Steinmeier said that the released hostages were under the protection of the German Embassy.
He did not say a word about the details of liberation.
At first there was no information on their return to Germany in Berlin.
According to the newspaper "Bill", 5 tourists and special forces have to return to Airbus from the German air forces and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
The United States House of Representatives does not approve the rescue package
The first chamber of the United States Congress has rarely failed a large bailout of $700 billion for financial markets.
The Dow Jones fell very dramatically.
The United States House of Representatives rejected with 227 votes against 206 the government's package for the rescue of financial markets.
Despite all the calls made by President George W. Bush and former political parties of both parties, there was no majority for the programme with which there should be limited financial markets.
With dramatic action, the desperate defenders had still tried to convince critics to accept the large package of $700 billion.
Barney Frank, the leader of the democratic negotiations, had asked Members to vote, although the plan was not so popular.
"It is difficult to get political approval to avoid something that has not yet happened," he admitted.
During the vote, the Dow Jones fell to more than 6 percent or to 600 points.
The reason for this was the concerns of investors that the State rescue package could fail.
He rested at the end of the vote and after the failure was made public, he fell again.
Experts have other serious disturbances in international financial markets.
It is necessary to have the approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate in order to allow the programme to enter into force.
Organizers record the increase in the number of reservations
It seems to be a good winter for the organizers of German travel:
According to one study, the volume of sales of travel bookings for the following months increased compared to last year - even the winter season in more than 30 percent.
According to one study, despite the weakened situation, the desire to travel from Germany remains as before.
As the German Travel Association (DVR) in Berlin reported on Monday, with travel reservations for the winter season, travel agencies recorded a sales volume of 31 percent more compared to last year.
According to the survey by the GfK Market Research Institute, the reserves for the autumn months had already increased in number.
Thus the sales volume of travel agencies in October was almost eleven per cent more than in 2007, the DVR reported.
The basis of the results is GfK figures that are the information analyzed on reservations in 1200 travel agencies and calculated approximately for the entire market.
The data collected are travel reservations made by the end of August 2008.
Due to the weakened course of the dollar most of all travels to the United States are of great demand, the DRV reported.
In this case, the number of reservations increased almost to one third.
Germany's preferred destinations are not only Spain, Turkey and Greece but also the regions of Germany.
Most of the organized trips are very popular, Klaus Laepple, the president of the DRV, explains.
In view of the increase in energy and food prices, in this case travel costs are "better calculateable for the customer than during an individual journey".
Among other things, consumers can save money with advance booking discounts or with All-Inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
Also in the summer months travel was well booked, so the volume of sales compared to last year again rose - although according to another study the number of Germans who made a trip, comparing last year, went down.
My first October party
The hits of the parties under the open sky in the endless pool, the beer on a litre and the famous people dressed in traditional bavavaros by designers.
A debut in a campaign store.
Really Susanne Kronzucker and I don't have much in common.
She is blonde, the moderator on television and wears a traditional Bavarian suit.
I've got dark hair, I'm a student, and my dress is already used.
But there's one thing that unites us: we're just in the campaign store, the photographers have already rushed to us and filled their memory cards with photos - it's very lisonary above all because I'm the first time in Octoberfest.
That's how you make friends.
The traditional cheap Bavarian dress seems to perform its function.
In fact, as a tourist at the Octoberfest from northern Germany, my sense of well-being with a traditional Bavarian dress to this day was still limited.
But after you get to the Teresa Beach, it's not all for that.
Almost everyone wears traditional Bavarian clothes or leather pants; none seems to be a case or feel unpleasant - everything is absolutely normal.
Only my delantal gets rare looks next to a banana stand in the chocolate.
A muniqué calls my attention to my dealant who had dressed in a wrong way: "The left part is single, the half is the virgin, on the right part is engaged, behind is widowed."
Oh, God, now I'm opening my back to the left.
"It's okay," he says laughing.
The others don't worry about many of the subtle methods to flirt and carry hats where it's written "To drink to get dressed!" and they show, without asking them, their bare ass.
A young boy who behaves in an exhibition mode is called Bob, is from England and is also for the first time at Octoberfest.
To him it seems "gorgeous", what he utters with a very long "or."
He tells me after he put his bottle next to him of a liter of beer he just drank.
He put it right next to the fire mouth, most think it's a garbage bin.
So Bob is one of the famous people who can drink a lot.
Others don't have much luck and they can't consume so much alcohol.
At eight o'clock in the night, health care groups run for the party place and have to worry about poor drunks.
Sanitaries appear every time in groups - suddenly there are always four people who bring the covered paths from one campaign shop to the other.
This works like most visitors: They arrive sober, they return drunk.
You can't see who's suffering from alcoholism and is in the mood.
"They are those who "can't anymore," a health care officer gave me the answer, answering my question and disappearing in turmoil.
Victim of an accident identified by the police
The 63-year-old pedestrian who died in the hospital after being hit by a vehicle in the county of Essex has been identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road, in the city of Brentwood, was involved in the accident that happened at Shenfield Road on Friday afternoon.
The woman was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested under suspicion of neglect.
Since then, he has been released under bail.
Turkey expands its diplomatic horizons
Long before Turkey was intended to be a member of the European Union, European powers had lost the desire to penetrate the interior of this country.
In the eastern part of Bósphoro, perhaps only 20 steps inside Asia, one of the most interesting relics of the disastrous imperial ambition is found.
The Hydarpasha train station was designed by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu, neo-renacentist.
At least that's what the guides say.
The building is set to watch the end of the platforms and leads ahead two towers, one for each corner, all looking like a typical German town.
The stone is dirty.
The building in its complex is a bit decadent.
But once the taquila was overcrowded, there was no doubt what the size of the company was that this was the most western door.
The station was opened in August 1908 by the German consortium Anatolia-Bagdad Corporation.
Germany, a "latecomer" in the imperial game, had the ambition to dominate the Middle East through this railway that was cured to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond what is today Saudi Arabia.
However, the ambitions of this imperial Germany failed during World War I.
His railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular Arabs.
The relative isolation of the surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, fell below
the British domain and when the forces moved to Egypt, they pushed Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
The news was also bad for the Hyderpasha station.
In 1917 a ammunition train exploded by destroying its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources commented that it was a sabotage.
Since then, the station has fallen and remained on the edge of history.
But today, this railway, the entrance door to Anatolia and all the eastern centres, serves - at least symbolically - to highlight Turkey's willingness to expand its diplomatic horizons.
The Justice and Development Party that is in the government - the AKP - has planned a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the surrounding regions, generated by the frozen frontiers of the Cold War, has disappeared.
Now there is a new policy of collaboration.
The Turkish Government maintains excellent relations with Israel and Syria, with both the Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
To evaluate the parameters of this new foreign policy, I went up to a letter and went to the Turkish capital Ankara, in order to visit one of the AKP leaders, an expert on foreign policy, Turkish Prime Minister Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten hours and a half later - after a trip of scoundrels, which produced the cadences of the old world in the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived at the Turkish capital - a new city, designed to govern a new secular state, far from the past autumn.
However, the AKP, with its clear Islamic roots, represents a paradigmic change in the Turkish consensus
which has raised some suspicions in the West and, especially, in Washington.
A taxi takes me to the headquarters of the AKP, an ultra-modern structure of stone and steel - built ad hoc - in a developing suburb, surrounded by medium-sized shopping centers and "power pastries" where middle-class managers in business clothes - men and women - meet at first hour of the morning to agree/do business.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a centre-right politician of almost any party in Europe.
I'm sure he still has a Blackberry.
"The aim of the party's foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate neighbourhood.
The Cold War was an anomaly," he says.
Turkey has been cut off in its relations with its interior.
Today you have to look at the same time to the East and the West.
It is not a case if it is not towards one or the other.
He has to do both things.
"But certainly at some point," I ask her, "Would Turkey be forced to choose?"
"Turkey," he answers, "doesn't want to face that choice."
He then stressed a point that almost everyone I have talked to so far had almost read me about: the relations that Turkey has not only with the Middle East, but with the Caucasus region, and with the whole Black Sea, represent a benefit for Europe and the United States as well as for Turkey.
The message seems to be: with Turkey on board, Europe in its complex can metaphorically mount those railway lines that open the world to East Asia and the Middle East.
Once again at the station of Hydarpasha, after a second night without sleep, my thoughts return to the two German gentlemen, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who had attended the construction of this building 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to know that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East would, in large part, be in Turkey's hands today?
And waiting at the terminal for the ferry that will take me back through the Bosphorus, I remember that in those days Turkey was considered "the sick man of Europe."
Then there is no doubt in what continent this fascinating country will be called upon to demand.
Memorized lives: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: which musical director of Guildford since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (that, 11 September) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and the Coro.
As part of the musical project for the city, in the following year he founded his magnificent youth choir, Proteus.
It was supposed to be for the under 21 years, but at the time the Proteus sang its final in 1979, several of us were finishing the 20 years - we just refused to give it up to the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the changing mythological being of the forms) represented the will of the choir and the ability to perform any music presented to it, be it madrigal or Messiah, whether not accompanied or with a complete orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by this youth choir was often surprising, always exciting, and everything was due to the inspiration of that man and the enthusiasm for music that continued to be absolutely constant over the years.
Tod often told us to "let the music speak for itself."
He would say, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all there in music.
That's the only way to sing!"
His varita was always absolutely clear and precise, although never taxable, nor too flowered.
Any one of them was the musical scarf, it always ended up at an even higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any driver should have been a gentleman, this is Vernon Handley.
I met him very well during the two decades he led the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Especially in the last 40 years, I have reviewed over 100 of their concerts and I can honestly say that I have never, by any means, been disappointed – otherwise, many times I have been inspired by them.
Tod Handley had this rare combination of greatness and extreme personal modesty.
He hated the drivers who, in his words, simply "sold one or two war horses very well known throughout the world."
We'll miss you so much.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
in his sequel to William Woodruff (September 25, 1946) said that "in 1946 economic history studies were resumed in Oxford and in 1950 he won a research scholarship from Houblon-Norman... at the same time he was studying for a degree, a master's degree and a doctorate."
This is learned in a note by Woodruff's author at Beyond Nab End, but it's not entirely correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a professor of economic history at Nottingham University, a season during which he completed a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J.D. Chambers, and later published in 1958 with the title The British Rubber Industry.
He spent the years between 1950 and 51 in the United States, enjoying a scholarship from Houblon-Norman, and in the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he finally left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason Woodruff chose to ignore this part of his career is unknown.
J. Vicente Resino in Faculty of Philology
"I recommend José Vicente Resino's exhibition "Flamenco and Life" because his pictures in white and black, documentary style, are fantastic.
They called me attention to their simplicity and the strength they transmit, always treating the protagonists with great respect.
An exhibition that shows a lot of feeling.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments."
Second attack for the Honda superintendents
In November, Honda will begin marketing the second generation of Jazz.
If your predecessor already had a wide habitat, this new monovolume presents an even wider interior space.
This involves refined mechanics, which increase driving comfort and save more fuel.
Evolution towards the revolution.
That's the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although the new Jazz aesthetically presents a very similar line to the model that happens, the changes introduced in this monovolume are numerous.
Among other things, an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new mechanics can be noted.
However, before analyzing the new model, it must be noted that this new Jazz is six years after the first generation was introduced into the market.
Therefore, one first observation is that Honda has renewed this model in a shorter time than the one employed by other manufacturers.
Although Jazz is less known in Europe, in other markets this model is a sales phenomenon.
This is the case in Japan, the country where Jazz has been the most commercialized car in 2002 and also during this 2008.
Exactly in Japan about a million Jazz units have been sold since their launch.
The second market has been the Old Continent, with about half a million units in six years.
However, Honda wants this new Jazz to increase sales within the segment.
Thus, while in 2007 the Japanese company marketed a total of 83,000 Jazz units, in 2009 the estimates amount to 100,000 cars, which would result in a 17% increase in the European market.
With regard to the Spanish market, Honda has marketed a total of 8,000 Jazz units since 2002, representing 6.7% of the total sales of Honda in Spain.
As for the new generation, the Spanish affiliates expect to sell 2,000 Jazz units in a full year.
It is precisely the arrival of the new Jazz that will allow Honda to much palate down sales in Spain.
In fact, brand managers expect to end the year with a total of 22,000 marketed units, representing 4,000 less than in 2007, a decrease of 16 per cent.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda has increased its market share in Spain, reaching 1.8%, compared with 1.6% last year.
The Japanese firm also expects to reach 2 per cent in 2010.
To achieve this Honda quota trusts in the arrival of another new model.
This is Insight, a hybrid of five doors and compact size - 4.37 meters long - from which the Japanese company hopes to market about 200,000 units per year worldwide.
By markets and according to the estimates of the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of the sales of Insight will be made in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be distributed between the Old Continent and Japan.
Insight's commercial launch is scheduled for the first months of the year, once its presentation is made in society in January in Valencia.
With regard to the first generation, the new Jazz grows in all its quotas.
Its length is up to 3.90 meters (five centimeters more), the width up to 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and the distance between axes up to 2.50 meters, which means an increase of five centimeters.
The height, on the other hand, did not vary and is maintained at 1.52 meters.
Along with the increase in dimensions, domestic housing also grows.
This profit is due, on the one hand, to the inclusion of a new platform and, on the other, to the introduction of the fuel storage centre, to a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz.
In addition, the capacity of the suitcase - which has a double background system - rises up to 399 litres, 19 litres more capacity of the first generation suitcase.
It should be noted that these measures are from engine 1.4 because the capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2 suitcase is 379 litres.
Other improvements - in addition to external elements such as rear leds or the possibility of mounting the panoramic crystal - are an improvement in access to rear seats.
And it's that the doors that give access to the second row have an opening angle of 80 degrees, compared to the 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
They are also new engines in this second generation of Jazz.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model will have two 1,2 and 1.4 litre gas propellers.
Both mechanics incorporate the i-VTEC technology that achieves a lower consumption, emits less carbon dioxide, achieves excellent mechanical refining and at the same time achieves a high pair throughout the engine regime.
The first 1.2 litre mechanic obtains a power of 90 horses to 6,000 revolutions with a maximum pair of 114 Nm. to 4,900 rounds.
This propeller - which in the past Jazz reached 78 horses - has a cost of 5.3 litres and a emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
With regard to the previous propeller, which in the previous generation achieved 83 horses, now it's going to be 100.
This Jazz 1.4 of 100 horses achieves combined consumption of 5.4 litres and 128 grams of CO2.
The bee car that avoids collisions
To advance the development of technologies for the prevention of Nissan accidents, this time, in nature, in particular, in bees, has been inspired.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, on the basis of the flight of bees, avoids accidents.
This is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C that represents the first step in collision prevention technologies.
The engineers of the Advanced Technical Center of Nissan Motor Co. have developed this small robot in collaboration with the Center for Advanced Science and Technology Research at the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Director General of Public Relations for Brand Management Technology and Research and Development, the BR23C is presented as an extension of the security shield in four areas of Nissan.
This robot intends to strengthen the ability to prevent collisions of the vehicle of the brand.
During their flight, each bee creates its own personal space in oval shape that looks much like the Nissan Security Shield.
But the most important are the compound eyes of the bee, capable of seeing with an angle of more than 300 degrees in all directions, which allows you to fly without interruption within your own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, engineers designed what they called a laser tracker (Laser Range Finder).
This detects the obstacles that are up to two metres within a radius of 180 degrees in front of the BR23C, calculates the distance to that object and sends a signal to a landing microprocessor that immediately translates into conflict prevention.
"At the moment you detect an obstacle, the small robot will imitate the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by turning its wheels straight or higher to avoid collision.
The biggest difference with any existing system is that the escape manoeuvre is completely instinctive.
Otherwise, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and major engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot be turned upwards or downwards, nor diagonally; it can only be moved in two dimensions and in the direction that allows it to rotate its wheels and not in infinite directions and ways such as bees.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, to avoid collisions by the small robot.
"This device only needs to process information every few seconds, and act according to that data.
It does not require the storage of information or intuitive logic of previous maneuvers, so it can work continuously with only a couple of dozens of KB memory.
This may surprise us, but we're not talking about memory gigas, not even megas."
This is the first step in developing new instant collision prevention technologies, a technology that Nissan Vatican will introduce into serial cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than the range of lithium ions.
Another possible future application of this technology could be the integration of the unit with a satellite GPS navigation system to guide the driver to his destination by avoiding obstacles on the road.
Time before mortgage
It must be acknowledged that the U.S. Treasury Department, in addition to having a lot of liquid to make injections, is not lacking in engineering.
Before the crisis, and to prevent Americans from embarking on trashy mortgages in questionable solvency banks, they have created a Ameno and informative game for the browser: 'Bad Credit Hotel'.
Either the 'Hotel of Bad Credits' or the Lions.
The tetric aspect of this accommodation and especially its receptionist is to think one, two, and up to three times if it is time to ask for a credit.
And, above all, where to do it, what is probably your goal.
It is true that it has useful but little detailed information.
It's more a page for teenagers than a place for all the public.
What if the game is completed?
So there's a bedroom in the hotel.
Something's something, because if we buy a better house and we don't talk...
Morgan Stanley sells participation to Japanese MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry into his capital of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first Japanese bank, which will disbursement $9 billion to acquire 21% of its capital, a news that has been accepted with a strong discount on its stock exchange.
One week after the opening of a provisional agreement, both banks explained that MUFG was going to buy 9.9 per cent of Morgan Stanley ' s ordinary shares at a unit price of $25.25, or an amount of $3 billion.
The agreed price is less than 19 % of the book value of the securities as at 31 August.
MUFG will invest six billion additional dollars with the purchase of convertible securities, which will ensure a return of 10 per cent and a conversion price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley stated that the overall transaction would be based on a unit price of $29, or 28 per cent above its current change.
Morgan Stanley lost 6.79 per cent to $23.07 each at 5:00 GMT.
" This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to the banking holding status," explained Juan Mack, Director General of the American Group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which would have allowed him to diversify his activities, but he made it pass under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
Its alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces Wall Street's largest names to adopt a much more prudent behavior than before.
The modalities presented last Monday also show that the agreement has been modified over the last few days: last Monday, Morgan had announced that he would sell up to 20% of his Japanese shares for almost $8.5 billion.
" A week ago, he explained in Tokyo Toshihide Mizuno, the Executive Director of MUFG, " we thought that participation would have been made up only of ordinary actions.
But in view of the current situation of the economy and the market, we have wished to minimize the risks and cover ourselves. "
On the basis of the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its claims Morgan Stanley 7 % below its accounting value.
And the transaction will be translated by a dilution of about 20 % of the benefit per action.
The agreement provides that MUFG may within one year convert half of its preferred securities into ordinary shares if they are sold at more than 50 % above the conversion price, or at more than $47 or less, for a given period.
Morgan Stanley ensures that the funds provided by MUFG will allow you to take investment opportunities, strengthen your balance and increase your liquidity.
A spokesperson for the group refused, however, to provide details on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After the investment of MUFG, Morgan Stanley should show a Tier One solvency ratio of about 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan must have relieved his balance from the end of August.
The last few weeks were exhausting for the group, which saw their quote in a bag down to half while the cost of security against a risk of defect on their debt was off.
This cost came back last Monday but remained at a high level, about 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only "survivor" of Wall Street's big investment banks after the breakup of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and Merril Lynch, announced that he had raised $15 billion, in part for Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa in Quito this Monday.
Refund the republic around the socialism of the twenty-first century.
This is the common project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Equatorial Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, for example, of his colleagues and friends, was the third person to put to the vote a draft for a new Constitution.
Mission accomplished as 64 per cent of voters voted "yes" to the referendum, according to the official results referring to 80 per cent of supply.
According to these results, "no" obtained 28%, 7% of the votes were zero and 0,7% were blank.
For the draft Constitution to be adopted, half of the more than one supply should be obtained.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the polls and an account by a non-governmental organization had announced a broad victory to the "yes", estimated between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had also claimed on the night of Sunday to Monday the victory of his draft Constitution.
The " Constitution triumphed in a devastating way," he had assured, congratulating Ecuadorians headed by the Government of Guayaquil, at 280 kilometres south-west of Quito.
Thus, Rafael Correa has been congratulated by Chávez and Morales but also by her Chilean colleague, Mikaela Bachelet.
The elections, which will be held in full calm, according to the Organization of American States' (OAS) observation mission, referred to a text of 444 points that strengthened the " new socialism " advocated by the President.
The draft Constitution entails increasing the power of the State on the economy, while retaining the " development planning " of a country that lives mainly by oil extraction by foreign companies and by sending money to its immigrants.
Taken by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also grants enhanced powers to the head of State, which can take up to two consecutive four-year mandates each and will have the opportunity to dissolve the Assembly.
Correa had already announced that she would use this power and propose a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also consolidates the principle of free health and education services that the President has begun to establish in this country of 13.9 million people, with 50 per cent of the population living under the poverty line.
Finally, it provides for the ban on the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for American drug operations.
The 19 kidnapped persons have been released in Chad
An Egyptian command launched the attack on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight escorts captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight companions kidnapped Egypt ten days ago in the desert arrived in the Egyptian capital after being released Monday afternoon.
In the morning, they had been released by the Egyptian special forces in Chad.
All of them had a good look at their arrival at 3:30 p.m. on board a special aircraft at the Al Maza military base, adjacent to the Cairo International Airport.
They were immediately transported by helicopters to the Maadi hospital, a residential suburb of Cairo, to be subjected to medical tests, so they could not speak to the press.
"They are well healthy" and "no ransom was paid" to kidnappers, said Egyptian Minister Zoheir Garana at the airport.
On 19 September, these hostages fell into power by 35 unknown kidnappers while enjoying a safari in all terrain in a desert area at the foot of Mount Ouanat, on the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, and from then on they passed from one hill to another.
The group was composed of eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the travel agency Aegyptous, in charge of the organisation of the safari.
An Egyptian security officer indicated that 30 members of the special forces, transported on board two helicopters, had launched the attack during the night before dawn.
" A shooting exchange took place, and half the kidnappers were killed, the others fled," said this manager who kept the anonymous.
According to him, 150 members of the Egyptian special forces from the "relampago" unit were sent to Sudan, where they had the support of German and Italian commands.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini mentioned in Belgrade the role played by secret agents and members of the Italian special forces.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and effectiveness of our men of secret services, of the special forces," he said without entering into details.
He also denied payment of a ransom.
The Sudanese army claimed to have intercepted during a patrol an all-terrestrial on board of whom the kidnappers were found, of whom he killed six, including the Chadian chief and detained two.
He also stated that they were related to a rebel group of Darfur, the Movement for the Liberation of the Sudan-United States, (SLA-U), a statement that was immediately denied by this group.
Letters - Quiet majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture takes place in the machetes and takes up the current electoral campaign.
That's better.
But a sector of our cultural life is always forgotten.
Who will be raised to denounce the miserable amounts granted to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations, or national places that are starving?
Which politician would dare to remind the federal government that neglects its monuments and its heritage buildings?
Why don't we have real laws that actually preserve our heritage as in Canada and Quebec?
Did you know that the French government spend three and a half million euros on restoring it only to the Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley?
In the United States, it is written in its Constitution that the protection of heritage is part of the culture of the United States and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all elected and all government departments, and all of this, in concert.
In Quebec, in the Quebec Federation of Historic Societies, at least 40,000 Beneficial People regrouped into 211 Historic Societies, Heritage, Archives and Genealogy are concerned about finding in history, preserving with little money the collection of private files and preserving archaeological vestiges.
These are often the guard dogs of our heritage, who protest with energy and despair when promoters and responsible ones throw their bulldozers against our old stones and our forgotten tombs.
For what time, a monument to history and heritage?
The Governments of the Netherlands nationalize part of the Fortis Bank.
The Netherlands, being the first in Europe, will help with nationalisation to the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis, which is seen in haste due to the effects of the mortgage crisis on the North American market: the three countries will support this financial and insurance institution, which also has business in Hungary, with a total of EUR 11.2 billion.
This weekend the governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands held higher-level consultations with the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commission's economic competence.
The Fortis Bank is the first to suffer the euro area crisis in the context of the international financial crisis that has occurred in several waves more than a year ago, so decisions taken with respect to the Bank can, in a sense, be considered as precedents.
According to the decision taken on Sunday morning, the three States will purchase approximately half (49 per cent) of the property owned by the Bank in its area.
The Bank will certainly sell part of its business, including all of its activities - mainly insurance - purchased last year by ABN Amró Dutch.
The actions of the Fortis began a strong descent last week and for the second half of the week there were already important signs of crisis in the institution.
However, analysts agree to point out that with its 85,000 employees, this Bank is too large to allow it to fail.
The company's shares fell by 12 percent only on Friday, which is the lowest point in the last 14 years.
Since January, the value of the shares has decreased by more than two thirds.
By observing the current stock prices, the total market capital of the group is around EUR 14 billion, but according to the company’s executives this is not real.
The Bank's management was responsible for the sudden decline in Fortis's shares to the insecurity of the US market in connection with the approval of the US package plan of $700 billion.
On Monday the actions showed a slight increase.
On Friday they appointed Filip Dierckx as the new general director of the bank.
The Bank also sought private investors, but so far no one has given a specific offer.
The Belgian government had previously ensured that investors had no reason to worry, would not lose their money.
No panic has occurred among the Bank's clients so far, they have not invaded the bank's offices to withdraw their money.
Fortis has its own branch in Hungary and has also purchased leasing companies.
Zorro in the gallinero
In the United States, life and health insurance companies often refuse to sign an insurance contract when they see the purchase data.
Privacy policy experts fear that the market for personal data will become uncontrollable.
"There are personal data protection programmes, which for the use of revenue data in all cases link it to the approval of the person concerned.
The same must be in independent hands, because if not, "we trust the turtle" - quote Washington Post to Richard Dick, the designer of the medical prescription follow-up program.
Insurance companies depend on the insurance price and the amount of compensation of the customer's health status and if they believe that the risk is excessive, they simply do not make the contract.
They previously sent the client to a medical check and signed the contract with him, already knowing the outcome of the check.
Dick invented a much cheaper procedure ten years ago: with the customer identification number, he easily gets the list of medicines purchased in the last year and mid-term and the program itself draws the conclusion on the customer's health and diseases.
For example, if you systematically take a large dose of pills to reduce cholesterol, it indicates that the fat level in the blood is practically incurable, so it is immediately included in a higher risk category.
There are numerous versions of the program, some even set a number of risks, so the insurance company, in addition to the administration, only has something to do, although there are small difficulties.
Among the programme's disadvantages is that some medicines are multi-use, for example certain substances serve both to treat headache and heat waves and even to treat antidepressants.
The latter is an important risk increase factor for insurance companies while the first ones do not.
Special companies were formed to consult and process these data, which, before acquiring the necessary information from the pharmacy, require patient approval.
The authorities are already forcing them to do so, although they have not received a fine for neglect so far.
Some companies have recently also developed the results of laboratory tests and, by combining them with drug consumption data, obtain more precise information on the patient's health status.
More and more companies have access to these data and at the same time it is increasingly difficult to control their use.
There is an exclusive law for the protection of personal health data, but it applies only to insurance companies and those providing health services.
There is already before Congress the bill that gives the authority the right to control the specialized companies for the provision of personal data.
Dick Richard recognizes that this is insufficient: he therefore developed his program, which will require the person's specific approval for the provision of his own personal data.
It is another matter that that person cannot deny his approval, because if the insurance companies do not sign the contract with him.
So the chicken, however, are exposed to the good will of the rat.
Global menu of Marseilles
The European Union doubles its trade with India
Since the European Union and India are mutually trade partners, this issue, in addition to the other problems in most of the world, dominated the agenda of the ninth summit.
A Franco-India summit will also be held today to deal mainly with cooperation in nuclear energy.
Although the European Union recognizes that India is a great democratic developing power that should have more voice and vote in international affairs, member countries have not yet been able to reach a common denominator on whether they should support New Delhi as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.
This issue has not been addressed at the ninth summit launched yesterday in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, President of the EU's turn, José Manuel Barroso, President of the Commission and Javier Solana, chief representative of foreign policy, received Manmohan Singh, India's prime minister with whom they reached an agreement to double in five years, i.e. to increase their trade exchange to more than one hundred billion euros.
Given that between 2000 and 2007, the trade in goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not an overly ambitious goal.
Thus, the twenty-first bilateral civil aviation agreements with India have been legally harmonized, so air transport can also fly in the future.
India wants to sign the Treaty on Free Trade with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the negotiations.
The goal is the balance, because while the EU is India's first trading partner, New Delhi is only the ninth place among the trading partners of the Union.
The summit paid attention to global affairs.
Both parties condemned the Afghan and Pakistani situation and terrorism - all its forms - and welcomed the convening of a United Nations conference.
The conclusion of the Doha trade liberalization round was also welcomed, although both parties had great responsibility for their failure.
The EU confirmed that its energy and climate programme will be tied up, i.e. by 2020 it wants to reduce pollutant emissions by at least 20 per cent.
India also agrees with this, as in the climate conference next year should reach a global agreement and reduce greenhouse gas production by 50 per cent by 2050.
They also wanted to impede the increase in food prices and supported the convening of an international conference to turn it over to the financial crisis.
Today, the head of government of India will travel to the French capital, where, in a bilateral meeting, he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
Paris trusts that French companies will be charged with a value of EUR 20 billion to build nuclear reactors.
According to news agency information, the agreement would be for a period of 15 years.
In Frankfurt more than three hundred Italian publishers
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the international exhibition of the book of Frankfurt.
Over three hundred Italian publishers will be present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The international sample of the book of Frankfurt expects for this edition more than 7 thousand exhibitors from 102 different countries that will occupy 171,790 square metres of the sample with more than 403,000 titles in exhibition and with Turkey as guest of honor.
It will be the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Cultural Property and Activities Francisco Maria Giro to represent the Italian government at the opening ceremony of the Italian pavilion: Italy will be institutionally and effectively present with a point Italy - 264 square meters of exhibition space.
There will be a press meeting in the Structure Room on the 5.0 flag of the Buchmesse: this will be an opportunity to present numbers, trends and prospects about the state of the editorials in Italy.
According to the data, the weight of foreign authors' books gradually decreases over the total Italian production, in particular for adults and adolescents.
Found Steve Fossett's plane the millionaire disappeared a year ago
the remains of Steve Fossett's plane were found, the millionaire missing on 3 September 2007 while flying over the Nevada desert.
The debris has been found on a height of 3,000 metres, in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammoth Lakes, on the border between California and Nevada.
There were no human remains inside the plane.
the Commissioner of Madeira County, John Anderson, has identified the remaining doubts: "The plane has been located, we have sent a squad, and now we have the confirmation that it is itself about what Steve Fossett was flying on the day of its disappearance" has said in a press conference.
The Commissioner has stated that no human remains have been found on the plane or around.
The millionaire, 63 years old, was killed in February.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Office (Ntsb) has reported that a team of researchers who have identified the device was sent a few hours after the inspection of the remains: it is the Bellanca 8kcab itself, scattered from 3 September 2007, when Fossett departed from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, always in California, not far from the border of Nevada, some personal remains of Fossett have been found by a couple near their house of Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents named Fossett, the two issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and sweat.
Fossett's search had been interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The millionaire had won a post in history thanks to a long series of prizes.
In 2002, at the sixth attempt, he had become the first Man to complete the world's circle into an aerostatic globe: two single weeks of flight.
Three years later I had made the world's tour on a plane and without scales.
Among his records, he also flew 15,445 meters high, over the Andes, but with a copilot.
Glk, the publicity you don't expect
A Suv outside the schematics with an original and well-established design with defined lines and angles.
This is, in summary, Glk the last born among the all-terminated "compact" trucks of the star house with which Mercedes-Benz has sought to give a new window in this sector.
Owned by the content outside the traditional, it will be unexpected and unconventional, the communication that will accompany the launch of the suv Glk, available in the Mercedes-Benz exhibition rooms from the next 17 October.
The advertising campaign that accompanied the debut of the new car launched an unpublished mode of communication through a 3D advertising campaign, used for the first time in Italy by a car brand.
A project with maxi posters, articulated in three different phases, which dominated the central street of Milanese shopping, avenue Like, until 15 November.
The first phase of this new type of communication began with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic version and thanks to special glasses distributed on the avenue How it will be possible to see the new suv in almost real and three-dimensional format.
Indeed, looking at the images will give the impression that the car exits from the poster.
Subsequently, through the use of the innovative Enlightenment8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated at different times in all its details, to be recompensated in a single image.
No doubt Mercedes with this advertisement is trying to introduce something new into the stereotype of motor communications.
Can this formula capture the interest of future buyers? we'll see.
is clear who are the Italian hooligans
In the Triveneto, the prohibition of access to sporting events is being played.
But who are those 150-200 girls and boys from whom Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia" which has been following the Italian National for years and which, so far, has never created too many problems.
And they had never met the rival fanatics either.
The group's extraction is on the right.
The promoters come from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
A small group (a few units, actually) of the Campaign and Apulia have been added to these in Sofia.
They have three-colour flags where the city of origin appears: Saturday night they have been taken out so that they are not identified.
They are inspired by English fanatics.
In Bulgaria a group of true Nazi fanatics, the Levski ones, have found.
The Figc had made 144 entries available to the Italian fans for the party: all with names, so easily controlled.
And the Minister of the Interior had already controlled them all: among those who had left for Sofia, there was no one with a Daspo (banning access to sporting events) at that time, no one who had banned him from attending a stadium.
Four Italian fanatics, who had a history of crime in stadiums, rejected the ticket and also the trip.
The Ministry of the Interior now expects to read the acts of the Bulgarian police to take action: in this case, it is possible to give the Daspo (banning access to sporting events) for at least five years to fanatics who have been arrested or identified in riots.
An international Daspo (banning access to sporting events) that prevents not only Italian stadiums but also those across Europe.
Our hooligans, they won't put more feet in a stadium.
Good luck!
But now there is the fear of imitation: that to those few fifty, others are added.
"We must immediately extinguish this fire and not legitimize who behaves in this way," they say.
Therefore, "well-opened eyes" especially in view of the National Party of Wednesday in Lecce.
In Apulia there is also a small nucleus of Ultras Italia supporters.
Tomorrow the Observatory meets, on Tuesday the Cams can also count on a section of the Aise (information and external security agency, i.e. the secret service, which deals with the problems in the stadiums.
"The horns of Duce-Duce and the arm raised during Mameli's hymn? In Bulgaria it's not a crime ...".
This is Domenico Mazzilli's thought (expressed in a poorly happy way) for a few weeks ago, the director of the Observatory of the Ministry of the Interior (has taken the position that before it was from Francesco Tagliente and after Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli had been head of Trieste's public security where there is a core of supporters of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to celebrate the Duke but yes, the behavior of those 150-200 fanatics who have been ashamed.
"I do not do the sociologist – add the observatory's No. 1 – the reactors are assigned to the countries in which the event occurs.
So far this group has behaved well now we will see what has happened and take this into account for the future.
But let's also talk about the savages in Mameli's anthem: they're not a crime, but if they're allowed, they're also from education...".
