The members of the Wells Assembly are concerned that they "seem to be soft"
Part of the members of the Assembly are embarrassed by their proposal to change their call to "CHR" (Members of the Welsh Parliament).
This proposal is provoked by plans to change the name of the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the entire political spectrum are worried that this could be a cause for laughter.
One of the labians said that his group was concerned because the new name was "rhyme with Tup and Wdlub."
For readers outside Wells: In Welsh this is definitely offensive.
According to one member of the Plaid party, the whole group "is not happy" and offered alternatives.
A representative of the Willic Conservative Party stated that his group "has not been persuaded" to change the name, but notes that the new name of the CWP (MWP) has a certain verbal opportunity with "mupet".
In this context, the letter W is similar to the English Yorkshire pronunciation of the letter U.
The Commission of the Assembly, which is currently preparing the draft law to change its name, made the following statement: "It is clear that the final decision on all descriptive names, which are called members of the Assembly, will belong to the members themselves."
The Wells Government Act 2017 gave the Wells Assembly the power to change its own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of public inquiry into the proposals establishing a broad support for the Assembly to start being called the "Parliament of Wales".
As far as the duties of its members are concerned, the Commission prefers "Members of Wells' Parliament, briefly "CPU", but the "CPU" option has received the greatest support after questioning the society.
Members of the Assembly offer alternative options, but reaching consensus will obviously be a headache for President Elin Jones, who is expected to submit the draft bill for change within a few weeks.
The Reform Bill will include other changes in the way in which the Assembly works, including rules on disqualification of its members, as well as the very design of the Commission's system.
Members of the Assembly will have the final vote on what they will be called when they reach the draft law.
Macedonians will vote on a referendum to change their country's name
On Sunday, voters will vote to change the name of their country to "The Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum is planned to resolve an ongoing dispute for decades with neighbouring Greece, where it has an administrative area called "Macedonia".
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbour's name represents a claim to Greek state territory, and has repeatedly opposed its attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Georgi Ivanov, who opposes the referendum on the change of name of the country, has said you will not start the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the name of the country is just the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's Camps close in the background of the difficulties of the churches in Harlem
"If we look at the historical plan, according to the old people I spoke to, there was a bar and a church literally at every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today both are gone."
Adams shares that the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"The people are socializing today in different ways," he adds.
"The barrels are no longer the quarterly daily, where everyone gathers regularly".
As far as the churches are concerned, money from the sale of assets will not reach as long as the leaders expect, "and sooner or later they will be in the same position".
The man adds that churches can be replaced by blocks with apartments, where people who don't help survive the rest of the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy houses in these buildings will be white, which will speed up the process of closing these churches, as it is not particularly likely that most of the new settlers will visit them".
Both churches were built from white pastures before Harlem became a quarter of the Black – the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin's decade later.
The original White Methodist Pastion was carried out in the years after 1930.
After that, the building became the property of the black people of the neighborhood.
"St. Martin" was a poet by the black Christians under the direction of the extraordinary John Howard Johnson, who organized the boycott against retailers on the 125th street, which is the main market street in Harlem, as they did not want to hire blacksmiths.
In 1939, the building suffered severe fire defeats, but Father Johnson's honorors made a plan for its restoration, where the bells were ordered.
The wonderful David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson, and the heir of St. Martin, proudly called them "poor bells".
The expert who used the bells in July has another description: "Cultural treasure" and "unchangeable historical instrument".
The relevant expert, Tiffany Ng from Michigan University, also noted that this is the first system of bells in the world that was used by a black musician – Dionicio A. Lind, who moved to the largest system in the Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Marywooder says that St. Martin's has not been replaced.
What has been played in "St. Martin" over the last few weeks has been a complicated story, filled with architects and performers, some brought by the world leaders of the church, and others by the Episcopal Church.
From the newsman – who is the leader of the pastor, made up of the world leaders – wrote to the parish in July expressing his concerns that the parish "would be inclined to transfer the expenses of the newsman", although he did not have a role in the recruitment of architects and performers sent by the parish.
Some horoscopes have complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the eparchy.
13-year-old is injured by shark in lobster hunting in California
The shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy last Saturday while it suffocated for lobsters in California on the first day of the hunting season, representatives reported.
The attack happened just before 7 a.m. near the Baycon Beach in Ensinitas.
Chad Hamle told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was drowning with friends about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and he joined the whole group to get him out of the water.
First, Hamle thought that the child was trapped in a hole and excitedly realized how he was shouting, “Dear me!
He's got me!
Hamle shares that when he got to the boy, he found out that the entire area of his key had been broken.
"I've called everyone out of the water because there's a shark!" Hamle adds.
The boy was transported by helicopter to the child hospital "Rady" in San Diego, where he was taken into critical condition.
It's still not known what kind of shark is responsible for the attack.
Captain Larry Gilles made a media briefing that a few weeks earlier in the water was a shark, but it was estimated that it was not of a dangerous nature.
Gilles adds that the victim has suffered traumatic injuries on the upper part of his body.
The responsible authorities have closed access to the beach line from Pontho in Kazablad to Suomi in Ensitinas for 48 hours of safety considerations while the investigation is ongoing.
Gilles notes that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, most of which do not present a danger to humans.
Sainsbury plans an offensive on the British market for decorative products
Sainsbury is facing Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams, opening standards for decorative products in its facilities, where customers will be served by special assistants.
As part of the significant offensive in the UK retail market, which is estimated at 2.8 billion pounds and continues to grow, while sales of fashion and domestic products are decreasing, the largest retail stock will be located in 11 stores across the country, and then, if the initiative succeeds, these will be discovered in more facilities.
The investment curve in the decorative sector is being made at a time when supermarkets are looking for ways to use the free space on the stalls, recently occupied by televisions, microwaves and other household appliances.
From Sainsbury they said that they would double the number of the proposed decorative products up to 3000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweeterman and Dr. PawPaw.
The current product ranges from L'Oreal, Maybellline and Burt's Bees will also get more space, like offers in Boots' stores.
The supermarket also relaunchs its boutique range of creams so that most products can be used by vegans – something that is increasingly being sought by younger users.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop perfume dealer will try discount programs in two Sainsbury stores, the first of which he opened in Croydon, South London last week, while the second will be opened in Sally Oak, Birmingham later this year.
The online marketing and placement focus on the marketing of smaller quantities of food daily at convenient times leads to the fact that supermarkets need to make more effort to attract buyers.
Mike Coup, Chief Executive Director of Sainsbury, shared that the facilities would look more and more like universal stores, while the supermarket chain is trying to fight the Aldi and Lidl discounters, offering more services and non-food.
From Sainsbury they have Argos facilities in hundreds of shops, as well as Habitats' facilities, since they bought both chains two years ago – which they claim from the company has increased sales of food goods and made the acquisitions even more profitable.
The previous experience of the supermarket chain to refascinate its facilities for decorative and pharmaceutical products was unsuccessful.
Sainsbury had a joint experience with Boots in the beginning of the new century, but the association ended after a dispute about the distribution of profits from the pharmaceutical company’s facilities in supermarkets.
The new strategy was developed after Sainsbury sold its pharmaceutical business with 281 objects on Celesio, which was owned by Lloyds Pharmacy, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
From there they claim Lloyds will play a role in the plan by providing a rich range of luxury skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hex, trade director of Sainsbury, made the following statement: “We have transformed the kind and nature of our charming stand to improve the overall experience of our customers.
We have also invested in special training of our colleagues who will offer professional advice on the spot.
The range of brands proposed by us is designed to respond to every taste and all necessary in a pleasant location, making this combination an attractive destination for decorative products that creates a challenge to the very concept of the old way of marketing."
Peter Jones "infrequent" after Holly Willubi's cancellation of a 11 million pounds deal
The Dragons Den Peter Jones star "has become angry", after TV leader Holly Willuby has turned down a deal for 11 million pounds with his lifestyle company to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willubi doesn't have time for the brand of home appliances and accessories True.
The couple's business is compared to the Goop brand in Guinet Poltrow.
This morning's 37-year-old leader announced his departure to Instagram.
Holly Willubi left the Dragons Den Peter Jones star "to cook", after withdrawing from their business with the brand for lifestyle products in the last minute – in order to focus on his own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources share that Jones was "infuriated" when the "golden girl" on television admitted to his busy meeting on Tuesday in the center of his business empire in Marlowe, Buckingamshire, that her new contracts – worth up to 1.5 million pounds – mean that there will be no time for his brand domestic products and accessories True.
The business is based on the Goop brand of Guinet Poltrow, as the rumors are that he doubled Willubi's wealth, the value of which is projected to be 11 million pounds.
When 37-year-old Willubi announced in Instagram his abandonment of True, Jones left Britain by plane to go to one of his holiday properties.
One source said: "Truly was certainly Holly's highest priority.
She was expected to be her long-term commitment to secure her future over the next few decades.
Her decision to leave the mess completely unattended.
No one believed that this could happen on Tuesday, so close to the start.
There is a warehouse in the center of Marlowe that is full of waiting for products to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the leader of this morning, one of the most successful stars in Britain, could cost the company millions because of the large investment in products ranging from headgear and candles to clothing and household products, and could also lead to a slowdown in the launch of the market.
And not least, it can also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willby, who's the mother of three children, along with his wife, Dan Baldwin, is a close friend of Jones and his wife Tara Cap for ten years.
Willubi himself founded Truly together with Cap in 2016, as Jones, who was 52 years old, joined the company as president of March.
Both families often go on vacation together, and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's television production company.
Willubi will become a "poster" of the M&S brand and will also replace Ann Mcparlyn as the leader of the broadcast "I am a celebrity" on ITV.
A source close to Jones made the following statement last night: "We will not comment on his business."
Serious negotiations leading to the "increasing of relations"
He jokes about the criticisms he would take from the media channels for commenting, which would be considered "inappropriate to the President" and too positive for North Korea's leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump's answers in his "new" way.
"I didn't give up anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting, after the first time held in Singapore in June and was declared by Trump to be "a major step towards the elimination of nuclear weapons in North Korea".
But the negotiations for the elimination of this weapon are on hold.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea diplomat Ri Yung Ho told the representatives of the UN General Assembly that North Korea "does not see reciprocal relations" by the US towards its country's first steps on the road to disarmament.
Instead, the diplomat noted that the US continues with sanctions aimed at maintaining tension.
Trump presented in his speech a much more optimistic view of things.
"Our relations with North Korea are wonderful," he noted.
"We had headed for war with this country.
They were going to kill millions of people.
Instead, we now enjoy a wonderful relationship."
The president said that his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim led to positive results – stopping rocket tests, releasing hostages and returning home to the bodies of US soldiers.
He also protected his non-orthodox approach to negotiations with Kim.
"It's extremely easy to act like President, but instead of having 10,000 people outside who are trying to get into this crowded zone, we'd have about 200 people right there," Trump said, facing the crowd in front of him.
Cunami and earthquake in Indonesia desert the island and lead to the death of hundreds
After the earthquake in Lombok, foreign NGOs were said to have no need for them.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population were forced to leave their homes, no national disaster was declared, which is a requirement for initiating international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases there is an undisputed opinion that international aid is not needed, which makes things slightly challenging," Mrs Sumbung said.
While "Save the Children" is a team to go to Palu, it is still not certain whether foreign personnel will be allowed to operate on the country's territory.
The national spokesperson of the disaster agency, Mr. Sotopo, announced that the Indonesian authorities are currently assessing the situation in Palau to decide whether international agencies are allowed to contribute to the recovery efforts.
In view of the ongoing earthquakes in Indonesia, the country remains unprepared for this type of natural disaster.
Although shelters were built in Acheh in the case of tsunamis, they are not often seen on the other shores.
The obvious lack of a warning siren for tsunamis in Palu probably contributed to the loss of life, although a warning was issued.
Even under the best conditions, transport between many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make this logistics even more complicated.
Recently stationed in Lombok to serve the victims of the earthquake, a hospital ship has headed to Palu, but it will take at least three days before it can reach the place of the new disaster.
President Joco Widodo has turned the remaining infrastructure of Indonesia into the centre of his campaign, investing a large number of funds in roads and railway lines.
But the lack of finances are constantly slowing down his office, while Joco is relaunching the urns next year.
Mr. Joco is also under pressure from ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have accepted a more conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed, and tens of thousands were forced to leave their homes while Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets with swords, bows and arrows, as well as other original weapons.
Look: Daniel Stridge brought late equality for Liverpool against Chelsea
Daniel Stridge saved Liverpool from losing in the High League against Chelsea in the 89th minute this Saturday at the Stamford Bridge in London.
Stridge got delivered by Jordan Shakiri about 27-28 meters from Chelsea's door while his team was left with 1-0.
He placed the ball on his left foot, then fired a precise shot at the remote corner of the door.
The ball flew over the penal field and turned to the top right corner of the network.
She transferred the plunziral Keppa Arisabalaga and flew unsaveable into the network.
"I tried to take a good position to control the ball because players like Shak are always looking for submissions in front positions, so I just tried to win as much time as possible for a good shot at the door," Stridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw the kantte coming, I pushed my ball and I just shot myself without much-thinking."
Chelsea took 1-0 in the 25th minute after the goal of her Belgian star One Azar.
The attacker of the "saints" submitted with a fifth to Mateo Kovacic, then printed from the middle of the field to half of Liverpool.
A coward exchanged fast double delivery in the center.
After that, he released a fast shot passport with which he took Azar to a clean position in the penal field.
Azar ran over the defenders and noticed with his left foot in the remote corner next to the door of Liverpool Alison Baker.
Liverpool will face Naples in the group stage of the Champion League at 3:00 this Wednesday at the stadium "San Paolo" in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea's next opponent will be Videoton at the UEFA's Europe League at 3:00 on Thursday in London.
The number of fatal cases of tsunami in Indonesia increased to 832
The number of deaths after the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia increased to 832, as reported by the country's disaster agency early Sunday.
Many people are trapped in the ruins of buildings, which collapsed after the earthquake with magnitude 7.5, which struck the country on Friday and led to waves of height up to 20 feet, reports at the press conference the agency's spokesperson Sotopo Purvo Nugroho.
The city of Palu, with over 380,000 people, is inhabited by ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation was initiated after Mercisside discovered a woman's body this morning in Berkenhead.
The remains of the 44-year-old woman were found at 7:55 a.m. with injuries from the arrest of Grayson Mouse of John Street, as suspected of murdering a 32-year-old man.
The police are asking for all of the areas they've seen or heard.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan made the following statement: “The investigation is still at an early stage, but I beg all those who have been close to John Street in Berkenhead and have seen or heard something suspicious about contacting us.
I also ask all, especially the taxi drivers, who may have recorded something with their board cameras, to contact us as it is possible to have vital information for the investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body is open is a Berkenhead resident and that she was found in private property.
This afternoon a group of friends, who consider the woman their acquaintance, arrived and asked where she was found in the morning.
The investigation continues as the police reported that they are currently informing the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mouse tried to get home to his apartment, but he was informed by the police that no one is allowed to come in or out of the building.
The man remained silent when he realized what had happened.
People are told that hours will pass until they are allowed to go home.
One of the police officers reported to a man that the whole area was treated as a crime scene.
There's a crying woman on the scene.
She keeps saying, "this is so terrible."
In the afternoon, two police baths crossed the border, while the other outside was out.
There are police officers in the border who are watching the housing block.
All available information is requested to contact @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, code 247 on 30 September.
Cromwell's parliamentary statue becomes the most recent memorial hit by "rewriting history"
Its prohibition will be poetic justice for its almost Taliban destruction of so many of the English cultural and religious artifacts that were carried out by his fanatic Puritan followers.
Ala "The Cromwell Society" described Mr. Crick's proposal as "absolute" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in this debate to remove the statues of Oliver Cromwell to the palace of Westminster.
The English civil war was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Maybe the wrong Cromwell will be turned into a victim because of the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent presentation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorncroft is evidence of the 19th century opinion and part of the story of a figure that many still consider to be worthy of respect.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph this: “Cromuel is considered by many, perhaps even more during the 19th century than today, for Parliament’s defender against external pressure, of course in his case it is the monarchy.
Whether this is an entirely accurate presentation is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is the conflict in the middle of the 17th century, which has shaped the next development of our nation, and Cromwell is a clearly recognizable person, which represents one side of the division.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be noted and honored."
A pig-killer wounding a deadly Chinese farmer
Farmer was attacked and killed by pigs on the market in southwestern China, local media reported.
The man, identified only by his family as Juan, was found dead with the late artery and covered in blood near the Lyupansui market in the province of Wayjou, reported on Sunday South China Morning Post.
The piglets were prepared to inject their pigs with vaccines on 30 May 2005 in Sinin from the province of Cinhai, China.
He was supposed to come along with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and he also locked the door to the neighboring cottage open.
He also reported that there was a big male pig with a bloody huddle.
The forensic expertise confirmed that the 550-pound pig attacked a deadly farmer, reports the report.
"My cousin's step was bleeding and deformed," said Brother Wu, quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
The security camera footage shows how Juan goes to the market at 4:40 in the morning to feed his pig.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
The life-killer didn't belong to Juan or his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked up so that he could not attack anyone else while the police collected evidence from the crime scene.
It has also been reported that Juan's family and market management are negotiating compensation for the death case.
Although they're rare, it's been reported before about the pigs that attack people.
In 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, after the attack the husband was severely injured.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig dragged a wheel farmer to his tractor while his wife managed to chase him.
After an indigenous farmer was eaten by his own pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood may affect them as "push".
"They're just playing.
The pigs are like small children, extremely curious... they're not meant to hurt anyone.
But a man should also treat them with respect," the man ends.
Depressing Hurricane Rosa will lead to frequent and flooding rains in the southwest of the United States
According to the weather forecast, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves over the cold waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will lead to rains in northern Mexico and the southwest parts of the United States.
Rose includes winds of 85 miles per hour, which is a Category 1 hurricane, considered to be 5 hours a week in the morning east time and is located 385 miles southwest of Punta Evgenija, Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
During this time, over the Pacific, I begin to form a sink that moves east to the western coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the peninsula Baha California on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, it will begin to push the tropical flood deep north to the southwest of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will lead to 10 inches of rain in some areas of Mexico.
Within the next few days, tropical moisture along with the approaching sink will create frequent heavy rains in the southwest.
At local level 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous and fast floods, broken streams and likely desert slopes.
The deep tropical moisture will lead to waves from 2 to 3 inches per hour in certain places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In some parts of the southwest there are expected from 2 to 4 inches of rain, especially above most of Arizona.
It is possible to have light-emitting floods in rapidly worsening conditions due to the dispersed nature of tropical rain.
It would be extremely unwise to travel a sheep in the desert when there is a threat of tropical rains.
Heavy rain can turn canyons into stormy rivers, and thunderstorms will lead to rising dust and stormy winds.
The approaching synclination will lead to heavy rains in some parts on the southern coast of California.
It is possible to reach the valleys of more than half an inch, which will lead to brought small waste streams and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainy season.
In the late Sunday and early Monday, scattered clouds carrying tropical rain with them will begin to approach Arizona before the rain covers a larger zone on late Monday and Tuesday.
The heavy rain will spread over the four corners on Tuesday and will continue until Wednesday.
October can bring great temperature fluctuations in the United States as the Arctic Ocean cools down, but the tropics remain warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature of short distances.
On Sunday, there is a wonderful example of dramatic temperature changes in the central United States.
There is about 20 degrees temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha Nebraska, and between St. Louis and De Moin, Iowa.
In the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to increase and expand.
In most central and eastern US it is expected to have a warm beginning in October, with temperatures of about 80 degrees from the south to the north-east.
The temperature in New York City can reach up to 80 degrees on Tuesday, which will be about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term forecast for the weather indicates a high probability of temperatures above the average in the eastern part of the United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanau's hearing
More than 20 million people saw Thursday on six television networks the attractive sight of the testimony of the nominations for the Supreme Court Brett Kawanau and Christine Blassie Ford – the woman who accused him of sexual assault, which occurred in the 80s of the 20th century.
During this time, political opposition continued as the networks interrupted their regular return programmes in the last few minutes of Friday: an agreement arranged by the Arizona Senator Jeff Flake and that the FBI should conduct a one-week investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate's Judicial Commission that she was 100% convinced that Kawanau had pressed herself drunk and tried to take off her clothes during a gymnasium party.
Kavanau, in her deprived of emotional testimony, is absolutely categorical that such a thing did not happen.
It's probably even more than the report by Nielsen's number of 20.4 million viewers to have seen the witness Friday.
The company included average viewers of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There was no direct data available for other networks that broadcast the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen is also traditionally experiencing difficulties in measuring the number of people who look at their jobs.
In comparison, we are talking about a audience similar to that of a championship football match or Hollywood awards.
Fox News Channel, whose leaders strongly supported the appointment of Kavanau, is the first among all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the entire day hearing, reported by Nielsen.
ABC was the second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to the Nielsen CBS reported there were 3.1 million, NBC – 2.94 million, MSNBC – 2.89 million and CNN – 2.52 million.
The interest remained high even after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in the Friday drama.
After the office of the moderate Republican issued a statement that he would vote in support of Kavanau, CNN and CBS cameras recorded on Friday how protestors were turning him on the ground while trying to catch an elevator for a meeting of the Judicial Commission.
During the entire brake period for several minutes, he did not raise his eyes from the ground, which was emitted live on CNN.
"I'm right here, I'm standing in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he presents the truth to the state?
"You have authority while many women are completely helpless," the attacks continued.
Fleke refused that his office had already issued a declaration and, before closing the elevator doors, he announced that it would occur further during the hearing by the Commission.
Cables and broadcasting networks provided live coverage a few hours later when the Judicial Commission had to decide whether to transfer the nomination of Kavanau to the attention of the full Senate for the vote.
Ala Flake announced that he would do this only if he was sure that the FBI would review the charges against the nominations next week, for which the Democrats insist on opposition.
Flake was partly convinced by talks with his friend, the senator of the party of Democrats Chris Cuons.
After talking to Cuons and a few senators, Fleke made a decision.
His election was definitely essential, as it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kawanau without the investigation.
President Trump ordered the FBI to investigate charges against Kawanau.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "political games" with Brexit
Prime Minister Teresa May accused the critics of her plans to leave the European Union in "political games" with the future of Britain and to undermine national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Teresa May arrives at the conservative party conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, published so far on the first page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson stepped up his attack against her so-called "Lady's Game Plan" for Brexit, saying that the collection of customs fees from Britain for the EU and vice versa is "absolute".
Shooting Wade Sims: Police arrest suspect Dietion Simpson for the death of a player from LSU
Police are arresting a suspect for the finished fatal shot at Wade Sims, the 20-year-old basketball player in LSU.
Ditian Simpson, in his 20s, was arrested and imprisoned for second-degree murder, reported by the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Officials presented a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, reporting that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses on the spot and also found Simpson's DNA on them, reported by the branch of CBS WAFB.
After Simpson's interrogation, the police announced that he had admitted the fatal shot against Wade.
His warranty is set at $350,000, notified by the Attorney.
The Eastern Baton Rouge Medical Service publishes a preliminary report on Friday, in which a gunshot wound is referred to as cause of death, hit the head and door.
The government expresses its gratitude to the refugee investigation department of the Luxian state police, the police lab, the Southern University police and locals for the aid they have provided in the investigation that has contributed to the arrest.
The Director of Athletic Sports of LSU Joe Aleva thanks to local law enforcement authorities for "temporary justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The six-foot high and six-inch player has grown up in Baton Rose, where his father Wayne also played basketball for the LSU team.
Average last season reached 5.6 points and 2.6 slots.
On Friday morning, LSU Will Wade's basketball coach announced that the team was "slow" and "shocked" after Wade's death.
Wade said that "this is something that worries a person all the time".
Volcano spraying ashes over Mexico City
Throwed from the Volcano Popocatepetel ashes reached the southern quarters of Mexico’s capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre has warned Mexican citizens on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after the crater activity has increased and 183 gas and ashes emissions have been recorded in the last 24 hours.
The center was watching a lot of rabbits and earthquakes.
Posted in social media images show a thin layer of dust that covers the front windows of the cars in some of Mexico City’s neighborhoods, for example in Hokymilco.
Geophysics have seen an increase in the activity of a volcano located 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital since an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.1 shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, also known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police in conflict with Catalan separatists prior to the year of the vote on independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, after protestors of independence met with the gendarmerie when thousands joined the opposing demonstrations to mark the first year of the polarising vote to separate Catalonia.
A group of masked separatists, who were not allowed by the gendarmerie, began to poison the peacekeepers with eggs and powder, thus creating dark and dusty clouds on the streets that are usually crowded by tourists.
Later in the day, other insights came up with the police, and the police resorted to their batons to control the situation.
For hours, groups supporting independence shouted, "We don't forget, we don't forgive," until they declared to preserve the country's integrity returned with "Spain forever".
The local press reported that as a result of the protests, fourteen people received medical assistance for minor injuries.
The tension remains high in the desired independence of the region even one year after the 1 October referendum was considered illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catholics.
The vast majority voted whether or not their vote on independence, although the activity was low, as most disengagement opponents boycotted the referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year, after the police tried to stop the vote in the polling stations in the region with a number of violent clashes.
The desired independence groups spent Friday night on the street to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
Nevertheless, the demonstration took place, but it was forced on a different route.
Narcissus Termes of 68, an electrician, joined the separatist protest with his wife, says that there is no longer any hope for Catalonia's chances of independence.
"Last year was one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy when they could vote, but now it seems we're stuck," the man added.
Despite the important victory, it was a small difference in the regional elections last December, which support Catalonia's independence political parties are experiencing difficulties this year, as many of their most famous leaders are either in a self-containment or are arrested in anticipation of their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Hoan Piug, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded on his phone a protest in support of the police, claims that the conflict was provoked by both politicians.
His comment is that "it is becoming more and more tense".
On Saturday, Oriol Hunkeras, one of the nine arrested Catalan leader waiting for a preliminary process last year, announced that he would be nominated in the European Parliament elections next year.
He argues that "my candidacy for European elections is the best way to counter the recession of democratic values and the repression we are watching by the Spanish government".
Londoners: Arrested men after the car got stuck in the house
Three men of age 33, 34 and 39 were arrested, respectively, after several times the car was stuck in a house in London.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday about 19:30 a.m.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemings has announced that there have been damage both on the gate and on the building itself.
It's also possible that he was shot in the car with an Arbalet.
Menga's goal is to win Livingston with 1-0 over Rangers
Dolly Menga's First Goal for Livingston Ensures Victory
The New Yorker in the Livingston High League surprised Rangers and put Stephen Gerard's only second loss in his first 18th match as a club manager from "Ibrox".
The goal of the Dolly Menga proved decisive, and Gary Holt's team was leveled at points with the second in the Hibernian ranking.
The team of Gerard remains unbeatable in the High League during this season, and next week he's facing the Harts leader, from whom he's left with eight points in the ranking.
But before that, Rangers was home to Rapid Vienna at the League of Europe on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston is already in a six-game series with no loss in the championship, and manager Holt still hasn't felt the taste of loss since he switched to the Kenny Miller post last month.
Livingston missed good opportunities against homeless guests
Holt's team was supposed to lead the result far before they scored a goal, and his direct game style was extremely difficult for Rangers.
Scott Robinson tried the defense, but his blow went away, then Alan Litgow shot through the grid after Craig Halket got the ball back with his head on him.
The housekeepers left Rangers to play the ball, knowing that they could seriously make it difficult for the guests from static positions.
And that's exactly how it reached the goal of victory.
Rangers committed a breach, and Livingston played well, when Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined and performed Menga, who took his ball and marked it from the middle of the criminal field.
So far, Rangers had more control of the ball, but they met with the unbreakable protection of the hosts, and doorkeeper Lim Kelly was rarely supposed to intervene.
This style of game continued during the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to make a rescue.
Rangers' doorman saved Scott Pittman's leg shot, and Littleo's head hit the door after another static situation for Livingston.
In Livingston's penal field, however, centers were used, which were easily cleaned, and the judge twice did not respect the claims of the guests for the ass – first after a unanimity between Halket and the Glen Middleton Reserve, and then in case of doubt about the game with his hand.
Livingston's Phenomenal – Analysis
Alasdair Lambont from BBC Scotland on Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal game and a great result for Livingston.
The team just plays super, continuing to exceed expectations and improve its performance.
The style of the game and the composition almost did not undergo any changes after the team returned to the Supreme League, but Holt deserves a lot of praise for the way he changed the team after his appointment.
He has real heroes on the ground.
Captain Halkett was amazing in organizing the defense in an excellent way while Menga was constantly holding Connor Goldson and Joe Waral under pressure.
At the same time, Rangers showed nothing inspiring.
Under the guidance of Gerard, you've been shown some great things, but in the case, they were a lot below those standards.
They were missing the last pass before naked, only once they were able to break the protection of the hosts – this loss must wake up Rangers, who are currently in the middle of the ranking.
Erdogan gets mixed reception in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th), we became witnesses to smiles and blue spaces when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations between NATO allies.
The friendly relationship cools because of problems affecting human rights, media freedom and Turkey's EU accession.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to find a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest group of Turks living outside Turkey.
For security reasons, the police prevented a 25-thousand crowd from gathering in front of the mosque, but despite this, many supporters were robbed around who wanted to see their president.
Hundreds protesting against Erdogan, many of which the Kurds also raised their voices condemning both Erdogan's own policy and the German government's decision to allow it to the country.
The various protests reflect the breakup caused by a visitor who is accepted as a hero by some German Turks and at the same time is despised as a despot by others.
Road accident in Deptford: Driver resting after car crash
The driver died after a car crash in London.
The disaster came near the intersection of Beswood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, southeastern of the city, about 10:15 in the morning British time.
The car driver stopped and got medical help, but the driver died in the parking lot.
The disaster happened a few months after another driver died, after being hit by a runaway Childers Street driver, located about a mile from the scene of the Saturday disaster.
The headquarters police have announced that her employees are working on identifying the man, and then they will inform his relatives.
The road is closed and the bus lines are turned off, and it is also recommended that motorists avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: Six overseers have been injured in a riot
Six prison guards were injured in a male prison riot with a high level of security reported by the Prison Service.
The move exploded in Long Lartin prison in Worchester at about 09:30 in the morning British time Sunday and still continues.
In order to exercise his authority, special servants from the Tordano unit will have to deal with eight persons deprived of their liberty, including the movement itself in a limited amount to one wing of the prison.
Injured overseers have suffered minor personal injuries and have received medical attention on the spot.
A spokesperson for the Prison Service made the following statement: “Explained are trained servants who will deal with the incident at Long Lartin Prison.
Six supervisors have received medical attention.
We do not tolerate any violence in our prisons, and we state very clearly that responsible persons will be handed over to the police, as it is possible that their sentences will be extended."
In Long Lartin there are more than 500 prisoners in prison, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that after the arrest of a prisoner, the director of the prison had to be treated in a hospital.
Also in October last year, police officers from the parts to fight the riots were called to prison, where they were to have a heavy strike, where personnel were attacked with billiards.
Hurricane Rosa threatens with lightning flooding Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (although droughts can benefit)
Arizona rarely happens to be hit by a tropical storm, but there is a great likelihood that this will happen early next week, while the weakening hurricane Rosa is carried through the southwest desert leading to its risk of light floods.
The National Meteorological Service has already established posts against lightning floods on Monday and Tuesday for West Arizona, South and East Nevada, Southeast California and Uta, including in the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a different route over Finisk on Tuesday, as late Monday can bring rain.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix noted on Twitter that “only ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storms within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950! ”
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border."
The latest models from the National Centre for Hurricanes provide for 2 to 4 inches of rain with isolated quantities up to 6 inches in Mogolon Rome in Arizona.
Other areas of the southwest desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to receive 1 to 2 inches of rain, with individual locations up to 4 inches of rainfall.
For those who are not threatened by lightning floods, the rain caused by Rosa can in fact be a blessing, as the region is severely affected by drought.
Although floods are extremely serious concerns, a part of the rain is likely to be useful, since the southwestern part is currently in drought.
According to the U.S. Dry Period Monitoring Commission, over 40% of Arizona suffers from at least excessive drought, which is the second most severe category," weather.com reports.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa leads to reaching the drought at Baha California, Mexico.
Rose, which can still be praised on Sunday morning at the maximum wind speed of 85 miles an hour, is located at 385 miles from Punta Evgenija, Mexico, moving north at 12 miles an hour.
The storm meets with colder waters over the Pacific Ocean and therefore loses weight.
Therefore, it is expected to reach the drought in Mexico with the force of tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
The rain over part of Mexico can be strong and lead to a significant risk of overtime.
"Summary rains are expected from up to 6 inches from Baha California to northwestern Sonora, with up to 10 inches," weather.com reported.
Then Rosa will go north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early in the morning as a tropical depression, which will then pass through Arizona in southern Yuta until Tuesday late in the evening.
"The main risk of Rosa or its consequences is extremely strong rain in Baha California, northwestern Sonora and the US desert southwest," the National Hurricane Centre warns.
These rains are expected to lead to life-threatening floodwaters and various waste streams in the deserts, as well as slopes in the mountain plains.
Attack in Midsummer North: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and 20-year-old men were arrested for attempted murder, after a 16-year-old was discovered with stab wounds in Summerset.
The wounded boy was found in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsummer Northon around 04:00 in the morning of British time on Saturday.
It is located in a hospital where his condition remains "stable".
During the night in the Radstock area, a 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old boys and 20-year-old men were arrested by the police in Avon and Summerset.
The cops are asking anyone who might have recorded what happened to them to contact them.
Trump says Kavanau "has suffered from the humiliation and anger" of the democratic party
"Every voice for Judge Kavanau is a voice that rejects the embezzlement and contradictory tactics of the democratic party," Trump said at a meeting in Willing, West Virginia.
Trump announced that Kavanau "has suffered from the humiliation and anger" of the democratic party during his nomination.
Kavanau's testimony before the Congress Thursday, categorically rejecting Christine Blacy Ford's charge of sexual assault in front of decades ago when the two were teenagers.
Ford also testified during the prosecution hearing.
The president made a statement on Saturday that "the American people today have witnessed the intelligence, courage and quality" of Kawanau.
"Every voice in support of Judge Kavanau is a voice in support of one of the most brilliant legal minds of our century, a true lawyer with a wonderful reputation in the service of the public," the president said before the meeting were numerous supporters from West Virginia.
The president indirectly saw Kavanau's nomination as he spoke of the importance of the Republican votes for the general elections.
"They leave five weeks to one of the most important elections in our time.
Although I'm not a candidate, I'm actually also participating," Trump continued.
"That's why I go around and fight in support of good candidacy."
Trump noted that the Democrats have set themselves up as a mission "to prevent and impede".
The first key procedural vote in the Senate for the nomination of Kavanau is expected not later than Friday, as one of the senior representatives of the Republican Party reported to CNN.
Hundreds die after earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, number of victims increases
At least 384 people lost their lives after many were taken off the coast by the giant waves, when a strong earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, the authorities announced on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in Palu on Friday, when the beach was observed from waves up to six meters (18 feet), led many to their death and destroyed everything on their way.
The tsunami hit after an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5.
"When the threat of tsunamis increased yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not escape immediately, so many became victims of the disaster," Jakarta Sotopo Purvo Nugroho, spokesperson of the Agency for Disaster Management of Indonesia's BNPB, announced during a briefing.
"The water was pulled with its car, the trees, the whole house, hit everything on its way," Nugroho continued and added that the tsunami crossed the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 m/h) before hitting the coast.
"Some people have reached the trees and thus managed to save themselves from the water," he added.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Posted by the agency on disaster photos from the air showed multiple destroyed buildings and shops, collapsed and drained bridges, as well as surrounded by the water of the mosque.
The secondary rabbits continued to lick the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquake struck an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) issued a statement that the energy released from the Friday mass earthquake was about 200 times stronger than that released on the Hiroshima nuclear bomb during World War II.
The declaration also states that the geographical location of the city, which is located at the end of the long and narrow bay, may have increased the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "great" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels were destroyed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found under the ruins of the snorkeled buildings, added the speaker, then added that 540 people were injured and 29 disappeared.
Nugroho said that the victims and damage could be higher on the coast of 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the rabbit.
He also added that "communications are completely intercepted and no information from Donggala".
The red cross on its side indicated that more than 300,000 people live there, adding that its teams and volunteers have already headed for the affected areas.
"It is already a tragedy, but it can be even more difficult."
On Saturday, the agency was bitterly criticized for not informing about the defeated Palu tsunamis, although officials explained that the waves had arrived during the announcement of the message.
Shared in social networks, loving videos show a man on the top floor of a building who screams at people on the street panic warnings about the approaching tsunamis.
After a few minutes, a huge water wall bursts into the shore and treats both cars and buildings.
Reuters failed to verify the authenticity of the video in time.
Earthquake and tsunami have led to a severe interruption of electricity supply, which has stopped communications around Palu and thus made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army began sending cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, reported by the responsible authorities, but the evacuated still desperately need food and other essential products.
The city airport was reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joco Widodo will visit the evacuation centers in Pali on Sunday.
The deaths in the Indonesian tsunami are already over 800.
The situation is extremely bad.
While World Vision officials from Donggala managed to reach Palu safely, where they found refuge in the breezy shelters that had been scattered in their office yard, they passed a number of desert scenes, Mr. Dossoba says.
"They told me they saw countless destroyed houses."
The situation is extremely bad.
Despite the start of work on rescue and rehabilitation emergency groups, some complain that those who have had a rich experience in such situations are prevented from reaching Palu.
According to the Indonesian regulations, the financing, dispatching of foreign personnel and supplies can only begin if the affected site is declared a national disaster zone.
And that hasn't happened yet.
"Effection is still at regional level," said Aulia Ariani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government announces that this is a national disaster, we can accept international aid, but they have not yet declared such a status."
While over Palu falls the second night after the Friday earthquake and tsunami, the friends and families of those who are still unknown continue to hope for a miracle and that their loved ones have somehow survived after natural disasters.
On Saturday a little boy was pulled out of the sewer.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under the ruins for two days along with her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the national team on Indonesia's paraplanism, has trained two of the missing paraplanners for the Asian championship, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Among those trapped in the Roa-Roa hotel were his students, Mr. Mandaghi added.
"As seniors in the field of paraplanism, I carry my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon recalled how in the hours after the news of the Roa-Roa Hotel had reached the community on paraplanarism, he desperately sent messages about WhatsApp to the racers in Palu who participated in the beach festival.
Instead of a couple of blue marks, however, the only answer to his messages was one-one gray.
"I think that means that messages have not been delivered," he added.
Stealers raise $26,750 while loading ATMs in Newport of Levi
On Friday morning, thieves picked up $26,750 from Brink's employee who had a ATM in Newport of Levi, became clear from a press release from the police department in Newport.
The car driver has emptied the ATM into the entertainment complex and has been preparing to charge it with money, says Detective Dennis McCarthy in the message.
While the man was busy, another man “traced behind the back of Brink’s servant” and stole the bag with money.
Witnesses have noticed many suspects running from the scene, the message continues, but the police have not indicated the number involved in the theft.
All who have information about the identity of suspects must contact the Newport police on the phone 859-292-3680.
Kanie West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanie West is changing his name to Ye.
Along with the announcement of a change on Twitter on Saturday, he also wrote: "The man, officially known as Kanie West".
West, in 41 C.E., has been wearing the Y-ray for some time and has been used as a title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change competes for his appearance in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new Yandhi album.
He's changing Ariana Grande's song into a show that's refused "for emotional reasons," the show's creator tells us.
In addition to shortening his current professional title, West and before he claimed that the word had religious significance for him.
"I believe "yes" is the most commonly used word in the Bible, where "you" or "you" meant "you," said West earlier this year while discussing the title of his album with the leading Big Boy.
"That's how I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
He passed from Cany, which means only one person, just to Him – which is a reflection of the good in us, of the evil, of the confusion, of everything.
The album is rather a reflection of our essence."
Rapper is one of many known in his field who changed his name.
Sean Combs has a number of prefixes and names, including Puff Daddy, Pi Didi or Didi, but this year he announced his preference for the nicknames Lion and Brother Lion.
One of West's former associates, J.Z., also introduced himself in a version with or without arrows and/or capital letters in his prefecture.
Mexico's president swears not to use the army against civilians
The newly elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopes Obrador swore that he would never use military force, which happened as the country nears the 50-year-old of bloody repression against students.
On Saturday at Tlateloko Plaza President Lopes Obrador promised "never to use the army to suppress the Mexican people."
Soldiers shot at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people, while student movements with left political views gradually spread into Latin America.
Lopes Obrador vowed to support young Mexicans by providing monthly scholarships to students and discovering more free public universities.
The president also concluded that the unemployment and lack of access to education attracted young people to criminal gangs.
The US needs to double the financing of the development of II
At a time when China is becoming increasingly active on the front of artificial intelligence development, the US has to double its research budget in this area, claims the researcher and developer of II Kai-Fu Loy, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comment was made after different ties from the US government made statements on the topic of II, although the US as a whole does not have an official strategy for II.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: the country strives to become number 1 from innovations in II by 2030.
"The doubling of the II development budget will be a good start, given that all other countries are far from the US and are going to make next II breakthroughs," Lee said.
The duplication of funding can also double the chances of the next major achievement in the field of II coming from the US, as Lee informs CNBC in an interview last week.
Lee, whose book "The Superpowers of IE: China, the Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the lead executive director of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the largest companies for IE in China – Face++.
In the 80s of the last century at the University of Carnegie Mellen Lee worked on an II system that won the most successful hotel player in America, after which he was executive director of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese Google clone.
Lee is responsible for the past technological competitions of the federal government, such as the Agency's robotics competition for improved defence research projects, and asked when it will be the next one, which will be of help to identify new visionaries.
"The researchers in the United States often have to work well to earn government funding," Lee explained.
"Not China takes academic leaders, but corporations," the man says.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired university lights to work on II.
Lee adds that changes in immigration policy can help the US strengthen its II programme.
"I think that science doctors should automatically offer green cards," said the man.
The U.S. State Council announced its plan to develop an artificial intelligence from the next generation in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences of China provides funding for people from academic institutions like the way the National Scientific Foundation and other state organizations finance researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee says.
Earlier this year the U.S. Ministry of Defence established a Joint Intelligence Centre, which aims to include partners from industry and academic environments, and the White House announced the formation of a Special Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
Also this month DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As far as the NSF is concerned, more than $100 million a year are currently invested in the development of II.
Meanwhile, the US legislative body, which wanted to set up a National Commission for the Safety of Artificial Intelligence, has not observed any activity for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change their country's name
Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum this week to change the name of the country to "Republic of North Macedonia". This is a move that would allow a long-standing dispute with Greece that blocks Macedonia's membership in the European Union and NATO for decades.
Greece, where there is an area called Macedonia, argues that its northern neighbour's name is a claim against its territorial integrity, which puts a vote on its inclusion in NATO and the EU.
Both governments agreed in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of Macedonia.
President Georgie Ivanov said he himself would not vote in the referendum, while the boycotting campaign cast a shadow of doubt as to whether the referendum would achieve the minimum 50 per cent required to recognise its validity.
The issue of the Bulletins is as follows: "Do you support NATO and EU membership by adopting the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters for the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that their price deserves to be paid to achieve the entry of the formed after the collapse of the Yugoslav state of Macedonia into organisations such as the EU and NATO.
"Today I came to vote for the country's future, for young Macedonians, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, as this means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, a 79-year-old citizen of Skopje.
Although the referendum has no binding force, enough Members of Parliament have said that they will comply with the result of it to the extent that the vote is already crucial.
In order to change the name of the country, two-thirds of parliamentary representatives must vote.
The State Electoral Commission reported that no reports of irregularities were available by 1 afternoon.
However, electoral activity was only 16% compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66% of registered voters visited the polls.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Giose Tanevski, a 62-year-old citizen from Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dusko voted in the referendum in Macedonia to change the country's name, which will pave the way for accession to NATO and the European Union, in Strumica on September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje Vladimir Kavadarkov in 54 he prepared a small scene and arranged chairs in front of the tents lined with boycotting referendums.
"We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join them with proudly raised heads, not through the door for servants," Kavadarkov said.
"Our state may be poor, but we still have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the European Union."
Prime Minister Zaev argues that NATO membership will lead to investment needs for Macedonia, as unemployment in the country is more than 20 per cent.
"I believe that the vast majority will be with us, as more than 80% of our citizens prefer the EU and NATO," Zaev said after he gave his own voice.
The state also stated that the positive result would lead to "the confirmation of the future of our people".
Last Monday, the Macedonian Institute for Political Research publishes results of the study that between 30 and 43 per cent of voters will participate in the referendum – which is under the required activity.
Another study, the work of Macedonian TV Telma, reported that 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
70% of them said they would vote with "Yes".
In order for the referendum to be successful, the electoral activity must be 50% plus one vote.
If the referendum is unsuccessful, it will be the first serious blow against the pro-Western government's policy since it won power last May.
Look: Sergio Aguaero from Manchester City passes through all of Brighton's defense and marks the goal
Sergio Aguaero and Rahim Sterling overcame the defense of Brighton and brought Manchester City 2-0 victory on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero's play for his naked in the 65th minute seemed too easy.
It all started when the Argentine Golmaster was found with a passport in the middle of the field.
He ran three defenders from Bryton before printing with the ball in the empty space ahead.
Then Aguero turned around by four players in the green.
He slipped next to one of the defenders, and then left behind the rest of Brighton's criminal field.
Then he turned left to Sterling.
The British attacker with one touch returned the ball back to Aguero, who struck right across the door of Brighton Matthew Ryan and found the right corner of his door.
"Aguero is struggling with some contusions in his feet," City Pep Guardiola's manager told reporters.
"We planned that he would play about 55-60 minutes.
And look what happened.
We were lucky you scored naked right now."
But Sterling was the one who secured the initial advance of the "heavens" in this match from the High League of England.
He got divorced in 29 minutes.
In the case of naked Aguero, he got a deep surrender in the middle of Brighton.
He immediately released a relay passport on the left flank to Liroy Sane.
Dream made progress with the ball, then found Sterling with a passport to the remote grid.
The attacker of the "heavens" managed to cut off close, just before the ball went out in the car.
City will face Hoffenheim in a match from the group phase of the Champion League at 12:55 on Tuesday afternoon of "Rain Necar Arena" in Zinsheim, Germany.
Shercer wants to play certain fate of Rockies
After the Nationals didn't rank for the playwrights, there was no special point for another game of a title-starting painter.
And yet the ambitious Shercer always hopes to be the titler on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, if the match is of importance to Rockies, who run a match before Los Angeles Dodgers in the ranking of NL West.
Rockies guaranteed their participation at least in the Wild Card game after winning 5-2 against Nationals on Friday night, but it is still not sure that they will win their first title in the division.
"Although we ourselves are not fighting for anything, we want to finish the season with a nice game in Denver, where the audience and the other team will give everything to win, perhaps the most important game for them during the year.
Why would I want to miss such a match?"
Nationals still haven't announced a starter for a week, but they're supposed to allow Shercer to participate if the match is decisive.
For Shercer this would be the 34th match as the initiating painter this year, when he held the training on Thursday and would have the normal rest time until Sunday.
Washington's right-handed paintper has a balance of 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 inches during this season.
Trump recruits supporters in West Virginia
The President of Kosovo proposed the situation with his voter for the Brett Kawanau Supreme Court, while he was talking about the importance of republican votes in the general elections.
"All we have achieved in November will be at risk.
They leave five weeks to one of the most important choices in our lives.
This is one of the greatest moments in the present history – I also say that even though I am not a candidate, I am actually also participating, that is why I am fighting all the forces for the right candidates," Trump said.
Then he went on with: “You all see this terrible radical group of democracies, you see them with your eyes.
They are determined to return their power in any way, you yourselves are witnesses of their inefficiency, of their evil.
They don't care when they can hurt who they have to walk to get in power and control, because they only care about power and control, but we won't give them."
The Democrats, according to the President, have set themselves up to "stop and stop".
"What we all see in the last four days," he continued, calling the democracies "enraged, ugly, vile and unfaithful".
The president recalled the Senate Judicial Commission, referring to the Senator of Democrats Daian Finstein, more specifically, which has caused strong protests by the crowd.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you spread the document?
Please, what?
No, no, I've been waiting – it was a really bad fit – maybe the worst I've ever seen."
The labyrists are no longer wide-ranging.
The party is not tolerant to those who speak openly
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, a few were surprised.
At the end of the day, I am just the last member of Parliament of the Labourers who was said to have been unwelcome – just because I speak freely.
My colleague in the Parliament, Joan Ryan, has had a similar attitude, as he was determined to face anti-Semitism.
In my case, censorship criticises me for my disagreement with Jeremy Corbin.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, those that are ironically similar to those with which Jeremy expressed disagreement at the time of previous leaders.
In the report on the Nottingham East Labourers meeting on Friday, it was said that "we want the meetings to include all and be beneficial".
During most of my eight years as a local representative of the Labourers in Parliament, the Friday meetings were exactly that.
Unfortunately, today the tone of most meetings and the promises of "lighter and moderate" policies have long been forgotten if they were ever on the agenda.
It became increasingly evident that different views were not tolerated in the Liberian party and that any opinion was assessed on the basis of how much the party's leadership likes.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, while my colleagues, whom I had previously worked for, thought they shared similar political views, began to expect me to turn around and take positions that I would never agree with – whether on national security or the single market in the EU.
Whenever I make public statements – no matter what I actually say – there is an all-encompassing tyranny in the social networks, where it is called for feedback, rejection of moderate policies, statements that they do not belong to the libersists.
Like this isn't just happening to me.
In the interest of the truth, I know that I even got more luck out of some of my colleagues, because the comments about me are primarily of a political nature.
I can only admire the professionalism and purpose of these colleagues, who face the sexist or racist subjugations every day, without being afraid of them.
One of the biggest disappointments of this era in politics is how similar abuses have become normal.
Last week, Jeremy Corbin said the labians should embrace a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that the party is no longer wide-ranging, with any sign of mistrust or change in the rules of choice becoming increasingly tighter.
In the last two years, I've received a lot of advice to bend, not to say so much, and then "everything will be fine".
But that's not why I got into politics.
Since I joined the labers 32 years ago as a student, provoked by the Thacher government, which, through its neglect, led to a literal breakdown in my excellent school, I have fought for better public services for those who have the greatest need – whether as a local councillor or as a minister.
I have never hid my political views, including during the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could be confused about any way of my political position and my disagreement with the current leadership.
To all those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would like to say that when the state has reached Brexit, it will harm the households, companies and the public sector, and I do not understand the desire to waste my time and energy in loyalty to the leader of the labers.
But actually my message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters, whether they are members of the labers, or not: it is for me to be proud to serve you and to promise that no threats of withdrawal or political rejection will deny me to act in the way I consider best in protecting your interests.

Er 38-17 Melrose: The Invincible Ears led the ranking
The two late essays may also have changed slightly the final result, but there is no doubt that Er deserved to triumph in this incredibly interesting match from Tennant's High League.
The team is already heading the rankings, and only one of the ten teams is out of the question so far.
The better protection and the better use of opportunities have proved to be decisive in the match, from which coach Peter Murchi and his team can be very pleased.
"I am happy because the other teams have tested us very seriously in the past matches, and we are still without loss," Mr. Murchi noted.
Robin Christi of Melrose said: “Congratulations for Er, they really benefited from their provisions better than we did. ”
Grant Anderson's essay in the 14th minute, followed by a successful additional hit by Frasier Klimo, led Er forward in the result, but a yellow card for the Scottish national Rory Husse, released to play in the Warriors match, allowed Melrose to grow in the result, after Jason Bagot realized the essay followed by an unsuccessful additional blow.
Klimo increases the advantage of Er from a penalty strike shortly before half-time, marking the axis after salt action, and then realizing the additional blow with which he made the result 17-5 for Er of the rest.
But Melrose began the second half well and Patrick Anderson's essay, followed by a successful additional blow to Bagot, reduced the lead to only five points.
It follows a continuous stop of the game due to a severe contusion of Ruarid Not, which was carried out on the carrier, and after the renewal of the match Er increased their advance after the essay of Staff McDoual and a successful additional hit of Klimo.
Then Er Blair McFerson's current captain received a yellow card and Melrose again took advantage of their numerous advantages by exerting strong pressure and implementing essays through Bruce Colvin, followed by an unsuccessful additional blow.
However, their hosts returned the presence of the spirit and when Stroan Hutchinson received a yellow card, after the clashes of Klimo without a ball, from the subsequent criminal act Mcferson realized essays with the help of Er's advanced offensive line.
Klimo realized the additional blow, and not long after Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong's excruciating ball and carried out Gregor Henry's wing on the flag for the fifth essay of the hosts.
The star of Still Game seems to have focused on a new career in the restaurant business
The star of Still Game Ford Kirnan seems to have directed himself towards a more direct and warm sector after it was discovered that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor Jack Jarvis plays in BBC's popular broadcast, which is also a screenwriter and one of the two stars along with his long-term comedy partner Greg Hemfil.
The two announced that the next nine seasons would be the last for the broadcast, as it seems that Kirnan is already planning his life after Kreelig.
According to official records, he is the director of Arigingmorn Limited.
The actor refrained from commenting, although a source of Scottish Sun suggested that Kirnan intended to be included in the "scrupulous restaurant business" of Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": no exit at sea Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
The sailors are constantly patrolling the seabeds at La Paz.
There's an ocean son flag on public buildings.
The sea bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are lined with the motto: “The sea belongs to us.
It's our duty to get it back."
In Bolivia, which has no access to the ocean, the memory of the lost exit handed over to Chile after a bloody conflict in the 19th century, is still alive – as well as the call to swim again from the Pacific.
In fact, this hope is now stronger than for decades here, while Bolivia is awaiting a sentence from the International Court of Justice on 1 October, after it has already been considered for five years.
"The force is in Bolivia, everywhere there is jealousy and unity, with the country expecting a positive result," said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadila.
Many Bolivians will see the condemnation of the international court of the large screen throughout the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will support Bolivia's request and that after decades of negotiations Chile will be obliged to give Bolivia sovereign access to the ocean.
Here's Morales, Bolivia's charismatic local president, who is about to go to a controversial re-election battle next year, has also put a lot and a lot at the discretion of the court on Monday.
"We are very close to returning access to the Pacific," Morale promised last August.
But some analysts believe that the possibility of the court making a decision for Bolivia is quite small.
The United Nations authority in the Netherlands has no power to take over Chile's territory and has decided that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the conviction of the international court is only six months after hearing the last arguments indicates that the case "is not complex", says Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And instead of contributing to Bolivia's cause, the last four years may have actually been damaged.
"The problem of access to the ocean was separated from the current Bolivian government," Zarate said.
After that, he suggested that Morales' military rhetoric looked out and that Chile's little will remained.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the negotiations at a given time, but it will be extremely difficult to engage in normal dialogue after what has happened.
Both sides do not support diplomatic missions to one another since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltze, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was made unusually quickly.
According to him, on Monday Bolivia will have "the incredible opportunity to open the page of a new era in its relations with Chile", as well as the chance to "stop 139 years of disagreement by achieving both sides".
Kalzadila also rejected the idea that Morales – which continues to be one of the most popular presidents in Latin America – used the problem of accessing the ocean as a "political patriot".
"Bolivia will never renounce its right to exit the Pacific," he added.
"The conviction is an opportunity to see that we must overcome our past problems".
North Korea claims it won't continue nuclear disarmament until it can't believe the United States
North Korea Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never get into nuclear disarmament first if it is unable to trust Washington.
Ri presented his speech on Saturday before the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to comply with the promises made during the meeting between the leaders of the opposing countries in Singapore.
His comment comes after US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of relaunching the unprecedented nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with Kim Young Un from North Korea.
Ri called the idea of continuing with US sanctions and objections to a declaration that would put an end to the Korean war would cause the North to fall on its knees.
Washington is not willing to agree with the declaration without first making a significant gesture on the way to disarmament.
Both Kim and US president Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But there is widespread skepticism that in Phanyan they are serious about abandoning their arsenal, which they see as the only way to guarantee their safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Phenyan next month to arrange for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
The fashion reviews in Paris reveal the latest list of massive hats that will soon be in fashion stores next to you
If you want to increase your collection of hats or still completely block the sunlight, you don't need to search any more.
The designers Valentino and Tom Brown discovered a range of incredibly large hats from their upcoming SS19 collection, who were laughing at the fashion stage during the fashion week in Paris.
The rather impractical hats I caused a wave in Instagram in summer, when the designers sent the eye-catching creatures to lure the fashion community.
Valentino's exciting proposal was an extravagance escape hat with a wide periphery that literally covered the heads of the models.
The other too huge accessories included decorated with beautiful dishes, magic hat and even pineapple – but they do not aim to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also presented a selection of strange masks – with this precisely time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had their lips covered and reminded them not as much about the high fashion as about Hannibal Lekter.
One of the designers liked the diving equipment in a full set of snorkel and glasses, while the other looked like a hot funnel ice cream.
If you fall for such fashion trends, you're lucky.
Fashion experts predict that huge hats will soon be sold in fashion shops near you.
The huge hats come very soon after the "La Bomba" – the straw hat with a two-foot perimeter that was seen on the heads of all – from Riana to Emily Ratajovski..
The cult to the extremely impractical hat that took over the social networks led to the appearance of another huge design on the fashion floor – a straw beach bag, almost as large as the wearer wears it with a bath model.
The Rafia bag with the color of burnt orange, with rafia sharp and stuck with a white skin handle, was the appealing all views of an article in the collection La Riviera SS19 of Jacquemus during the Fashion Week in Paris.
The famous designer Luke Armitid said to FEMAIL: “I expect to see large hats and beach bags in fashion shops next summer – after the designer made such a big impression, it will be difficult to ignore the search for Edrogabarite accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a reputation for academic excellence, which continues in 2018 with another outstanding presentation of the test results, which is only enhanced by individual and collective achievements in sports disciplines, art, music and other public sciences.
With up to 30,000 students from all over Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Association of Independent Schools (SCIS) strive to offer the best level of their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further education, their chosen career and their place in a global world.
As an educational sector that can form and implement a personal curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and desirable in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to someone we understand about him in a language, your words can reach him.
But if you speak his own language, you touch his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust with the peoples of other countries.
Through the results of this year's exams, we see that languages are first of all with the highest success for independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who studied foreign languages achieved high score A.
The data collected from 74 students in SCIS schools show that 72% of students achieved an A assessment in Chinese, with the same estimate being 72% of German students, 69% of French and 63% of those with Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland perceive foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will definitely need in the future.
At present, languages as a subject of free choice by students receive the same attitude as natural and mathematical disciplines (scientific, technological, engineering and mathematical disciplines) both in independent schools and beyond.
The study carried out in 2014 by the United Kingdom's Commission on Employment and Labour showed that for reasons of difficulty in finding employees, 17% have indicated insufficient language skills.
As a result, the rule of foreign languages becomes increasingly mandatory to prepare young people for their future careers.
More and more jobs require the rule of language, which makes these skills essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the chosen career, if a person has a foreign language, he will have a real advantage in the future, after having such a skill that remains for the rest of his life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts the dominant several languages one breast before competition.
According to a survey of YouTube among more than 4,000 United Kingdom citizens in 2013, 75% did not own a foreign language well enough to be able to speak, as French was the only language whose rulership reached a 2-digit percentage of 15%.
That's why the investment in language learning today is important to children now.
The rule of several languages, especially those of developing economies, will provide children with a better chance of finding a good job.
In Scotland every school will differ from taught languages.
A number of schools will focus on more classic modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered more important for the United Kingdom in the future by 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever interests your child has, there will always be enough languages to choose from in independent schools, as teachers will be specialists in their area.
Independent schools in Scotland are determined to provide an educational environment that will prepare children and give them the skills needed to succeed in life, no matter what the future holds.
At present, it cannot be denied that in a global business environment languages continue to play an incredibly important role in the future of any country, which must be taken into account in the education system.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, together with diversity and excellent quality, to young people in Scotland.
It's a good thing to do.
John Edward is director of the Scottish Association of Independent Schools
Lebron will make his debut for Lakers this week in San Diego.
Waiting's almost over for fans who can barely see Lebron James' first match with the Los Angeles Lakers team.
Lakers Luke Walton's coach announced that James would take part in the first match of the pre-season team against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it's still not clear how many minutes he's gonna play in the duo.
"It'll be on the ground between one and 48 minutes," the squirt Walton announced through Lakers' official website.
The reporter for Lakers Mike Trudel announced on Twitter that James would probably play a relatively few minutes in the match.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the sixth match from Lakers' pre-season training.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need pre-season matches to prepare for the new season," he said.
Trump meeting in West Virginia, channel on YouTube
President Donald Trump starts a series of election meetings tonight in Wieling, West Virginia.
This is the first of the five planned Trump meetings, which include barriers to known places, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the postponement of the confirmatory vote for its election to fill the free space in the Supreme Court, Trump aims to support the forthcoming elections in the middle of the mandate, as the Republicans are threatened by the loss of control over the Congress when the votes are cast in November.
How many hours will the Trump meeting be held in West Virginia tonight, and how can you watch online?
Trump's visit to Wieling, West Virginia is scheduled for 19 a.m., east time tonight, Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can see Trump's visit to Wyling, West Virginia, down by broadcasting live on YouTube.
Trump will probably consider hearings this week for nominations for the Supreme Court of Brett Cavano, where tension arises due to allegations of immoral sexual acts, which keeps the Senate's confirmatory vote until one week, while the FBI's investigation is ongoing.
The main objective of this series of meetings, however, is to help the Republicans recruit energy for the November elections.
Therefore, President Donald Trump's campaign announced that these five meetings in the next week aim "to activate volunteers and supporters, as Republicans are trying to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so important for its programme that the president will visit as many states as possible and we start a campaign season filled with commitments," Reuters spokesperson for the Trump campaign, which refuses to be mentioned.
The meeting tonight, planned for Wesbanco Arena in Wieling, can bring the supporters of "Oigho and Pennsylvania and attract the attention of the media from Pittsburgh", according to West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, Trump's second visit will take place this month in West Virginia – the state in which he won more than 40% in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the candidate for the Senate of West Virginia, Republican Patrick Morrisi, who remains in sociological research.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisi that the president has come to give him a boost in sociological research," said Simon Heather, a politician at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The US team will fight to the last, keeping its hopes alive before the singles on Sunday
After three consecutive sessions without an intrigue "foursome" matches on Sunday afternoon might have brought what Ryder Cup needed.
Changing the advantage in sport is a very subjective concept in which players believe without reservation, even more in competitions like this.
So, which team is in a better position right now?
"They've been running with six points, and now they're just four, so I guess we've got some energy," Jordan Spyette said at the end of today's competition day.
Of course, Europe has a four-point advantage over only twelve allocations.
As Spite says, however, the Americans have something else to show and their fans should not lose hope if we have to judge in the sports form of Spite and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each of them took three out of four possible points.
Spite shows a great shape from the beginning to the end of each hole and is the true leader of his team.
The cheers of the fans were getting stronger as he made progress in the round, in which with a precise blow he leveled the result in the fourth match, after remaining with Thomas with two strikes after the first two holes.
His blow, which won the 15th hole match, was confronted with strong convulsive reactions that make us believe that not everything is really lost for the American team.
"It's important you don't think about anything else and focus on your own match," Spyt says.
That's all that's left to these players now.
18 holes to be remembered.
The only players with more points than Spite and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Flitoud, the undisputed heroes of the Ryder Cup so far.
The strange but wonderful couple from Europe won four out of four, and it looks like everything they got.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't make "gods" on Sunday afternoon, but they also didn't have "gods" on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon or morning.
These successive successes, as well as the way in which energy was passing between them and the enthusiastic fans, confirmed the view that they were the players who would win on Sunday and that there would be no better couple than Flitoud and Molinari who would bring Europe's potential victory while the sun goes over Le Golf National.
To prefer both at the same time to different holes.
However, the stories of European fame have proved a little premature.
Baba Watson and Web Simpson had a quick deal with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the fourball matches in the morning while he was partnering with Alex Norren.
"Gods" and two "dabula" of the first nine holes brought Spanish and Swedish into problems that they failed to cope with.
But there's no way anyone else can solve your problems.
Fourball and foursome games are extremely interesting to watch close because of the interactions between the couples, the tips that exchange between each other, and the way in which a strategy can undergo changes at any time.
Europeans played better teamwork and therefore had a significant lead before the last day, but this foursome game session showed that the American team is also ready to fight until the last – something in which many people, especially in the United States, had strong doubts.
Europe runs with 10-6 in the last day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe will have a solid front before the last day of the Ryder Cup, after taking the US with 10-6 after playing matches from the fourball and foursome formats on Saturday.
The inspiring duet Tommy Flitwood and French Molinari began with two victories against the invincible Tiger Woods, with which their assets in the Le Golf National race increased to four points.
In an attempt to return a trophy that lost Hazeltine two years ago, Thomas Bjorn's European team dominated tomorrow's "fourball" matches over Americans who made a mistake after a mistake, and finally Europe won the 3-1 match series.
The U.S. proved more resistant in the foursome matches, where they won two victories, but failed to reduce the difference.
Jim Furik's team needs eight points from the 12th single match on Sunday to keep a trophy.
Flitwood was Europe's first novelist, won four points in order, and he and Molinari, known as Millwood, after this sensational weekend became only the second pair, won four points of their first four matches in the history of Ryder Cup.
After unappealing Woods and Patrick Reeed in the fourball matches, they were extremely motivated to defeat Woods and American novelist Bryson Decambu with an even more categorical result 5-4-4.
Woods, who barely passed through his two matches on Saturday, only occasionally demonstrated the glare of his genius, but so far there are 19 losses from 29 matches in the "fourball" and "foursome" matches, as well as seven consecutive losses in total.
Justin Rose, who got a break for tomorrow's "fourball" matches, partnered with Henrik Stanson in the "foursome" matches at the 2+1 victory over Dust Johnson and Brooks Copka – respectively number one and number three in the world.
However, the team of Europe failed to enjoy a pleasant, cold and cloudy day south-west of Paris.
The three-time winner Jordan Spite and Justin Thomas returned the hopes of the Americans, winning two points on Saturday.
They won a hard victory with 2§1 against the Spanish John Ram and Jan Polter in the "fourball" matches, and later returned to win Polter and Rory McKilroy with 4–3 in the "foursome" meetings, although they lost the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team emerged to raise four points of deficit before the singles, and according to the regulation, the Furik team will hold a trophy even at the same time.
However, after they had been onboard in two consecutive days, their chances of turning on Sunday seem not to be particularly great.
North Korea says "no way" to disarm unilaterally, without trust
The Foreign Minister of North Korea announced to the UN on Saturday that continued sanctions are deepening mistrust towards the US and there is no way for the country to give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
At the annual general meeting of the world organisation Ri Yong-how, he said that "significant measures of good will have been taken in recent years," for example, we are stopping nuclear and missile testing, destroying the nuclear testing facility and promises not to spread nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we do not see a corresponding reaction from the US," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, we will not believe in our own national security and, under no circumstances, there is no first way to disarm ourselves unilaterally."
While Ri expressed well-known North Korea's complaints about Washington's resistance to the "paedipene" approach to the elimination of nuclear weapons, where North Korea would be rewarded as it took step-by-step measures, his statement seemed significant as it did not reject unilateral nuclear disarmament, as it did in the past.
Ri called for a joint statement by Kim Chen Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the US president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June when Kim promised to work on "nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula", and Trump provided security guarantees for North Korea.
North Korea strives for the official end of the Korean War from 1950 to 1953, but the US says that Phenyan must first give up his nuclear weapons.
Washington also opposed calls for relief from severe international sanctions against North Korea.
"The US insists "first we remove nuclear weapons" and increase pressure through sanctions to achieve their goal through forced force, and even oppose "the declaration of the end of the war," Ri said.
"The realization that sanctions can make us fall on our knees is a pointless dream of those who do not know us.
The problem, however, is that the continued sanctions are deepening our mistrust."
Ri did not mention whether a second meeting between Kim and Trump is planned, for which the US leader stressed earlier in the UN a week ago.
Instead, the minister focused on the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Mun Jain over the past five months and added: "If the country on nuclear disarmament was South Korea, rather than the United States, the elimination of nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula would not reach such a stop.
However, Ri's tone of speech was significantly different from that of the previous year when he told the UN general meeting that directing North Korean missiles to the continental part of the United States is inevitable, after "evil President" Trump called Kim "a human- rocket" on a suicide mission.
This year in UN Trump, which threatened North Korea last year with "full destruction", commended Kim for his courage to take disarmament measures, but said there was still much work to be done and sanctions should remain in force as North Korea removes nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday Trump stressed that there was no time for this and said, "It doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Phenjan for the measures taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The implementation of the Security Council's sanctions must continue indefinitely until full, final and confirmed nuclear disarmament is realized."
The Security Council unanimously reinforced sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to stop the financing of the nuclear programme and the Phanayan ballistic missile programme.
Pompeo met with Ri in the halls of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Phenyan again next month to prepare a second summit meeting.
This year Pompeo visited North Korea three times, but his last trip went well.
He left Phenyan in July with the words that he had made progress, but only a few hours later North Korea accused him of having made "gangster requests".
At a meeting with Moon this month North Korea has promised to destroy a missile object and a nuclear complex if the US takes "the appropriate measures".
According to him, Kim told him that the "relevant measures" he was seeking are the security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and that he wants to achieve normalization of relations with Washington.
Students at Harvard on a sufficient holiday course
A new course at Harvard University this year drives all students to sleep more in an attempt to fight the growing culture of learning "all night" with the help of caffeine.
The teacher found that university students number one in the world often don't even think about the very basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Kaysler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Brigam Hospital and the Women's Hospital, has prepared a course he believes to be the first of his kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after talking about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
"At last a girl came to me and said, "Why are they telling me right now, in my last year?"
She said that no one ever told her about the importance of the dream that surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is held for the first time this year, explains to students the most important about how good sleep habits help academic and sports achievements as well as improving overall well-being.
Paul Barry, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University's health services, said the university decided to take the course after it was found that students suffer from a serious lack of sleep during the week.
At the same time, the course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one part there is an image of a room in a dwelling, to which students click on cups of coffee, curtains, marathons and books to explain the effects of caffeine and light, how sports achievements affect the lack of sleep as well as the importance of sleeping routine.
Another part of the participants reported how long-term sleep deprivation could increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Then a map of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that this will not change students' behavior immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know the effects on the health of the choice to smoke," added Professor Kaysler.
The culture of pride from "learning all night" still exists, he says and added that modern technologies and the increasing pressure on students mean that sleep deprivation is an increasing problem.
The provision of adequate and high quality sleep must be the "secret weapon" of students in the struggle with stress, fatigue and anxiety, he says – even to avoid filling, as the elimination of the sleep infamilies the brain in a mode of hunger that keeps them hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Kaysler to prepare the course, taking one of his classes in his first year at Harvard.
He says his course "opened his eyes" and inspired him to spread it throughout the campus.
It is hoped that the next step is for all graduates to be asked to complete such a training programme before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Kaysler recommends that students consider whether to set up an alarm for sleeping and awakening and to know the harmful effects of "the blue light" emitted by electronic screens and light-emitting that can disrupt the Circadian rhythm and lead to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 – 0 Rangers: Menga's goal was to destroy Gerard's team
Rangers suffered another loss after Dolly Menga's shot broke Steven Gerard's invisible team and won a 1-0 victory for Livingston.
The team of Ibrox wanted to record his first victory as a triumphal guest in February with 4-1 over St. Johnston, but Gary Holt's team was only the second defeat of Gerard in his 18th match as a manager who left his team with eight points less than the late Harts team, a leader in the Ladbrokes High League.
Menga noticed seven minutes before the break, and the missing from constructive ideas the Rangers team at no time seemed close to the equation.
After the game, Rangers took off in the sixth place, and Livingston is already third, leaving the second Hybrid only on the head.
For Rangers there may be additional problems, as lateral judge Kalum Spence got a head wound after he was hit with an object that was apparently thrown by guests' fans.
Gerard made eight changes in the team that blew up Er in the semifinals of the Cup of the League of Scotland.
Holt, on the other hand, came out with the same eleven of Livingston, who pulled the point against Harts last week, and should be satisfied with the way his aggressive team was paring up all the actions of the opponent.
Rangers could have dominated the ball's reign, but Livingston managed better in the rarest cases when they owned it.
They had to notice in the second minute when Menga made a touch of Scott Pittman against the doorman Alan McGreeger, but the semi-protector missed the good opportunity.
Later, the center of Keegan Jacobs from Foul found Captain Craig Halket, but his partner in defense Alan Litgow turned the ball away from the back of the grid.
Rangers took control of the game, but they couldn't create anything in the last third of the field.
Alfredo Morelos certainly thought there must be an ass in the 15th minute when he met with Steven Lowells, but the reference Steven Thompson rejected the Colombian claims.
Rangers only made two precise hits in the first half, but the ex-door of Eibrox Liam Kelly managed easily with a hit with Lasana Kulibali's head and with a weak shot of this Ejaria.
Although Livi's fall in the 34th minute was surprising in view of the possession of the ball, it was fully deserved.
Rangers couldn't cope with Jacobs' deep focus again.
Scott Arfield doesn't react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who gave cold blood to Menga, for which it was easy to realize.
Gerard reacts to the break by changing Kulibali with Ryan Kent and this change almost immediately led to the result when the wing handed over to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came out firmly and blocked the impact.
Livingston, however, continued to force the guests to play comfortable for the domestic style of the game, as Litgou and Halket repeatedly rejected the forward long balls.
Holt's team could have increased its lead in the last few minutes, but McGreeger managed to hit Jacobs, and then next corner Litgou shot his head off the grid.
The intruder like Glen Middleton from Rangers was looking for an ass at the end of the duo after a single fight with Jacobs, but Thompson didn't see anything wrong again in the situation.
Anniversary: The inventor of the gazeger counter
Page of our anniversary Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and BROENE... the day on which the future physicist Johann Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger develops a method of saturation and measurement of radioactivity, an invention that ultimately leads to the creation of the device, known as the Geiger's counter.
A rectangular stone in science from then on, the gazer's calculator also became a corner stone to pop culture when in 1950 the film "Kornodo's Campans" was released, in which the amazing scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans apparently participated.
Man: “To God, what is this?
Rogers: This is a gauge counter and is used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these headphones, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms separated by the radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans: "Surely shoots right now!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days after his 63rd birthday.
But the discovery that bears his name continues to live.
New cancer vaccine can train the immune system to "see" foreign cells
A new cancer vaccine can train the immune system to "see" foreign cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise foreign cells as part of treatment
The method includes withdrawing immune cells from the patient and changing them to the laboratory
Then they can "see" protein, which is common to many types of cancer and injected again into the patient
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to identify foreign cells has seen her egg cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method includes withdrawing immune cells from the patient and changing them to the laboratory so that they can "see" protein, common to many types of cancer called HER2, and then injecting into the patient again.
According to Professor J. Berzofski of the U.S. National Institute of Oncology in Betheda, Maryland: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "stimulates the growth of several types of cancer", including breast, ovaries, white lungs and colorectal carcinoma, explains Professor Berzofski.
A similar approach to taking immune cells from patients and how to “train” them towards cancer cells was used in the treatment of leukaemia.
Kenny West gave a speech in support of Trump, wearing a hat with the inscription "Let's make America big again", with our participation in the SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kenny West was staged at the studio during Saturday Night Live, after he made a pointless execution in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for president in 2020.
After performing his third song for the evening, called Ghost Town, during which he was wearing a hat with the inscription "Let's make America a Big Again," he announced against the Democrats and said his support for Trump.
"Very often I talk to white people and they ask me, "How can you like Trump, he's a racist?"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
SNL began the show with Matt Damon's participation, in which the Hollywood star was playing on Brett Kavana's testimony before the Senate Legal Commission on Sexual Violence Complaints by Christine Blaise Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the West execution record was uploaded to the social networks of comics Chris Rock.
It's not clear why Rock tried to play West with his publication.
Besides, West complained to the audience that he had trouble behind the scenes because of his hat.
"They tortured me behind the scenes.
They told me, "Don't go out with this hat."
They tortured me!
And then they say I'm on a sinking ship," he said according to Washington Examiner.
West continues: "Do you want to see the sinking ship?", claiming that you will wear Superman's suit, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try it with love."
The comments provoked at least twice the disturbances of the audience and the members of the SNL team seemed embarrassed, Variety reported, saying one of them said: "The whole studio has been shut down."
West was invited at the last minute to replace the singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, rapper McMiller, died a few days ago.
West resathed many with the song "I Love it", dressed as a bottle "Perie".
West received the support of the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Kandes Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "On one of the bravest: Thank you for what has been done to TALPATA."
However, the leader of the show Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that the West was just "it was herself and that's wonderful."
"But I choose not to reward a person (by buying his music or his clothes or by supporting his "art") who I think welcomes and spreads an ideology that is valuable to society.
He's free.
That's who we are," she added.
Before the show the rapper announced on Twitter that he changed his name, and now "is officially known as Kenny West."
He's not the first artist to change his name, and he follows Didi's example, also known as Puff Grandpa, Puffy and Pi Didi.
His friend, rapper Snoop Dog, was called Snoop Lion, and the musical legend Prince changed his name with a symbol.
Indictment for attempted murder after stabbing with a knife in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man is accused of attempted murder after a man was stabbed with a knife in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, police say.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Supreme Court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the prosecutor's office.
The star of "Igran and Thrones" Keith Harrington is against toxic manhood
Keith Harrington is known for the role of John Snow's waving sword in the full violence of a medieval fantasy series by the NGO's "Play of Thrones".
But the actor, who is 31 years old, turned against the stereotype of a hero, saying that showing such roles on the screen often leads young people to think that they should be "serious" in order to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Keith said he believed that "something was wrong" and asked how to deal with the problem of toxic malehood in the age of #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married to his partner from the "Game of Thrones" Rose Leslie, also in 31, admits that she feels "strongly convinced" that this problem must be solved.
"At the moment, I am quite personally convinced – what have we been confused about manhood?" he said.
"What do we learn from the growing men about the problem that we see now?"
Keith believes that television can be partly responsible for increasing male toxicity due to many male personalities.
He continued: “What is born, and what is taught?
What is taught by television and on the street that makes boys feel they have to become this particular type of man?
I think this is really one of the big issues of our time – how can we change it?
Because obviously something's wrong with young men."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in the history or continuation of the "Game of Thrones" after the end of the series in the next summer, claiming that he was "completed with the battlefields and horses".
From November, Keith will participate in Sam Shepherd's "True West" restoration, a story about a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently said that dating his wife Rose was the best thing that happened in the Throne Game.
"I met my wife in this series, so in this way he gave me my future family and determined my life ahead," he said.
Rose plays Game, the girl that Keith John Snow's hero loves, in the fantasy series, wearing Amy's award.
The two married in June 2018 at the home of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/Spin: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China reported a leap of 14% of the population living with HIV and spin.
According to health services, more than 820,000 people are affected.
Only around 40,000 new cases have been reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases are caused by sexual contacts, which marks a change compared to the past.
Traditionally HIV spreads rapidly in parts of China as a result of blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way is almost zero, said China's health services at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, every year, the number of people living with HIV and retiring in China is increasing by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sexual contact is a serious problem in the LGBT community in China.
In 1997, homosexuality was decriminalized in China, but discrimination against people in the KGB communities is widespread.
According to conservative studies, 70-90% of men who had sexual contact with men eventually marry women.
Many cases of transmission of diseases are due to incorrect protection in these relationships.
In 2003, the Government of China promised to provide universal access to HIV medicines as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxin Waters denies that there is a leak of data from senators of the Republican Party, asserts "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
On Saturday, a member of the U.S. Chamber of Representatives Maxine Waters condemned the allegations that a member of her team had published personal information to three U.S. senators from the Republicans of the Wikipedia legislators' pages.
The Democrat of Los Angeles said the claims were made by experts and sites on the "ultra right wing".
"False, lie and still hideous lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information includes the home addresses and phone numbers of US senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch, who are from Uta.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person from the capital during the hearing of the Senate's composition on allegations of sexual misconduct against the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanau.
The disappearance was achievable after the three senators questioned Kawanau.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identified the source of the publications is linked to the Waters office, and released information about a member of her team, according to Hill.
"This unwarranted claim is completely false and is an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my team – whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these false and false claims – is in no way responsible for the leaking of this information.
This unwarranted claim is completely false and is an absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly provoked online criticism, including from the former White House Press Secretary Ari Flycher.
"There's poison in this denial," wrote Flasher.
"This implies that it does not have the temperature suitable for a Congress member.
When someone's accused of something he didn't do, he shouldn't be angry.
It shouldn't be challenging.
I don't have to question the accused's motives.
It must be calm and balanced."
Flasher compared the Waters' reaction to the criticism of Judge Kavano's democrats, who was accused by critics, that he also seemed angry at the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navaro, a Republican candidate for the place of Waters in the middle elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"In fact, if it's true," he wrote.
In his statement, Waters said her office had seized the appropriate authorities and law enforcement authorities for these misleading claims.
"We will make sure that the perpetrators will be exposed," she continued, "and that they will be legally liable for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all members of my team."
"Johnny England's Ride Again" - the weak spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
It is already traditional to look for links to Brexit in every new movie with British participation, and it seems that this is also valid for the re-establishment of the ex-comedy, espionage French for Johnny English, which started in 2003 with "John English" and returned in 2011 with "John English Returns".
Will the self-response and myths that say how obvious it is that we are stupid become a new possibility for the nation's exports?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with rounded eyes and a "gummy" person has the permission to repeat things for the second time – his name is of the utmost importance when it comes to a great comical creation intended for viewers of movies who don't speak English.
He is, of course, a stupid secret agent who, despite his strange claims, has a little of Clouseau, a little of Mr. Beyn and a large part of the man who contributed with a note on the musical theme Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony in London in 2012.
In addition, it is originally based on leaving chaos after itself a traveler and an international man who Atkinson plays in Barclaycard's already forgotten television ads.
In the last movie with Johnny English there are two good times.
I liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter, wearing a medieval armor, and for a short time the feathers were stuck in his helmet.
Atkinson's contribution to the physical comedy and obvious, but humor is quite weak and strange, especially when "serious" films such as "007" and "Mission impossible" include a dose of comedy.
The humor seems to be targeting the children rather than the adults, but Johnny English's obsessive villains, I think, are not innovative and focused, as Actinson's game reminds Mr. Beyn.
The current assumption is that Britain is facing serious problems.
Cyberhacker hacked the British super-secret network of spies and exposed the identity of all operational agents to the horror of the agent – unfortunately, a small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last drop for the prime minister, who's overcrowded and poisoned the figure and already suffers from a complete collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives everything of his own for this quay-Teresa-May role, but in the scenario there's nothing to do with.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that she should call a retired agent, as all active agents are compromised.
And that means Johnny English himself, who currently works as a teacher in a Shikosan Center, who, however, teaches illegally how to be an undercover agent: here are some good attacks when English is re-establishing a spy rock academy.
English has been called to Whitehall for urgent instruction and is gathering again with his former long-time assistant Bo, played again by Ben Miller.
Bo is already a family man married to a commandant of a submarine, a fun role in which Vicky Pepperdin's talent is a little wasted.
So Batman and Robin are back in the game to solve the big problems of Her Majesty's secret services and confront the fatally beautiful Ofelia Bouletova, played by Olga Kurilenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister falls under the dangerous influence of the charismatic technological billionaire, who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the vicious Jason Walta played by Jack Lacey.
English and Bo start their odious from fares: dressed as waiters, burn a French restaurant; create chaos when they sneak into the luxury yacht of Walta; and English causes a real anarchy when trying to use helmet for virtual reality to recognize the interior of Walta's house.
All the jokes are definitely taken from the previous film, but since it's so nice and violent, there's a lot more content here for children.
Quite a mediocre product.
Like the other movies about Johnny English, I keep thinking, can't the British film industry give the Atkinson role that meets his talent?
The labers deny that they're developing a plan for British people to work four days a week, but to get a five-day payout.
Jeremy Corbin's Liberian party is considering a radical plan that says British people work four weeks, but get paid for five.
The party argues that it wants the company's bosses to provide the economies made through the revolutionary artificial intelligence (III) to the workers, giving them another rest day.
She wants workers to enjoy a three-day weekend, but get the same pay.
The sources say the idea would "save" the economic programme and the party's plans to disband the country for the benefit of the workers.
The transition to a four-day working week was approved by the Congress of trade unions as a way for workers to benefit from the changing economy.
A higher source of the Liberian party told The Sunday Times: “It is expected to be announced before the end of the year for a policy review.
"Not to happen immediately, but the four-day working week is an effort that is included in the approach to rebalancing the economy for the benefit of the workers, as well as in the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Liberian Party will not be the first to have such an idea. The Green Party promised a four-day working week during its general election campaign in 2017.
At the moment, however, this quest does not meet the approval of the entire Liberian party.
Laberist spokesperson said: "The four-day working week is not in party politics I don't think about it."
The chancellor in shadow John McDonald used the Labourers' conference last week to reveal his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonald said he was determined to take power back from the "unfair directors" and "speculants" in the utilities companies.
The Chancellor's plans in the shadow also mean that the current owners of shares in the water supply companies may not receive their full share, as the Liberian government could impose "supply" on the basis of the established violations.
He also confirmed plans to put employees on board companies and set up privatisation funds to transfer 10 per cent of the net capital of private companies to employees who could raise annual dividends up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy speak "60 minutes ago" whether the investigation by Cavano by the FBI can change their opinion
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavano slowed the final vote on his nomination for the Supreme Court for at least one week and raised the question whether the Bureau's findings could cause some of the senators of the Republican Party to withdraw their support.
In an interview on Sunday, the correspondent of "60 minutes" Scott Pelley asked the senators from the Republican John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could find something that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"When I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Cavano.
I called him after the case, after that statement came out, and I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was determined, categorical and inseparable."
However, Graham's voice seemed uncompromising.
"I have an opinion on Brett Cavano and to change it, there is a need for a disturbing indictment," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it categorically," added Graham, turning to Christine Blassie Ford.
"And no one she mentioned, but she could confirm it.
That's 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new."
What is the "Global citizen" festival and does it help to reduce poverty at all?
This Saturday New York will host the festival "Global citizen", an annual music event that has an impressive composition of performers and also performs such an impressive mission: eradicating poverty in the world.
Now, in its seventh year, the "Global Citizens" festival will gather tens of thousands of people of the great seas in the Central Park, who will not only enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardie Be and Sean Mendes, but will also learn about the real goal of the event – the elimination of extreme poverty by 2030.
The "Global Citizens" festival, which began in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty project, an international group for protection that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting it.
To receive a free ticket for the event (except if you do not want to pay for a VIP ticket), visitors had to perform a number of tasks or "actions" such as voluntary participation, sending email to a world leader, calling the phone or connecting in another way to help raise awareness of their goal of eliminating poverty.
But how successful is "Global citizen" 12 years before reaching its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with free concerts a great way to be sure to require action or is it just another case of so-called "clitivism" – people think they do something important when they sign online petition or post on Twitter?
Since 2011, "Global citizen" has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, who insist on many different goals.
It says that these actions have helped world leaders to declare commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and messages arising from its actions, which have already been paid or collected at least $10 billion.
The group believes that the funds provided have already directly affected nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the main commitments include "The Power of Food", established in the UK partnership between investors and performers, "helping children develop their full potential", which promises to provide Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4700 posts on Twitter from "global citizens".
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into just a historical note," said the Ambassador of the "Food Force" Tracy Ulman in front of the London live concert audience in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions have been taken, which call on Britain to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government has reported funding for the project, "The Power of Food", which will reach 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the CCWs on his website, asking "Why do you think we can stop the extreme poverty?"
"Global citizen" replied: This will be a long and difficult path – sometimes we will fail and we will fail again.
But as with the great movement for civil rights and against apartheid before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weekend, Sean Mendez, Cardy Bye, Janel Mona are just some of the performers of this year's New York event, which will lead to Deborah-Ley Fernes and Hu Jackman.
The US can use military forces to "block" and prevent energy exports – the Minister of Interior
Washington may, if necessary, resort to its military forces to prevent the entry of Russian energy products into the markets, including the Middle East, revealed US Interior Minister Ryan Zink, as Washington Examiner quoted.
Zink argues that Russia's engagement in Syria – more specifically, where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government – is a foreword to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to sell energy, just as they did in Eastern and South Europe," he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to deal with this.
"The United States can, through our military forces, ensure that the seaways are open and, if necessary, block them to ensure that energy products do not reach the market," he said.
Zink referred to the event organised by Consumer Energy Alliance, a group with a non-economic purpose that is represented as the "voice of energy users" in the United States.
He aimed to compare Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are the same.
"The economic option for Iraq and Russia is, more or less, fuel-stimulating and replacing," he said, while at the same time defining Russia as "one-number ponies", with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements come at a time when Trump's administration has the task of strengthening the export of liquid gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, officials in the Trump administration, including US president Donald Trump themselves, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" "North Stream 2" pipeline project, which according to Trump turns Berlin into a "premises".
Moscow has stressed several times that the pipeline for $11 billion of "North Stream 2", which will double the existing capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a clean economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington's burning opposition to the project is simply produced for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the point of view, energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Russia's energy minister Alexander Novak said after meeting with US energy minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position triggered a negative reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German industry organisation, the German Industry Federation (DBDI), called for the US not to interfere with EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third party interferes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industry (BDI), after a recent meeting between the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will take seriously" the presidential nomination in 2020, says Senator of Massachusetts
Senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that he would "seriously look" at the presidential nomination after the mid-term elections.
During a city council in Holioke, Massachusetts Warren confirmed that he was considering applying.
"It is time for women to enter Washington and fix our broken government and that includes a woman on top," she said, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November I will take a serious look at the presidential nomination."
Warren expressed his appreciation for President Donald Trump during the city council, saying that he “leads this country in the wrong direction.
"I feel at the bottom of my soul as Donald Trump does with our democracy," she said.
Warren was exposed in his criticism of Trump and his candidate for Supreme Court Brett Cavano.
In a post on Twitter on Friday Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
However, the sociological study carried out on Thursday showed that most of Warren’s voters do not think that it should be candidate in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "probably" voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not apply, according to the study of Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported this candidacy.
Social research has shown more support for the candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent and 48 per cent against.
Other senior representatives of the Democratic Party, discussed on potential candidates in 2020, include former Vice President Joe Byden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Byidon said he would take an official decision in January, reported Associated Press.
Sara Palin pointed out the PTSD to Trac Palin at a meeting for Donald Trump
Trac Palin, on 26th, spent a year in Iraq after his entry in September.
He was arrested and accused of an incident with domestic violence on Monday night
"What my own son goes through, after returning, is known to other families who feel the consequences of the PTSD and some of the wounds our soldiers are coming with," she told the audience of a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "an elephant in the room" and said about his son and other war veterans that "they return a little changed, accelerated, returned and wondered if they would receive this respect which they and their brothers had given to the country."
He was arrested Monday in Vasil, Alaska and accused of assault and domestic violence against a woman, was included in a report on domestic violence and possession of weapons in a state of emergency, according to Dan Bennet, spokesperson for Vasil police.
18 states and the District of Colombia support the challenge of the new asylum policy
The Eighteen states and the District of Colombia support the judicial challenge of a new US policy that rejects asylum for victims of gang and domestic violence.
On Friday, representatives from the 18th States and the county submitted a request of goodwill in Washington in support of the asylum seekers and contesting politics, NBC News reported.
The full name of the petitioner in the Grace v. Sessions case has not been disclosed, which the US Civil Liberties Union filed against the federal policy in August.
She claims that her partner "and the sons of his gang's cruel members" have abused her, but the US officials have rejected the asylum request on July 20th.
She's under arrest in Texas.
The state lawyers who are helping Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum seekers come to the United States, such as nations facing widespread gang and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy returned the decision of the 2014 Immigration Appeals Council, which allowed immigrant documents fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District Attorney Carl Rasin said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law."
"The federal law requires all requests for asylum to be examined in accordance with the specific facts and circumstances and such a ban violates this principle," the report of good will says.
In addition, lawyers argue in the report that the policy that refuses immigrants to enter is detrimental to the American economy, claiming that it is more likely that they will become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary labour force."
In June, Chief Prosecutor Jeff Sessions ordered the immigration courts to stop providing asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and domestic violence.
"Refugees are given to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion," Sessions said in its communication of 11 July on politics.
The purpose of the asylum was never to alleviate all the problems – not even all the serious ones – that people face every day, all over the world.
Desperate efforts to save Palu while the death cases are doubled during the search for survivors
The situation for survivors is getting worse.
"I feel very tense," said the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, calming her sick boy in an evacuation center in the desert city of Palu.
"Every minute the ambulance carries more corpses.
Clean water's dirty."
The inhabitants are noted to return to their ruined homes to try to save something from their inundated belongings.
Hundreds of people have been injured, and hospitals injured by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake are filled.
Some of the victims, including Two Harris, who had suffered a fracture of the back and shoulder, were found outside the Army Hospital in Palu, where patients were treated openly due to ongoing secondary rabbits.
His eyes are filled with tears as he recalls his severe earthquake in the hotel room on the fifth floor that he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I think I was pressed into the destroyed wall," Harris told the Associated Press, adding that he came to town with his family to attend the wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help, but then I shut up.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
The US Ambassador accuses China of "barm" with "propaganda"
One week after an official newspaper in China released a four-page advertisement in the US daily for the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the US envoy in China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
Last Wednesday, US President Donald Trump referred to China Daily's paid publication in the Des Moines Register – the most sold newspaper in Iowa – after accusing China of trying to interfere in the US Congress elections on November 6th.
Trump's accusation that Peky was trying to interfere with the US Congress elections, noted what US officials told Reuters that it was a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to issue promotions to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently participating in a escalating trade war in which import tariffs are balanced between countries.
According to US and China experts at the beginning of the trade war, customs tariffs in China were intended to strike exporters in states such as Iowa, which support the Republic of Trump.
Teri Branstad, the US ambassador to China and the former long-standing governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods for China, said Beijing had added US workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad writes in a comment in the Sunday issue of the Des Moines Register, "now doubles this brake by placing propaganda advertisements in our own free press."
"In spreading its propaganda, China's government takes advantage of America's respected tradition of freedom of speech and the press, putting a paid advertising at the Des Moines Register," Branstad writes.
"In contrast, on a newspaper stand down the street here in Beijing, you will find limited statements and you will not see a true reflection of the diverse views that the Chinese people may have regarding China's worrying economic trajectory, given that the media is under strict control of the Chinese Communist Party," he writes.
He adds that "one of the most famous Chinese newspapers avoids the proposal to publish" his article, although it does not specify exactly who.
With Kavano's crowd, the Republicans call out women's voters for inter-elections, analysts warn
As many of the high-ranking republicans stand behind and defend the nominations for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavano in relation to several charges of sexual assault, analysts warned that there would be a reaction, in particular from women, during the upcoming intermediate elections.
The emotions around the table are extremely strong and most Republicans have already noticed that they want to continue voting.
These things can't be returned," said Grant Racher, professor of political science at Maxwell University in Syracuse, in front of The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Rahr said he doubted whether Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s last-minute insistence on an FBI investigation would be sufficient to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it either tomorrow or November," said Karin Jean-Pierer, a senior adviser and national speaker for the Progressive Group MoveOn, on Friday, according to the Washington newspaper.
On Friday morning, protestors ran "Noemvry is coming!" during a demonstration in the Senate hall, as Republicans who control the judicial commission decided to continue with the nomination of Cavano despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blassie Ford, Mic said.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be ruled out," said Steu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst.
"The people say that the problem is already serious; that is true.
But it can become even more serious, especially among women voters in the suburbs and younger voters, between 18 and 29 years old, who often do not vote because they don't like the president."
Even before Ford's public testimony describing her allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nomination, analysts assume that she may follow a reaction if the Republicans insist on confirming the candidacy.
"This became a big mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steel, former president of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee's vote, the final vote, or whether Kavano is put on the scale. It's about how the Republicans deal with it and how they deal with it," said Gai Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps choose Democrats.
The Americans, however, seem to be somewhat divided about who they believe in as a result of Ford and Cavano's testimony, slightly more inclined to the second.
A new sociological study by YouTube shows that 41 percent of respondents are either certain or likely to believe in Ford's testimony, and 35 percent say that they are definitely or probably believed in Kavano.
In addition, 38 percent say that they believe Kavano probably or certainly lied during his testimony, while 30 percent claim the same for Ford.
After Flake's insistence at the moment, the FBI investigates Ford's claims, as well as at least another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Last week Ford testified under oath to the Senate's judicial commission that Kavano attacked her in a state of emergency when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed her genitals before her while they were at a party during her follow-up at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to start a new Internet to attack Google and Facebook
The inventor of the World Wide Web Team Burners-Lei starts a start that aims to compete on Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the legend in the field of technology, Inrupt, is a company that builds the platform with an open code of Burners-Ley Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people have permission to access certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company Burners-Lei, the intention behind Inrupt is "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said about the beginning.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology, which allows people to create their own online personal data store or POD.
It contains lists, lists of tasks, calendars, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It looks like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, which are available through every browser, and at the same time is all of them at the same time.
The unique feature of the online personal data store is that the user determines who has access to the information.
The company calls it "give power to personal data".
The idea of Inrupt, according to the executive director of John Bruce, is to invest resources, processes and skills to help Solid become accessible to all.
Currently the company consists of Burners-Ley, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several developers, concluded a project work contract, and a group of volunteer programmers.
From this week on, technology developers around the world can create their decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Burners-Ley said that he and his team don't talk to Facebook and Google about whether to make a complete change, or not, when all their business models are completely updated for one night.
"We don't want permission from them."
In a publication in Medium on Saturday, Burners-Lei wrote that the Inrupt mission is to provide energy for trade and the ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid.
In 1994, Burners-Ley transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium in the Massachusetts Technical Institute.
In recent months, Burners-Ley has had a strong influence in the debate on network neutrality.
Despite the launch of Inrupt, Burners-Ley will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely optimistic about this new era on the Internet," Burners-Ley added.
Bernard Van: in the memory of the priest, worthy of the cross Victoria during World War I
They mark 100 years in the native city of the only Anglican priest worthy of the cross of Victoria for his participation in hostilities during World War I.
Colonel Bernard Van won the award on 29 September 1918 at the Bellengise and Lehaucourt attack.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper, not knowing he was worthy of the highest military honors of Britain.
A monument was discovered on Saturday by his two grandchildren on a parade in Rusden, Northamptanshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said it was "extremely symbolic" to discover exactly 100 years from his grandfather's case with a medal.
According to London Gazette of 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Van led his battalion through Canal de Saint-Quentin “in a very dense fog and heavy shot by artillery and cartels.”
Later, he attacked the fireline and with "incredibly bravery" led the building ahead before attacking an artillery weapon with one hand and beating three of the crew.
Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – only a month before the end of the war.
Michael Van, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "something I know I could never do, but it makes me calm."
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, placed a wedding after the parade, led by "Brentwood Imperial Youth Band".
Michael Van said it was "a great honor to participate in the parade" and added "the virtue of the true hero is demonstrated by the support that will be given to many people."
MMA fans waited all night to watch Bellator 206, but instead they got Peppa Pig
Imagine that you are waiting all night to see a full edition of Bellator 206 and finally you cannot become witnesses to the main event.
The San Jose program contained 13 doubles, including six of the main card and had to be broadcast live in the night in United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6 p.m., just when Gegard Musasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to face each other, the viewers in the United Kingdom were shocked when the presentation changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were disappointed when they were building up to the early hours, especially because of the twins.
Fen described on Twitter the switch on the children's animation film as "some kind of sick joke".
"The government regulates that this content is not appropriate at 6 p.m., so the program was replaced by a children's lecture," said Dave Schwarz, Senior Vice-President for Marketing and Communications of Bellator, in response to the issue of broadcasting.
"Peppa pig," yes."
The president of Bellator Scott Kocker said they would work on meeting planning to include viewers from Britain in the future.
"I think, when it comes to repetitions, we can solve the problem," Koker said.
"There is, however, six in the morning on Sunday and there is no way to plan things so that the event will take place here on Sunday and there on Monday.
We're still working on this.
Believe me, when the program was changed, we got a lot of messages and not everyone was friendly.
We tried to fix it because we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't like that, it was government.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We will stick to the inclusion of five doubles instead of six – as we usually do. We tried to provide more to the fans, but we crossed.
It's a bad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daily felt "less" because of his sexuality
The Olympic water jumper Tom Dale says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality – but that motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old athlete claims that until he started high school, he didn't realize that "not all are like me."
In an interview with the first edition of Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, led by Lauren Lavern, he spoke about gay rights to give hope to others.
He also said that when he became a parent, he began to care less about winning the Olympics.
The permanent leader of the long-term show, Cursty Young, is in hospital for a few months.
In his participation in Lavern Daily's first program, he said he felt "less" than everyone else when he was growing up, as "it was not socially acceptable to like girls and boys."
He said: “To this day, the feeling of inferiority, and the fact that I am different from others, are actually the things that give me energy and strength to succeed. ”
He wanted to prove that it was "something," he said, so he didn't disappoint anyone when he finally learned about his sexuality.
The double Olympic Bronze Medal became an active participant in LGBT's campaigns and used its participation in the British Community Games in Australia this year to call on more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said he was doing this because he was happy that he could live openly, without consequences, and he wanted to inspire "hope" of others.
The three-time world champion said that when he fell in love with a man – American director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – he was "surprisingly surprised."
Daley married Oscar's carrier, who was 20 years older than he was last year, but claimed that the difference in age was never a problem.
"When you go through so much while you're so young," he participated for the first time in the 14th Olympics, and his father died of cancer three years later," he said, "it's hard to find someone at your age who's had such withdrawals and falls."
They both became parents in June, and they have a son called Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley himself says that "his whole vision of peace" has changed.
"If you had asked me last year, I would tell you that I'm only interested in winning a gold medal," he said.
"You know, there are more important things than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic Gold Medal is Robbie."
His son was baptized by his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40, after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father couldn't accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked about was whether they already had tickets for the 2012 London Olympics – as he wanted to be in the first place.
"I couldn't tell him "you wouldn't be with me, Dad, nor in the first order," he said.
"I held his hand until he stopped breathing, and at that moment when I realized he was dead, I finally admitted that he was not vulnerable," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I just knew that I've been dreaming my whole life about it – jumping to the Olympics before the audience at home.
It also inspired the choice of his first song – "Proud" by Heather Small – who accompanied him during his preparation for the Olympic Games and still makes him feel better.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 a.m. British summer time.
The lost Mikelson form remains on the Ryder Cup scale on Saturday
American Phil Mikelson will set a record on Sunday when he will win his 47th game at the Ryder Cup, but he will have to return his old form if he doesn't want his record to be tied to failure.
Mikelson, who participated in a two-year record event for the 12th time, was left on Captain Jim Furik's stand for "fourball" and "foursome" matches on Saturday.
Instead of being the main figure in the U.S. team again, the five-time winner of big tournaments spent his day as a fan and in training his blows away with the hope of correcting his weaknesses.
The 48-year-old athlete, who was never even at the top of his career among the most regular players, is not in the best form for the difficult game of Le Golf National, where the long uneven terrain usually penalises every wrong hit.
And if the game itself isn't worrying enough, on Sunday, the ninth match, Mikelson will face the precise champion of the British Open French Molinari, who's on the team with the new champion Tommy Flitwood and are trying to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans who leave four points before the 12th single match make a strong start, it may turn out that Mikelson's match is absolutely decisive.
Furik expressed confidence in his associate, although he could hardly say anything much different.
"He fully understood his role today, suffocated me, hugged me, and said he'd be ready tomorrow," Furik said.
"He's confident of himself.
He is a member of the Hall of Glory and has given as much as in the past and this week.
I probably didn't imagine him playing in two matches.
I expected him to play more, but that's just how he did it, and we believe we made the right decision.
He wants to be on the golf course and play, as well as everyone else."
Mikelson will improve Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup matches, played on Sunday.
This can put an end to his career in the Ryder Cup, which has never come close to his impressive individual achievements.
Mikelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven equal matches, but Furik said his presence also brings other benefits to the team that are not measured by numbers.
"He's funny, sarcastic, sharp, he likes to joke with people and he's a great man for every team," he explained.
"I think that even younger players had fun with him, especially this week.
He gives a lot more than that just to play."
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, is aware that the great advantage can soon be achieved
The European team captain, Thomas Bjorn, knows from personal experience that the great foreplay, accumulated before the single match since the last day of the Ryder Cup, can be easily abolished.
The Dutch debuted in the game of "Valderrama" in 1997, when the team with Captain Sve Balisteros led with five points in front of the Americans, but exactly on the final right was almost reached and barely managed to win with 141⁄2-131.2.
"You continue to remember that we had a great lead on Valderrama; we had a great lead on Brookline, where we lost, and on Valderrama we won, but very difficult," said Bjorn, after the European team won 5-3 sessions on Friday and yesterday, with 10-6 of Le Golf National:
So the story has to show both to me and to everyone on the team that it's not all over.
Be ready for the attack tomorrow.
Get out and do what you have to do.
Nothing's over until you see the final result on the table.
We have a goal and she's trying to win this trophy, and that's exactly what we need to stay focused on.
All the time I said that I only thought about the 12 players in our team, but we are also aware of our rivals, who are the biggest players in the world."
Satisfied with the performance of the players in a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never rush with the holidays.
It'll be different tomorrow.
Tomorrow's front-line performances will come out, and that's different.
It's great to be there with a partner when everything goes well, but when you go out alone, then you put your full capacity as a golf player to the test.
That's the message you have to get to the players: tomorrow you have to give the best of yourself.
Now you can turn your back on your partner, because he must give himself up to the end."
Unlike Bjorn, the captain of the enemy Jim Furik will want his players to appear better individually than as partners, except for Jordan Spite and Justin Thomas, who took three out of four possible points.
The Furik himself was from both sides of these great reverses in the last day – he was part of the triumph of Brooklyn, and then from the losing side when Europeans performed the "Miracle of Medina".
"I remember every damn word," he said in answer to the question of how Ben Krenshaw, the captain in 1999 brought his players in the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but it would be good to make the same good start as you saw at Brooklyn, as well as at Medinah.
When the advantage passes from one direction to the other, these intermediate games are played under tremendous stress.
That's why we formed our constitution and distributed our boys the way we want to try to do the impossible tomorrow."
Thomas has been assigned the task of leading our counterattack and facing Rory McKilroy in the most important match, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Flitwood and Jan Polter will meet the other Europeans in the upper half of the order.
"I have chosen these players in this order because I think it gives us the greatest chances of success," Bjorn said about his choice of singles.
Germany postpones the launch of a new warship
The German fleet's most recent fleet had to be put into operation in 2014 to replace the old warships since the Cold War, but this would not be implemented until the following year due to faulty systems and the chiefly growing costs reported by local media.
The introduction into operation of ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’, the leading ship of the brand new fragments of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, was postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the Die Zeit newspaper, which quoted an army speaker.
The shipyard had to join the military forces in 2014, but the problems that arose after its delivery affected the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships ordered by the fleet in 2007 will replace the old Bremen class frigates.
We understand that they will have a powerful weapon, a set of air and anti-air and anti-aircraft missiles, as well as some steal technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods – the newest brakes must be able to be used for up to two years before they return to their home ports.
The constant delays, however, mean that advanced military ships – which are said to allow Germany to demonstrate force beyond the ocean – will already be old when entering operation, Die Zeit notes.
The evil F125 flag entered the heading last year when the German fleet officially refused to release the shipyard into operation and returned it to the shipyard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This is the first time the fleet returns a ship to the shipyard after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German media quoted a number of essential "software and hardware defects" that make the warship useless if sent to a military mission.
The software deficiencies are particularly important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class vessels will be managed by a crew of about 120 sailors – only half of the crew of older Bremen class frigates.
In addition, it has been shown that the ship is significantly overloaded, which reduces its efficiency and restricts the ability of the military forces to add future surpluses.
The 7000-ton Rhineland-Pfalz is thought to be twice as heavy as the ships of a similar class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the cost of the whole project – including crew training – also becomes a problem.
It is estimated that the staggering 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) have been reached – from the original 2.2 billion euros.
The problems with the latest brakes become particularly important in the light of recent warnings that the military forces of Germany are turning.
Earlier this year Hans-Peter Bartelles, head of the German Parliament's Defence Commission, admitted that the fleet is actually "depleted from ships capable of carrying out missions".
The official said that the problem had become bigger in time, as the old ships were taken out of operation, but no new ones were provided.
He complained that no badger of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could be included in the fleet.
National Trust Follows the Secret Life of Stickers
A new study, carried out on a property in the Scottish mountains, aims to determine how the adhesives use the landscape when hunting.
The hopes are that the discoveries will shed new light on the behavior of the unique flying bats and will help guide future conservation actions.
The study by scientists from the National Trust of Scotland will follow the often met stickers as well as the brown-eyed water-night shooters at the Inverewe Gardens in Western Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed at key locations in the property to track the activities of the trailers during the season.
NHS and volunteers will also conduct mobile studies using hand detectors.
The expert sound analysis of all the recordings will determine the frequency of the calling sounds of the adhesives as well as what types they publish.
Then a map of the dwelling and report will be prepared to create a detailed landscape picture of their behaviour.
Rob Duar, a nature conservation adviser for NTS, is hoped that the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important for the adhesives and how they are used of any kind.
This information will help determine the benefits of the housing management work, such as the creation of meadows, as well as the best way to maintain forest areas for the trailers and other associated species.
The populations of sticky in Scotland and the United Kingdom have decreased significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by the construction activities that affect their shelters and lead to the loss of their homes.
The risk to populations may include wind turbines and lighting, aerial appliances and some chemical processing of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
In fact, the adhesives are not blind.
However, because of their nighttime fishing habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use an improved cholocation technique to absorb insects and obstacles on their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76 000 hectares of land in the country, takes the adhesives very seriously.
The trust is equipped with trained experts who carry out regular investigations, asylum inspections and sometimes rescue operations.
The organisation has even created the first in Scotland and the only special attachment reserve in Thrave in the Dumfries and Galway area, which is home to eight of the ten species of attachments in Scotland.
The manager of the David Thompson property says it's an ideal territory for them.
"Here, in Thrave, we have a great field for adhesives," he noted.
"We have old buildings, very old trees and completed suitable housing.
But there are many more things about the adhesives that are not known, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us to understand better what they need to thrive."
He stressed that it was important to check the availability of adhesives before carrying out property maintenance activities, as it is possible to destroy a shelter by killing up to 400 women and young adhesives as well as by destroying the entire local population.
The adhesives are a protective form and it's illegal to kill, freeze, disturb or destroy their shelters.
Elizabeth Ferl, a Scottish servant in Trust to protect the adhesives, encouraged society to help.
She said: “I still have much to learn about our sticky and many of our animal species, because we just don’t know what’s going on with their populations. ”
Ronaldo rejects allegations of rape and his lawyers will judge a German magazine
Christian Ronaldo defined the allegations of rape against him as "false news", saying that people "want to be known", using his name.
His lawyers will judge the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which publishes these claims.
The attacker of Portugal and Yuventus was accused of rape of American Catherine Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He claims that after that he paid her $375 000 to silence the incident reported by Der Spiegel on Friday.
In a video in Instagram, addressing its 142 million followers, a few hours after the publication of the claims, 33-year-old Ronaldo sealed the publication as "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said about me today is false news," the gold ball's fifth carrier told the camera.
"They want to be known by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to raise the popularity of my back, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's okay," the footballer smiled.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to judge Der Spiegel for the claims that "inadmissible publication of personal life suspicions", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Sherz said that the footballer would seek compensation for "moral damage in proportion to the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
It is claimed that the incident in question occurred in June 2009 in an apartment at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga went to the football room where they claimed that he raped her Annaly, according to the documents filed in the district court of the Clark District in Nevada.
Majorga claims that after the incident Ronaldo fell on his knees and told her he was a "good boy" of "99%", but in the case he just surrendered to "one percent".
According to the documents, Ronaldo confirmed they had sex, but this happened with her consent.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police and that photos of her injuries were taken at the hospital, but later she agreed to an extrajudicial agreement because she felt "feared by revenge" and worried that she would not "be publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman says she wants to cancel the agreement as she continues to live with the injury caused by the incident.
During the incident Ronaldo was on the verge of joining the Royal Madrid of Manchester United, and this summer he moved to the Italian Grand Juventus for the amount of 100m euros.
Brexit: Britain "will regret forever", that it has lost car manufacturers
Britain "will regret forever," if it loses its status as a world leader in car production after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it is "anxious", that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, they will temporarily stop production at their factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," he said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of delaying the border in the case of Brexit without a deal could lead to loss of jobs.
In the factory in Burnaston – where the Auris and Avensis models are produced – around 150,000 cars were manufactured last year, 90% of which were exported to other countries from the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain left the EU at the end of March, our production in the plant will stop," said Marvin Cook, director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, expressed their concerns about leaving the EU without agreement and how cross-border trade will work.
BMW, for example, says they'll shut down their mini model factory in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of car manufacturers relate to the risks of the supply chain in cases of non-trading Brexit.
Toyota's production line works on the "precisely time" principle, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers from both Britain and the EU for cars manufactured by order.
If Britain leaves the EU without a transaction on 29 March, there may be problems at the border, which the industry believes could lead to delays and partial shortcomings.
For Toyota it would be impossible to wait more than one day to complete their inventory at the Darbisher plant, they said from the company, so the production will stop.
Mr Clark said that Teresa May's "shamata" plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks."
"We need to have a deal. We want to conclude the best deal that will allow us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to seize this opportunity," he said in BBC Radio's 4's Today program.
"After the claims not only of Toyota, but also of other producers, we are absolutely convinced that we must be able to continue to provide successful supply chains."
Toyota cannot say how long the production will be stopped, but in a longer term they warn that additional costs will reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately lead to loss of jobs.
Peter Cualaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the founder of the United Union in the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “I feel that if these jobs go away, they will never return.
A government speaker said: "We have set out an accurate and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU."
The meeting between Trump and Rosenstein can be postponed again, says the White House
The extremely important meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Chief Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein can be "delayed for another week", as the candidate for Supreme Court Brett Cavano continues to fight, reports the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein is monitoring the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates the Russian intervention in the elections, the links between Trump and Russia's assistants and the potential impediment to justice by the president.
Whether Trump will fire the Deputy Chief Prosecutor, or not, or in this way threatens Mueller's independence, for months he's been feeding on Washington's hearings.
Earlier this month's New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the possibility of wearing a microphone to record talks with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denies this claim.
But last Monday he went to the White House after reports that he would resign.
Instead, while Trump was in the United Nations headquarters in New York, a meeting was announced with him on Thursday.
Trump said he would prefer not to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed in order to avoid conflict with the Senate's hearing before the legal commission, which they witnessed both Kavano and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment – Dr. Christine Blaise Ford.
On Friday Trump ordered a one-week investigation by the FBI of complaints against Kavano, even more slowing the Senate's full vote.
Trump's spokesman, Sara Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “It may be a week, but seeing all the other things that are happening in the Supreme Court, I think it can be postponed for the next week.
But we'll see, and I always try to keep the press informed."
Some reporters would argue this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference from the White House since 10 September.
The leader of the show Chris Wallace asked for the reason.
Sanders rejected that the rare press conferences were not due to the "demonstrational behaviour" of television journalists, although he said: "I cannot say that I disagree with the fact that they have demonstratorial behaviour."
Then she suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president conducts more sessions with questions and answers from each president before him," she added, without quoting the evidence: "We have checked these statistics."
There will still be press conferences, Sanders continued, but "if press representatives have a chance to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, that is far better than talking to me.
We're trying to do it often and you're witnesses to practice it very often in the last few weeks, and that will replace the press conferences once you have the opportunity to talk to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with high-level guests.
Lonely press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may show why, with his eccentric and at times strange behavior in front of the assembled journalists.
The Minister of Health turned to EU workers in the Scottish National Health Service for concerns related to Brexit
The Minister of Health addressed EU staff working in the National Health Service of Scotland in writing to express the country's gratitude and desire to remain in their seats after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter to the remaining less than six months before Britain left the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed itself to the costs of the established procedures for the status of EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: "In the summer negotiations between Britain and the EU on abandonment continued, with decisions expected this fall.
But the UK government is also making progress in its preparations for a possible scenario without a deal.
I'm sure this is a very uncertain period for all of you.
That is why I would like to remind you how much I appreciate each servant's contribution, regardless of his nationality.
Members of the EU as a whole and beyond contribute valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, which is of benefit to the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is unconditionally your home and we would like you to stay here."
Krischen Abercromby undergoes emergency surgery after having a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers Liner, Christian Abercromby, underwent an emergency operation after receiving head trauma during the meeting on Saturday, when his team lost Vanderbilt Comodors with 31-27, reported Mike Organ of Tennessee.
The senior coach of Tennessee State, Rod Reid, shared with reporters that the trauma happened just before the mid-term.
"He went to the side line and somehow just fell there," Reid said.
Trainers and medical personnel submitted Abercrombi's oxygen to the side line before it was placed on the conveyor and placed in the pick-up boxes for further inspection.
Tennessee State official confirmed in front of Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercromby was out of surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are still no details of the type/seriousness of the trauma", and that Tennessee State is trying to understand when the trauma occurred.
Abercromby, a second student with a college scholarship, is for the first season in Tennessee State after his transfer from Illinois.
On Saturday he made a total of five blocks before leaving a match, which makes a total of 18 blocks for him during this season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher herb tax when buying real estate in Britain
According to new plans of the conservators, foreign buyers will be charged a higher herb tax when buying real estate in the UK, with additional funds to help homeless people.
This move will neutralize Corbin's efforts to attract young voters
Increase in herb tax will affect those who do not pay taxes in Britain
The government has expected an increase of over 120 million pounds a year, which will help homeless people
Theresa May will announce today the decision of foreign buyers to pay a higher Herb tax on the purchase of real estate in Britain, with additional revenues going to help homeless people.
This move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbin's efforts to attract young voters, promising more accessible housing and is directed towards people with high incomes.
The increase in herb's tax will affect individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in Britain, with additional revenues supporting government efforts to limit the number of people sleeping on the street.
The supplement – which is an addition to the current herb tax, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for second houses and properties purchased for surrender – may amount to up to three percent.
The government has been expecting an increase of up to 120 million pounds a year.
About 13% of the newly built buildings in London are purchased by people with citizenship outside the UK, which leads to price increases and makes it difficult for people who buy their property for the first time to interfere in the property market.
Many of the rich areas – especially in the capital – have become "prison cities" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy appears only a few weeks after Boris Johnson requested a reduction in herb's tax to help more young people own their first home.
He accused the large construction companies of maintaining high property prices by robbing the land, but not using it, and asked Mrs. May to leave the quotas for affordable housing to correct the "warning" of the British housing.
Mr Corbin announced an attractive series of proposals for housing reform, including control of rents and the end of the expulsions "without wine".
He also wants to give the councils greater power to build new houses.
Mrs. May said: “Last year I shared that I would like to devote my time as a prime minister to restoring the British dream – the life of every new generation to be better.
And that means repairing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open doors for those who want to live, work and build their lives here.
But it is not common for people who do not live in Britain as well as foreign companies to buy as easily as hard as British workers.
For too many people the dream of owning their own home has gone too far in time, and the pollution from sleeping on the street remains too realistic."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to lead the team of Scotland"
Sunderland Manager Jack Ross said that "the greatest ambition" in his career is to be the senior coach of the Scottish national team.
The 42-year-old Scottish accepted the challenge of creating a club from northeastern England, which is currently in the third position in the First League, at three points from the first.
He went to Stadium of Light this summer, after last season he took St. Miran back to the Scottish High League.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I wrote a match for the B team, and that's all," Ross told the Scottish BBC Sportsound.
"But I grew up with the games of Scotland of Hampdon, which we watched as a child with my father, so the national team always attracted me.
"This opportunity, however, would only be opened if I were successful at the club level."
Among Ross' predecessors as Sanderland's managers are Dick Advocaat, David Mois, Sam Alardais, Martin O'Neil, Roy Kein, Gus Poet and Paolo Di Canio.
Aloa Atletik's former teacher said he was not concerned as an heir to such established names in such a famous club, as he had previously rejected offers from Barnes and Ipsuic Town.
"For me success at this moment will be measured with a positive answer to the question "Can I return this club to the Supreme League?"
Because by structure, basis and conditions he is undoubtedly at the level of the Supreme League," he said.
"It will not be easy to get back to the highest level of football, but I will assume that I have achieved success here only if I can get the team back there."
Ross has been a manager for only three years after he spent some time as a assistant in Dumabarton and 15 months at Harts' training station.
Then he helped Aloa not to fall into the Third Division and turned St. Miran from a winning team in the Championship next season.
Ross shares that he now feels more comfortable than he did during his career as a footballer in Clyde, Hartlipoul, Folkerk, St. Miran and Hamilton Academy.
"I was really on the cross," he remembers when he took Aloe.
"I really believed that being a manager is the best way for me, including before I was an active player.
It sounds weird because I did well, I made good money, and I had some significant success.
But sometimes it's hard to play.
There are a lot of things you have to deal with every week.
I'm still facing the same stress and stress levels at work, but I just feel that being a manager is the right direction for me.
I've always wanted to be a manager and now that I'm really doing it, I've never felt more comfortable in my skin in my whole conscious life."

The perfect time for beer is 5:30pm on Saturday, discovers research
The summer heat increases the income of the struggling British pubs, but increases the tension for the chains of restaurants.
The groups of pubs and bars reported an increase in sales by 2.7 per cent in July, but revenues in restaurants decreased by 4.8 per cent, statistics show.
Peter Martin of the Business Consultant CGA, which compiled statistics, said: "Since the long-term solar period and longer time went by England's expected participation in the World Cup, in July, there was a similar model as in June, when audiences reported growth of 2.8 per cent, but the restaurants were hit even stronger.
The fall of 1.8% in the restaurant business in June only deepened in July.
Pubbs and drinks bars reported the best results in their growth compared to the lower movement of restaurants.
The eating pubs also suffered from the sun's time, but not as much as the owners of restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to go out and drink something.
In pubs and bars, sales of drinks jumped by 6.6 per cent per month, while in food there was a 3 per cent decrease."
Paul Newman, from the rest and entertainment analysts RSM, said: “These results continue to be the trend that we observed at the end of April.
The time and impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the services sector outside the home.
It is not surprising that groups of restaurants continue to suffer, although a drop in sales of 4.8 per cent on an annual basis may be particularly painful in addition to the constant costs.
The long hot summer could not have appeared at a worse time for food managers and only time would show whether the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August would bring the desired rest."
The overall growth in sales in pubs and restaurants, including the new ones, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowdown in branding.
Coffer Peach Tracker, the sales analyst for pubs, bars and restaurants in the UK, collects and analyzes data for the execution of 47 operational groups, with a total turnover of over 9 billion British pounds, and is a confirmed indicator in the sector.
One of the five children hides a secret profile from their parents on the social network
One of five children — some only 11 — has a secret profile on a social network that hides from their parents and teachers — revealed a study
Study conducted among 20,000 high school students shows growth of fake Insta pages
News increased fears that sexual content should be published
Twenty percent of students said they have a "basic" profile that shows their parents
One of the five children — some of whom are 11 — creates a social network profile that keeps adults in secret.
A study of 20,000 high school students shows growth in fake Insta accounts – a link to the Instagram photo sharing site.
News increased fears that sexual content should be published.
Twenty percent of students said they have a clean "basic" profile that shows their parents, while at the same time having secret profiles.
A mother who posted herself on the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter discovered a teenager who encouraged others to " rape him".
The study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Directors (HMC) of Independent Schools found that 40 percent of children between 11 and 18 years of age have two profiles, half of them admit to keeping their profiles secret.
HMC leader Mike Bucanan said: "It is impressive that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Elid Doyle will be "the voice of athletes" on the Board of Light Athletics in Scotland
Elid Doyle was elected to join the Board of Light Athletics in Scotland as a director without performing the functions of the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's lighthouse with the greatest achievements and President Ian Beatit has identified this move as a great opportunity for those leading to sport to take advantage of her rich international experience over the past decade.
"Eylide enjoys great respect in the light-based communities of Scotland, Britain and the world, and we are convinced that light-based athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from its attractiveness," Bitet said.
Doyle said: “I want to be the voice of athletes and I really hope I can contribute and help promote sports in Scotland.”
The American who won the finals of 200 and 400 meters of the Atlanta Olympics in 1996, adding to his total four Olympic gold medals, and is currently a regular commentator at BBC, lost his ability to walk after receiving a transitional ischemic approach.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I was hit.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that only time would show me whether or not I would recover to what extent.
It was a exhausting job, but I got a full recovery, I learned to walk again, and today I'm doing movement training!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Advertising for a feed pump that compares mothers to cows, share online opinions
The company producing feeding pumps shares online opinions with advertising that compares nursing mothers to cows that they eat.
To mark the placing on the market of the expected "first wireless feed pump in the world suitable for wear", the consumer technology company Elvie released a silky music and video advertising to demonstrate the freedom that the new feed pump provides to feeders.
Four true mothers dance in a cow's den, full of hay, on the background of a song with text, including: "Yes, I do, but you don't see any tail" and "If you haven't noticed, that's not what we see, these are my breasts".
The song continues: “Spring, pump, with them feed the babies, pump, pump, drink your friends. ”
However, the advertisement, published on the company's Facebook page, caused online disagreements.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from the viewers, as many say it reduces the "horrific" of the milk processing industry.
"It is very foolish to use cows for advertising this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their babies take them a few days after birth," someone wrote.
The Elvie feed pump is collected discreetly in the support of the feedingstuffs (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment: “We fully understand that it is traumatic for both mother and baby.
But yes, why don't we use them for an ad on a mother feeding pump that can keep their babies?"
Another added: “So inadequate advertising.”
Others protected the advertisement, as one woman admitted that she considered the song "excellently fun".
"I think the idea is brilliant.
I'd buy myself one if I were still feeding.
The expulsion made me feel just like a cow.
The ad is a little rat, but I accept it as it is.
This product is brilliant," someone wrote.
Another comment: “This is a funny advertisement aimed at mothers who give up (often at their jobs or in the toilets) and feel like "cows".
It's not advertising, praising or condemning the milk processing industry."
At the end of the clip, a group of women discover that they danced with the discreet pumps placed in their supports.
The concept of the campaign is based on the view that many women who are breast-feeding feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely soundless, no wires or tubes and gathers discreetly in the back of the feeding room, which gives women the freedom to move, keep their babies and even get out while they're out.
Anna Balarin, partner and CEO of Mother, comments: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves bold and provocative marketing.
By drawing a parallel between dairy cows and dairy cows, we wanted to focus on getting rid of the milk and all the challenges associated with it, while at the same time showing more fun and understanding the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump falls into the leading news.
During the fashion week in London, the mother of two children appeared on the stage for designer Martha Jakubowski using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children have been secretly moved to a tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of children detained by migrants jumped sharply, although the monthly crossings at the border remained relatively unchanged, partly because the harsh rhetoric and politics of the Trump administration made it difficult for children to arrive with teachers.
Usually most educators are immigrants without documents that fear they may risk their stay in the country if they want to recognise a child.
The risk is increased in June when federal authorities have announced that potential family keepers and other adults should provide fingerprints, as these data will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a high-ranking immigration and customs official, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who wanted to become teachers of unaccompanied minors.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no prior criminal records.
"About 80 percent of those who are either hostages or members of the family of hostages are illegally resident in the country, most of whom are foreigners-criminals.
So we're gonna keep chasing these people," Albens said.
In order to cope with the registration of these children more quickly, the authorities imposed new rules requiring some of them to appear before a court within a month of their detention, not after 60 days, as was the previous rule, according to the shelter officials.
Many appear in a video conference, not personally, to present their case for legal status before an immigration judge.
Those who are identified as unfit for admission will be deported as soon as possible.
The longer the children remain detained, the more likely they are to become depressed or depressed, which may lead to violent expulsions or escape attempts, according to employees in shelters and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
Lawyers have said that this concern is growing in large facilities, such as in Thornillo, where the signs that a child has problems are more likely to be neglected because of the scale of the place.
They added that moving children to "the city of the tent" without giving them enough time to prepare at an emotional level or to say goodbye to their friends can make the trauma that many are already struggling with.
Syria urges US, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Turning to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid al-Mulem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the civil war has been going on for eight years.
Mualem, who also holds the post as Deputy Prime Minister, said foreign troops are illegally residing in a Syrian country under the pretext of combating terrorism and "will take appropriate action".
"They must be removed immediately and without any conditions," he said to the assembly.
Mualem insisted that "war against terror is almost at its end" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have lost their lives since 2011 and millions have been forced out of their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue "to fight in this sacred battle until all Syrian countries are cleansed" both by terrorist organizations and by "any illegal presence of foreigners".
The U.S. has about 2,000 troops in Syria, who mainly train and advise both Kurdish and Syrian parties, opposition from President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 military personnel in the countries of the war-torn.
With regard to the Mualem refugees, he said that the conditions were sustainable and could be reversed, as he accused "some Western countries of "fearless fear" that encourage refugees to stay away.
"We have urged the international community and humanitarian organisations to cooperate on these returns," he said.
"They turn into a political issue something that is a completely humanitarian issue."
The US and the European Union have warned that no aid will be provided for Syria's recovery until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to stop the war.
UN diplomats said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last major fortress of the Idlib rebels provides an opportunity for progress in political dialogues.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces over the province, where three million people live.
Mualem stressed, however, that the agreement has "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that the military action will be directed towards the jihadists, including fighters from the Al-Qaida front, who will "be destroyed".
UN envoy Stefan de Mistura hopes soon to convene the first meetings of the new committee, composed of government and opposition members, to form a draft of the next Syrian constitution and to conduct the way to elections.
Mualem set out the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, stating that the work of the panel should be limited to "review of the members of the current constitution" and warned that there should be no interference.
Why Trump's gonna win second term
In this logic Trump will win the re-election of the 2020 elections unless – as many liberals probably hope – his presidency will not be terminated early due to impychment and scandal.
This would certainly be "the most dramatic end of the presidency ever!"
At the moment, there's no sign of the viewer's fatigue.
Since 2014, the premium rating has increased twice to 1.05 million at CNN and almost three times to 1.6 million for MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during premium, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and The Rachel Maddow Show at MSNBC is at the top of the cable TV rating, with up to 3.5 million viewers at dinner with big news.
"It's a fire that attracts people because it's something we don't understand," says Neil Baer, the executive producer of ABC's "Last Candidate" drama, where he talks about the cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack on Capital.
Nel Skowl, who is a comedy veteran and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The cab driver told her he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
She asked "Why?"
Mrs. Skowel told me that he answered her "Why he's laughing at me."
There's a lot of fun in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else that appears on television, Washington's stories can determine the future of "Roo vs. Wade", whether immigrant families can gather again, as well as the good state of the world economy.
Exclusion is a luxury that can only afford the most privileged viewers.
However, the desire to be informed by a citizen does not correspond to this in six hours to see how a group of experts discuss Bob Uduard, who uses "deep historical information" as a source of his book "Strah"; Paul Manafort's pilot jacket of grey leather for $15,000 ("full of arrogance" according to "Washington Post") and the disturbing descriptions of Stormy Daniels about Mr. Trump's anatomy.
I especially will never look at Super Mario again in the same way.
"The honor of what he does to make you feel like part of the reality show is to give you a little every night," said Brent Montgomery, the lead executive producer of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of the "Pawn Stars", regarding the changing participants and the daily talks (eating with the National Football League, complimenting Kim Chen Un).
You can't afford to miss an episode because you'll be gone.
When I got in touch with Mr. Flyes this week, on the northern coast of Kauai was sunny, 80 degrees, but he was locked up at home to watch MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not separate himself from the TV, especially when Brett Cavano had to stand before the Senate's legal commission and that depended on the future of the Supreme Court.
"I remember when we used to do all those crazy lectures and people were saying, "This is the beginning of the end for Western civilization," Mr. Flyes told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were real."

Investments are involved in the most controversial competition in the early elections for place in Congress
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania receives a stream of money thanks to the reorganization of the districts of Congress and from there two headlines for the same place.
The recently redeployed district in Pittsburgh's suburbs points to conservative Democratic Connor Lamb, who won his place from another district of partial elections last spring.
Lamb is facing another titular, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently the oldest 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is significantly represented by the new 17th.
The maps were redesigned after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ordered in January that the old districts were otherwise manipulated for the benefit of the Republicans.
The competition in the new 17th district sparked a financial dispute between the party's main funding institutions, the Democratic Congressional Commission for Campaigns (DCCC) and the National Republican Commission for Campaigns (NRCC).
Lamb moved to Pennsylvania after the difficult victory in the widely discussed partial elections in March for the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania.
The position was taken by the Republicans for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the county with 20 points.
Political experts believe that democrats have a slight advantage.
The United States considered imposing sanctions on El Salvador for its support for China, after which it withdrew
The diplomats note that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognised Beijing, with little pressure from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a hearty meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela from Panama in June 2017, and he also owned a hotel in Panama until the partners fired the management team from the Trump Organization.
Representatives of the State Department decided to respond to the leaders of the diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "the short decisions no longer recognize Taiwan", said earlier this month Heather Naurt, a spokesperson for the Department.
However, only sanctions were envisaged against El Salvador, which in 2017 received approximately US$ 140 million in aid for the fight against drugs, with a view to development and economic aid.
The proposed sanctions, including the reduction of financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American State with its unemployment and percentage of murders.
With the advancement of internal meetings, officials from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference aimed at security and economic well-being, which serves as a continuation of such a gathering last year, considered as a step forward in efforts to prevent the flow of migrants to the United States.
But in mid-September, the senior management authorities clarified their desire to hold the conference, thus effectively ending any discussion of sanctions against El Salvador.
Now Vice-President Mike Pens has announced that he will participate in the conference scheduled for mid-October as a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the gathering, the diplomats say.
And the three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new strong messages or sanctions from Washington.
The spokesperson for the White House for Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who wished to remain anonymous who agreed to participate in the internal discussions.
Their stories were confirmed by an external analyst near the administration who also wanted to remain anonymous.
History of the Study
The next move may be the report of Special Adviser Robert Muller on the possible impeding of Mr. Trump's justice, as the report is currently a significant evidence in the public register.
It is claimed that Mr. Muller is directing his investigation and whether Mr. Trump has been engaged with Russia during his campaign in their attack on our elections.
If the leadership of Congress changes, it will turn out that Mr. Trump will have to report to this body, exactly when he is prepared to stand up to voters, as well as perhaps to judicial observers composed of his colleagues.
There are many unknowns here, and I do not imply that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable – neither is it in Europe.
All of us, on the two sides of the Atlantic, have to make these choices that will affect how much the fight will lengthen.
In 1938 the German officers were ready to make a coup against Hitler, except that the West had joined him and supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the following years of the clan.
The course of history depends on such moments of fishing, and the impossible march of democracy is speeding up or slowing down.
At the moment, the Americans are faced with several similar captures.
What would we do if Mr. Trump fired Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who holds in his hand the fate of Mr. Muller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in danger ever since this newspaper announced that last year he had proposed to write down the president secretly and speculated that he was not fit for the post.
Mr. Rosenstein announced that the history of "Times" is inaccurate.
"How will we react if the new investigation against Brett Cavano, requested by the FBI, is not complete or fair - or if it is approved for the Supreme Court despite allegations of sexual harassment and false testimony?
And most of all, will we vote in the early elections for Congress if this will force Mr. Trump to take responsibility?
If we fail in these trials, democracy is waiting for a long winter.
But I believe we're not going to fail because I've learned from Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia who was taken to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my missionary home.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me to light the candles for Shabat on that table wearing swastika.
With a legacy like this, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"
Norman Eisen, senior employee of Brookings Institute, is president of "Citizens of Responsibility and Ethics in Washington", and is the author of "The Last Palace: Europe's Turbulent Century in Five Lives and One Legendary House."
Graham Dorans of Rangers is an optimist for the encounter with Rapid Vienna.
Rangers are home to Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the victory over the Austrians after the impressive equality in Spain against Villareal earlier this month will give them a significant chance to continue ahead of Group G of the League of Europe.
Contusion in the knee did not allow semi-protector Graham Dorans to win his first match for the season prior to the 2-2 match with Villareal, but he believes that for Rangers this result could become a trampline to greater achievements.
"We have won an important point because Vilareal is a good opponent," said a 31-year-old footballer.
"We entered the match with the hope that we could win something and left with a point.
Maybe we could even win at the end of the game, but as all equality seems fair.
They were better in the first half and we in the second half.
We took a look at Thursday, another big night of our matches in Europe.
I hope we can fight for the three points, it will be a difficult match because they achieved a good result in the last meeting, but I'm sure with the support of our audience we can do everything we can and achieve a good result.
Last year was definitely hard after everything that happened next to my contusions and changes in the club, but now things seem to have gone in the direction rules.
The team is good, and the boys are really having fun, the training is beneficial.
I hope that we will be able to exert all our power to forget the past season and achieve the desired success."
Women are worried about fears about their pension savings
Despite the fact that participants in the study had a clear idea of what concerns they would like to receive, few people discuss this with family members.
About half of the participants in the nationwide study share that they discussed with their husbands the costs of long-term care.
Only 10% have talked to their children about it.
"The choir wants family members to take care of them, but they have not taken steps to conduct this conversation," said Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the Life Insurance Sector of Nationwide.
Here's what you can start with.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide you with care if you do not predetermine your wishes.
Along with your advisor and your family, discuss where and how you want to get care, as these decisions can be a key factor in determining the costs.
Include your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you with the idea of how to pay these expenses.
Your decisions when you choose a financial institution for long-term care may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a mixed life insurance policy with a monetary value to help you cover these costs or self-insurance with your funds – if you have the money resources.
Prepare your legal documents: Deal with legal battles from the beginning.
Make yourself a health care agent, so that you have a certain trustee who supervises your medical care and ensures that professionals comply with your wishes, in case you cannot communicate.
Consider also the idea of a financial officer.
You can choose a trusted person who will make the financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that your accounts will be paid if you are unable.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent needs urgent medical attention and travels to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Show these details in a written form to be prepared.
"It's not just about the financial aspect, but also about what doctors will be," Martin asked.
"What are the medications?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Make a plan."
A man was shot several times with an air rifle in Ilfracomb
A man was shot several times with an air rifle while he was coming home at night outside.
The victim, about 40 years old, was located in the Oxford Groov district of Ilfracomb, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and arm.
The police describe the shooting that took place around 02:30 a.m. in British summer time, as an "eventual act".
The injured man couldn't see his attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are trying to attract witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died of a massive earthquake and tsunamis that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, the authorities announced, expecting the number of dead to grow.
Due to the interruption of the communications, support organisations cannot receive information from the Dongala Regent, a region north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palau after the disaster.
Here are some of the basic facts about Palu and Dongala, which are found on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of central Sulavesi, located at the end of the narrow beach on the western coast of the island of Sulavesi, with a population of 379 800 people in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by earthquakes and tsunamis.
Dongala is a regent that extends more than 300 km (180 miles) along the coast of the island of Sulavesi.
The regency, which the administrative region is less than the province, has an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the basis of the economy of the province of central Slovenia, especially in the coastal area of Dongala.
The acquisition of nickel is also important for the province, but it is concentrated mainly in Morovali, on the opposite coast of Sulavesi.
Palu and Dongala have been hit several times by tsunamis over the past 100 years, according to data from the Indonesian Disaster Recovery Agency.
In 1938, tsunamis killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of buildings in Dongala.
Cunami covered Dongala's west side, and in 1996, when nine people died.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific Fire ring and is regularly affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the great earthquakes and waves of tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A strong storm on 26 December on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in North Sumatra activates waves of tsunamis that have hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people across the Indian Ocean coast, with more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias on the coasts of Sumatra.
2006: Rabbit with a magnitude of 6.8 hits the most populated island in Indonesia, Java, triggering tsunamis that broke into the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: Magnitude earthquake 7.6 hits near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1100 people died.
2010: Earthquake with magnitude 7.5 hits one of the Mentawai islands and activates a 10-meter wave of tsunamis that destroyed tens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A sudden earthquake hit the Paddy Jaya Regency in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, as people mentioned the disasters of the deadly earthquake and tsunamis in 2004.
This time, tsunamis were not activated, but more than 100 people were killed by collapsed buildings.
2018: Strong rabbits hit the tourist island Lombok in Indonesia, killed more than 500 people, most of them from the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily homeless.
Sarah Paylin's eldest son was arrested for charges of domestic violence
Trac Paylin, the eldest son of former governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice President Sara Paylin, was arrested for charges of violence.
Palin, 29-year-old, from Wasila, Alaska, was arrested for suspected domestic violence, interference with domestic violence and resistance to arrest, according to a report by the state police in Alaska, published on Saturday.
According to the police report, when a woman in the sex tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he picked up her phone.
Paeline is detained in the Mat-Su Preservation Building and under an unsecured guarantee of $500, reported KTUU.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, where he declared himself "innocent, certainly", when he was asked to beg, the media reported.
Palin is threatened by a penalty for three Class A offenses, which means he can be deprived of his freedom for up to a year and pay a fine of $250,000.
He's also indicted in a class B offense, which is punishable by a day in prison and fine of $2000.
This is not the first time Pileen has been charged with criminal charges.
In December 2017 he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Paline.
His mother, Sarah Paylin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently being considered by the Windmill Court in Alaska.
In January 2016 he was accused of domestic violence, interference in reporting a crime of domestic violence and possession of weapons under the influence of drinking substances in connection with the incident.
His friend said he hit her with a fist in her face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of veterans in 2016 when she linked her son’s aggressive behavior to post-traumatic stress resulting from his service in Iraq.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died of an earthquake that devastated the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electrical and communication network has been interrupted, expecting the number of dead to grow in the near days.
The earthquake struck near central Sulavesti, northeast of the capital of Indonesia – Jakarta.
The social networks are playing videos that show the moment of conflict.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a beach festival in Palu when the wave tsunamis hit the shore.
Federal prosecutors want a rare death penalty for a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City
Federal New York prosecutors want a death penalty for Saifolo Saipov, suspected of a terrorist attack in New York, in which eight people were killed – a rare sentence that was not executed in the federal crime state since 1953.
It is claimed that Saipov, at 30 years of age, used a truck hired by Home Depot to carry out the attack in October on a bicycle near the West Side highway in lower Manhattan, gasping pedestrians and bikers on his way.
In order to justify the death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intended" has killed eight victims and "intended" has caused serious bodily harm, according to the notice of intent in connection with the request for a death penalty in the South region of New York.
According to the judicial document, both charges may end with a death sentence.
Weeks after the assassination, an expanded federal judiciary sent a 22-point indictment to Saipov, including eight charges of murder related to a racket usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, as well as an accusation of violence and destruction of IPS.
The attack called for "serious planning and intention," the prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov performed as "horrible, cruel and deceitful".
"Syfolo Habibulaevich Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, An-Lori Decad, Darren Drake, Ariel Erley, Ernan Felci and Alejandro Damian Panuko," the notice says.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since New York's last South District was looking for a death penalty.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug addicts, but was subsequently sentenced to life sentences in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was executed on a federal case in New York was in 1953 – Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a family couple who were executed after a conviction for conspiracy and spying on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenberg were executed at the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a people's Uzbek, did not show a sense of regret during the days and months following the assassination, according to the court documents.
He told the investigators that he felt good about what he did, says the police.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching videos on his phone, the indictment said.
He also asked his hospital room to place the IDIL flag, they said.
He pleads innocent of the indictment consisting of 22 points.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, noted that "they are obviously disappointed" by the decision of the prosecutor's office.
"We believe that the decision to seek a death sentence instead of a sentence of guilt and life imprisonment without the possibility of early release will only prolong the traumatic effect of these events on all affected," Paton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously wanted from the prosecutor's office not to want a death sentence.
Member of the Conservative Parliament says that NIJUL FARAZ should lead the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Faraz was pledged to "mobilize the army of the people" today, during a protest at the conservative conference.
The former leader of the British Independence Party said politicians should "understand pressure" – as one of the members of Teresa May's own party, he proposed to lead the negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bon, a Conservative MP, said in March in Birmingham that Britain "would have gone out so far", if Mr. Faraz was secretary for Brexit.
But the challenge faced by Mrs. May to agree with the party's deeply divided lines was stressed by conservatives who supported the remains who joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to preserve his compromise "Checkers", despite the attacks by the supporters of the Brexit, the remaining EU.
The Allies insist that it will make progress in its attempt to reach a deal with Brussels despite the hostile reactions and urge the Europeans and the libersists to choose between its package and its "chaos".
Mr. Bon said in front of the protesters with the slogan "Exit means going out" in Solihall that he wanted to "reject the Chequers".
He pointed out that Mr Faraz had to share with the others and that he had to be held responsible for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was a principle, we would have left," he said.
Wellingborough MP added: "I support Brexit, but we must reject the Chequers plan.
Commenting on his opposition to the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to be rabbled.
We want to create our own laws in our own country."
Mr Bon rejected the claim that the public opinion changed since the 2016 vote: "The understanding that the British have changed their opinion and want to stay is completely wrong".
Conservatives Andrea Jenkins also participates in the meeting, sharing with reporters: “I’m just saying, Prime Minister, listen to people.
"Chequers" is not popular among the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular in our party and our activists who actually went out on the street and really helped us to be elected.
Please drop the "Checkers" and start listening."
In an open message to Mrs. May, she added: “The pioneers keep their position when they keep their promises.”
Mr Faraz said at the meeting that politicians should "under pressure" if they were to change the decision taken after the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's about trust between us – people – and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to change Brexit and we're meeting here today to say, "We're not going to let this happen to you."
Turning to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is on the edge of changing Brexit, feel pressure.
"We mobilize the army of the people of this state, which has helped us defeat Brexit, and we will never stop until we become independent, self-government, proud United Kingdom."
At the same time, supporting remnants moved on to Birmingham before holding a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
Shepa activists had raised flags with "Conservators against Brexit", after the group started this weekend.
Laberist Lord Adonis played with the Conservatives about the security issues of the party's application when he found himself at the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have IT systems and all of Canada's technology and yet, for the smooth crossing of borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"This is a complete farce.
There's no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren said he would "consider seriously" his candidacy for president
State Senator Elizabeth Warren said he would "consider seriously the opportunity to apply for president" after the November elections.
Boston Globe reported that the representative of the Democrats from Massachusetts spoke of his future during a city council in Western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a permanent critic of President Donald Trump, will be candidates for re-election in November against the state representative of the Republicans Jeff Dale, who was co-chaired by the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It is at the heart of speculation that it can take the position of Trump in 2020.
The event Saturday afternoon in Holiouk was her 36th meeting with voters in the mayor's building after Trump entered duty.
One of the attendings asked her if she was planning to apply for president.
Warren rejected that it is time for "women to go to Washington and repair our damaged government, including women at the top".
He was arrested for the death of Sims from LSU
The Baton Rouge police, Los Angeles, announced on Saturday that there was a suspect arrested on Friday at the shooting when basketball player Wade Sims was killed by LSU.
The Baton Rouge police department reported the arrest of Dayton Simpson, 20-year-old, during a press conference at 11:00 east time.
They posted video footage of the shooting on Friday and asked for help in identifying the man who was seen on the footage.
Sims, 20 years old, was shot and killed near the South University area early Friday morning.
"Wade Sims was shot in the head, which ultimately leads to his death," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the press on Saturday, according to 247 sports.
Wade intervened to protect his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being at the crime scene, had a gun and shot Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without difficulty and detained in the arrest of the Police Department of the Eastern Baton Rouge.
A young man who grew up 6′6′′, who grew up in Baton Rose – Sims participated in 32 games with 10 matches as a holder of last season and recorded on average 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 matches.
Grand Pri of Russia: Luis Hamilton is getting closer to the world title after the team's instructions helped him win Sebastian Fetel
Ever since Walter Botas was ranked ahead of Louis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the guidance from the Mercedes team would play an important role in the race.
Botas made a good start from the first position and seriously worried Hamilton while defending his position in the first two turns, giving Fethel the opportunity to attack his teammate.
Fethel first made a pit stop and let Hamilton deal with the traffic at the end of the column, which seemed to be crucial to getting out of the race.
Mercedes also made a pit stop on the next round and went out after Fethel, but Hamilton managed to beat him after a rough manoeuvre and drive a tire to the tire, which forced Ferrari's pilot reluctantly to release the inner part of the track to avoid punishment with additional time, after he had already closed the path of his opponent with a dangerous double protection manoeuvre on the third turn.
On my 21st birthday Max Verstappen started from the back lines of the start grid and was seven after the end of the first round.
Then he even led the race for a long time, as he had decided to change his tires later than the others, which would allow him to be faster at the end of the race and possibly beat Kimi Raykonen in the battle for the fourth position.
Finally he entered for the pit stop in the 44th round, but failed to grow enough in the next eight rounds and finally Ryconen finished fourth.
It was a hard day because Walter did a great job all weekend and it turned out to be a real gentleman when he let me fight him.
The team has done an excellent job to win the first two places on the podium," Hamilton said.
That was really the wrong language of the body.
President Donald Trump was playing with Senator Diane Fianstein on a rally Saturday because of her claim that she had not circulated the letter from Christine Blaisey Ford, who accuses the Supreme Court's prosecutor of Brett Cavano in sexual harassment.
During the discussion of rallyes in West Virginia, the President did not directly mention the demonstrations given by Ford before the Senate's Legal Commission, and instead commented on how what was happening in the Senate shows that people are "bad and disgusting and dishonest".
"What can happen and what happens in the last few days in the Senate when you see anger, when you see angry people and evil, and disgusting, and dishonest," he said.
"When you look at publications and distribution, and they say, "Oh, I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Do you know?
Diane Finstein, did she spread out from you?
Do you remember her answer... did you release the document – "Oh, um, what?
Oh, no.
I haven't spread."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we spread... no, we didn't spread," he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein sent the letter with details of Ford's claims against Cavano in July, and it was spread earlier in September – but Feinstein denies that this spread happened from her office.
"I didn't hide Ford's claims, I didn't spread her story," Feynstein told the commission, The Hill reported.
"She asked me to keep the confidentiality and I kept the confidentiality as she wished."
But her denial was not well received by the president, who comments during the rally on Saturday night: “I will tell you that this was a very bad language of the body.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst language of the body I've ever seen."
Continuing to protect the Supreme Court's petitioner charged with sexual crimes against three women, the president pointed out that the Democrats used claims for their own purposes.
"They are determined to return their power with all possible means.
Look at the dishonesty, the shamelessness, they don't care who they're going to hurt, who they're going to have to walk to get back power and control," the president said.
Elit League: Dundy Lover 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Duyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundy.
Dondi Svart returned for the Friday loss at the Elite League against Belfast Jaints, winning a five-thirds rebate in Dundi on Saturday.
Jaints had an early match with two goals after Patrick Duyer and Francis Bovillier hit.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Counny were set up for the hosts before Dwyer restored the front of Jaints.
Francoa Bushar was equal to Dundi before Lucas Lundwald Nielsen's two goals were to confirm their victory.
This is the third victory in the Elite League for Adam Keefe's boys who got out of the bottom to win Dundy in Belfast on 2-1 Friday night.
This was the fourth conflict between the opponents of this season, when Jiantes won the previous three matches.
The blow that Duyer discovered the result came in the fourth minute, at 3:35 with Kendall McFaul's assistance, and then David Rutherford doubles the advance as a Bovillier's assistant four minutes later.
It was a tense start, Sullivan returned the hosts back to the game at 13:10, before Matt Markart helped to balance with the help of Kauni at 15:16.
Duyer's trying to take Jaints before the first break, marking the second goal for the evening at the end of the first half.
The housekeepers regrouped and Bushar rebalanced the chances with a powerful blow at the door at 27:37.
Couni and Charles Corcoran united efforts to help Nilsen give lead to Dundi for the first time in the end of the second half, and he gave everything of himself and confirmed the victory of the team with the fifth goal in the middle but the last half.
Jaunts, who lost the last four matches of a total of five matches, meet as host Milton Keines for their next match on Friday.
The pilot of the plane died to ensure that hundreds of people on board an aircraft can escape an earthquake
A pilot of flights in Indonesia was praised as a hero after he died, ensuring that a plane with hundreds of passengers on board managed to fly safely.
More than 800 people died and many are unknown in a powerful earthquake that hit the island of Sulavesti on Friday, triggering wave tsunamis.
The strong second tributaries continued to defeat the area, and many were caught in a trap from the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues were running to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post in the heavily shaking control tower at Mutiara Sis Al-Jufri Airport.
He remained in place to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the track at that time, would manage to fly safely.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he decided he was crashing.
He died at the hospital later.
Air Control Speaker, Indonesia, Johannes Sirate, said that this decision might have saved hundreds of lives reported by ABC News Australia.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palau.
"Our hearts were broken when we heard about it," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities are afraid that the number of deaths can reach thousands after the disaster response agency in the country has announced that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Butong is limited.
"We assume that the number of deaths will increase, as many bodies are still under fractures, and many people cannot be reached," said Sotopo Purvo Nugroho.
The waves, which reached six meters, devastated Palu, where there is mass burial on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are carrying aid and supplies.
Riza Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute the ambulance is still bringing bodies.
There's a lack of clean water.
There are bruises everywhere in the minimarts."
Jan Gelfand, president of the International Red Cross Movement in Indonesia, pointed out to CNN: “The Red Cross in Indonesia is fighting to help its survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it can get a lot worse."
Indonesia President Joco Widodo arrived in Palo on Sunday and turned to the country’s army: “Please work day and night to complete all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?", CNN reported.
Earlier this year Indonesia was struck by earthquakes in Lombok, with more than 550 deaths.
A plane crash in Micronesia: Now Air Niugini reported that a person is unknown after an aircraft crash in a lagoon
The aircraft that flew by a plane that crashed into a Pacific lagoon now reports that one person was declared missing after earlier stated that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated by the sinking aircraft.
In the press release Air Niugini said that from Saturday afternoon they cannot contact a male passenger.
The airline added that they work together with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in their attempts to find a man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more details about the passenger, e.g. age and nationality.
Local boats helped save passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land on Chuk Island.
On Friday, the authorities announced that seven people were admitted to the hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers remained at the hospital on Saturday, all in stable condition.
They remain unclear the cause of the disaster and the exact sequence of events.
Both the airlines and US military forces said that the plane had landed in the lagoon just before the runway.
Some of the witnesses thought the plane was over the track.
American Bill Janes, a passenger on the plane, claims that the plane was very low.
"That's extremely nice," Janes says.
Janes tells us that he and the others managed to cross through the deep to cross the water to get to the crash exits of the sinking plane.
He said that the stewards had panicked and screamed, as well as that he had suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy forces tell us that seamen repairing the docks nearby also helped in the rescue action, using an overboard boat to take people to the shore before the plane sinks into the depths of about 30 meters of water (100 feet).
Data from the Air Safety Network suggest that over the last two decades 111 people have died on flights registered to PNG, but Air Niugini has not been involved in any case.
Analyst exposes the chronology of the night when a woman was burned alive
The Prosecutor's Office concluded its statement on the case this Saturday in the retrial against a man who was accused of burning a woman alive in 2014.
Analyst Paul Rowlet of the U.S. Ministry of Justice witnesses hours like an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used cell phone records to collect the movements of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night she died.
Roulette said he got data on the location of several mobile phones showing that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of her death, back to his previous claims, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was in Chambers at the time when he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to inquire about Sanford.
Sanford stood before the court on Saturday and testified that he was out of town that day.
When the prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said that "it was a lie because my truck was in Nashville."
Another misunderstanding is that Tellis said he knew Chambers two weeks before she died.
The cell phone records say they've known each other for weeks.
Roulette pointed out that shortly after the death of Chambers Tellis, she had deleted text messages, calls, and contact information from her phone.
"He took it away from his life," Hale said.
The protection is planned to begin with its concluding submissions on Sunday.
The judge stated that he expects the trial to be presented to the judges later on the same day.
The High Breed: What is a conscious hip-hop?
Hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative opinions of the genre by performing his music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol claims that the hip-hop has deviated from its origin of political statements and engagement with social problems.
They want to go back to his roots and repopulate the conscious hip-hop.
The Fugees and Common performers are opposed in Britain by performers such as Akala and Lowkey.
The other black guy?
A New York bartender judges a couple after being fired for "racist" message
A New York bartender judges a couple for dismissal for discrimination, after having received a wrong message from the mother who complains that she is "the next black woman".
The two deny that they are racist, comparing the desire to be "enforcement".
Linzi Plasco-Faxman, the mother of two children, was ridiculed when she learned that the new babysitter, Gizel Morris, was black when she arrived for her first working day in 2016.
"NOEEEEEEEEE, THE SECOND NARRATOR," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Faxman in her husband's text message.
Instead of sending him to his wife, however, she sent him to Mrs. Morris, twice.
After she realized her mistake, Mrs. Plasco-Faxman felt "unfortunate" fired Mrs. Morris, pointing out that the former African-American barmaid had not done her job well and that she was expecting a Filipino, reports New York Post.
Mrs. Morris received a reward for one working day after being sent home with a taxi.
Now Morris is judging the compensation couple for the dismissal, wanting the amount of $350 a day for the six-month contract for which she was initially hired, even though she had no contract.
"I want to show them, look, you shouldn't do that," she told Post on Friday, adding, "You're sure this is discrimination".
In response, the couple claimed that they were not racist, adding that ending Maurice’s employment was a reasonable action, as they feared that they would not be able to trust her after they tried her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist," said Joel Plasco's husband in front of the Post.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you tried, even if it was a mistake?
You're a newborn?
Think about it."
Looking at the demand for "expression", Plasko claims that his wife was born only two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation".
“Are you going to attack someone in this condition?
That's not particularly nice," the investment banker added.
While the trial is still under review, the public opinion quickly condemned the couple in social networks, denying them their behavior and logic.
"Padington's publishers were afraid that readers wouldn't feel connected to a talking bear," he says.
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, born shortly after the book was accepted by the public, relates: “It’s hard to put yourself in the place of someone who reads the book for the first time before it is published.
It's really fun now that we're aware of the tremendous success of Paddington."
She said that her father, who worked as an operator for BBC, before he was inspired to write the book for a little sword player, would feel optimistic about any rejection of the book, adding that he met the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book "with mixed feelings", after his death last year.
With regard to Paddington, whom she describes as "an important member of our family", she added that her father secretly felt proud of her ultimate success.
"He was a very modest man and was not self-glorious," she said.
"But since Padington felt so real, it's like having a child that has achieved something: you're proud of him, though it's not really your business.
I think you've been taking Padington's success somewhere in this way.
Although it was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always attributed the merit of Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After her daughter was discharged, she was rushed to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors struggled to save her life.
"The hope was constantly ringing to say that the situation is really bad, that it does not expect to survive," said Ednan-Laperuz.
"Then Nad called me to say that he would die within two minutes and that I should say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
I said, “Tashie, honey, I love you so much.
I'll come to you soon.
I'll come to you.
The medications given to her by doctors to maintain her heart slowly stop working and leave her system.
She's been gone a while before, and that's how it all ended.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
Nasty was supposed to bend."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperuz, who so far grieves for the loss of her daughter, is on the plane with other passengers who have no idea of the trial she's going through.
"No one understands," she says.
"I'd put my head in my head and all the time my tears would drop.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I felt this overwhelming feeling of sympathy with Nad.
That he needs my love and understanding.
I knew how much you loved her."
Grieving women put cards to prevent suicide from bridge
Two women who lost their loved ones to suicide try to prevent other suicides.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys put on a bridge in Wells with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call to get help.
Tyler, Mrs. Davis' son, was 13 years old when he started suffering from depression and committed suicide at 18 years of age.
"I don't want any parents to feel the way I feel every day," she says.
Mrs. Davis, 45-year-old Lidney, says her son was a promising cook with an infectious smile.
"Everyone knew him by the smile.
They've always said that his smile is burning in every room."
However, he gave up his job before leaving, and he was in “a really dark place. ”
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was then 11 years old, found his brother after he took his life.
Mrs. Davis said: “I constantly worry that this will have some consequences. ”
Mrs. Davis creates the cards, “so that people know who they are to go to and who they are to talk to, even if they are friends.
Do not keep silence – you must speak."
Mrs. Humphreys, Mrs. Davis' long friend, lost Mark, her 15-year-old companion, shortly after his mother died.
"He did not share that he felt depressed or depressed, or anything else," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He arrived at the bottom of Christmas – when the children opened their presents, he did not look at them, nor anything."
She said that this was a terrible trauma to them, but they had to cope: “This opens up a gap in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we need to move forward and fight."
If you are struggling to cope, you can contact the Samaritan of 116 123 (for Britain and Ireland), send an e-mail to jo@samaritans.org or visit the Samaritan website here.
Brett Cavano's future is in question after the FBI launches an investigation
I wondered if we could really achieve what he wanted – research with limited duration and limited scope – maybe we could combine our efforts," Mr. Flake said on Saturday and added that it is feared that the Commission would "fall apart" despite the confirmed suprapartmental blockade.
Why didn't Mr. Kavano and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their dissatisfaction is for the moment.
The early elections are only after five weeks on 6 November – if, as expected, the Republicans do not present themselves well, they will seriously affect their attempts to be elected their representative in the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush called senators, inviting them to support Mr. Kavano, who worked for Mr. Bush at the White House, and with his help he met his wife, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI prepares its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where members are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavano can obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which will allow Vice-President Mike Pens to declare equality and confirm his candidacy for the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean refugees "decreases" in Kim
South Korean legislator claims that the number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has decreased since Kim Chen Un came into power seven years ago.
Park Bieong Sug, quoting data from the South Korean Association Ministry, said there were 1127 refugees last year, compared to them in 2011, 2706.
According to Mr. Park, the tighter border control between North Korea and China, as well as the higher amounts required by human smugglers, are the key factors.
There's no official comment from Phanyan.
Most of the refugees from the North eventually receive citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul states that more than 30,000 North Koreans crossed the illegal border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most run through China, where the longest border with North Korea is located and passes easier than the strictly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ), which divides the two roots.
China considers refugees to be illegal migrants, not refugees, often repatriating them.
The relations between North and South Korea, which are still technically at war, have improved significantly over the past few months.
Earlier this month, the Heads of State met in Phenyan for talks focused on stopping nuclear disarmament negotiations.
This happened after the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Chen Un in Singapore, where they agreed to work on the Korean peninsula without nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, however, North Korea Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho accused the US of lack of progress ever since.
"If we lack confidence in the US, we will not be confident of our national security and, under these circumstances, there is no way of getting rid of ourselves unilaterally first," Mr. Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Cavano "historic" and said it was not suitable for service in the Supreme Court
The leader of the minority in Congress Nancy Pelosi called the candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Cavano "historic" and said that he was too uneducated for service in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi comments this during an interview this Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"There was no way to think that if a woman had reacted in this way, they would call her "sterical," Pelosi said about his reaction to Kavano's testimony before the Senate's legal commission on Thursday.
Kavano emotionally rejected the claim that he had committed sexual assault on Dr. Christine Blaisey Ford when both were teenagers.
During his introductory speech, Kavano was very emotional, at times he almost screamed and felt when discussing his family and his academic years.
He also categorically condemned the democratics in the commission, calling his claims "grotically and coordinated attack on personality", organised by liberals who are not satisfied that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi pointed out that according to her testimony, Kavano proves that he is not able to work in the Supreme Court, as it has become clear that he is prejudiced against the Democrats.
"I think he himself has disqualified himself with these claims and with the way he persecutes the Clinton family and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi denied when asked if he would try to discredit Kavano if he was appointed and in case the Democrats get a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say so – if he does not tell the truth before Congress or the FBI, then he is not only on Sunday to enter the Supreme Court, but also in the court in which he is now," Pelosi said.
Right now, Kavano is a judge in the Court of Appeal in Washington.
Pelosi added that, as a democracy, she was concerned about the potential decisions of Kavano regarding the Health Care Act or the Row v. Wade case, as he was considered a conservative judge.
In the preliminary hearings, Kavano denied questions as to whether he would reject certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"Now is not the time for a staunch, preconceived man to enter the court and expect us to say, 'Isn't it great,' Pelosi concluded.
And women have to control themselves.
This is a fundamental criticism, after months and years of dissipation of anger, and she cannot accept it without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Mrs. Steinham said 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
She continued, "I got a lot of help from a woman who was the executive director somewhere who shared that she was crying when she was angry, but she developed her technique, thanks to which when she was angry and crying, she said to her interviewer, "You might think I'm sad because she's crying.
I'm angry."
And then it just goes on.
I thought it was brilliant."
The tears are allowed in an expression of anger, partly because they are misunderstood at first.
One of my clearest memories of previous work, in the office mainly with men, is like once, while I've had a bit of unexplained anger, older woman caught me by the door – a freezing leader, from whom I was always a little scared – and she dragged me to the stairs.
"Never let them see you crying," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy to have done it to you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic Congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in his campaign for president.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extra-marriage relationship with the yacht called "Monkey Business", and withdrew from the competition, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply disappointed, decided that there was no reason to consider the idea of applying for president herself.
"It wasn't a well-considered solution," she said 30 years later, laughing.
"There were already seven other candidates in the competition and the last thing they wanted to happen was to show up another one.
Someone called the situation "Snow and Seven Dwarves".
Since it's included late in the campaign, it's left with a fundraiser and decides it won't stay in the competition if it fails to collect $2 million.
The battle is predestined to fail.
She realizes that some of her supporters who give $1,000 to men would only give her $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she wondered.
In his speech, in which he declares that he will not continue with an official campaign, she is the hall of so many feelings – thanks to the people who supported her, discontent with the system that makes it so difficult to collect money and to be able to turn to voters, not to delegates, but to anger against sexism that she felt.
"A man may think I've got a nervous breakdown," recalls Mrs. Schroeder how the media reacted.
"Someone might think that Kleinex is my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking what they were going to write on my tombstone?
"She's crying"?"
How the US-China Trade War Can Serve Beijing
The first launch in the US-China trade war was deafening and, as the battle is about to set speed, a gap between the two countries will benefit Beijing in the long term, experts say.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, fired the first warning bell this year, covering key elements of China's exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest escalation of the tension emerged this week with the new customs duties affecting production of $200 billion (150 billion British pound) with an effective tax on half of all goods imported into the USA from China.
Every time Beijing turned against new customs with five to ten percent of American goods for $60 billion.
China has refused to give up every hit on the United States and soon the second largest global economy is not expected to ignore this.
To get Washington to give up means to submit to the demands, but to go public in front of Washington would be too embarrassing for Si Dzinpin, the president of China.
And yet, according to experts, if Beijing plays its cards correctly, the pressure from the US trade war can help China in the long term with reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that an accelerated political solution, both in Washington and in Beijing, can create conditions for an economic crisis in some of the two countries, is in fact more dangerous than the observers had previously acknowledged," said Abigail Grace, a scientist on issues related to Asia to the Expert Group Center for New American Security.
Syria is "ready" to return refugees," Foreign Minister said
Syria has announced that it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and requests for assistance in the reconstruction of the country, devastated by the war, has continued for more than seven years.
Turning to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid al-Mulam said conditions in the country are improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and secure, thanks to the progress we have in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore areas devastated by terrorists to restore them to their normal state.
Now there are all conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and food.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people who still live there need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mulam said the Syrian regime would welcome any assistance in restoring the desolate state.
But he stressed that no conditional support or assistance would be accepted from the states that financed the rebels.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the Ryder Cup for 2018, winning the US team with a final result of 16.5 out of 10.5 of the Le Golf National in Paris, France.
Thus, the US has six consecutive losses on European land and have not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe returned the championship crown to the tournament, after the team led by Danish captain Thomas Bjorn reached the required 14.5 points that guaranteed victory over the United States.
The star of the United States, Phil Mikelson, who presented himself weakly during most of the tournament, sent his first hit to the 16th hole (with "a pair") in the water, with which he lost his match against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari presented himself perfectly in all rounds, becoming one of the four players in the history of the tournament, reached a balance of 5-0-0 since the competition took place in the current format after 1979.
American Jordan Spite lost categorically with 5&4 from a player in the European team, located at the lowest ranking – Torbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
World ranking leader Dustin Johnson lost 2 and 1 of Ian Paulter from England, for which this is probably the last participation of the Ryder Cup.
Spanish Sergio Garcia, a veteran with eight participations in the Ryder Cup, became a European with the most winning points in the tournament for all time, increasing its assets to 25.5 points this year.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't hold it.
It was a tough year.
I'm extremely grateful to Thomas for calling me and believing in me.
I'm so glad I can raise the cup again.
Most importantly, the team is important, and I am happy that I was able to help," said excited Garcia after the victory of Europe.
He's handing over the staff of his fellow citizen John Ram, who won American legend Tiger Woods with 2+1 on the singles on Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud to win Tiger Woods, but I grew up watching him play," 23-year-old Ram said.
Woods lost all four matches in France and his overall Ryder Cup balance is now 13-21-3.
Foreign statistics for one of the largest players for all time have won 14 major titles – an indicator that only falls to Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. team was having trouble all weekend, except Patrick Reid, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who showed high-class golf in every day of the tournament.
The U.S. team captain Jim Furick said after the disappointing performance of the team: “I’m proud of these guys, they fought.
At one time this morning, we pressured the team of Europe.
There was a battle.
I'm taking off Thomas' hat.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players were very good.
We will regroup, discuss important issues with the US Professional Golf Association and our Ryder Cup Committee and we will look only forward.
I love these 12 boys and I'm proud to be their captain.
There's no way you can keep your opponent's hat down.
We've just been on top of it."
New for Red Flood: Concentrations decrease in Pinelas, Manuti and Sarasota
The latest report of the Committee on Fish and Wild Animals in Florida shows a fundamental reduction in red tide concentrations in parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the Committee, there are reports of conditions for growth decline in the areas of Pinelas, Manuti, Sarasota, Charlotte and Colier districts – this shows a reduction in concentrations.
Water particles with excessive red flood colour extend to approximately 130 miles along the coast, from the northern district of Pinelas to the southern district of Lee.
Aquifers can be seen 10 miles from the coast of Hillsboro County, but they are less than last week.
Red tides are also observed in the Pasco district.
Over the past week, there has been evidence of moderate concentrations in the coastal zone or a little more indoor in the Pinelas district, low to high concentrations on the coast of the Hillsboro district, assumptions of high concentrations in the Manuti district, assumptions of high concentrations on the coast or inside of the Sarasota district, assumptions of moderate concentrations in the Charlotte district, assumptions of high concentrations on the coast or inside of the Liy district, and low concentrations in the Koller district.
They continue to receive information about the inflammation of the respiratory tract in the districts Pinelas, Manuti, Sarasota, Lee and Kolier.
There have been no reports of respiratory inflammation in Northwestern Florida in the past week.
