Well, then I'll go to Tom's.

I hit a box in his jaw.
I pressed the button to turn the radio on.
I drew up the word "Allis" to highlight.
I suggested it.
I put three coffee cans of false sugar in your tea.
I opened my tent.
I quit smoking curses.
I gave up.
I'm raising goods.
The Iranians were a peaceful people.
I read his book.
I read Tom's story.
I realized I haven't eaten yet.
I'm really getting married.
I really like you.
I really don't know.
I really like what your hair looks like.
I really like it.
I really like your website.
I really love your older sister.
I really missed you.
I really miss my mother's cooking.
I really miss them.
I really want to help him.
I really want to know what's going on here.
I really want to learn French.
It would be really nice to keep your mouth shut.
I got this fax from her.
I recognize the guy.
I refuse to do that.
I refuse to work.
I remember how I met the queen.
I despise his rude attitude.
I respect the decision you made.
I cried one.
Iron is stronger than gold.
Isaac Newton died as a virgin.
I said I'd bring it.
I said maybe he'll turn around.
I told you to open the door.
I said we're closed.
I agreed.
Anybody in there?
Is anyone surprised?
Is there something missing?
I saw a ghost last night.
I saw an unidentified flying object.
I saw her a week ago.
I saw him right now.
I saw him play cards with all of them.
I saw him there.
I saw my sister drop the letter.
But I didn't see anything.
I saw that.
I saw them.
I saw the sponge in the sink.
I saw Tom do it.
I saw Tom with Mary.
I saw Tom.
Is it far from Boston?
Is Buddhism a religion or a philosophy?
Is Dan aware of what he did?
Are you calorific?
I don't see a conspiracy here.
"I see," said the blind man.
I see Tom every day.
I see you're awake.
I sent Tom to Boston between me.
I left early to catch the first train.
Are they all busy?
Are they all happy?
Is everybody having fun?
Is everything there?
Is he breathing?
Does his aunt eat apples or bananas?
I've been right with my head.
I definitely need to buy you a drink.
I should be sorry about them.
I need to take her home.
I need to pack.
I need to go change my clothes.
I should go home.
I shouldn't have trusted her.
I shouldn't have done it without you.
I shouldn't have eaten so much ice cream.
I shouldn't have gone to Tom's.
I should sue him.
I should take a look.
I should try to help them.
I should have asked her first.
I should have asked them first.
I should have asked you first.
I should have been more cultural.
I should've checked.
I should have done it yesterday.
I should have known you were gonna be here.
I should have refused.
I showed my room.
Did he study outside?
Is it over?
Is it far from here?
Is Dada really very nice today, or does it seem to me?
Is that the last lesson?
Is it time to go?
Is it true?
I've got him a scarf.
I'm sleeping on my feet.
I'm sleeping on standby.
I slept like a curse.
I slept in my lap.
I slept on the bus.
I cut off the sandwich.
Did Mike stop drinking alcoholic drinks?
I was smiling.
Isn't it exciting?
Isn't it possible that Tom did this?
Isn't that unusual?
Isn't that dangerous?
Isn't that enough?
Isn't that excessive?
Isn't that good news?
Isn't that the guy who wants to buy your house?
Isn't this great?
I kind of like it.
I've been cleaning up the snow all day.
Is she a taxi driver?
Is she pregnant or is she just fat?
Is she really that pretty?
Is that your mother?
I was staring at the man.
I started seeing him.
I started thinking about him.
I blew something weird.
Is that all Tom does?
Is that all we need?
Is that a rhetorical question?
Does that mean "yes" or "no"?
Is there even that word?
Is that necessary?
Is that necessary?
Is that sarcasm?
Is that enough?
Is that Tom's coat?
Is that what Tom thinks happened?
Did you do that to them?
So there's Tom?
Is that why I'm here?
Is that why you came?
Is that why you don't want to help him?
Is that why you don't want to help us?
Is that your package?
Is the bridge safe?
Is coffee hot?
Is the house ready?
Is the lake deep?
Is he paying for the delivery?
Is there a doctor here who knows English?
Is there any food?
Anybody else?
Is there anyone else here?
Is there sugar?
Is there anything else I can do for you?
Is there a problem?
Is there a reward?
Is there anything specific you want to see?
Is this about Tom?
Is this a good time to talk?
Is this in place?
Is it really a diamond?
Is that moral?
Is this exactly English?
Is this Jupiter or a bull?
Is this our cabin?
Is it your radio?
Is anyone sitting here?
Is this place free?
Was this all the excitement?
Is this your picture?
Is this your bag?
Is this your bag or his?
Is this yours, Tom?
I still don't believe Tom left.
Somehow I still don't believe it.
I still don't get it.
I still don't know how to do that.
I still don't understand women.
I still respect Tom.
I still want a horse.
I stole it from them.
Does Tom know he's swimming?
Is Tom back?
Is Tom aware?
Does Tom contribute?
Is Tom dead?
Is Tom dying of cancer?
Is Tom funny?
Is Tom in Boston?
Is Tom interested?
Is he looking for Tom?
Are you mad at Tom?
Is Tom safe?
Is Tom still alive?
You talk to Tom?
Is Tom alone there?
Is Tom with you now?
I stopped paying attention to Tom.
I burned the cyber in the dark.
I'm learning art history.
I felt old all of a sudden.
I'm suffering from asthma.
I suggest you learn more.
I suggest we focus on looking for a way out of this cave.
I suggest we go home.
I'm hungry for you to lean on.
I suggest you send someone out to see what's going on.
I guess I should go talk to Tom.
I guess that's okay.
That's how I doubted it.
I suspect Tom broke the window.
I was swimming in the river.
I swear it wasn't me.
I swear it was them.
I swear, I wouldn't catch up with you if I burned you and you were the last bucket of water.
It goes down there every day.
Are you still working on the freezer?
Is your head full of straw?
I use the opportunity to thank her.
Italian cops are driving me crazy.
I talked to my advisers about what subjects to take.
It all makes sense.
It looks pointless.
It always happens the same way.
It can't be a coincidence.
So it wasn't.
It's not possible!
It's you for now.
It seemed much more than I expected.
Never, but never, it could have happened here.
There's no way it was Tom.
That would be a disaster.
It'd be good.
I didn't mind.
We didn't mention that.
It didn't get so bad.
That's what disappointed him.
It would look good.
I don't mind.
It won't get better.
It doesn't look very different.
It doesn't matter what you don't want to do; you have to.
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't seem to help.
Doesn't sound like he knows what.
That doesn't surprise me.
I teach Chinese.
I'm learning English.
It's just me.
That gave me an idea.
I've got something to do with.
It had to be done.
It must have come from somewhere.
Depends on your decision.
It happened too fast.
It's happening.
It's happening.
It's cool.
It's not about luck.
It wasn't easy for us.
It has sentimental value.
I've been thinking about it all day.
I think of him every day.
I think she's right.
I think he's right.
I think he's hiding something?
I think I can.
I think I could get used to seeing you every day.
I think I better help him.
I think I better help them.
I think I found one of those.
I think I'm done.
I think I know him.
I think I know how to find him.
I mean, I know how to stop him from happening again.
I think I'm gonna go eat outside.
I think I'm gonna go visit Tom and see what he's like.
I think I love you.
I think I've made myself clear.
I think I'm writing pretty well.
I think I'm a pretty normal guy.
I think it's possible to pee.
I think I'll be fine.
I think I should look at Tom.
I think I should have asked for help.
I think I speak French very well.
I think it's risky without any help.
I think it would be best if I stayed here for a while.
I think it's time to start getting ready.
I think it's time you left now.
I think it's time to start getting ready.
I think it would be a mistake to borrow Tom's money.
I think I figured out what time we should leave.
I think I was wrong.
I think I might be able to help her.
I think he's good at dancing.
I think so.
I think that hotel will be a little expensive for you.
I think that's terrible.
I think that's crazy.
I think it's Tom.
I think you're right.
I think the box is empty.
I think they saw me.
I think Tom can help.
I think Tom's gone.
I don't think Tom's breathing anymore.
I think Tom's unconscious.
I think Tom's conservative.
I think Tom was brave.
I think Tom's crazy.
I think Tom's dying.
I think Tom's funny.
I think Tom's beautiful.
I think Tom's cruel.
I think Tom's hurt.
I think Tom's mean.
I think Tom's fine.
I think Tom's fat.
I think Tom's tiny.
I think Tom's a cepedal.
I think Tom's rich.
I think Tom's right.
I think Tom's in danger.
I think Tom's cute.
I think Tom's sensitive.
I think Tom knows who stole my wallet.
I think Tom might have a boyfriend.
I think Tom moved to Boston.
I think Tom needs a ride to the airport.
I thought Tom was just bluffing.
I don't think Tom's gonna go.
I think we can catch him.
I think it's better if we don't drink water.
We'd better not get out of a storm like this.
I think we'll join.
I think we're close to the solution.
I think we're done.
I think we should call him.
I think we should help him.
I think we should hire him.
I think we should wait a little longer.
I think we've had enough.
I think we found one.
I think you did it.
I think you did it on purpose.
I think you know the rules.
I think you know Tom.
I think you know what I'm interested in.
I think you know who I am.
I think you're gonna have to help them.
I think you should call him.
I think you've panicked.
I think you're exaggerating the problem.
I think you're too sick to go to school.
I think you should choose her.
I think you should do this alone.
I think you're gonna help me.
I think you've been here before.
I think you've lived in the jungle too long.
I think they lied to you.
I think you're spending too much time with Tom.
I think you should end this by yourself.
I think you've helped enough.
I thought about what Tom said.
I was thinking about you.
I thought there were bigger tits.
I thought he was there.
I thought I'd ask him for help.
I thought I was asking for their help.
I thought I lost all the money, but I guess I was wrong.
I never thought I'd find him.
I never thought I'd find Tom.
I thought it was my fault.
I thought you'd already found a place to stay.
I thought they found him.
I think this is over.
I thought Tom had a good time.
I thought Tom was retired.
I thought maybe Tom knew where Mary put the key.
I thought Tom might not want to go with us.
I thought Tom came from Boston.
I thought Tom was gonna be here.
I thought Tom was sick.
I thought Tom was gonna be busy.
I thought Tom wouldn't want any help.
I thought Tom wouldn't want to go with us.
So we agreed?
I thought we could help you.
I thought we could sit here for a while and talk.
I was thinking of visiting the museum together.
I think you're gonna have a job by the bush.
So you didn't want the reward?
I thought you found someone else.
I thought you lost your watch.
So you don't hate him?
I thought he was tired.
I thought maybe you could help.
I thought you might be interested in finding out.
I thought you were only dating girls that were inferior to you.
So didn't you know you were playing the piano?
So didn't you say you could swim?
So you said you wanted to go with us?
I thought you were playing chess better than me.
I thought you were crazy about Tom.
I thought you were funny.
I thought you'd live with us.
I thought you were in Boston.
I thought you were planning on staying in bed all day.
I didn't think you'd be busy.
I thought you wouldn't like Tom.
I'm in terrible pain here.
Mary gets nervous when Tom leaves the cap out of the hall.
It's a multi-phase process.
That depends on whether we buy it or not.
His first day at school.
I can't answer the question.
There's no theoretical chance I'll finish my job in one day.
It's less wet today than yesterday.
It's not cold.
It's not expensive.
It's not over yet.
It's not that bad.
It's not wrong.
Can I handle that?
I'm paying.
It doesn't matter.
They say the old chapel is cursed.
It's starting to get in our head that we can't ignore nature.
It's warmer today than yesterday.
It's worth quoting a well-known passage of his essay.
He's writing on his forehead.
It's written on his face.
I kind of feel wrong.
I just don't feel safe about it.
It just sounds boring.
It happens all the time.
It's gonna be okay.
It'll be Christmas soon.
It'll be hard to convince them.
It's gonna be okay.
It'll be worth it.
It looked terrible.
It looked funny.
Looks like you're right.
It looks very delicious.
It looks different.
I think it's familiar.
It looks like eggs.
Looks like I drank too much last night.
Looks like these two are back together.
It seems these two have calmed down.
Looks like we're having a snowy Christmas this year.
Looks like we're the only ones here today.
It looks nice.
That's what I got close to Tom.
You kicked me.
I'm worried.
It could be dangerous.
Maybe it'll be hard.
Maybe it's already too late.
Maybe it sounded like a suggestion, but it was an order.
Maybe he'll turn around tonight.
Maybe it's weird.
Maybe it'll be a long time before you see me again.
Maybe it's him.
It could be risky.
Maybe it's not just a coincidence.
It can come back today.
Must have been her.
I must have invented it.
It must be perfectly symmetrical.
I told them when I saw them.
I told the police that Tom was with me that time.
I told Tom about you.
I told Tom he wasn't welcome here.
I told Tom the truth.
I told Tom to tell you that.
I told you I can't.
I told you it would be hard to get out.
I told you my father died when I was thirteen years old.
I told you this was gonna get tough.
I told you the truth.
I'm a teacher, too.
I went on a trip to Boston.
I took care of it.
I'm out.
I came back with the bus.
I took Tom to lunch.
My pants are off.
I couldn't sleep all night.
I completely understand.
Probably won't be worth waiting for.
He came back two days ago.
You've been working with a lot of trouble.
I tried to explain it to him, but he's not.
I tried to find Tom.
I tried to make him come.
I tried to make them stop.
I tried to pretend to be something I wasn't.
I'm sincerely complaining about it.
I trust the teacher.
I'm trying not to sneeze about you.
I'm trying not to shake myself.
He's about to turn around.
It's a classic.
It was a real disaster!
It is recommended that you check if there are any side effects if you drink alcohol while drinking the medicine prescribed.
It's a kid's game.
That's a good system.
It's all in the file.
Everything's in the room.
We're done.
Now it's over.
That's all they're talking about.
It's all very strange.
It'll be over in a little while.
It'll be midnight in Boston.
It's almost summer.
She's just gonna have to go.
It's funny.
It's seven o'clock.
It's 11 o'clock.
It's already open.
That's a minor mistake.
It's a miracle you survived.
It's an honor.
There's nothing to think about.
It's a shame you ruined everything.
It's about integrity.
That's a reasonable compromise.
It's a fake lead.
It's a risk plan.
It's a shame the concrete doesn't burn.
It's coming up fast.
It's a simple job.
It's a special occasion.
It's a stupid rule.
It's a great idea, but it's gonna take a lot of work.
They broke him up.
You just made me sick.
He's been back for a week, up and down.
Three weeks have passed since Tom moved to Boston.
It's been too long.
This week is extremely hot.
It would be best if you didn't talk that much.
It's better to be alone.
It is better to be optimistic and bet on yourself than to be pessimistic and be right.
"You die better on your feet than living on your knees." "Then why are you still alive?"
It's empty.
Sauna's here.
It's the new money.
You scared me.
There's no one.
It's time to close.
Study here.
It's generally known that you don't like Tom.
It's dark here.
It's deeper than that.
It's definitely them.
It's definitely Tom.
It's different now.
It's hard to evaluate his ability.
It's hard to explain.
It's disturbing.
It's easier like this.
It's easier not to end up in jail than to escape.
It's easy to see why people love Tom.
You can easily distinguish them.
I guess I misjudged him.
It looks like her style.
I think that's the only possible conclusion.
It looks very well written.
It's empty.
That's what you need.
It's bad to puke.
It's ten o'clock.
That's exactly what happened before.
It's very rare.
It's fair.
It's fair.
It's to protect you.
It is from the Bible.
It's funny.
Watching TV is fun.
She's dressed.
It's getting darker.
It's getting harder to breathe.
It'll be beastly.
It's gonna get colder.
It'll happen soon.
I'm glad to see you all again.
That's good training.
It's okay.
It's improved.
It's so funny.
It happened before.
It's happening right now, isn't it?
It's hard to explain.
It's hers.
It's hot here in hell.
That should be possible.
It shouldn't take us a long time to do this.
I don't care what you think about Tom.
It's impossible for him to quit smoking.
It's impossible to get out of this cell.
It's a safe place.
He's in excellent condition.
He's in the basement.
I'm just guessing.
It's just a question.
It's just made up.
Just sit there.
It's a little ahead.
It's locked.
It's made of leather.
I'm deciding, Tom.
That's my only hope.
It's nice and fresh.
It's nice and warm.
It's nice of him to carry such gifts.
It's nice to feel that someone needs you.
It's not a big miracle.
It's not a big miracle.
It's loud in here.
It's none of your business!
It's not a secret that Tom disagrees with you.
That's not a big priority.
That's not a mistake.
It's not attractive.
It's not back.
It didn't happen that way.
It won't be easy to do that without a lot of help.
It's not hard to point out if you're surrounded by fools.
It's nothing scary.
It's not just a guess.
It's not usually a pen.
There's not enough light here to read.
It's not that we're doing something.
It's not my decision.
It's not my fault.
You don't have to.
It's not absurd.
It's not that small.
It's not yet spring.
I'm not surprised.
It's not that deep.
It's not too early.
It's not up to you.
It doesn't happen very often that someone buys a hat of a thousand dollars.
It's not worth much.
It was snowing last night.
Obviously it's a print error.
It's obvious to everyone that he's in love.
It's just a temporary solution.
Sounds like Tom.
It sounds pretty loud.
Sounds very good.
It's our job to help them.
It's all white.
It's poison.
His presence is important to me.
It's probably hard.
It's probably true.
He's probably still there.
Probably still available.
It's dirty.
It's actually very common.
It's delicious.
It's very possible that I'm wrong.
It's quite possible Tom can't help us at all.
It's simple.
It's really exciting.
It's really bad.
It's a real damage.
It's really weird.
It's red.
It's so beautiful.
It's so complicated.
But it's strong!
It's a law!
It's so obvious that we don't need proof.
It's getting darker.
It's still dark out there.
It's still on sale.
It's still working.
It's still not working.
It's still growing.
He's still there.
It's weird how people in the tropical areas eat cooked food like a cari.
It's stuck.
His surface was flat as a mirror.
It's time for that again.
This is the best poor thing I've ever tasted.
It's a spider's tart.
I'm so scared!
It's time to get to work.
It's time to get up.
It's Tom's office.
It's too impressive.
It's too late to help you.
It's too risky to fight them on their own.
It's very strong.
It's bullshit.
It's all wrong.
This heat is not supported.
That's unique and irreplaceable.
It's unnatural.
It's really hot.
I need to see Tom first.
It's very relaxed.
It's very simple to understand.
It's hot here.
I don't care.
There's a wind.
It's from work.
You're losing.
It's yours to ask, Tom.
It's yours.
The water only needs three minutes to speak.
It's been going on all night.
It took a lot more than I thought it would.
It took me a long time to get rid of those ants.
Turns out you're an unexpected beauty.
I turned on the fan and turned it on the wall.
I turned on the lamp.
I turned off the TV.
I turned him down, Tom.
It was a great honor to be asked to give a speech.
It was so beautiful.
That was a shame.
It was midnight.
This was an arena day.
It was a great show.
That was all my idea.
You were right here.
It was so easy.
That was an amazing night.
It was a ambush.
It was a terrible sight.
It was an honor.
It was an offer I couldn't refuse.
It was a bore I spent the night with a smart, spiritual and beautiful girl like you.
It was an extraordinary experience.
That was a surprise.
It was a wonderful experience.
It was a tough test.
It was a warm night.
It was a wonderful day.
It was a great day.
It was a wonderful evening.
Such behavior was childish on his part.
It was disgusting.
It was effective.
It was pretty funny.
It was too late.
It was for her.
It was her.
It was one of them.
It was fun yesterday.
He was having a night.
It was getting dark.
It was ironic.
It was my fault.
That was my suitcase.
Nice of you to buy Tom a gift like that.
It was kind of you to let me stay here last night.
It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.
It wasn't easy for me to admit that I was wrong.
It wasn't easy to solve this problem.
It didn't matter.
It wasn't my idea.
It wasn't very good.
It was pretty disgusting.
It has been proved that the pain in dogs jumps higher than the pain in cats.
It was great.
It was pretty funny.
Epten was cheap.
It was really good.
It was really nice.
It was really nice.
That was really touching.
He was breathing a lot.
It was amazing.
It was necessary.
It was seven and a half.
The day was so beautiful that we decided to climb.
It was so obvious.
It was creepy.
He was still there.
Tom gave me the picture that's attached to the jacket.
It was Tom.
It was too much.
It was sad.
I arrived in Tokyo two months ago.
That was inconceivable.
It was very generous of you to buy us all this stuff.
It was very suffocating in that room, because all the windows were closed.
It was Bether.
It was worth a try.
It was your fault.
It won't be okay.
It won't be enough.
I'm not gonna be alone here.
Nothing's gonna cost you to fix it.
They won't help lies.
It won't help you.
That's good.
It would be very normal for you to get mad at Tom.
It wouldn't matter.
I'll talk to you tomorrow if I can explain everything.
I need you urgently.
I've been watching you before.
I used to dream of becoming a ballerina.
I used to hate you.
I use it every day.
I'm using that computer.
I'm using this.
I've already packed.
I've already read it.
I already wrote everything I had to write.
I've already written my part of the report.
I've always admired Tom.
I've always been careful not to say too much.
I've always been helped by someone.
I always thought you were from Boston.
I've always wanted to get to one of these.
I've always wanted to live in a place like this.
I've already asked everyone.
I asked Tom to help you.
- Have a cake.
I baked them a cake.
I've been chasing them for a long time.
I was a little overwhelmed by something else.
I turned the whole city around looking for Dom.
It was much worse for me.
They betrayed me.
I've been reported.
I've been robbed three times this month.
I've been calling for hours.
I was an alcoholic.
I was thoughtless.
I can't wait to meet him.
I've been gone for three weeks.
I was happy here.
- I've been helping.
I gave them some help.
They hired me to find them.
They kidnapped me.
I've been living here for years.
I've been looking for him for a while.

We've been looking all over for them.
We love beauty.
Maybe it's too late.
We finally meet, Tom.
We met in Meana.
We met in Boston last year.
We met a day ago.
Maybe we can find something.
Maybe we'll have a chance to talk to Tom later.
We all have to go find Tom.
We must always support our children.
We have to face the facts.
We need to know exactly what we're doing.
We can't give up.

Now we need it.

We packed their suitcases.
We played basketball in the gym.
We're playing Sunday.
We set up a tent.
We're out of food.
Up and down we're ready.
Let's just get started.
We're all in danger.
We're all pioneers.
We're all safe.
We're all the same.
We need more American slang on Tatoeba, in an emergency!
We're a team!
We're home today.
We're avoiding him.
We're together again.
We've been bankrupting.
We're being childish.
We've been informed.
We're not moms.
We're paranoid.
We're both from Boston.
We're busy now.

We're looking for them.
We're modeled.
We won't let you die.

Aren't you going?
Didn't you get tired?
We're good.
We're old friends.
Let's go to Boston.
There's no gas.
No need for a drama.
We're exaggerating.
We're playing on a computer.
We're playing with the computer.
We're pretty good.
We're probably lying.
We're ready to fight.
If you're ready to go, we're ready.
We're very angry.
We're really good.
We're really in danger.
We're fine.
We're sorry.
We'll stay.
We're the best.
We're playing with fate.
We're the champions.
Did you have any survivors?
We're Tom's parents.
We're trying to help him.
We'll turn back.
We're very effective.
We're very pleased.
We're wasting our time.
We're dependent on work.
Did you get scared?
Were you home at ten?
Was it one of them?
We're your neighbors.
Was it honest?
Was he sympathetic?
Did you see?
Were you with anyone?
We wrapped up the carpet.
We sat down and waited.
We should ask him.
We need to ask them.
We both have to go.
We should do this again sometime.
We should give him some time.
We should give Tom a chance to admit it.
We should go home.
We need to help them.
We should let Tom get back to work.
We shouldn't have let her go.
We shouldn't have stayed up until 2:30.
We need to set up a trap.
We should have bought another bottle of wine.
We should've given up before.
We slept in a tent.
We spent the afternoon fooling around on the beach.
We started talking.
We're stuck.
We stayed up all night trying to figure out a plan.
We still need a plan.
We still want to help.
We stole it.
We've been talking for two hours.
I think you can tell us where to find him.
We tried to get them to come.
We tried to get them to tell us.
We tried to hide it.
We understand that.
We appreciate our customers.
None of us were right.
We've all read that.
We've already cleared that.
We baked them cakes.
We're just getting started.
We're expecting her.
We were looking for them.
We've been through a lot.
We were transferred.
We were trying.
We've been waiting.
We were worried.
We both saw him.

We've met several times.
Only once have we met.

We want more money.
We want to be famous.
We want to hear it.
We want to help him.
We want to help them.
We want to know about them.

We want to see Tom.
We got out of there at eleven o'clock.
We went to pick up strawberries.
We went to the same church.
We were all cheering for her.
We were all shocked.
We were both busy.
We didn't even have any broken money.
We were just confused.
At the time, we were 18 years old.
We're gonna hang them.
We had a fight.
We were in a hurry.
We're just here in time.
We just got out of there.
We were looking for you.
We didn't fight.
We weren't hungry.
They had a lot more of them than we did.
We were passengers.
We played golf.
We were ready.
We were very close.
You didn't save the bell.
We were so worried.
We were so young then.
We got there first.
We were under attack.
We were worried about you.
We'll have a discussion about the forecast.
We will visit our brothers and sisters.
When we woke up this morning, we faced terrible news.

You're cooking a bunny.
It's possible you're wrong.
You could've refused.
You'd be a great mother.
You better ask them first.
If you'd found them.
You better go help him.
You better go.
You better let me do it.
You deserve a medal.
You deserve a higher salary.
He deserved better.
You'd do the same for me.
You've done the wrong thing.
You've done your job well.
You didn't buy that, did you?
You didn't give me a chance.
Didn't you know Tom was gay?
You didn't listen.
You didn't see anyone coming in, did you?
You didn't tell me what was wrong.
You told Tom about it, right?
You already did that.
He did all he could.
You don't have to like everything.
You don't even like fish.
You're gonna get hurt, right?
Don't you have a random key?
You don't know how long.
You don't have to be abnormal to work here.
You know what I'm saying.

You don't have to wear anything disgusting.
You don't have to write more than 400 words.
You don't think it's worth it, do you?
You don't understand business.
You don't want to do something that will remind them that you're not really big enough to be here.
You don't want to go, do you?
You don't work here.
You're driving me crazy.
You forgot your backpack!
You scared Tom.
You gave Tom the list, didn't you?
You have the right to a phone call.
You go pick Tom up and get back.
You hit one.
You're not right, people.
You were right, guys.

There's no reason to be afraid.
You haven't changed your mind, have you?
You didn't see that, did you?
You haven't solved this problem, have you?

You have very beautiful lips.
You've got a lot of hairy eyes.
You heard exactly.
Just got back from vacation.
You almost missed him.

You don't get involved in this.
Children, you stay here.
You knew, didn't you?
You know he would do anything for your beautiful eyes.
You know I don't eat meat.
You know me better than you seem.
You know me too well.
You know, sometimes you should hear it.
You know what I need.
You know, you don't mean anything anymore, Mary!
You're learning fast.
You will learn to appreciate your health when you get sick.
He left me in despair.
You let Tom escape.
You love your life, don't you?
You'll be all right.
You're gonna get confused.
You'll be in danger.
You'll be my guests.
You'll be known in time.
You'll feel better.

You're going with me and a point!
That's what you're gonna have to ask him.
You'll have to learn better next year.
You're gonna have to talk to Tom about what you expect him to do.
You'll need a ticket to travel by bus.
You're gonna have to sit still.

You're bothering me.
Maybe you'll need it.
You can go anywhere.
Maybe you'll have to help us.
You can sleep here.
It wouldn't be bad to slow down.
You met my sister, didn't you?
Maybe you can help them.
You must be careful.
You must be confused.
I'm sure it's very easy for you.

You need to help her.
I need you to help me find him.
You need to hurry.

We only have one life.
One is life.
You need to make a habit of brushing your teeth after each meal.
You should go to a dentist.
You don't owe me anything.
You pay me very well.
You made a good choice.
You probably think I'm a fraud.
He's gone red.
He was running as fast as he could.
You're burning the car.
You're burning the car.
Your complaints have upset me.
Your crimes have defiled your ancestors' graves.
Your demands are unreasonable.

You're ready to cry.
You're absolutely right.
You're a real man.
You're acting weird.
You're crazy.
You're a fraud.
You're after them.
You're a good son.
You're a loving man.
You're all cowards.
You're all the same.

You're lucky.
You're lying to me.
You're mad at me. I can tell.
You're great.
You're disturbing Tom.
You're my neighbor.

You're not that young anymore.
You're not a freak.
You're not a woman.
You're not dressed.
You won't find me.
You won't find them.
You won't find us.
You're below her level.
You're below his level.
You're not ready yet, are you?
You're not that terrible.
You don't suggest we give Tom all the money, do you?
You're not that old, Tom.
You're not too old for her.
Now you can go.

You're wrong, Tom.
You're lying, Tom.
The witches seem strange to you.
Your future starts today.
Your hair smells like spring.
You're pushing too hard when you're holding your hand.
Why don't you go to a doctor?
Your house is very beautiful.
It's good to remember.
Your moon is coming back.
Your mother put the collage in the top drawer.
Your new guitar has a good sound.
It's hard on you.
Your doctorate must be written in English.
Your excuse is up and down right.
Your propaganda isn't interesting.
Your faith is bad.
Your role here is so important.
Your police are full of books.
There's yours.
Your sister's sleeping.
Your sons are pretty handsome.
All your things are here.
Your wishes are my command.
Your patent's unlocked.
That's what you said an hour ago.
You told me to call whenever.
You said we'd never catch her.
You said you'd help.
You said you'd text me a Quaker, but you lied to me, obviously.
You saved my life.
You look disoriented.
Apparently you already know the answer.
You look like you're studying.
I guess you've got an infection.
Apparently, it's hard to understand what I'm trying to tell you.
Do you share his interest in this book?
You need to ask them for help.
You should ask Tom.

Be careful not to overdo it.

You smell like shit.
You sound like you're relieved.
You sound very safe.
You've got your ankle.
You're so beautiful.
You really talk a lot.
You talk too much about Boston.
You think she's weird just because she's not white.
Traitor!
You two are very sweet together.
You used to be so funny.
You used to love Boston.
You're back.
They drank you.
You've experienced traffic, but you're gonna be fine.
You didn't thank us.
It was for our great benefit.
You're right from the beginning.
You were making white again!
You bought Mary something.
He beat me.
You beat them.
You've done so much.
You scared her.
He's over it!
You've got a rash.
You're burdened with enough care.
You got me wrong.
I promise.
You got it now, don't you?
You have to let me deliver a message to Tom.
You have to let me go home.
You have to work together.
He's an accident, Tom.
You jumped a button.
You've probably seen a lot worse.
You've been delaying this for too long.
You saw what I could do.
You were amazing.
He was in love with Tom, wasn't he?
He was lucky to have survived the attack.
You've made a mistake.
It's not that you were wrong.
You were right, Tom.
He drove fast.
He was great.
You're not asleep all night, are you?
He was very brave.
You were wrong about the picture.
You'll do as I command you.
You'll find your toys and your books.
You won't need that.
You're not gonna make it.
You won't win.
You're too dry for him.
You don't want to be late.
Yeah, I'm angry.
