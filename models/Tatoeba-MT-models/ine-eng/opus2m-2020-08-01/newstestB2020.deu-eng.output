Rainers were called on to leave their homes. Buildings around 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens were closed on Thursday. In the chemical plant on the shore of its banks, additives are produced for lubricants. The factory is part of the company Lubrizol of the US billionaire Warren Buffet and is subject to the so-called EU Seveso Directive, which provides for particularly stringent safety requirements.
About 400 people work in the work. In the past, the chemical factory has already provided for strike lines - for example, as in 2013 a leak developed the gas methanthoil and the environment was largely tainted by faulein eggs. In 2015, after an operation accident, around 2,000 litres of mineral oil flow into the city's sewage system.
A woman announces her job to look for her missing dog 57 days
For two months a woman from Washington was looking for her missing dog - and she announced her job extra. The seven-year-old frontierr Collie was kicked out of the hotel room during a short vacation in Montana. 57 days missed every trace of the dog - but Carole King did not give up.
"It was terrible. I was sick," said Carole King to the "Daily Inter Lake". She and her husband had left Hündin Katie in the hotel room while they went to dinner. When they returned to the hotel, Katie had disappeared. They were looking for the animal, but without success.
Donner had put dog in panic
In the hope that Katie could stay somewhere else in the hotel, Carole King went to the reception. "The employee says: "She's been away about four, four and a half hours ago," recalls Carole King against "Daily Inter Lake". When the automatic entrance door opened, Katie was immediately released. Probably a loud Donner had moved the dog into panic.
With flyers and calls in Facebook groups, the Kings searched for their beloved dog. But from days became weeks. "I never gave up. I never lost hope," said Carole King to "Daily Inter Lake", who announced her job as a postman to continue her search for Katie.
"Flash the tears"
57 days after Katie's disappearance, Carole King received a call: A man reported himself and said that Katie was in his court. But as the king arrived there, Katie had already disappeared again. She sought out the neighborhood and suddenly stood her dog under a tree. "I just hugged her. I didn't want her to go," King recalled according to "Daily Inter Lake". "The tears flowed. People kept in their vehicles, stepped out and hugged us. I think the whole neighborhood knew that we had found her".
Losses at the Federal Defence Force: Machine guns disappear without trace
Friday, September 27, 2019
Six MG3 machine guns are still missing.
In recent years, the German army has lost numerous weapons and tens of thousands of ammunition. Among them are three machine guns. The remainder is unclear in most cases. The opposition speaks of a "fearing" extent.
Since the beginning of 2014, the troops have been able to detect the loss of 39 weapons, 39 weapons and nearly 20,000 ammunition. This is the result of a list of the Federal Ministry of Defence, which is classified as a final case, which is reported by the German publishing network.
According to the paper from the Office of Defence Secretary Peter Tauber of the CDU, two weapons, one weapon and 3474 gun ammunition have been reappeared. The remaining weapons and weapons are six MG3, eleven G3, four G36 guns, six G36 guns and two P8 guns. In addition, 30 weapons pipes are missing for MG3.
The volume of weapons and ammunition losses in the federal defence was "fearsome", said Left-Earth General Martina Renner. This is much more true, as it was hardly found in the course of investigations. The left-wing politician spoke of a "necessary balance". Renner criticised that the list did not reveal whether under the missing ammunition was the one who was found in connection with the investigations against the suspected Federal Defence Officer Franco A.. "And although a supporter of Franco A. was recently convicted for the possession of this ammunition," said Renner.
Oil tanker "Stena Impero" left Iranian port
More than two months after its establishment by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" has left the port of Bandar Abbas on Friday. As reported by ship observation data from Refinitiv, the tanker moved and left the Iranian port. Port Rashid was reported as a destination port in the United Arab Emirates.
The tanker was actually released from the Iranian government on Monday, but he remained in Iranian waters for the first time. It was said that he wanted to wait for an official decision from Tehran.
On 19 July, the "Stena Impero" was commissioned by the Iranian Revolution Guard in the Sea Street of Hormuz to have violated security regulations. However, it was suspected that Iran was reacting to the controversial, temporary establishment of an Iranian oil tanker before the British-owned Gibraltar.
The road of Hormuz is one of the world's most important maritime roads. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Most of the global oil exports are shipped by the sea. The tensions in the region have been very intense in the past months. The trade voyage has been brought into conflict between the USA and Iran.
Merkel values the courage of people in the peaceful revolution
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel praised the commitment of the people in the DDR who went on the road 30 years ago during the peaceful revolution. In the fall of 1989, courageous citizens had brought the then DDR regime into focus, Merkel said at a party of the Thuringia CDU on the upcoming day of German unity in Erfurt. The Chancellor recalled, among other things, the occupation of the Stasi Centres. "State security was taken away from fear," she said.
Musk seeks delivery record
Teslas quarteral may be keeping record ready. Despite delivery boom, there was last loss in the electric car company.
New York.Tesla Chief Elon Musk has given his electric car company a strong boost to the stock exchange with the view of new record numbers. "We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," Musk wrote in an e-mail to Tesla employees published by the industry blog "Electrek".
The demand was strong, so that Tesla could book 110000 orders, it continued in Musks circular. The challenge was to bring the cars to the attention of the public. Tesla had to offer as many resources as possible by the end of the quarter.
Investors felt this: Tesla shares went with a plus of more than six percent out of trade. The price has not been so high since almost four months. In the second quarter Tesla had delivered well 95,000 cars and thus reached its previous best value.
Musk needs a record to achieve his high goals. 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 360000 to 400000 cars. Six-digit numbers have to be delivered in the current and coming quarter year. Especially the most affordable Tesla Model 3 is asked, but here are few winnings. Despite the boom, there was last loss.
Dissolved puzzles: That's why we can't fuck ourselves.
A kind of brake in the big brain prevents people from kicking themselves. This was found by scientists at the Humboldt University in Berlin with the help of experiments on rats, as they reported on Thursday night. Progress has also been made in the question of why children are so strongly opposed to the kicking just to demand more.
Finally, it was also shown why only the approach of a kicking hand already triggered laughter before the touch. This lies at a deep layer in the large brain that already triggers the smile when expecting the kickling.
According to the data, earlier research showed that rats react with "laughing" in the ultrasonic area when they are bitten by humans. This "laughing" is transmitted by the part of the large brain, which serves the central processing of haptic perception.
Laughing is suppressed during self-treatment
So far, it has been assumed that the brain can distinguish between self-touching and touching by others - that is why people can not bite themselves. However, the Berlin researchers now found out in the experiments at the rats that the smiles are being suppressed as well as the activity of the area of the large brain during a self-touching process. This is also true when living beings are self-adhesive. During the alien touch and kitzeln by the scientists, however, the activity in the brain and impulses have been strengthened.
But pass the self-touching and touching through others at the same time, the laugh is also suppressed. This suggests that the brain of the rat cannot distinguish between self-touching and touching by others. The new findings made it clear that people cannot kick themselves because self-touching activates a brake in the large brain.
The rats were also trained to bite themselves. In the experiment they sometimes temporarily interrupted this initiative, showed refugee behavior or horror stars. This ambivalentity is the same as the behavior of children. The ambivalentity of the kitzeln is a behavioral reaction that is the same for rats and humans.
Disaster removed: Great fire destroyed in French chemistry
The Great Fire was destroyed in a very dangerous chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen. This was shared by the prefecture of Normandy of the AFP News Agency on Friday. The fire broke out on Thursday night.
According to the authorities, no dangerous substances should occur. The samples taken do not give cause for concern, as Prefect Pierre-André Durand said at a press conference on Friday morning. No one was injured in the event. The firearm was in use with about 200 destroyers.
Schools and kindergartens closed
The residents were summoned not to leave their homes. Buildings around 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens remained closed on Thursday.

Brexit: Johnson criticized by his own sister
The Prime Minister's sister commented on Boris Johnson's speech at the first session of Parliament after the break on Wednesday. The Prime Minister threatened to lead the country without an EU agreement on 31 October, but Brussels should not accept its demands for amendments to the Brexit Agreement.
The prime minister said about Cox, who had used himself for the UK's stay in the European Union, "The best way to honor Jo Cox's memory and to bring this country back to life would be to fulfill the EU's destiny." Cox was murdered during the referendum election by a law extremist in 2016.
Mahntimes to attacks by Oslo and Utöya is revealed
More than eight years after the attacks in Oslo and Utöya with 77 dead in Norway, the monument "Jern roses" (German: the Iron Roses) consists of about 1,000 iron roses. They remember the roses that thousands of people had left in the days and weeks after the attacks before the house in Oslo.
In the same place, the project of the artists Tobbe Malm and Tone Karlsrud is now to be revealed – the roses have been carved out by people from all over the world, including survivors and members of the victims. They are expected to be opened under the Crown Prince Haakon and Crown Princess Mette-Marit.
On 22 July 2011, Anders Behring Breivik first fired an auto bomb in Oslo's government district and then on the island of Utöya dozens of participants from a youth camp of the social democratic workers' organization were killed.
Iran Frees British Tankers
The UN General debate did not solve Iran's conflict. But now there is less problem. The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" in Iran was able to get back into the sea. It could be a puzzle in the peace plan of Iranian President Ruhani.
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" in the street of Hormus in Iran has been back in international waters since mid-July. After being released by Iranian authorities, the ship is on its way to Dubai, as reported by the Reederei Stana Bulk.
The "Stena Impero" has left the port of Bandar Abbas and the Crew is now going for medical research to Dubai, said Reedereief Erik Hånell. On Wednesday the ship left the Iranian waters. "It's nice that it's over," he told the Swedish television broadcaster SVT.
The Foreign Ministry in London referred to the establishment of the ship as illegal. "This is part of a pattern of attempts to affect the freedom of the sea. We work with our international partners to maintain shipping and international law," it said in a statement on Friday.
On 19 July, the Iranian Revolution Guards set up the tanker under the pretext of disregarding the provisions of the law of the sea in the Persian Gulf. Seven of the 23 crew members had already been released at the beginning of September. The remaining 16 crew members went well according to the circumstances, Hånell said. They had been professional in the face of the difficult and exciting situation in the past ten weeks. The crew is now working to bring them together with their families as soon as possible.
Following the establishment of the "Stena Impero", the British government suspected a reaction to a similar incident in the British Gibraltar: at the beginning of July there was a supertanker with oil from Iran that was supposed to have been placed on the chain for Syria.
Iran spoke of "piracy" and threatened with consequences. In mid-August, the "Adrian Darya-1" was finally released.
The road of Hormus is one of the world's most important maritime roads. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Most of the world's oil exports are shipped by the sea. The tensions in the region have been very intense in the past months. The trade fleet has been involved in the conflict between the US and Iran.
Behind the tensions between Tehran and Washington is the nuclear battle between the two countries. The Americans are throwing the Iranian leadership forward to build nuclear weapons. Iran shows this back. In 2018, the United States was alone in the international nuclear agreement, which was to prevent Iran from building an atomic bomb and at the same time to end its political and economic isolation. Since then, the US government has put the leadership in Tehran with massive economic sanctions against the country under pressure to force a more stringent and extended agreement on other areas. Iran has so far resisted the pressure.
Because of the fight against the "Stena Impero" and other incidents with tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil installations in Saudi Arabia, the United States is working on a coalition for military protection of commercial ships in the region.
Iranian President Hassan Ruhani had presented a plan for security and peace on the way to Hormus at the UN Assembly in New York. With the initiative "Coalition of Hope" for the Persian Gulf, Iran wants to ensure the security of the Persian Gulf along with the Arab Gulf and without foreign defence forces.
India is building a better future with its protectionist economic policy.
In view of the fines imposed by President Donald Trump against Chinese producers, foreign producers in the People's Republic are forced to re-disposition themselves. Asian companies' financial leaders who are considering moving their production from China to another country call India in a survey of the UBS as one of the preferred alternatives. This has free to do not only with the uncertainties of the Chinese-American trade war. With a giant pool of young workers as well as an internal market of 1.3 billion consumers, India seems to be creating a more significant role in the globalised production chain.
But now India itself has focused on Trumps. From Haudegen in the White House as "Kingdom of Customs", America has removed the trade benefits for 2000 products from the country of Schwollen in early June. The United States has prohibited high customs and calls for better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, spirits, motorcycles and more.
On the world map of the trade wars, the raids with India are freely a sideshow. In addition, America considers the world's largest democracy also through the security glasses. Delhi and Washington connects the concern over China's claims of power in the South Ocean. Against this background, it is unlikely that a salve American fine against India will be imposed. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has just entered a second five-year term, should therefore move safely.
The problem lies elsewhere: The empirically hardened thesis that open markets are accelerating economic development has a difficult situation in the socialist Republic of India. Also under fashion. Its reform agenda mainly aims at the bureaucratic confusion that has been stifling all too long in the state of the world. Companies are now given faster building permits for buildings. They benefit from a better energy and transport infrastructure, and a more aggressive insolvency and competition law enables them to liquidate poor companies with high debt.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the appropriate rankings. From an economic perspective, much has been improved in India in the first five fashion years. However, this is not the case in trade policy. Its aim is to protect non-competitive companies from foreign suppliers internationally, even the national conservative government has created new barriers.
In the West, the mode of the Nimbus of the energy reformer, which is radically revitalizing his country economically. This impression is not due to the fact that the charismatic Prime Minister knows only too well what vocabulary Western managers like. In the core, however, the "India First" lawyer never withdrew from a protectionist economic policy, which prevents Indian companies from being forced to dispose of anachronistic runs and thus to become fit for the global competition. Business people who survive due to the removal of their industries are among the indigenous voters of the mode of nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and call this short-term policy.
Appointment of Jacques Chirac on Monday in Paris
The former French President Jacques Chirac is scheduled to present a report in Paris next week. The former Head of State will be appointed on Monday at the Friedhof Montparnasse in the south of the French capital, reported the AFP news agency calling on the Chiracs family. The appointment will take place in close family circles. On Sunday a public mourning party was held in Paris's invalidity, as media reported.
The aim of the contestants is: Dabo is the first secret hero of the Light Athletics World Cup
The world peak was long in the goal of playing hot scenes in the cooled Khalifa International Stadium. In the first run of the men over 5000 meters, Jonathan Busby began to wander dangerously from Aruba. He could hardly stand on his legs well 300 meters before the goal, when Braima Suncar Dabo suddenly came out of the West African country of Guinea-Bissau and supported him by the last half of the stadium. But the forces were still able to stop the current arm watch after the race. As if the scene had not been enough.
"I just wanted to help him. Everyone in this situation would have done the same," said Dabo after racing in Mixed Zone, when he completely unexpectedly drew the attention of the collected journalists to himself. Fearing he only didn’t want to talk about his heroism at all. Finally, he wanted to set up his personal best time and when he noticed that this would be difficult, he only wanted to help a sufferer. And yet he would be proud to represent his country which was invited to the World Cup. Under normal circumstances he wouldn’t even be allowed to start. "So I’m proud to run here for my country," he said.
He did this on the evening with emphasis - and much more intense than he had thought about it. Because this heroity will remain in memory. At the end of Dabo's rival Busby even gave the lead in the goal and voluntarily took the last place - well five minutes after the Ethiopian Selemon Barega who won this event. He had enjoyed nothing at the end of it all, because the busby who came to the goal with much help was precisely disqualified at the end of the World League of Athletics.
Dabo, who lives in Portugal and studied there in Lisbon, was present to create a personal best time at the World Cup in Doha. According to official data at 18:10.87 minutes, he himself was disappointed: "I wanted to run 17:55 minutes. I was already 18 minutes old." However, only in training, there are no best times.
Millions of masks: Egyptians prepare for wild Protestant days
In Egypt, security measures have been strengthened in advance of possible government critical protests. In the center of Cairo there was an enhanced police presence on Friday. Several subway stations remained closed, roads around the central Tahrir square have been blocked.
Already in the past days the police had strengthened their street controls and partially searched the phones of pedestrians for news and photos in connection with the protests. Hundreds had been arrested according to two non-governmental organisations.
Opponents of Al-Sisi
Last weekend it had been in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura to protest with hundreds of participants. They turned against the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the critic of corruption and mismanagement. There had been no such open protest against political leadership in Egypt for years. The Egyptian construction contractor and actor Mohammed Ali, who brought the demonstrations with video messages to Facebook, had called for a "million march" on Friday to be a central place in the country. Ali calls for a "People's Revolution". The man is also not a "good" for most young Egyptians, because he as a subcontractor for the army, but he is afraid of his messages.
The number of arrests related to the protests continued to rise by two groups of observers. By Friday, the Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) numbered more than 1,570 arrests. The Egyptian Centre for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and the Human Rights Watch (HRW) spoke of more than 2,000 arrests. Independently, these figures were not confirmed. The government also confirmed and commented on the figures.
Voluntary arrests
Many people have been "willfully arrested" "only because they were 'for the wrong time in the wrong place'," HRW informed them in appeal to lawyers of detainees. The allegations against the detainees range from "dissemination of false information" to membership in a "terrorist association". In Cairo, Alexandria and other cities, security forces were questioned and searched in uniform, but also in civilian clothing, according to HRW indications, and volunteers.
HRW also criticised the censorship in the North African country. Thus, the government in Cairo blocks websites and online services to stop further protests against Sisi.
Online Dealer: Resellers should be able to contribute more easily to returns
For online dealers many returned packages are lost. Around 20 million returns land on the garbage. But there is an alternative.
The Ministry of Finance has shown online traders such as Amazon and Zalando a way in which they can contribute returned products instead of destroying them.
Although the companies could not be released from sales tax on a case-by-case basis, the Ministry explained a question of the Greens-Bundags Group, which was reported on Friday by the Funke-Media Group, but the traders could use the market value of non-sale returns so low that they would not or would not have to pay any sales tax.
Scientists at Bamberg University had found that the federal citizens would send back every sixth package when ordering the Internet. Around four percent of the goods - some 20 million products - then landed in the garbage. To contribute, the companies would cost extra money, depending on current legal conditions, because the financial authorities estimate that they will have to pay as much money as a revenue that is then taxed.
Green Group Chief Katrin Göring-Eckardt called on Finance Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) to make it clear that companies could not assess sales products in accordance with the rules and donate free of charge to non-profit organisations. The companies should be able to rely not to be punished for their donations. This applies not only to online trade, but also to other business from the model to the construction market.
Banksy art for auction: There was never a better time to sell this painting
The well-known work of Streetart-Star Banksy, "Devolved Parliament", will soon be promoted.
For Brankík Banksys stresses the work "the re-education of the world's oldest parliamentary democracy into the basics of animals and tribes". From Saturday the painting at Sotheby's is to be exhibited in the British capital until it is auctioned on October 3. It is estimated at EUR 1.5 million to two million.
The work was first exhibited in 2009 at the Museum of Bristol in southwest Britain where Banksy lives. In this year the artist had re-issued the painting - at the same time as the original Brexit date on 29 March. On this occasion the work, which was called the "Question Hour", was renamed "Devolved Parliament" ("Delegated Parliament").
The picture could change the owner for a million.
Last Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson delivered a tough fight with the opposition at the first meeting of the Sub-House following the abolition of a forced break by Johnson by the Supreme Court. Johnson wanted to complete the Brexit already moved twice on 31 October without any agreement with the EU.
It is not the first time that Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, is involved in the Brexit debate. In Dover in southeast England he painted a picture that represents a man who breaks a star with a myth of the European flag. The work sees every day thousands of truck drivers and other visitors when entering the United Kingdom.
Brexit debate is like a walk in the park
The fierce verbal attacks by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Brexit opponents in Parliament do not contribute to a climate of hatred, according to his chief advisor. Compared to the election struggle before the Brexit referendum 2016, the current controversy was a "space crossing in the park", Dominic Cummings said in a book presentation on Friday. "We enjoy it. We will retire (from the EU) and we will win".
Johnson had attacked Brexit's opponents in Parliament in the past few days and called them "trafficking" on the people, accusations that he could put the Members at risk because they could be targeted at killings, he turned down as "humbug".
Cummings said that the only way to restore peace was if the British Members would finally respect the decision to withdraw from the EU, and it was not surprising that people were concerned that Britain was still not leaving the EU three years after the referendum.
In view of the above-mentioned mood, even on Friday the bishops of the Anglican Church called for restraint. "We should speak with respect," it said in a statement. "And we should also listen".
Pakistan Prime Minister Khan calls for non-interventions in Kashmir
With an emotional appeal, Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan again called on the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir conflict in his first appearance before the UN meeting.
Otherwise, a new war was likely between the nuclear powers of Pakistan and India, Khan said on Friday at the UN General Assembly in New York. "If this is bad, hope for the best, but be prepared for the worst." The United Nations had a responsibility for Kashmir. "You should have prevented it."
India and Pakistan have led three wars since their independence from British colonial rule in 1947, two of which are divided into the Kashmir region. Both nuclear powers each dominate part of Kashmir, another part of which belongs to China. At the beginning of August India had withdrawn its autonomous status and thus increased tensions in relation to Pakistan.
Not even a bottle of water
The demonstrators in Cairo call for the overthrow of Egyptian President al-Sisi.
Against the current protests in Egypt, the government reacts with a hard hand. It is able to shoot a sharp ammo on the population, over 2000 prisoners are sent to prisons to the 60,000 political prisoners who are already there. Protests were never dangerous in Egypt. However, since the takeover of General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in 2013, the state apparatus has done everything to avoid a scenario such as the times of the Arab Spring.
But one of the triggers for the protests in 2011 was the bad economic situation. Poverty, inconsistency and the feeling of being stifled by its own government drove millions to the streets. And this is a problem that also does not get the regime of el-Sisi in the grip, no matter how hard it is against opponents. The situation has even worsened.
Today every third person lives in Egypt below the poverty line. Since 2016 the currency has lost more than half of its value, the inflation rate is ten percent. Whoever wants to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket has to decide who he is funding: Nestlé, Coca-Cola or the military. The latter is not only responsible for the oppression but also the largest economic actor. The military builds streets, houses, football stadiums, produces food and much more. It was already before el-Sisi. With authoritarian regimes the Egyptian people have much experience, even the dilemma in the supermarket is an old one. Critically, when large parts of the population have difficulties getting rid of a bottle of water.
Tüv tests in the terminal: BER-Chief: No more showstopper for main city airports
Two months have been tested whether the complex plant environment works in combination with BER fire protection. The operators are satisfied with the course. However, the tube is not finished at BER.
Following major Tüv tests in the terminal of the future capital airport, the operators confirmed the planned opening in October next year. This is certain, Supervisor's chief Rainer Bretschneider said after a meeting of the Board of Control.
The airport chief Engelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke of a successful completion of the test, but also said that there were still shortcomings in the terminal. "We have many detailed themes, but we don't have a real showstopper." He assured that the schedule until the launch still includes buffers.
However, there is evidence that the temporary reserve should no longer be too large. The construction completion notice is now to be submitted to the construction office during the first quarter of 2020, which was planned for this fall at the beginning of the year.
Hundreds of faulty power cables are still to be fixed; the tüv wants to check them until February. "To create the conditions for taking up the flight operation here, it is still necessary to work intensively on the processing of the defect," it said in a written statement.
Lütke Daldrup said that in many cases it is missing evidence, less for new cables. There is still no release for all dubles on which the cables hang. The airport manager expects this to be available by the end of the year.
In addition, fire protection is still not satisfactory at the crossing to the train station under the terminal. The problems had already led the project to another crisis three years ago. This time it is about smoking cuts that are going down in a fire like a canvas wall so that the smoke does not spread. They are going too far down. 36 engines therefore need to be replaced. Then there should be new attempts at hot gas smoke at the beginning of the year.
Problems with fire protection and other trees as well as planning errors have delayed the opening of the airport for years. Originally, it should be operational in 2011. The costs increased from two billion since the beginning of 2006 to about 6.5 billion euros for the opening next year.
Since the passenger numbers in Berlin have increased significantly since then, the managers plan to expand the airport. Therefore, it is expected to take place at a special meeting of the Supervisory Board on 18 October, as announced by the president of Bretschneider.
The airport company is now looking for two new managers. Financier Heike Fölster is changing to the German Railway at the end of the year, personal chief Manfred Bobke-von Camen is going to rent next year, as Bretschneider said. He thanked Fölster.
Chemnitz: Automated for Drugs - Police take over
He needed money for drugs - and hunted several machines in the Chemnitz city area for that! Now the offender is finally in jail!
In the past two years, the number of splintered cigarette and parking machines in Chemnitz and the region has increased greatly. A million damage has occurred!
After two detonations at the end of May, the police arrested a 33-year-old German on the streets of Burger and on the streets of Further in Chemnitz.
Police spokesperson Andrzej Rydzik: "In the course of the investigations of explosive explosions in Tathene together with a particularly serious case of theft conducted by the Chemnitz criminal police, this suspicion was not only confirmed against the 33-year-olds".
Faced with the new evidence, the 33-year-old Chemnitzer now had eight acts in total.
The police spokesperson said, "With the bag he apparently financed his addiction to obesity."The bomb only jumped four times between 20 August 2018 and 31 May 2019 on the streets of Burger.
The total damage caused is at least EUR 60,000!
The automatic bomber is now under investigation. Police investigation continues against him.
He was also responsible for further automatic bursts in Chemnitz and adjacent country circles.
AUA takes over Eurowings flights from Vienna
The Lufthansa Group is tightening its strategy for Vienna Airport. In the middle of the price struggle with cheap flights such as Lauda, Wizz Air, EasyJet and Level, Lufthansa's daughter AUA "the commercial control of all Eurowings flights from Vienna" confirmed on Friday a press spokesman of Austrian Airlines against the APA. Previously, "AviationNetOnline" reported about this.
The Vienna base of the Eurowings Lufthansa Airport will be de facto dissolved. Four of the current seven Eurowings aircraft will remain in Vienna. This will take over the AUA from January 2020 in the "Wetlease", including Eurowings staff. Three Eurowings jets will be stationed in Salzburg to fly from Salzburg and Innsbruck as charter machines to holiday destinations.
The Eurowings base in Vienna will be integrated into the AUA crossroads and network planning, the speaker explained. The flight times are intended to be tuned to connecting flights. The aim is to strengthen the crossroads of Vienna and to expand the decentralized transport from the federal countries.
As AviationNetOnline writes, Eurowings in Vienna are only "Production Company" for the AUA Group Sisters. Thus, among other things, Barcelona and Rome would be used with AUA flight number, but mainly with Eurowings. The board product should be adapted to those of Austrian Airlines, but the pilots and flight attendants come from Eurowings. Eurowings flying under AUA flight number will not be reported anymore in Terminal 1, but in the same way as AUA in Terminal 3.
At the Vienna airport, a price struggle broke out after Niki-Pleite. The Ryanair daughter Laudamotion announced only on Thursday that the fleet in Vienna should be on 16 planes next summer. The Irish airline sends four Ryanair machines as well as crews to Vienna, also in the so-called "Wetlease", which the union criticised as an environmental structure to the collective agreement.
The campaign by Ryanair Chief Michael O'Leary that Lauda has been overrun for five years was won on Friday by the AUA CEO Andreas Otto: "We remain number one at the location, in five, six or ten years".
Queen-Enkelin Princess Beatrice is engaged
Beatrice, Eugenie, William and Harry: As children the cousins were the best friends. Now the last of the four is married. Beatrice is engaged!
Wonderful news from the British Royals: In the early months of Italy's holiday, Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi (34) was supposed to have held the hand of his friend Princess Beatrice (31).
"We are extremely happy to be able to announce our engagement. We are both so happy to start this adventure together and can hardly expect to be actually married," the couple, who have been together in the official communication since October 2018, said.
And further: "We share so many similar interests and values, and we know that this will help us in the years to come with love and happiness".
Sister Eugenie cut the pictures
The official engagement photos have been published by her sister, Princess Eugenie (29), and also on her Instagram account.

The wedding will take place in 2020. More information about date, location and everything else will be announced in the coming months.
However, it is certain that measuring the number nine of the British thrones and the real estate mogul will be a similar great feast as the wedding of Eugenie on October 12, 2018 with Jack Brooksbank (33).
Study on causes of heart disease
Smoking, overweight, unhealthy nutrition - there are risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. But what really solves a heart failure or a heart attack? Hamburg researchers now want to see the heritage of 9000 healthy and sick people exactly.
Through the analysis of the heritage of 9000 people, Hamburger and Swiss scientists want to discover the causes of heart-circuit diseases in more detail.
The research project was the largest of this kind in the German-speaking area, the University Clinic Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) shared on Friday. The Kühne Foundation supports the project with 12.5 million euros. From Switzerland, the Davos University Clinic, which belongs to the Foundation, participates in the University Hospital Zurich.
Excessive weight, smoking and unhealthy nutrition are among the essential risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Genetic factors determine the risk. But the interaction between genes and external influences is only known, it was called. Now scientists want to compare the total inheritance of 8000 healthy people with the total of 1000 former patients of the university's heart and gum center at the UKE.
Currently, in more than 4000 of the approximately 20,000 relevant human genes, possible disease-induced changes in the DNA - so-called mutations - were known, it was called from the clinic.
The aim of the five-year project is to develop new options for the prevention, detection and treatment of heart rhythm disorders, heart weakness and heart disease. The data could also be used in researching other folk diseases, as Stefan Blankenberg, head of the University of Heart and Gastrointestinal Center. New findings on the interaction between heart and brain, heart and kidney as well as cancer are possible.
The head of the Kühne Foundation, Klaus-Michael Kühne (82), also stressed the firm will to use the data to investigate other diseases. The Kühne Foundation's clinic in Davos deals mainly with allergy. Now a centre for Cardiovascular Precision Medicine is to be established on the medical campus in Hamburg and a professor for bioinformatics. For the purpose of his commitment, the logistics contractor in Switzerland said that he was operated on the open heart three years ago and was very grateful.
The bio samples of healthy participants are derived from Hamburgers who also participate in the Hamburg City Health Study. With 45,000 specimens, according to the clinic, this is the world's largest local health study. In the case of inheritance encryption, strictly respect for the protection of anonymous data, the scientists assured it. It is about a petabyte (1000 terabyte) of data, Holger Moch said from the University Hospital Zurich.
The legacy of a person can be deciphered today, according to UKE within 24 hours. The net cost of research is 1,300 euros. The first generation sequence worldwide, the results of which were published in 2001, has cost several hundred million euros. The study is scheduled to begin on 1 October, by the end of 2020 all 9000 samples should be analysed. The first results are expected this year.
Nigerian Police Frees Hundreds of Untreated Boys
In Nigeria, the police have released more than 300 tortured and abused boys from a Koranic school. According to residents, security forces searched the school in the northern part of the city of Kaduna and discovered the victims, as reported by police spokesman Yakubu Sabo. "The victims were abused. Some of them admitted to being raped by their teachers," said Sabo.
The boys have been detained under the pretext of being taught in the Koran and "obsessed". In fact, their teachers have been detained under "the most reprehensible and inhuman conditions", said Sabo. About a hundred students, including nine-year-olds, have been chained in a small room.
The Koran School has been in keeping with the data for about ten years. Residents would have paid attention to repeated irregularities in the institution. Parents would have been shocked when they were taught about the situation in the Koran school, Sabo said. They had not been aware of the suffering of their children. The operator and six employees were arrested according to the police.
In the predominantly Muslim north of Nigeria, there are many private Korean schools. They often replace the lack of state institutions. People in the region suffer from frequent attacks by armed gangs. According to the UN Refugee Relief Agency, therefore, more than 40,000 people have fled across the border in the neighbouring state of Niger in the last ten months.
Fed and tortured: Nigeria Police Free 400 Children from School
Policemen in a school in northern Nigeria have released almost 400 students from a state of emergency. "Many of them were chained and some had visible injuries that indicated torture," said police spokesman Yakubu Sabo in the city of Kaduna.
There the children were discovered on Thursday after an instruction in an Islamic school. The conditions there were "humanly unworthy". The officials found the school principal and six teachers after the liberation action.
The children, all young, were held in their school as slaves and placed on chains. Some were sexually abused. Television images showed deformed and injured students in a clearly poor health condition.
World Football Election: Further Challenges to Messis and Klops Kör
Invalid signature
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe awarded
With a gala in Milan, the Fifa World Football Association awards the best player, the best player and the best coach of the year. For Lionel Messi it is the sixth honour and thus record.
After explaining that he had never voted in the World Football elections, other countries have rejected the Fifa. Egypt has not been valued - for some reason.
Many of the Fifa's past years have proved to be a backlog: the WM awards, the dubious plans of its President Gianni Infantino, the general behaviour of various corrupt officials. Fifa World Football elections have not so far been in doubt, however, to be out of doubt - if you consider that the qualified national trainers and national team captainships of the member associations often vote according to sympathies rather than objectively.
But after Nicaraguan Captain had already complained that he had not voted at all, there are further concerns: Egypt complains that the votes of national coach Hossam El-Bady and Captain Mohamed Salah have not been taken into account. In fact, they do not appear in the official and publicly available voting review.
The Fifa apologizes for the fact that "the signatures on the ballot forms have been issued in capital letters and therefore have not been valid". The Egyptian association has been contacted several times to clarify the situation - without an answer.
Sudan Trainer also surprised
There is also a call from Sudan regarding the election. While the case is exemplified in the case of Egypt, the Sudanese Federation states that Trainer Zdravko Lugarisic did not agree as it was finally assessed: with Lionel Messi on the spot one, Virgil van Dijk on two and Sadio Mané on three. However, according to Fifa, the vote was taken as well, with signatures and official stamps of the Sudanese Federation.
In his case, it was assumed that the Nicaraguan football club had just voted in his name. In his case, the Nicaraguan football club had voted in his name.
The announcement came from the association on Friday: True, but of course it was no intention. The filled election papers were "unreasonably" with the name and signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaraguan election, said in a communication from the association. However, he chose the second Captain Manuel Rosas. "We take responsibility for the administrative errors," said the statement. Rosas and team coach Henry Duarte, however, had voted for the mission, "just as it is in the official FIFA list".
The other cases are now being examined by the Fifa in an investigation, but it is emphasized that the election process was supervised externally by the consultancy firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers. Lionel Messi will only remain the undisputed winner of the World Football Election - and Jürgen Klopp World Coach of the year.
Ukrainian Affairs: Ranghohe Republicans speak for official investigation
Two high-ranking Republicans spoke openly for an official investigation against US presidents and partners Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important," said the Republican Governor of the United States of Vermont, Phil Scott. "Wherever this comes from, it is determined by the facts found." He wants to know more about the Whistleblower business before taking action. An impeachment procedure can lead to the removal of the President.
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations, which had shown that Trump had repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj in a phone call to investigate the activities of the democratic presidential candidate and former Vice-President Joe Biden in Ukraine. Scott observed Trump Biden "for years".
The Republicans have so far remained critical of Trump because of the Whistleblower affair, only a few of which have been found to be unpleasant. Scott's statements are now the first sign of this in Trump's party. The moderate governor of Virginia had already turned against Trump's policy several times, for example against the unlocking of environmental protection regulations and the tightening of immigration regulations.
As another high-ranking Republican, Charlie Baker, governor of Massachusetts, also spoke out for the investigation. "It is a deeply disturbing situation," Baker said. "The right way and responsibility for the Congress is now to investigate the matter and go to the bottom of it."
Scott and Baker, as governor of the United States, have not formally taken part in the process against Trump, which will be decided on at the Congress. Their statements are therefore particularly symbolical. However, the first senators of the Republicans also expressed themselves critically about the situation. For example, Romney, representing the Utah Federal State in the second Chamber of Parliament, said that the case was "extremely disruptive, deeply disturbing". US media also reports that first cracks appear among the Republicans in the interior.
The affair could be initiated in the opening of an anti-Trump settlement procedure, which the Democrats in the House of Representatives have announced an investigation, and they are proposing to him abuse of power for the purpose of foreign influence for his own political benefit.
There is no precise timetable for the recruitment procedure. With its majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could strive for a so-called impeachment. However, the decision on an actual merger fell in the Senate, where Trump Republicans have the majority. The prospects for success in such a procedure are therefore low. No US President has yet been removed by an impeachment procedure of the Office.
Were torturers on board rockets "Sea Watch"?
Three men were arrested in Sicily, to have raped and murdered in Libyan refugee camps.
The German Captain Carola Rackete (31) was arrested in June, after she had been on board with the rescue ship "Sea Watch 3" and 53 Libyan refugees illegally headed the port of Lampedusa. After fierce protests and international criticism - including by Austrian Federal President Alexander van der Bellen - her house arrest was suspended after a few days by an Italian judge.
Now there are new heavy protests against rockets. Thus, three men whose tortures in Libyan refugee camps could have arrived with the "Sea-Watch 3" in Italy. The suspects were captured in a shooting camp in Messina (Sizile) after migrants had recognized their tormentors in Italy. "We cannot exclude this, but we have not even secured information," said "Sea Watch" speaker Ruben Neubauer of the German Press Agency.
The police said in mid-September that the suspects in the North African country had been raped, tortured and even murdered. It was Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24). "The migrants were systematically harassed and brutalized - through repeated and persistent physical violence," it said in the Communication.
NGOs and aid organisations are now pointing out that they cannot know exactly who is coming on board. "We can't scan who are the people. They are coming without passports," said the New Builder. Torture is one of the main reasons why people are fleeing Libya. It is therefore quite likely that there are also perpetrators on board the ships. "It is therefore very important that this will happen".
Italy's right-wing Interior Minister Matteo Salvini called for an immediate apology from rockets against which aid for illegal immigration is still being found in Italy.
Musk seeks delivery record at Tesla
Tesla-Chief Elon Musk has given his electric car company a strong boost to the stock exchange with the prospect of new record numbers.
"We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," Musk wrote in an e-mail to Tesla employees published by the industry blog "Electrek".
The demand was strong, so that Tesla could book 110,000 orders, it continued to write in Musks. The challenge was to bring the cars to the attention of the public. Tesla had to offer as many resources as possible by the end of the quarter.
Investors felt this: Tesla shares went with a plus of more than six percent out of trade. The price has not been so high since almost four months. In the second quarter Tesla had delivered well 95,000 cars and thus achieved its previous value.
Musk needs record to achieve his high goals. 2019 he wants to deliver 360,000 to 400,000 cars. Six-digit numbers are required for this in the current and coming quarter year. Especially the most affordable Tesla Model 3 is asked, but here are few winnings. Despite the boom, there was last loss.
US budget dispute: Only bridge financing is renewed
The new financial year will begin in the United States on 1 October without a proper budget. On Thursday, the Senate followed the House of Representatives and decided on a transitional financing until 21 November.
Although the US Congress and President Donald Trump agreed in August to increase the spending ceilings for the financial years 2020 and 2021, the United States is once again free of spending plans before the new fiscal year beginning on 1 October. On Thursday, the Senate followed the House of Representatives and decided on a transitional financing (Continuing Resolution, CR) until 21 November. Without such a decision it would have come to an end on Monday afternoon, a partial closure of the Federal Administration. President Trump still has to implement the decision.
Shutdown is down
For the time being, the Federal Administration will be funded at the level and will be in line with the priorities of the spending plans for the financial year to end on Monday 2019. This is because the Congress has not been able to agree on the 12 expenditure laws in due time, which allocates funds to the various departments and authorities. Therefore, the Federal Administration cannot benefit from the new budget year from 1.3 bio. to 1.4 bio.
The Democrats have completed ten of the twelve laws in the representative house where they have completed the majority. However, the expenditure laws reflect the priorities of the Democrats, who have little chance in the Senate dominated by the Republicans. The Senate has also converted ten of the twelve expenditure plans more or less ready, which are hardly majorityable.
The spirits differ mainly on the subject of resource allocation for the area of domestic security and border security. In the Senate, the Republicans are obviously trying to force $12 billion for wall construction, one of the major priorities of President Trump. The Democrats are disturbed by the plans of the wall and their funding, which is actually intended for other military buildings and projects. The battle over wall construction had already been scaled down in December 2018 and had led to a 35-day shutdowndown.
The Spirits Separate in the Wall Construction
It is now unclear how the parties want to get closer to this issue. More likely than an agreement on all twelve expenditure laws in the coming seven weeks is an extension of transitional funding beyond 21 November. Also a shutdown is not excluded.
In the light of the continuing inability of the Congress to agree in time on the twelve expenditure laws, and thus the inherent danger of a shutdown will gain ideas for the automation of the process of popularity. Template S. 1877 to avoid shutdowns would automatically continue to finance the federal administration at the previous year's level, suspend parliamentarians' travel activities and retain their wages until the new annual spending plans are put forward.
France allows artificial fertilization for lesbians and singles
In France, artificial fertilization is also expected to open up to self-living women and lesbians: the Paris National Assembly agreed with a large majority for a government bill, after which all women can obtain in vitro fertilization, so that the demand for anonymous coexistence should increase significantly.
The proposal also needs the approval of the Senate. In the three-day emotional debate, critics in the right camp had warned that many "children without a father" could grow up in the future. The French Bishop's Conference is also against innovation.
The new regulation is the core component of a bioethics law, which Minister of Health Agnès Buzyn defended as "a chance" for society. It is the modern family in which children with only one parent or gay parents are given. According to her, the cost of artificial fertility for all women is to be borne by social insurance.
Prohibiting fertilization with sperm from dead husband
With a brief majority, the National Assembly rejected an amendment that the widow should give access to the sperm of her dead man for artificial fertilization. In Belgium, Spain and the United Kingdom, the artificial fertilization "post-mortem" is allowed. In Germany in the past, there were cases where women were allegedly complaining about the issue of the sperm of a deceased person. The opponents of the coup in Paris argued that such a born child would then carry a "very heavy fate".
On the other hand, numerous members of the Government Party La Republika en Marche (The Republic in Movement, LREM) of President Emmanuel Macron and members of the opposition had spoken out for the artificial fertilization with the sperm of the deceased partner. They stressed that a widow would be "double mourning" if her husband's death did not satisfy her wish.
The initiators of the proposed amendment which has now failed consider it unfair for a widow to bear fruit in the future with the sperm of an unknown person, but not with her own partner.
So far, artificial fertilization in France is only allowed for heterosexual couples who cannot bear children. They must be married or live together for at least two years. Buzyn had already announced in the summer that the motherhood will continue to be prohibited.
In Germany, artificial fertilization is theoretically open to all women - but it is often difficult for single or lesbian couples.
Remuneration for the climate: calls for flight delivery for Unis become louder
There is a lot of flying at the universities, which is why the country is going to have to make a climate transfer there in the future. The principals say they didn't have any money for it. But now they are also under pressure.
Schools should also be restricted when flying. Photo: dpa/Julian Street School
The discussion that took place before the summer break on climate change on flights from universities and universities comes back in swing. After the country-director conference had reacted skeptically to a corresponding advance from the Green-Black Coalition, the plans are now receiving support from universities. In a joint statement, the doctors of six Bath-Württemberg universities and a pedagogical university are calling for compensation for service flights. This is the first step "emergently necessary", at the same time there should be a broad debate on the avoidability of flights, it is said in their opinion. The cabinet decision, originally planned in July, is still on ice, because the CDU has not yet submitted the Green Paper.
Russia re-establishs North Korean fishermen
According to the FSB secret service, the detainees were to fish illegally in Russian waters. Ten days earlier, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. At that time, there was a gunfight between the border guards and the crew. Three Russians and a North Korean were injured, and the fisherman later suffered his serious injuries.
The communist North Korea suffers from a chronic food shortage. North Korean fishermen were thus on their way to Russian high seas. There the Russian Coast Guard operates its own data to protect its marine biological resources patrols.
30,000 inkfish seized
During the re-checks, 30,000 inkfish were discovered and seized on the boats. In addition, the data were seized after three fishing and two motorboats and brought to Nachodka and Posjet at Vladivostok.
The Russian Fisheries Authority did not issue a fishing licence to North Koreans even after complaints by domestic entrepreneurs this year. Thousands of North Korean fishermen have been arrested there for the time being.
The head of the association of Russian fisheries companies in the remote Primorje region, Georgi Martynow, recently also complained about high environmental damage by North Korean fishermen. They were fishing with soft synthetic nets prohibited in Russia. These would also bring small creatures out of the sea. In addition, the nets would simply be removed in the sea where they needed 200 years to be settled.
In the future, only 18,000: USA lowers asylum ceiling
The "most generous nation in history": Donald Trump, here at a meeting with elected police representatives in the White House.
The richest country on earth is facing protection seekers: As confirmed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Washington, the upper limit for the legal access of refugees will be further reduced. In the future, believers and Iraqis will receive particularly threatened asylum.
The U.S. government wants to reduce the historically low threshold for the admission of new refugees again. In the 2020 economic year, which runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, a maximum of 18,000 people are to be left in the country, as the U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs has stated. In the recent year, the limit is still at 30,000 people.
The government of President Donald Trump has drastically reduced the preparedness for protection seekers from all over the world in recent years. Under the previous government of Barack Obama, there had been far higher levels of detention.
The declared upper limit of 18,000 refugees would have been the lowest since the introduction of the United States Refugee Programme in 1980. However, the U.S. Foreign Ministry referred to the United States as "the most merciful and generous nation in history", a formulation that strongly resembles the use of the official US president's language.
A "responsive approach" with refugees aims to ensure that refugees can return to their home countries to help rebuild there, Trump explained. For his hard course in migration policy, he gets a lot of demands from supporters, but there is also massive criticism.
A major point of dispute is the border to Mexico that wants to detach Trump. In order to finance the construction of a border wall, Trump had to rely on national emergency. Whether there is a temporary link between the current measure and the current internal policy developments in the U.S. capital is unclear. Trump is currently under pressure due to the selensky business and a potentially threatening recruitment process.
The U.S. government intends to focus on the admission of two groups of refugees after being represented by the Foreign Office: people who are persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the U.S. military in the country and are thus in danger, as stated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
In particular, the United States wants people from this "north triangle" of Central America to apply for asylum in other countries. Against this background, the United States has only signed with Guatemala and now also with El Salvador and Honduras Migration Agreements to prevent migration at the South American border to Mexico.
Court orders the release of orange-outan from zoo
At the request of the Argentine Justice of the former Buenos Aires Zoo, an orange-outan weaver was transferred to a human affirmary station in the United States. The "Sandra" born in 1986 in Rostocker Zoo was granted the rights of a "non-human person", so it was compulsory to release it. The animal was taken on Thursday night by direct flight to Dallas - not as a passenger, but in the cargo dream, as lawyer Andrés Gil Domínguez explained.
Since the 53 kilograms of heavy human waste has not been able to adapt to life in the wild, it is expected to live in Florida in the future in the free zone of the Center for Great Apes. There are already 21 other oranges and 31 chimps, among them "Bubbles", a former pet of Popstar Michael Jackson. However, before entering Florida, "Sandra" still has to undergo a 40-day quarantine in the Sedgwick County Zoo in Wichita in the U.S. state of Kansas.
"Sandra" spent several years after her birth in Rostock in the former Ruhr-zoo in Gelsenkirchen before she was transferred to Buenos Aires in 1995. The 2014 process of animal protectionists for "Sandras" fundamental rights has contributed to the transformation of the Zoo of Buenos Aires into an ecopark. By 2023, a research and education centre will be created to ensure biodiversity.
Record for Swiss Extreme Mountains: 550 meters in 46 minutes
The extreme mountain climb Dani Arnold is happy with a new house ride in the Italian Alps at almost 3,000 meters high.
Without net, double ground or other aids, the Swiss forced the 550 meters high north wall of the Great Tinnes in a new record time.
Dressed with Jeans, T-Shirt and supported only by absolute freedom of movement, Arnold needed 46 minutes and 30 seconds for the climb. He offered the old best brand for almost 19 minutes.
Arnold is now a record holder in the Free Solo Speed at four of the six most important European northern walls.
Nike benefits from new online marketing strategy
In spite of the trade conflict with China, the US sports product manufacturer Nike has booked a significant gain. Net profit rose to 1.4 billion dollars in the past quarter (almost 1.3 billion euros). This is 25 percent more than in the previous year, as announced by the Group on Tuesday. This is mainly due to the new marketing strategy "Nike Direct", with which the Adidas competitor directly uses its customers online.
Turnovers rose to $10.7 billion in the three-month period until the end of August. The most powerfully added Nike sales figures with a plus of 22 percent in China. Thus, the Beaverton Group in the United States of Oregon also benefited from its approach to address consumers directly via the Internet or smartphone apps.
Financier Andy Champion announced that Nike would pursue the "digital transformation" of the sports product manufacturer with strategic investments and thus expand its competitive advantage. The investors were pleased to respond to the quarterly figures - the shares of the sports product manufacturer increased by more than five percent.
Lifelong stadium ban on racism in Italy
Because of racist comments about football pro Juan Jesus of AS Rome, the association from the Italian capital has imposed a lifelong stadium ban on a fan. The defender Jesus from Brazil was ridiculed by the fan on Instagram. Jesus then published the private news and asked his club to take action. "@officialasroma You already know what to do with such a fan. #NoToracism. proud to be who I am," wrote the 28-year-old who has been playing at AS Rome since 2016.
The association reacted on Thursday. He reported on the account of the fans at Instagram and the police. Furthermore, the Roma supporters should never visit a game of the association again, the club wrote on Twitter.
Racism is a problem in Italian football. Regularly scandalous Italian fans racist fights against black players rivaling teams. "We cannot have any racism in society or in sports. In Italy the situation has not improved, and this is very serious. You have to identify the responsible and throw out of the stadiums," said Fifa President Gianni Infantino on the weekend. The occasion of the speech was racist songs at the first party between Atalanta Bergamo and AC Florence on Sunday.
But there were also discussions about the supporters of Juventus Turin. The Italian authorities now have 38 marginalizing fans of Juventus Turin recordmasters with stadium bans. Four of them are not allowed to enter the stadium for a period of ten years, the police informed them. For the rest, then bans of four to seven years apply.
The fans are involved in ongoing investigations against twelve leaders of Ultra fan groups in the area of Juventus. The twelve are subjected to severe repression, money laundering and private violence. The club had launched the investigations with an ad last year.
The Ultra Leaders are supposed to stick behind the Black Trade with tickets after Italian media reports. They had "militaryly controlled" the ticket trade for the Fancurve and were supposed to have pressured youth employees to get to cheaper maps.
Generation Z: Are they really different from Generation Y?
Millennials are narcissistic, the generation Z is political - all years are considered with gruesome names. If you look more closely, the awards are filled with contradictions. How well do these labels describe the individual life feeling of young people?
"The crabs are coming!" With this call began on September 21, officially at the Gucheng-see in Gaochun, which also announced the opening event of the 19th China Gaochun Gucheng Lake Crab Festival, as announced by the Department of Public Works of the Nanjing-Gaochun District Committee.
Gaochun, which forms the southern exit of Nanjing in Jiangsu Province, is one of the national environmental zones. The city is the first international "Slow City" in China and here is also the Chinese seat of the international "Slow City" movement. The city has ecologically ideal conditions with a mix of "30 percent mountains, 20 percent water areas and 50 percent fields". The great natural environment of Gaochun offers its inhabitants all the conditions to be rich.
In the early 1990s, people in Gaochun have started to develop the cancer industry. In the course of time, the cancer industry has developed into an attractive industry that has provided high income and has become an important part of the economic development of Gaochun. In the past years, Gaochun has been actively involved in the large, ecological and scientific development of the cancer disease as well as in a technically supported cancer disease. And the city has taken care of promoting more efficiency in agriculture and farmers' income.
In recent years, Gaochun has developed a reform to "distribute power, optimize administration and services" and with care the service network for "authorities under a roof, a criminal prosecution team, a network for services, a platform for credit granting". This is why the city wants to optimise the environment for permits, services and development.
Gaochun creates the local benefits by connecting to the southern Jiangsu and the southern Anhui and using the development zone and its position as an international "Slow City" as a sign of dependence on intelligent high-end production companies, companies for biomedical and medical technology, for energy storage and environmental protection, from the cultural and cultural resources of the region of Gaochun, as well as those leading in the "3+2" area. At the same time, Gaochun has promoted the construction of a national, all-area tourism zone and foreign transport sites of national importance. In addition, the ecological and cultural resources of the region of Gaochun have been integrated into the state of Gaochun, the state of the building of Gaochun for tourism and tourism on the basis of tourism and tourism.
Conflict between Iran and USA: Ruhani speaks of the end of the sanctions - Trump contradicts
Iranian President Hassan Ruhani spoke after his return from the UN plenary meeting of an alleged offer by the United States to abolish sanctions.In contrast to talks with the Tehran leadership, Ruhani explained on his official website.
However, President Donald Trump objected to the Iranian counterpart on Twitter: "I wanted Iran to lift the sanctions against it so that there was a meeting. I said, of course, no."
Ruhani describes the event as follows: Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron were present in New York and had insisted that a meeting would take place. "And America says that I am lifting the sanctions," added Ruhani. The type of action that should be completed has been the subject of debate. "And they have clearly said that we are raising all the sanctions."
However, this advance has not been made in an acceptable way, Ruhani criticised. Given the existing criminal measures and "the poisoned atmosphere of the maximum pressure", no one can predict the outcome of negotiations.
At the beginning of the week, Chancellor Angela Merkel met with Ruhani in New York. The hope of the Europeans to save the nuclear agreement negotiated with Russia and China with Iran was that the Islamic Republic should stop developing nuclear weapons. As a result, President Emmanuel Macron of France, as Merkel at the end of the UN plenary meeting, expressed the hope that Ruhani would meet with US President Donald Trump.
Heavy earthquakes near Istanbul - Almost 200 neighbourhoods
After the Western Turkey was terrorized by two earthquakes within a short period of time, fear of a catastrophe grew. 34 people were injured in the earthquake on Tuesday. Since the earthquake on the day of the earthquake there have been almost 200 survivors, Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said on Friday.
14 schools in Istanbul have been closed for security reasons. Hundreds of buildings have been damaged. The earthquake of Strength 5,8 had shaken the Marmara region from Istanbul on Thursday and triggered panic in the millions of metropolis. Now the government wants to set up a commission to prepare the country for earthquakes in the future, Oktay announced.
In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been prepared enough to fight, said Istanbul Mayor Ekram Imagoglu. In the city itself, the latent danger is always ignored. Every year poorly built homes are being destroyed - among other things by the many smaller earthquakes that regularly rock Istanbul.
City planners like the famous architect Mücella Yapici have been warning for years that large open areas that have been registered in the centre as places of refuge have been built for a long time. Only on the 20th day of the Gölcük-Babe in August did the Istanbul Building Engineering Board warn that estimated a million buildings in Istanbul are not safe.
The epicenter of the baby from Thursday was located in the Marmarameer in front of the Silivri district and in about seven kilometers deep, as the disaster protection authority Afad reported. A smaller nest was a few minutes later for even greater panic on the streets.
The Istanbul Mayor, Ekrem Imaoglu, was not reported on Twitter, injured or injured at first. The TRT sent by state showed people who fled from the houses in panic. Students were brought to the Silivri district for security reasons from the buildings. Some students were crying as was seen on images.
Istanbul is considered to be a particularly dangerous earthquake. Below the Marmara Sea is a section of the so-called North Anatolytic Disorder that marks the border between the Eurasian and the Anatolytic Plate. Turkey is constantly being frightened by earthquakes. One of the most deadly was the war in 1999 near Istanbul. At that time more than 17,000 people died.
Researchers fear that an earthquake of 7.1 to 7.4 might threaten. However, when it comes to the earthquake, it is unclear. On Thursday the earthquake hit the west of the country and Istanbul again.
Firms design Emergency plans, so-called Go-Bags have been packed with everything you need to stand next to the door, and schools will help children to learn how to cope when the earth wakes up. When the next great tribulation comes, be unclear.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said after his return from New York that eight people had been injured. Some buildings had suffered slight damage. Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imaoglu persecuted the developments of the Istanbul Disaster Coordination Centre (Akom).
Warning for neighbours in Istanbul
In the social networks, many users report panic. Buildings were awakened. Schools and hospitals were evacuated. Phone lines were interrupted. It was more intense than Tuesday, a user writes. The head of the Turkish Red Half Moon, Kerem Klinik, warned by Twitter before succession. He called on people to stay away from buildings that had suffered visible damage.
The time of the event is given according to official data at 13.59 (location time). Only a few minutes after the first event, according to CNN Turkey, there was a follow-up, which was reported with a strength of 4.0 on the right scale.
Only on Tuesday had an earthquake of strength 4.6 shook the Turkish Marmara region - it was to be felt until Istanbul. Also its epicenter was located in the Marmarame west of the millions metropolis, the disaster protection authority Afad already shared on Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake that made it possible to strike lines on Tuesday: Pakistan was also hit by a serious earthquake.
Researchers assume that sooner or later there could be a catastrophic earthquake in Istanbul - the tension between the tectonic plates is extremely high. Scientists believe that it will ever get rid of it - and massive damage.
Earthquake researcher Sükrü Ersoy estimates that the Earthquake is now a warning. It has become more likely, he said to CNN Turk. "These could be signs of a larger earthquake," says Ersoy to the sender. "Before or after the great earthquake will also come".
A few weeks ago, there had been an incident - the earthquake caused great anxiety even in Istanbul. Moreover, in Albania only a few days ago, there had been a severe earthquake - there were 68 injured. Also at the lake of the lake this year had buried the earth.
Parliament: New Firearms in Ukraine
Two breaking documents provide new firearms in the Ukrainian affair for possible abuse of power by President Donald Trump. On the way to a possible settlement procedure, the US Democrats see themselves strengthened: The complaints submitted by an anonymous notifier about Trump and his controversial phone call with the Ukrainian President raise important points of concern for investigations against the President. Trump himself sees himself once more as a victim of a "Hexenjagd". He also doubted the credibility of the Whistleblower.
United States: United Airlines Flights locked in the toilet - air carriers
Since a passenger was locked in the board toilet, a United Airlines flight was redirected. The WC door was blocked during the 1554 flight from Washington to San Francisco, according to US media.
When an extraordinary intermediate landing on Wednesday (location time) in Denver, the woman was finally able to be released from the narrow cabin. For about an hour she had been detained there, US media wrote calling on other passengers. To continue her flight towards San Francisco, the guests had to change the machine.
In an online video, which is supposed to come from flight 1554 according to US media, is to see how several people are trying to free the woman. "We are working at the moment to open the door, Ma'am. We will get you out soon, okay?" says one man. The airline apologized to all the airlines.
The cake lake: inspired by Kafka: Ian McEwan writes Brexit-Roman
How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with all the Brexit chaos? He writes a book about it - and his protagonist is unrecognizable.
Ian McEwan (71) was inspired by Franz Kafkas' famous story "The Change" by the British success author Ian McEwan (71) written a book about Brexit Chaos in Britain.
The novel "Die Kakerlake" (Original: "The Cockroach") will appear in German on November 27th, the Diogenes publisher (Zurich) told. It is about the conversion of a man named Jim Sams, who was ignored or hated in his earlier life, but now he is once the most powerful man in Britain. He sees it as his mission to implement the will of the people in fact and is determined to leave nothing and nobody behind.
McEwan was quoted as saying: "If Parliament is closed, so that the government cannot be challenged in a critical moment, when ministers are shy as the Soviet leaders once, when Brexiters in high positions are just going through the catastrophe of a no-deal - then a writer has to ask himself what he can do. There is only one answer: write." McEwan was only published in the spring of the novel "Machine Like Me" about artificial intelligence.
Kafkas 1915 was first published story by Gregor Samsa, who wakes up one morning and sees himself "as an unlucky stranger", is excluded from family and society, and finally goes on foot. "Ian McEwan denies himself before Kafka to describe a world that stands head," said the Diogenes publisher.
EU invests €9.5 million in Austrian railway infrastructure
11200 cars in Austria and Hungary receive fluorescent brakes to reduce the noise load through freight trains. In addition, sections of the train connections between Graz and Györ and Wiener Neustadt and Sopron are modernised and electrified.
This is expected to make travel more comfortable and reduce CO2 emissions according to EU authorities.
Thomas Cook: All travels cancelled until October 31st
The German tour operator Thomas Cook cancelled all travel by 31 October 2019 one day after his insolvency request. Travel could not be "not entered for insolvency reasons", the company said on Thursday evening.
Also concerned are bookings by the brands Thomas Cook Signature, Thomas Cook Signature Finest Selection, Neckermann Travel, ÖGER TOOURS, Book Travel and Air Marin, which are already paid or paid in full. As it stands for travel starting on November 1, 2019, the company opened. In agreement with the insolvency insurance, the other procedures will be examined, it said.
Thomas Cook in Germany was a member of the Board of Directors of the British Mother's Group and had applied for insolvency on Wednesday. The company, including Neckermann travels, Öger Tours and Bucher travels, employs about 2000 people in Germany.
Insurance wants to transfer money back to hotels from now on
On the other hand, from this Friday, hotels abroad that are still hosting Thomas-Cook vacationers will receive money from the Zurich insurance. The payments to the hotels are, according to Zurich, linked to the condition that vacationers are no longer invited to extra payments.
Based on booking information and without special invoices, hotels in the resorts are now expected to receive 50 percent of the outstanding payments, as a Zurich speaker of the German Press Agency said. "This applies immediately and subject to the condition that Thomas-Cook travelers from these hotels are not invited from now on for individual payment of hotel invoices or otherwise," said Speaker Bernd England.
The insurance responded to reports of hotel guests who were forced to pay their accommodation on site. Some had to put more than 1000 euros on the table. The German Association of Travelers (DRV) and the Federal Association of Consumer Centres had strongly criticised this.
As many hotels are affected, they will be matched on Friday with the insolvent travel provider, the insurance speaker said. According to Thursday's report, 70,000 Thomas Cook holidaymakers from Germany were on their way. Zurich Germany has secured the vacation and return of Thomas Cook customers.
Insolvency administrators want to try to continue the three Thomas Cook companies in Germany and find a future solution.
However, the now announced payments to hotels by Zurich insurance only help travellers who are still on their way. For Thomas-Cook customers who only want to fly the holiday, it looks bad. On Thursday evening, the company announced that all travels would be cancelled until 31 October. This also applies to bookings that have already been paid.
As it is about travel starting on 1 November 2019, the company left it open. In line with the insolvency insurance, the further procedures are being examined, it said. In principle, insurance is also responsible for these cases. The sale of new travel is stopped. dpa
The company refers to the insurance company Zurich, which can be represented by the company Kaera. Customers could inform themselves on the Kaera website about the options for refunding the travel price and apply their claims via a web form.
Prince Harry destroyed explosives in Angola
For a long time, Prince Harry has continued Lady Diana's commitment. In Africa, he is now moving directly to his mother's tracks.
The British Prince Harry in Angola has burned and destroyed an explosive mine.
Near a British Halo Trust camp near Dirico, he set up a firefight in front of an ongoing TV camera on Friday morning. In a safe distance, the explosives exploded in the Savonneland, without causing any damage. Although the Halo Trust alone destroyed more than 100,000 relics of the bloody conflict in Africa for decades, there are still more than 1,000 mine fields that threaten the population.
On the fifth day of his African journey, Harry wanted to walk directly in the city of Huambo on the tracks of his mother Diana (1961-1997). With the same bomb master who once accompanied his mother, he wanted to go back the way she was going at the time. The images on which Princess Diana went through a spacious mine field had gone around the world. She had also demonstrated support for the Halo Trust.
Harry (35) and his wife Meghan (38) have been on a ten-day African trip since Monday, which began in the South African tourist metropolis of Cape Town.
Stuck Brexit negotiations: the danger of a no-deal remains acute
In fact, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had clearly stated that he would not be guaranteed a third suspension of the Brexit negotiations. But what statements are already eternal in the polarising British. The latest judgment of the Supreme Court in Great Britain floats like a damocles sword over the Blondschoff. His suspension of Parliament to be able to hold its Brexit course until the expiry date was cancelled at the beginning of this week. And a bill passed by Parliament obliges Johnson to effect an extension of bilateral negotiations with the EU until 31 October. However, Johnson had categorically again.
Boris Johnson keeps dealing still possible
However, the pressure does not seem to pass to Johnson. Meanwhile, when visiting a hospital, he indicated that in the event of disagreement by the end of October, he would support an extension of the negotiations:
You know, we're gonna stick to the law.
At the same time, however, we are confident that we will leave the EU by 31 October.
And best with a deal. I'm cautiously optimistic that it fits.
And the time of the Brexit negotiators in Brussels is moderate. About six weeks later, the EU and the British retailers have time to prevent a British withdrawal from the European Union without an agreement. However, the latest talks have not been reached again. An agreement by the end of October seems rather difficult to imagine. If the British Prime Minister does not break the law, a new shift of the date of departure is in force. However, the opposition does not rely on the words of the Prime Minister. She fears that Johnson could somehow implement the Brexit in case of a no-deal.
US authorities: Other deaths by e-cigarettes
The number of deaths related to the use of e-cigarettes in the United States has risen to twelve. Furthermore, there are confirmed and likely injured in 805 in this context. According to a study in the "New England Journal of Medicine", there were already more than 900 victims, about 500 confirmed. The cause of lung damage is still completely unclear. In Europe there is no similar increase in lung damage. The complaints appear to be limited to users in the United States.
The fear of new protests grows in Egypt
The videos of Mohammed Ali were divided into online networks. The construction contractor and actor living in Spain demand a "Volksrevolution". For this Friday he called for further protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the Egyptian military who were accused of corruption and mismanagement. Ali expects mass donations with a million participants in central locations of the country.
The security authorities are alarmed anyway. In the center of Cairo there was already an enhanced police presence. Several subway stations remained closed, roads around the central Tahrir square were blocked. Already in the past days the police had strengthened their street controls and partially searched the phones of pedestrians for news and photos related to the protests.
On 20 September, the demonstrators gathered around Tahrir Square.
Last weekend there were protests in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura with hundreds of participants. One such open protest had not been given in Egypt for years. According to human rights organization Human Rights Watch (HRW), the security forces reacted. Since last week almost 2000 people were arrested. Many of them were randomly arrested - only because they were "for the wrong time in the wrong place", HRW informed legal counsel.
The organization has also criticised the censorship in the North African country. Meanwhile, the government is blocking Cairo websites and online services to stop further protests against al-Sisi. The General has ruled the country since 2013, after he had defeated the democratically elected Islamic President Mohammed Mursi. Thousands of Islamists, government opponents, bloggers and activists have been arrested and partially sentenced in recent years.
"Ocean Change": Inherited Fuchs from Greenland expedition back
The Polarforscher Arved Fuchs returned on Friday from his Greenland expedition. On his arrival at the Hamburg port, he was welcomed by Skipper Boris Herrmann, climate activist Greta Thunberg, who brought the race "Malicia" across the Atlantic.
With a team of scientists, Fuchs had investigated and documented the effects of warming on his ship "Dagmar Aaen" on the coasts of Iceland and Greenland in recent months.
The Fridays for Future Movement was a blessing, said the Polar researcher. For years he waited for the young generation to sign up for word. For decades, it has been known that the earth is warming up. However, many acted as if there were a planet B.
"What happens on the sea is often under public exclusion," said Fuchs. He and his team wanted to inform people about the effects of warming and the flooding of the seas. In the expedition, among other things, was measured with a drone of Greenlandian glacier and fished with nets to microplastics.
For his "fighting for a sustainable and respectful use of the world's seas", the Polar researcher from Bad Bramstedt was awarded the "Seadevcon Maritime Award" during the Hamburg Climate Week. "For all of us who have the survival of the oceans in the heart, Arved Fuchs is a great example," Skipper Boris Herrmann said at the award ceremony. "He is a witness of the changes that have been made in the Arctic over the last decades".
Dear Spaghetti in Rome: Tourists paid 430 euros for nudels
430 Euros for two taller spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant near the Englishsburg in Rome: This seemed to be too much for two Japanese tourists. The bill included 80 Euros of drinking money was paid by the two women, but they posted the removal on Facebook, which triggered hot reactions.
"Such cases are damaging to the sight of Rome. We ask the police to examine the question of whether this is a fraud," asked a speaker from Fedegit, the Association of Travellers in Rome, according to the Roman daily Il Messaggero (Friday Edition).
The Japanese women had not only ordered spaghetti, but also fresh fish, the local owner was justified. However, this is not to be taken from the account. Also a drink of up to 20 percent of the account was normal, the host said.
A call in Ukraine, and everything is broken? U.S. President Donald Trump could actually be confronted with an official removal procedure after the disturbing revelations of the past days, which the Democrats want to examine as soon as possible with their investigation in the House of Representatives - the speech is from weeks to weeks until a decision is taken.
At the beginning of the scandal, it is likely that the phone call with Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj. The proposal of the Whistleblower, which has finally brought the conversation of national security and the US democracy to the public with his complaint, is monstrous: the President has abused the power of his office to instrumentalize the government of another country for an influence on the 2020 election. He has used Ukraine's dependence pressurically and wants to force them to become active against a political opponent.
The core of this project is also to be completed in the currently published co-writing of the conversation with Selenskyj, although it does not give up the full vocabulary. But the phone call of July 25 is only an episode of a much larger story, in which the centre next to Trump is primarily his personal lawyer: Rudy Giuliani.
The story takes its public view in May 2019 when the New York Times of Rudy Giuliani's travel plans are reported to Ukraine. He wants to meet with the newly elected President Selenskyj in Kiev, and the lawyer himself knows very well that his intentions are good. "We don't mix into a choice, we mix into an investigation that we have the right to," he says. He may think it is inappropriate, but "it's nothing illegal". Juliani wants to be prosecuted for investigations in Ukraine for which there is hardly a basis - "because this information would be very, very helpful to my clients and would be helpful to my government."
The lawyer and former New York mayor seem to have been infected with right-wing fantasies that were fixed on Trump's opponent at the 2016 election: Hillary Clinton had conspired with actors in Ukraine, critics said at the time to construct a case for Russia's US polls.
It is precisely the investigations that will be spoken so prominently on the phone with Selenskyj in July. The version of Giulianis and the President says: The former Vice-President and currently successful candidates for the presidential candidacy of the Democrats, Joe Biden, as Ukraine's representative of the Obama government, have urged the release of the then Ukrainian Attorney General, Viktor Schokin, and in order to stop the investigation of the gas company responsible for him, in which his son Hunter Biden was active. By senior, Ukraine has been financially pressured to cover the corrupt machinations of his family.
In fact, the outcome was different. When Joe Biden demanded that the Ukrainian Attorney General be gone, the investigations against the gas company had already been completed, Hunter Biden had never been directly affected. In addition, Schokin was even challenged by deeply corrupt donors, the U.S. government was far from the only Western partner who insisted on his release. In the rest, Obama’s government even explicitly supported the investigations against the company.
Problems with Instagram Facebook and Whatsapp: Social media are down
Users worldwide report massive disturbances with Instagram and Facebook. Thus, especially Germany, Britain and Spain are affected. On the site allesterungen.de, users report that Facebook has not been loading again since 15.30. Instagram also reports the error message that content could not be loaded. Whatsapp also seems to be affected by the disturbance, even if not in the same range.
Instagram and co. more frequently affected by disorders
It is not the first massive disturbance this year. Already in March and July the services were dropped for several hours. And as in previous cases, users also come back to Twitter this time in order to make their angry air.
Polish scientists saved in Antarctica
Three Polish scientists were rescued by the Chilean Air Force from the ice of Antarctica. They were on their way with a hose boat and several miles away from their base when their engine failed. They had luck in the accident - less than an hour needed the Chilean rescue screwdriver for the protection.
Eduardo Mosquera, commander of the 4th Chilean Air Force:
"At 9:30 we received the message, about ten minutes ago we were started, and good 20 minutes later we were over the hose boat."
Poland has been operating on King George Island since 1977 the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station, 19 scientists working there. The frozen researchers were safely brought back to their research station.
Warning: Do NOT charge smartphones without cable
Practical but harmful
Inductive technology via Qi standard is extremely practical, but should not be used.
Last time several new smartphones have come to the market that support wireless charging and sell themselves very well - in front of all the new iPhone-11 models, we would like to call once again a study from the beginning of July into memory. The wireless charging of mobile devices is extremely practical, but not necessarily recommended.
Higher temperature adds battery
Researchers warn of the wireless charging of smartphones. This is according to the University of Warwick's findings, which is extremely harmful for the devices. The reason for this is the significantly larger heat development. If you charge a normal phone per cable, the battery heats up to 27 degrees in three hours. In the case of wireless charging, the researchers have measured the smartphone itself in perfect direction on the charging pad at more than 30 degrees. If the mobile is something next to the coil, the temperature is even higher. In addition, the water volume of the charging pad also rises, which in turn drives the power consumption up.
Capacity and lifetime
According to the researchers, the temperature for battery durability is a crucial factor. As each degree plays a role. When charging with higher temperatures, the battery does not only provide capacity, but also does not last so long. The lifetime of the battery is lower. Therefore, researchers recommend charging the smartphone by cable. Since a battery exchange is always connected to modern smartphones, it should be a helpful tip. Apple has recently even increased the cost of an battery exchange – and even for all iPhones.
Virtual
The technique is extremely comfortable: Simply put the device on a suitable charging path – they are now even installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars – and the battery is loaded without any boring cable salad and exhaust fumes. Since Qi (standing for inductive energy transmission) is a global standard, with the exception of even Apple, there are few restrictions. However, technology should be used only in exceptional cases according to researchers.
Everest Stau photographer: 13 thousands in six months
A Nepali mountain climber has climbed within just six months 13 of the 14 highest mountains in the world. Nirmal Purja (36) reached the peak of Manaslu in Nepal and thus established a record, his expedition organizer shared with him.
The former soldier wants to climb all 14 thousand in seven months. Purja calls his project "Mission Possible". He has already made international battle lines: from him comes a photo of mountain climbers who are on Mount Everest snakes, which is in the spring.
The picture of the mass decline triggered a debate on stronger security measures on the 8848 metres high mountain and the highest peaks of the earth. Within a few days eleven climbers died in May.
A problem for Purja could become the increase of the 14th millennium: Chinese authorities are currently blocking the Xixabangma mountain in Tibet. The reason for this is called bad weather. At the beginning of the week, Purja wrote on Twitter that Nepal's government wants to talk to China to allow him to rise.
Four dead elephants discovered in Sri Lanka
Among the dead animals was also a portable elephant cow, a police spokesman said on Friday. "We suspect the elephants were poisoned".
The four Cadators were found in a protected area near the famous and visited by many tourists earlier rock fortress Sigiriya. According to the police spokesman, the animals were probably between 15 and 25 years old. An autopsy was arranged to determine the cause of death.
On Sri Lanka, almost 200 elephants are killed every year. The perpetrators are often farmers who had previously kept the animals harmless. At the same time, about 50 elephants are killed each year. This is usually the case when the animals move near their habitat.
According to estimates in Sri Lanka, only about 7,000 elephants live. The death penalty is theoretically the result.
Detained British oil tanker leaves Iran
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" left the port city of Bandar Abbas more than two months after its establishment by Iran. According to the IRNA news agency, Bandar Abbas was known to the seafaring office. The Iranian revolutionary gardens had established the tanker flying the British flag on 19 July under the pretext of disregarding the provisions of the law of the sea in the Persian Gulf.
Management of Thomas Cook in the Critics
The responsible Economic Committee of the Sub-House intends to examine the Board of Travellers Thomas Cook in a comprehensive way. It is also intended to deal with the Board's payroll as well as with the question why the British government did not want to provide financial support to the companies struggling for survival. "Our interest in supervision in the company is as much as in the control of external auditors," said Committee Chairman Rachel Reeves in London. "We obviously have to do it with a bad example of management."
According to experts, genes are overestimated at the risk of bowel cancer
The role of genes in the family increased risk of bowel cancer has thus far been overestimated. In this conclusion, researchers from the German Cancer Research Centre (DKFZ) Heidelberg come into a current study. Other risk factors such as family eating habits are therefore likely to weigh harder than ever. This has had consequences for calculations of the individual risk of bowel cancer, the DKFZ scientists stress.
Elon Musk lets Tesla shares rise
This was written by Musk in an e-mail to Tesla employees published by the industry blog "Electrek". The demand is strong, so that Tesla can book 110'000 orders, it goes on to write in Musks.
The challenge is to bring the cars to the attention of the public. Tesla has to offer as many resources as possible by the end of the quarter.
Investors felt the information: Tesla shares went off with a plus of more than six percent of the trade. The price has not been so strong since almost four months. In the second quarter Tesla had delivered well 95,000 cars and thus reached its previous best value.
Musk needs a record to achieve its high goals. 2019 he wants to deliver 360'000 to 400'000 cars. For this, six-digit numbers have to be delivered in the current and coming quarter year. Above all, the most affordable Tesla Model 3 is asked, but here are few winnings. Despite the boom, there was last loss.
Will British government enforce Brexit law? Johnson withholding
The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is concerned about whether he is looking for an irregular Brexit law to be transposed by Parliament.
The law stipulates that the government must apply for a shift of the deadline, should not have reached an agreement with the EU by mid-October. Johnson criticises this as "capitulation law", which makes negotiations with the EU difficult.
On Thursday, British Prime Minister John Major expressed his suspicion that Johnson could try to use "political Shikane" to enforce the law. Johnson could put in place a procedure which would move the law into force at the time after EU withdrawal.
Johnson said he was seeking a treaty with the European Union. "We are confident to leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is with an agreement".
Iran's apparently leading uranium enrichment high
Iran's President Hassan Rohani has raised pressure on the European Contracting Parties in the fight against the rescue of the historic nuclear agreement. "Unfortunately, European states show incompetence or lack of willingness when it comes to concrete actions," Rohani said at a press conference on Thursday at the edge of the United Nations General Assembly in New York. In the event that they do not stand up to their promises, he set out "more steps" from the agreements of the difficult negotiated agreement of 2015.
The background is the conflict with the international agreement to prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb, which, as a counter-performance, includes the commitment to normalise economic relations. In 2018, the United States stepped out of the agreement to force Iran to change its course in the aggressively-considered Middle East policy. President Donald Trump's government wants to negotiate a new agreement with tougher demands and is now re-appropriate to severe sanctions against Tehran. Iran has recently responded to this with a re-introduction of the limited uranium enrichment contained in the Treaty.
The International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic has now been using or at least prepared for use with uranium as well as using centrifuges installed at the beginning of September. According to IAEA, Iran is also preparing for the construction of more than 300 additional centrifuges.
Perhaps the Europeans are not prepared to carry their share of the deal and therefore left the Iranians alone with the cost and burden of pressing US sanctions. However, there will be further talks that hopefully lead to a solution.
Rohani continues to argue Iran's development in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, after an attack on an important oil plant in Saudi Arabia in mid-September, the community changed: Germany, France and the United Kingdom followed the US estimate Monday that Tehran is responsible for the attack. Initially, the Huthi rebels supported by Iran in Yemen were known for the attack, however, as a false confession by the United States. "We have nothing to do with it," Rohani confirmed his position on Wednesday.
"Those who raise such charges must present evidence of this," said Rohani. The European leaders in the talks with him during the UN General debate had not been able to do so. Instead, they had only called on the rebels in Yemen to carry out an attack like this. Rohani had met with Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson in the past days.
Prior to possible talks with US President Trump, the extensive sanctions of the US administration had to be lifted, Rohani demanded. He urged the government in Washington to turn to a policy of "dialogue and Reason".
Comet by Other Star Crossing Solar System
Astronomers are currently observing a comet from the depths of the universe. This happened only once before. The comet allows feedback on other solar systems.
What was at first only a suspicion is now confirmed: An interstellar guest crosses through our solar system. The comet from the depths of space was baptized after its discovery on 2I/Borisov and has aroused the interest of astronomers around the world.
The widely traveled comet was discovered on 30 August by amateur astronomer Gennadi Borissow at the Margo Observatory in Crimea - with a self-contained telescope of 65 centimeters diameter. Observations from various observatories not only confirmed that it was an unknown comet, but also showed that it was not from our solar system.
2I/Borisov is only the second interstellar object seen after 1I/'Oumuamua from 2017 that was seen during a journey of our solar system.
2I/Borisov offers astronomers the rare chance to get insights into a strange solar system before it disappears on ever-see. First observations show that the interstellar comet resembles those of our own system, as reported by the Canadian Astrophysics Institute. "The current speed of the comet is high, approximately 150,000 kilometers per hour, which is in this distance clearly above the typical speeds of objects that surround the sun," reported David Farnocchia of the U.S. Space Agency NASA in a communication.
The comet is according to the analysis on a so-called hyperbelway that takes it out of our system - and clearly interstellar origin, as reported by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). It is also responsible for the designation and categorization of celestial bodies. In honor of its discoverer, the interstellar swivel star, which was first led under the catalogue number C/2019 Q4, was named 2I/Borisov, and the first part of the name indicates that it is the second interstellar object discovered in our solar system.
Astronomers are happy: In contrast to 1I/'Oumaumaa 2I/Borisov was already seen in the flight. Thus the researchers remain many months for research. "The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and will still be seen with medium-sized telescopes by April 2020," Farnocchia explained. "Then it will only be observed with larger, professional telescopes by October 2020".
Several observatories have already taken the visitor into the viewer. Thus, a team of Karen Meech from the University of Hawaii, which had already led the characterization of 1I/'Oumaumaa, determined in a first study the diameter of the sky object at 2 to 16 kilometers. Recordings of the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii show a clear wave of comets.
Researchers and researchers at the Canadian Astrophysics Institute (IAC) have already won a first so-called spectrum of the interstellar weaving star, which offers a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition. "The spectrum of this object resembles such comets of our solar system and indicates that their composition must be similar," reported IAC researcher Julia de León. This observation adds that comets could be formed in other solar systems through similar processes as in ours, complemented by León's colleague Javier Licandro.
The discovery of two interstellar visitors within only two years, according to the IAU estimate, indicates that these objects could open a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems. However, as often as such spot visits are, it is still difficult to estimate. One of the next interstellar visitors could possibly capture a planned satellite mission from the European space agency Esa.
By 2028, the agency intends to station the three-part space probe "Comet Interceptor" on a waiting position in 1.5 million kilometres from the ground. It is intended to be located either on an unaffected fresh comet from our own solar system or on an interstellar visitor such as 1I/'Oumaumama.
First landing on Beijing's new Mega-Airport Daxing
On the date of the 70th anniversary of the People's Republic, it is as follows: At the new Mega Airport in the south of the Chinese capital, a first Chinese United Airlines passenger car is landed, a special honor for Captain and Crew.
By 2022, around 45 million passengers were to be disbanded annually at the new airport, then by 2025 there were already 72 million. China's President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion expensive project. China's latest prestigious project is also called "Seestern" because of its six-story building structure.
The complex has four starting and land trains to be extended to seven later and is equipped with the world's largest automatic air traffic management system. A new subway transports passengers in just 20 minutes to the city centre of Beijing.
During the construction, the Chinese had reported several times that Berlin could learn from Beijing. The opening of the main city airport in Germany, which has been in the building since 2006, has been a much smaller one. On the other hand, in Beijing, a first passenger machine was established after four years.
New overcrowded aircraft will fly 2030: In four and a half hours from London to Sydney
From London to Sydney in just four and a half hours - the UK Space Agency dreamt of it. It is possible to make this, a special drive (Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre), developed by the company Reaction Engines from Oxfordshire, the US broadcaster CNN quoted the agency as saying: "This is the technology that could definitely be feasible," said Agent Graham Turnock to the broadcaster. "We are talking about the 2030s for the deployment, and the work has already been very advanced."
In order to advance the project, the British space agency wants to work closely with the Australian. A flight from the British capital to the Australian metropolis now takes about 20 hours. As the only overcrowding aircraft for passenger transport, the Concorde had covered the New York-Paris route from 1976 to 2003 and used three to three and a half hours for this purpose. In 2000, an accident occurred at the start of a Concorde at the Paris airport Charles de Gaulle, where all 109 Insas came to life. Last year, the US airline pilot Lockheed Martin announced plans, together with the US Space Authority NASA, to develop a overcrowding aircraft, the "X Plane". Virgin has also developed such developments.
"Sabre will make the world smaller with its high-speed point-to-point transport," Reaction Engines writes on his homepage, among other things. The Sabre drive could be used for efficient journeys with a speed of Mach 5 - which means five times as fast as the sound. Furthermore, such aircraft are also usable outside the Earth's atmosphere and thus allow the "next generation of truly reuseable frame-driving devices".
Emergency in Washington: Trump wants to detect anonymous pointers in Ukraine business
In the Ukrainian affair of possible abuse of power by the President of the United States, Donald Trump wants to detect possible hidden places in the White House.
"I want to know who gave the Whistleblower the information," Trump said on Thursday in front of employees of the U.S. Embassy in New York. The person concerned was almost "a spy" and had been treated with such things in the past as "a little different" than today.
This was seen as an attempted intimidation against a tipper. In fact, the event was not public. However, on Friday, several U.S. media distributed audio media from the audience. Democrats responded to the President's statement.
The Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives had announced preparations for an official trial against Trump on Tuesday. Their allegations were based primarily on the written complaints of an anonymous secret service employee who raised serious charges against Trump and its government headquarters. On a large public press release, the signs of the notifier were made public on Thursday.
As part of his work, the Whistleblower wanted to receive information from several government employees, according to which the U.S. President "uses the power of his office", to achieve that another country would join in his favour in the US election 2020.
In the centre of the project is a controversial phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj at the end of July, in which Trump encouraged his colleagues to investigate which might harm his political rival Joe Biden. It is about earlier business of Biden's son Hunter in Ukraine and alleged efforts to protect his praise from Ukrainian justice. Bien is in the race for the democratic presidential candidate for the 2020 election.
The Whistleblower accused the White House with a view to the Ukrainian phone also of the confusion: leading government employees would have tried to keep the exact wording of the conversation under the cover. As usual an electronic voice protocol has been produced. This was after the discussion on the instructions of lawyers from the White House but was removed from a database that was usually provided for and instead saved in a specially protected system. Only a large conversation protocol has been published so far.
The identity of the notifier is not known to the public. The "New York Times" reported that it was to be an employee of the CIA's foreign intelligence service.
Trump once again questioned the credibility of the source on Friday. In a series of tweets on the subject, the president wrote, among other things, the "so-called Whistleblower" has distributed information from a second hand that had appeared as irrelevant. Therefore, there may be no tipper or spy.
As Trump expressed himself in New York about those who were supposed to have played the Whistleblower information, however, triggered excitement. The president of the U.S. House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, reacted anxiously and complained that Trump's statement once again undermined the integrity of the government.
In the House of Representatives, several investigations have been carried out in various committees against Trump and its environment for months. Given the Ukrainian proposals, the Democrats are now conducting new-growth investigations in order to initiate a possible recruitment procedure against Trump.
"The Whistleblower has given us a driving plan for our investigation," said the Chief of the Secret Service Committee in the House of Representatives, Adam Ship. Trump attacked a ship sharply, threw him a wrong representation of the things and demanded the committee president's resignation again. Trump ridiculed the ship regularly and had already demanded his withdrawal months ago.
More than 300 former U.S. government officials from the security and foreign policy field, which were mostly under democratic but also under republican presidents, followed a statement published on Friday after the investigation initiated by the Democrats for a possible recruitment procedure. If the allegations were to be preserved, it would be "a gross abuse of power" by Trump, it was said.
There is no precise timetable for the next procedure. With its majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could strive for a so-called impeachment procedure. However, the decision on a genuine establishment of office fell in the Senate, where Trump Republicans have the majority. The prospects for success of such a procedure are therefore low. No US President has yet been removed by an impeachment procedure of the Office.
VW Board of Directors: jobs are "likely" depreciated
The plans of the VW brand, in which production will continue to reduce costs, could go to the burden of manufacturing in Germany and Europe. This worry is driving the car manufacturer’s operating council. The brand wants to reduce its annual manufacturing costs of ten billion euros by two billion euros by 2023. Of these, 500 million euros should be saved this year.
A key for this is the personnel costs. The "future pact" negotiated between the company and the company council in 2016 already provides for the reduction of 14,000 jobs in Germany alone by 2020. In principle: A job can only be dismantled when it is almost proved that the related activities are no longer necessary. In addition, employment insurance is applicable until 2029.
As our newspaper has now experienced from business councils, however, jobs in production, which are not really at the disposal of others, are "like" depreciated by another way - i.e. at the official course. Thus, free regular jobs would often not be reoccupied.
In these cases, the Board of Directors has no opportunity to force reinstatement. In the meantime, there are many staff who are failing to take the job sealing to increase their concerns before a moderate exhausting of the vehicles. In order to also increase the fear that vehicle production could be withdrawn from Germany and Europe because it is cheaper in other parts of the world. From VW it was just said: "An adjustment of the employment volume is being made as agreed socially compatible along the demographic curve".
The brand VW wants to further standardise production worldwide and control new projects centrally. It also aims to reduce costs and also speed up decisions - behind it is the goal to increase productivity and thus increase competitiveness. Production CEO Andreas Tostmann said at a Berlin Manager's Conference: "Just in uncertain times from Brexit to the threatening trade war between the USA and China, we are well advised to make ourselves a crisis party".
On this path there are already successes: For example, this year, for example, for the first time since 2013, the production costs per vehicle would fall compared to the previous year. Tostmann told reporters that the production time for the Gulf 8 to be presented in Wolfsburg on 24 October should be reduced by 1.1 hours. Exact figures for the duration of production do not mention VW, according to our newspaper, it is estimated that it will be around 7 at the Gulf.
20 hours.
In our region, the Wolfsburg family plant is the only VW factory in which vehicles are produced. The works of Braunschweig and Salzgitter are manufactured components. For Wolfsburg, VW-internal applies the Faust rule that 800,000 cars must be built there annually so that the work can be profitable. In 2018, however, the discharge in Wolfsburg was only about 700,000 vehicles - due to the decreasing demand for diesel and the problems in converting to the new WLTP consumption and exhaust test procedure.
However, as Tostmann's production manager announced last year, in Wolfsburg, a million cars will be "perspective" from the band. This will allow the merger of golf production in the parent plant - because the Zwickau plant, through the conversion to the location of the E-Auto Production, will provide the golf production.
In addition, the SUV Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) are produced in Wolfsburg. However, the sales figures of Golf and Tiguan have recently declined. Therefore, the expectations are now resting on Golf 8. Despite all efforts to build the E-mobility, the Wolfsburger’s bread and butter car will remain the first.
voodoo forced to prostitution: human traffickers convicted
Young women from Nigeria are dressed with swords, locked in the rue area and forced into prostitution. Six smugglers of human beings have to go to prison for this.
Six wrongful human traffickers from Nigeria were sentenced on Friday in Bochum to conviction and imprisonment for up to eight years and three months. The accused had locked young women from Nigeria into the rue area and forced them to prostitution. In order to enforce their obedience, the volunteers of Nigeria still had to lay a ritual burden in their home in front of a voodoo priest.
The victims were between 17 and 22 years of age. With the help of Libyan lockers, they were brought over to the Mediterranean. However, the dream of a better future did not come true. In Germany, they were distributed on different boards to cover the alleged locker costs of an average of EUR 25,000.
The accused - four men and two women - had admitted the inclusion and subsequent distribution of the young Nigerians to Bordelle in the process. "The work made it difficult for the women to create physically and mentally," said Judge Isabel Hoffmann at the hearing. "Some were rightly directed."
The judgments are based on the commercial and gang-related inclusion of foreigners, trafficking in human beings, bribery and heavy forced prostitution.
Ufo calls for negotiations with Lufthansa
Fim Permanent Dispute with the Lufthansa Group has again threatened Ufo with strikes.
If the company does not return to the negotiating table, the trade union "will inform the LH Group on 14 October about the anti-fraud measures", said Ufo tariff manager Daniel Flohr on Friday. Lufthansa and her daughter Eurowings have for months refused to negotiate tariffs with the Ufo. It is also about whether the trade union has legally announced tariff agreements with Lufthansa.
At this point, Ufo now sees himself strengthened after a decision by the Labour Court of Frankfurt. Lufthansa wanted to see that the tariff agreements were not announced. The court rejected the applications. The company confirmed the decision and examined the application. "That a second court sees the case completely differently, I consider it unlikely," said Ufo-Chairman Flöhr.
Lufthansa also submitted an application to the Frankfurt State Labour Court in August to review the status of the Ufo as a trade union. The company argued that the trade union has not been using a representative board for months and is therefore unable to fulfil its role as a tariff partner.
Previously, there was a fierce leadership dispute in the Spartan union, with numerous members of the board as well as the consultative council, including the long-standing trade union chief Nicoley Baublees. The Ufo had, because of the doubts about its leadership, put forward an early UFO vote on the strike of the cabinet staff at Eurowings at the end of July.
Easy entry: Saudi Arabia announces new visa system
Until now Saudi Arabia has not been known as an international tourist magnet. But this should change now. The country in the Persian Gulf wants to introduce new visa regulations.
With a new Visa system, Saudi Arabia is going to attract more international tourists in the future. By 2030 the number of international and domestic visitors is going to increase to 100 million per year, the Tourism Commission said.
"The opening of Saudi Arabia to international tourists is a historic moment for our country," said the President of the Tourism Commission, Ahmad Al-Chatib.
Saudi Arabia is still difficult to access for tourists. Visas are usually only for short business trips, religious pilgrimages or visitors with relatives in the desert state. With the new rules, the canned Kingdom expects more revenue from the tourism business. According to its own statement, Riad wants to reduce its dependence on oil trade.
In mid-September, several rockets and drones had hit two of the most important oil installations in eastern Saudi Arabia: the largest oil refinery in the country in Abkaik as well as the oil field Churais. As a result, the national oil production dramatically broke in, the oil prices were up. It should take several weeks until the oil production of the Kingdom again reaches its old level.
Justin and Hailey Bieber stick in preparations for wedding party
Singer Justin Bieber (25) and his wife Hailey (22) prepared for her wedding party. The model posted several party photos in her Instagram stories, on which she is to be seen in the white wedding look. Reality-Star Kendall Jenner (23) and others had organized a boy's cell neighborhood in Los Angeles according to the People magazine.
Justin posted several colorful, e.g. banana prints on Instagram and asked his followers: "Help me choose my smoking for the wedding". According to media reports, the Promi couple wants to marry church next weekend.
The Biebers gave themselves the yes word a year ago in a New York State office. There was no greater party at the time.
In an interview with the Australian Vogue, Hailey recently explained that the two had found a common level after initial problems: "If you don't want to compromise, you can't have a relationship".
Two deaths in the event of plane crash in Czech Republic
Two people died when a small plane was destroyed in western Czech Republic. The wreck was discovered on Friday in a forest area near the city of Mecin (Meschin), the police reported. In the case of the dead it was a 38-year-old woman and a 64-year-old man.
The authorities had been looking for the machine since Thursday evening after the operation had given a signal via GPS. The search was also a military helicopter in use. The source of the accident still needs to be determined. The resort is about 30 kilometres south of Pilsen (Plzen) and 100 kilometres north-east of Regensburg.
Half of European tree species are threatened by extinction
In addition to the damage, there were diseases, alien species, non-sustainable woodpile and the growth of cities Causes of the threat, the World Conservation Union reported IUCN in Brussels on Friday. It has investigated the stocks of all 454 species known in Europe. 265 of them do not occur on any other continent. Of these 265 are threatened 58 percent. 66 are already at the highest level of danger and thus face extinction.
The IUCN divides endangered species into six categories: "potentially endangered" by "dangerous", "strongly endangered", "dangerous from extinction" and "destroyed in nature" to "destroyed". Overall, it lists more than 28,000 species of animals and plants worldwide as endangered.
Eberesche und wilde Roskastanie threatened
In Germany, Eberschen (Sorbus) was threatened primarily, said one of the authors, David Allen, of the German Press Agency. "Most are threatened because the populations are so small or by the conversion or weakening of their living spaces".
It looks bad also for the ordinary Russians. They have been considered "dangerous" since 2017, stage two of the IUCN scale. The biggest threat in addition to a Pils poses the Balkan minima. It has spread throughout the continent since the 1980s of Southeast Europe and has hardly any natural enemies. IUCN estimates the number of wild Russians (Aesculus hippocastanum) in Europe to less than 10,000 copies. Not taken into account in this assessment are the trees in cities, parks and lonely.
Straucharten and Moose also in danger
At the same time, IUCN scientists have created new European Red Lists for leaners, storks and moose. More than one-fifth of the leaners and moose and almost half of all straw charts are at risk, according to IUCN. This is especially true of the destruction of the wild, of the species involved, of agricultural practices and of climate change. Weighers like snakes played a key role in the recycling of nutrients in the soil and are an important source of food for birds and other animals.
"This report shows that the situation is precarious for many overlooked and underestimated species, which form the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet," said Luc Bas, director of the IUCN Office. "We need to limit the impact of man on our ecosystems and make the protection of these species a priority."
Earthquake in front of Istanbul: 34 injured reported
During the recent earthquake in Turkey, 34 people were injured. Death was not reported. dozens of people had to leave their homes, 14 schools in Istanbul had been closed for security reasons, Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said on Friday.
Hundreds of buildings have been damaged. Since the earthquake in the morning there have been almost 200 after the earthquake. The earthquake of the strength of 5,8 had shaken the Marmara region in front of Istanbul on Thursday and caused panic in the millions of metropolis.
Now the government wants to set up a Commission to better prepare the country for earthquakes in the future, Oktay announced. In the past 20 years Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for earthquakes, said Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imaoglu.
Istanbul is particularly at risk of earthquakes. Below the Marmara Sea is a section of the so-called North Anatolic Disorder that marks the boundary between the Eurasian and the Anatolic Plateau.
One of the most severe seizures was one of the 7.6 in 1999 near Istanbul. The epicenter was then located in Golcük in southeast Istanbul. More than 17,000 people died.
Already on Tuesday, an earthquake of strength 4.6 shook the region around Istanbul. The authorities called on the residents to stay away from damaged buildings.
Super Bowl 2020: Jennifer Lopez (JLo) and Shakira take part in the half-time show
The Latin Pop Singers Jennifer Lopez and Shakira are showing the half-time show of the next American football final Super Bowl. This was announced by the singers on Twitter. "Larger won't happen," Shakira wrote to a photo of herself and Lopez. She was crazy to stand on the Super Bowl stage. On February 2, 2020 it will be so far in Miami.
Jennifer Lopez explained that she had dreamed of acting at the Super Bowl since 1996 - at that time she saw Diana Ross flying at the half-time show in the sky. "Now it is even more special because the NFL is 100 years old and I will perform with another Latina." She could hardly expect "to show what we can do on the biggest stage of the world".
Shakira pointed out in a statement that she was honored to stand next to another artist on one of the largest stage in the world and to represent Latinos and Latinas from the United States and the whole world. "And then on my birthday!" The main sponsor of the event wrote on Twitter, except for the first time that the two "kings" were together on a stage.
Shakira comes from Colombia. Jennifer Lopez was born in New York, her parents come from Puerto Rico.
Fight against falling numbers of viewers
The Super Bowl is the highlight of the American Football season. The game and half-time show are among the most seen TV broadcasts in the United States. Even though you have recently dropped viewer numbers: In February this show in the United States attracted the smallest viewer for more than ten years. However, there were still almost one hundred million people on average.
About the half-time show of the last Super Bowl there was an emergency in the front: In the fight about dealing with quarterback Colin Kaepernick last February media reports according to Topstars such as Rihanna, Pink and Cardi B did not appear. Finally, Pop Group Maroon 5 started the half-time show - the critics were not friendly.
Kaepernick, then a quarterback of San Francisco 49ers, had gone to the knees in the 2016/17 NFL games in the National Hymes of Protest Against Police Violence and Rassism. With his protest, Kaepernick triggered a movement, many players took over the gesture. This caused great excitement, U.S. President Donald Trump attacked most African football stars sharply. Kaepernick himself has been free since March 2017 and has not fought any more NFL parties.
Cook-Pleite: Hotels receive money from insurance
Some banks are expected to be valued by Traveller Thomas Cook, according to a press report. High write-offs on outstanding loans and loans are threatened. Credit Suisse is also affected, writes the "Financial Times" in its issue from Friday.
Banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit or Credit Suisse had to make total subscriptions to their books of up to 1.8 billion British pounds (about 2 billion euros), according to the report.
The lenders of loans had to purchase write-offs from 900 million to 1 billion pounds and the lenders between 550 million and 825 million pounds. The amounts actually written should be at the top end of the tapes, one expert said to the sheet.
As the losses of the creditors will eventually prove to be true, after the insolvency procedure has ended. One person close to this procedure did not promise too much hope. For example, the approximately 40 flights of Thomas Cook in Great Britain are "old" and many of the properties are in bad positions. Most money could probably be obtained by selling the airport slots as well as the Thomas Cook brand, it was further said.
Rackets are supposed to have brought uniform killers to Italy
The Sea Watch Captain Carola Rackete may have brought men to Italy who should have tortured and killed people in Libya. "We can't exclude this, but we don't even have certain information about it," said the spokesperson of the Refugee Organisation Sea Watch, Ruben Neubauer, the news agency dpa.
Other migrants would have recognized the three men in Italy. You will be asked to rape, torture and have killed people in Libya. Mutative criminals have been arrested in the detention camp in the Italian Messina. New builders stressed that refugee organisations could not check who they left on their ships. "They come without passports."
Carola Rackete had illegally brought migrants to the port of Lampedusa on June 29 and had taken a ship from the Italian Financial Police. On that day the three suspects were also to arrive there. Against the captain, investigations are under way for aid to illegal immigration.
USA warns federal government against Huawei
The head of the US Internet Office Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, has warned the federal government to trust the Chinese network equipment Huawei.
We believe that the risks are too high," Pai told the trade sheet with a view to building the new 5G mobile network.
China has a "national security law", which required each company "under Chinese law" to comply with the instructions of the security authorities.
The applicable law also prohibits the company from informing third parties about such requests," said the FCC Chief. This makes it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
The Federal Government has now agreed to demand a "confidential declaration" from suppliers.
Berlin wants to first try to control the risks, for example with technical solutions, reports the trade sheet, calling for its own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible. The 5G technology does not consist only of hardware:
Just the software is important to keep the devices up to date. This software consists of billions of program lines that change over time," Pai said.
It is "very difficult to imagine", that a government authority, "no matter where it might be able to check every single update in real time to detect security risks", continues the FCC Chief.
The Huawei Chinese Group offers close contact with the Chinese state apparatus:
The ownership conditions are opaque. The employee company, allegedly belonging to the company, is not necessarily independent of the government," Pai said to the trade sheet.
The U.S. presents findings after which government employees are located within the company. Pai was recently for talks in Berlin to advertise for the U.S. position.
Chemical factory burned in Northern France: schools closed
In the night, residents hear explosions. A giant fire wall illuminates the sky over a North French chemical plant. The fire is destroyed after hours - the cleaning works could now take days.
After a fire in a chemical factory in the northern French city of Rouen on Thursday, the schools and children's cracks in the region remain closed.
In 12 municipalities, the facilities would not open carefully on Friday, the responsible prefecture was informed. The Ministry of the Interior had called on the citizens to stay in buildings as far as possible and not to quit smoking. The injured were not. Farmers and farmers were called to bring their animals inside, to protect their feed, and to set up the harvest first.
The fire could be completely removed on Thursday evening, as the prefecture reported. There is still the risk that after the removal smell will spread, according to the prefecture on Twitter. According to the prefecture, 240 firemen and 90 policemen and gendarmes were in use at the Brandort.
A giant black smoke column was previously raised from the chemical factory. French media reported huge flames and explosions in the factory of Lubrizol, the oil supplement. The production plant is a few kilometres from the city center.
The factory in Normandy is one of the so-called "Sevenso" categories of dangerous sites to be monitored in particular. In the Italian Sevenso near Milan, there was a devastating chemical accident in 1976.
The prefect of the Normandie region, Pierre-André Durand, told the broadcaster BFMTV that there had been no "high toxicity" in samples at first. However, a pollution of its nearby sites could not be excluded. In the river dust dams were built against pollution, the prefecture explained.
The fire broke out early in the morning at 2:40 p.m., the authorities reported. The cause remained unclear at first. Rouen is a regional metropolis and is located at the Seine between Paris and the port city of Le Havre.
French Minister of Finance: "Germany must invest and now"
The French Minister of Economic and Financial Affairs Bruno Le Maire has called on Germany to increase its investment to attract economic growth in the euro area.
Germany must invest and now, the sooner the better," Le Maire said on Thursday evening when presenting the French budget for the coming year.
The euro area economy is slowing down, the Minister warned.
We must not wait until the economic situation deteriorates in order to make the necessary decisions."
Action should be taken by those states which had the budgetary space for more investment, Le Maire said, inter alia, with a view to Germany.
France did not have these playrooms, added the minister and referred to the high government debt of his country. It is more than 98 percent of the gross domestic product. French government debt had to be "stabilized" and "defeated", Le Maire said.
In recent years, more and more calls have been made to Germany from France to make more public investment to revive the European economy.
The French budget presented on Thursday for 2020 provides tax reliefs of more than EUR nine billion for households.
Thus, the French government reacts, among other things, to the protests of the Yellow West movement. The new debt should fall to 2.2 percent, as expected by 3.1 percent this year.
Is he still trying to trick?: Johnson softens question about Brexit tactics
British Prime Minister Johnson criticises the strict "Capitulation Act" adopted by Parliament.
Parliament is back, a law prescribes the British Prime Minister to avoid a chaos brexit, but critics are afraid that Boris Johnson could use another loophole, but to this end the Tory politician is turning off.
The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is concerned about whether he wants to implement an irregular Brexit - despite the legislation that Parliament has recently decided, which should prevent this.
The law stipulates that the government must apply for a shift of the deadline, should not reach an agreement with the EU by mid-October. Johnson criticises this as a "capitulation law", which makes negotiations with the EU difficult.
On Thursday, British Prime Minister John Major expressed his suspicion that Johnson could try to use "political Shikane" to enforce the law. The Prime Minister could use a procedure that shifts the entry into force of the law to the time after EU withdrawal. Johnson said he was seeking a treaty with the European Union. "We are confident to leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is with an agreement."
Johnson's chief adviser Dominic Cummings, meanwhile, explained that he felt the political disagreements about Brexit as a "walking in the park" and expressed confidence that the EU's desired exit would still come: "We will enjoy what we will win, we will abstain (e.g. Red: from the EU), no worry," said Cummings of the British newspaper "Telegraph" in a book presentation.
Cummings, who led the Brexit campaign "Vote Leave" during the 2016 EU referendum, now serves as a leading strategy in the British government's Downing Street. He is going to be behind the uncompromising policy that has led the prime minister into a rather unforgivable situation.
"The Polaroid Diaries" by Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan or Janis Joplin - they all stood in front of Linda McCartney's camera, which has become one of the big rock photographers. But it doesn't always have to be the big glamorous. The photo book "The Polaroid Diaries" (bags) dives deep into the whole private world of the McCartney family.
Paul McCartney, who was married to Linda's death from 1969 to 1998, was apparently proud and touched when he presented the film band "The Polaroid Diaries" in mid-September at Victoria and Albert Museum in London. Among the illustrative guests were Ringo Starr, Stella McCartney, Olivia Harrison, and Pretenders-Front Frau Chrissie Hynde.
After the launch of the event, McCartney wrote at Instagram: "#ThePolaroidDiaries is a volatile sight in the life of an extraordinary family from the time before Instagram, a celebration of the authority of LindaMcCartney as an committed artist and the instant magic of the Polaroid film".
At Linda McCartney, who had studied art history at the University of Aizona until she found it in photography, the camera was always there. Thousands of Polaroids made it, several hundred of which are now published for the first time in "The Polaroid Diaries".
There are portraits, quiet life, landscapes, several hamsters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interiors from the early 70s to the late 90s. "She wanted real moments," writes artist Ekov Eshun in his introduction. And of course there is still one in the middle: your husband Paul - as you may never have seen him before.
Then he dances with his daughter Mary on his shoulders, telephones in the bathroom with a towel on his head or wears unshaped moonboats. Surely, the McCartneys were an exceptional family, but outside the lighthouse on her farm in South England or Scotland, who also lived a very normal life. According to BBC, Mary McCartney said that she had slept as a baby in a bed that her father had built from old potato boxes. And it has not always been cleaned up by McCartneys.
Like hardly any other medium, the Polarid camera takes on the immediate moment. Linda McCartney's recordings are probably a kind of family diary, but they are much more than just snapshots.
It's about the decisive click: you have to find out if a great picture happened before you. And then you have to cut it in the right moment," said Paul McCartney. "If you cut two seconds later or two seconds earlier, it may be a completely different picture." And Linda would have had the gift of always taking the right moment. "She just knew she had it," said Paul in Eshun-Essay.
There the light, the composition, the image cut and the colors that make "The Polaroid Diaries" not only a entertaining picture book for Beatles fans, but also, in addition to all anecdotics, is a great aesthetic pleasure, where landscapes also seem like abstract paintings. The perfect addition to the newly released Beatles album "Abbey Road", which appeared just 50 years ago.
"We will continue to buy oil and gas from Iran"
Turkey wants to import oil and gas from the neighbouring country, despite the US sanctions against Iran. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in an interview published on Friday that Turkey could not cancel the oil and gas imports from Iran.
We will continue to buy our natural gas from there," Erdogan said in New York, where he attended the UN Assembly.
Erdogan, however, claimed that Turkey had problems with imports of Iranian oil, as some companies had "retired due to US threats".
Nevertheless, Turkey "will continue our relations with Iran especially on this and many other issues," said the Turkish President, who had repeatedly criticised the US sanctions against Iran in the past.
Since their departure from the international nuclear agreement with Iran, the United States has been pursuing a policy of "maximum pressure" against the Islamic Republic. According to the United States, Iran has been pursuing a nuclear programme in secret and has not adhered to the agreement.
Their sanctions have led to the collapse of Iranian oil exports and a severe economic crisis in Iran. In recent months, tensions in the Gulf region have increased considerably.
U.S. government wants to restrict the admission of refugees
The U.S. government wants to severely restrict the admission of refugees. The U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated on Thursday that the annual ceiling of a new resettlement programme is currently to be reduced from 30,000 to 18,000 refugees.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that the United States would continue to be committed to supporting refugees. However, the most important task is to protect and serve US citizens.
The U.S. government will focus on the admission of two refugee groups: people who are persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the U.S. military in the country and thus are in danger, as outlined in the statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
In the 1980 programme, refugees from UN warehouses are selected worldwide and re-occupied in the United States. The upper limit of 18,000 refugees for the financial year 2020 would be the lowest in the programme's history. Already the current upper limit of 30,000 is a low value. When the former US President Donald Trump, Barack Obama, left the White House, the figure was almost 85,000.
Aid organizations responded to the announced reduction of the upper limit. "This is a very sad day for America," said the head of the International Rescue Committee David Miliband. The United States would continue to damage its leadership role in protecting the most vulnerable people in the world.
Trump is trying to limit immigration to the United States - legally as illegal - strictly. The US government expects, according to its own data, 350,000 asylum applications for the coming fiscal year. These figures are separated from the new-occupational programme.
Donald Trump - "Come Close to a Spot"
US President Donald Trump has visited the Whistleblower affair of espionage. Anyone who has agreed with the informant who has denied him any abuse of power "comes close to a hospital", said Trump according to a private event on Thursday in New York. This reports several U.S. media in agreement.
So when he was asked about the person who informed Whistleblower about the disputed procedures in the White House, Trump said, "This is coming close to a hospital." Then Trump added, "Do you know what we did in old times when we were drunk? Right. The spies and traitors, we had to deal with it a little differently than we do now."
Observers last commented on a possible appeal to the death penalty. The democrats strongly criticized Trump's statements and threw fear on him. It was also an attempt to prevent a congressional investigation into a possible recruitment procedure against him, the presidents of the Committees for Foreign Affairs, Secret Services and Surveillance in the House of Representatives wrote.
The Whistleblower proposes to the President in a complaint now published to have his office abused in order to ask for another country's integration into the US election 2020. Specifically, his controversial phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart, Wolodymyr Selenskyj, is to be launched in the summer: In the conversation, Trump approached him to investigate his possible democratic challenger Joe Biden and his son Hunter in Ukraine.
It is still unclear who the Whistleblower itself and its informants are. However, as the New York Times reports, the Whistleblower should be an analyst of the CIA's foreign intelligence service.
Refugee boat known: Baby and baby drown in Aegean
People are always trying to get across the Aegean Sea from Turkey to Greece. Often the boats are too small. In the fall of a boat, seven migrants have died, including five children.
In front of the Greek island of Chios, seven migrants were killed during the sinking of a boat. Among the victims, there were also a baby and four other children, reported the Greek Coast Guard. Four children, three women and five men could therefore be saved from the floods by the occupation of a passing ferry.
Among the victims was also supposed to be a locker, reported the local news portal of Chios, Alithia.gr. The migrants had broken up from Turkey in the morning. They had tried to reach the small island group Inouses in the north-east of the island of Chios. Inouses is located between Chios and the Turkish mainland.
Hundreds of migrants from Turkey now move to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean, mostly in many too small boats. Last year, according to the United Nations Refugee Assistance Agency (UNHCR) 174 people were killed on this route.
The Who Breaks Concert
A U.S. concert by Rockband The Who has found a good ending due to the carelessness of lead singer Roger Daltrey. In the middle of the show on Wednesday evening (location time) in Houston, his voice gave up the service. At eight songs Daltrey told the audience: "I think I should leave it as long as it's still running".
Lead guitarist Pete Townsend asked for an apology and added that Daltrey "could not speak right now". The audience promised Townsend to come at a refund concert at his expense.
For Friday in Dallas and for Sunday in Denver, The Who said they should be followed at a later time. The 75-year-old Daltrey and his 74-year-old band colleague Townsend are the only remaining founding members. The British cult band formed 55 years ago.
Rental suddenly set: WeWork lets real estate markets cittre
In New York, WeWork has risen to the largest office meter.
Within a few years, WeWork rises from small startup to driving power on the most expensive real estate markets in the world. But now the company is in crisis. Owners must fear billions of revenue.
The crisis of office tenant WeWork threatens to disrupt the balance on the world's largest real estate markets. The company had set aside Adam Neumann as the head of the company a few days ago, moved the planned stock exchange and started selling subsidiaries and values such as the private jet for the executives to win financial play space for the coming weeks and months. Among other things, WeWork reports on the British "Financial Times", which ended new leases with immediate effect. Thus, among other things, New York and London are the largest office tenants suddenly from the market.
WeWork rents large office areas in the long term and rents them in part of small units in short term to members. This can be individual volunteers, small startups or all departments of large groups. WeWork is still burning money with this business at stunning speed. Last year, the company entered a loss of $1.6 billion, with a sales of $1.8 billion. In this year, the rental costs should only be increased by the rental of new large areas at an estimated $2.5 billion. To reduce the loss, the new management should now have pulled the emergency brakes and the rental of new areas with immediate effect.
According to the Financial Times, WeWork has now concluded leases with periods of up to 15 years, from which commitments of more than 40 billion dollars are due. These huge commitments could not only become a problem for the company itself and its investors, but also for all real estate markets.
According to economist Dan Alpert from the Cornell Law School in New York, WeWork rented in Manhattan, one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world, in the last 24 months almost 300,000 square meters office area. Only WeWorks New Contracts made sure that the demand for offices in New York was larger than the areas that came to the market at the time. Without WeWorks expansion, the office gap in the US metropolis would have increased at this time, as Alpert wrote in the "Business Insider". Similarly, WeWork looks like it is currently operating several dozen offices in a better position.
Even in the UK capital, the balance on the real estate market could shift significantly without further expansion of the aggressive start-up. Among other things, WeWork is the main tenant, a office house purchased by the savings fund provider Deca for almost EUR 100 million in the center of the financial metropolis last year.
Many owners have refurbished their properties for WeWork's requirements with high investments. WeWork is divided in order to make its business model profitable soon, the real estate owners had to write down part of the expected billions of revenues. Access to WeWork's - but hardly - reserves have not been made in spite of long-term leases. As the rental of WeWork's individual locations is usually carried out by extra-founded subsidiaries, so-called Special Purpose Vehicles, for which the parent company only holds tight limits.
Russia has again captured numerous North Korean fishermen
The Russian Coast Guard has again taken action against North Korean fishermen. In the past days, 262 more wilders were arrested who had illegally fished in the waters, according to the Agency Interfax, the Russian Domestic Intelligence Service FSB reported on Friday.
Only ten days ago, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. Before the border guards were shot and three of them were injured. This time there were no injured persons, it was called.
The North Korean fishermen were therefore on their way to Russian high seas. There the Russian Coast Guard carries their own data to protect their marine biological resources patrols. During the re-checks, 30,000 ink fish were discovered. In addition, the data were seized after three fishing and two motorboats and brought to Nachodka and Posjet at Vladivostok. According to the agency, the Coast Guard 2018 identified more than 8,000 violations.
The Russian Fisheries Authority did not issue any fishing licences to the North Koreans even after complaints of domestic entrepreneurs. Thousands of North Korean fishermen have been arrested there for the time being, according to 2019.
The head of the association of Russian fisheries companies in the remote Primorje region, Georgi Martynow, recently also complained about high environmental damage by North Korean fishermen. They were fishing with soft synthetic nets prohibited in Russia. These would also bring small living creatures out of the sea. In addition, the nets would simply be removed in the sea where they needed 200 years to be set up. Even the ships themselves do not comply with the hygiene and technical rules.
According to Moscow, three members of the Russian Coast Guard were injured during the pre-week arrests. Also, an injured North Korean died of his injuries, according to the FSB. On 17 September, Russian border guards first set up a North Korean boat and then a second after it had opened the fire.
United States ban against former President Castro
The United States has imposed bans on former Cuban President Raúl Castro and his children. The U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs founded this in a statement on Thursday with Castro's involvement in " grave human rights violations". As the head of the Communist Party of the Caribbean, he introduced a system in which thousands of Cubans were voluntarily arrested and there were more than 100 political prisoners.
As President of the Armed Forces, the brother of the late revolutionary leader Fidel Castro was also guilty of human rights violations there through the support of President Nicolas Maduro. "The violation of human rights and the use of violence by the Cuban regime to support the former Maduro regime is responsible for the ongoing crises in Cuba and Venezuela," said US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo.
President Donald Trump had pronounced a ban on entry on Wednesday, among others, against members of the Venezuelan government and the military. In Venezuela, for months, he suffered a vicious power struggle between the government and the opposition. The United States has imposed a whole series of sanctions against the Maduros government to force him to his knees and to help the opposition leader and self-appointed interim president Juan Guaidó to power.
Cuba is considered one of the closest allies of Maduros. The socialist Caribbean island receives oil from Venezuela in exchange for services sent to doctors. According to the US and the Venezuelan opposition, Cuba has also sent numerous intelligence agents to Venezuela to help the government suppress government’s opposition.
New Climate Protests by Fridays for Future
A week after the largest international climate protests so far, thousands of people want to go on the road again today for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate week, the Fridays for Future movement plans again to take action and broadcasts in dozens of countries around the world. New Zealand and Australia should begin with the time shift before the protests move across Europe to North America. There, climate activists Greta Thunberg wanted to participate in a major teaching in Canada’s Montreal. Demonstrators also wanted to gather in front of the White House in Washington.
The size of the worldwide demand on this Friday after the record of the previous week is relatively unclear. Thunberg himself was a good thing. "The last Friday has reached over four million people for the climate. This Friday we will do it again!" she wrote on Twitter. Until now, as part of the strike week 6383 actions have been given in 170 countries, she added.
Especially in Germany the Friday last Friday was very large. A good third of all world-wide demonstrators - around 1.4 million - had participated in the protests according to estimates of Fridays for Future in 575 German cities. This time, according to the movement, a list of broadcasts was planned in at least 65 cities. Among them in metropolises such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller towns and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt, people want to go to the streets for the climate.
At the age of 15, Thunberg had sat in front of the Swedish Parliament in August 2018 to encourage politicians in his country to make greater use of climate protection. In the short term, the Fridays-for-future movement was created. In particular, students and students are involved in climate protests, but increasingly scientists and other adults are also involved.
Together, they call for more zeal for politics in the fight against global warming and the threat of climate change. In particular, under the Paris Climate Agreement, global warming has to be measured at less than 1.5 degrees compared to pre-industrial times.
Thunberg arrived just one month after a two-week transatlantic tour with a high-sea reindeer in New York. She had recently participated in climate protests and summits of the United Nations. On Monday, she gave an emotional talk to the United Nations in which she spoke to the Heads of State and Government of the Earth in full confidence. In her home Stockholm, she was invited on Wednesday to use her alternative Nobel Prize for the Right Livehood Foundation.
Russia prohibits smoking on the balcony
The people in Russia will no longer be allowed to smoke on the balcony. This is a change in fire protection. "This applies also to smoking," said a spokesman of the Ministry of Emergency Affairs in Moscow on Thursday. The ban will enter into force on 1 October.
Anyone who smokes, however, must count with a fine of 3,000 rubles (42.46 euros). If the cigarette is to light up a fire, the penalty will fall higher. Under the ban there are also candles burning according to the Ministry. Also there is no permission to grill meat on the balcony.
Attack against cybercriminals - resolver lift server
In the fight against Internet crime, for the first time German investigators have raised a large server provider for illegal business in the darknet.
A total of 13 offenders are suspected of having hosted numerous websites at the Mosel as an operator of a data centre in a former Nato bunker in Traben-Trabach, via the international criminal-acting companies.
This was shared by the Public Prosecutor General in Koblenz. Seven suspects were arrested on Thursday night for a major action. The Darknet is a protected part of the Internet.
Among other things, the users of the world's second-largest Darknet market place for drugs, Wall Street Market, were supposed to have destroyed the investigator in the spring. The attack on 1.25 million telecom routers at the end of November 2016 was managed by a server in the Cyberbunker, according to the General Public Prosecutor.
One such host was first raised in Germany, it said. A web host provides the infrastructure for an Internet presence.
In the access operation with the support of special units such as GSG9, there have been searches in Germany and neighbouring countries. It has been the result of almost five years of research. In the afternoon, researchers want to know more about the details.
New global climate protests by Fridays for Future
A week after the largest international climate protests so far, thousands of people want to go to the streets again for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate week, the Fridays for Future movement is re-planting actions and advertising in dozens of countries around the world.
In Germany protests are planned in at least 65 cities, including metropolises such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller municipalities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt. Climate activist Greta Thunberg wants to participate in a major event in the Canadian Montreal.
Climate protests - Who are Thunberg's rearmen?
The sense of justice and courage are high virtues, even in the 21st century, in a world full of war and smoke factories that warm the climate. More amazing, that a 16-year-old girl calculated to keep the powers of this time in front of her nose. But what is behind it? Is it willingness or smart marketing of a climate activist? Historic masterly performance or manipulative tactics for himself?
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg puts the masses in motion and brings young people up for a better climate-friendly world. It is historically not the first time in Europe that a young man can win a collection of children and young people. Already in 1212 a child named Nikolaus from Cologne has chosen to make a fairer world. At that time he has also been able to win a lot of young people for himself, and this convinces him to cross the sea to get to the famous country, just like Greta Thunberg recently made his way to America with a sailing boat.
But there is a shadow page about this? Why does it need a share called "We don't have time" to save the world? Furthermore, Greta Thunberg has rich PR manager on her side. Besides, her mother published a book that sold itself widely, thanks to the daughter standing in the skylight. Even the elderly followers of Greta Thunberg were a bit upset about the last PR show, or the journey with the boat was probably also too thick. This is also not unfounded, because the action came into the media very well and it flows a lot of money thanks to the impressive action.
The Spirits now separate here: Is it morally right to enrich themselves financially when saving the world? Is it still authentic if certain groups of people are working together with stockbrokers during the world's rescue action? No matter what position is ultimately involved, a critical and reflective point of view is increasingly important in a democratically marked society, because democracy is living from different opinions and discussions. That is why it can make sense to ask questions of certain trends.
Comet discovered: Interstellar guest crossed by our solar system
A foreign comet crosses at the moment of our solar system.
The suspicions of astronomers have confirmed: A foreign comet crosses at the moment of our solar system - it is only the second of its kind.
Garching/Washington - Long the researchers have only suspected it, but now they are confident: A comet from another star crosses at the moment of our solar system. He was baptized after his discoverer 2I/Borisov and employs astronomers worldwide.
2I/Borisov: Comet was discovered by amateur astronomers in Crimea
The so-called body was discovered by an amateur astronomer named Gennadi Borissow on the Crimea. He looked at his first suspicion with a self-contained telescope by heaven and further observations. It is actually an unknown comet that does not come from our solar system. He is only the second of his kind that was seen during the journey.
The great chance for astronomers is now to glimpse insights into a strange solar system. Apparently, the comet resembles those of our own system, as reported by the Astrophysics Institute of the Canary Islands. The comet is, according to the International Astronomical Union (IAC), a clearly interstellar origin and is currently moving on a so-called hyperbelbahn that brings it out of our system.
Comet has already been seen before arrival - and can be observed for several months
But before it is so far, astronomers can observe it in depth. Unlike his predecessor, 2I/Borisov has already been seen in his approach, which means that he can be investigated for many months from Earth. "The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and will still be seen with medium telescopes by April 2020," explains David Farnocchia of the U.S. Space Agency NASA. "Then it will only be observed with larger professional telescopes by October 2020".
The predecessor of the new visitor: 1I/2017 U1 "Oumuamua".
First knowledge about comet 2I/Borisov awaken hopes in science
According to the first findings, the comet is estimated to be 2 to 16 kilometers in diameter. At the same time, the celestial bodies seem to be similar to our comets - because as IAC researcher Julia de León expresses it, the spectrum of the swivel star is similar to ours. This observation draws close to the fact that comets in other solar systems could form through similar processes as in ours, supplemented by Leon's colleague Javier Licandro.
However, the observation goes beyond individual knowledge. The fact that two such objects have already been discovered within just two years allows, under circumstances, a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems.
Asteroids always occupy the researchers. Only recently a giant asteroid passed through the earth and came close to it dangerously.
"Absolutely acquired": Rachel Johnson excited about brother
To Boris Johnson it becomes more lonely. Only his younger brother leaves the cabinet, now his sister speaks clearly of the prime minister's war language as "tasteless". It's not the brother she knows.
"Capitulation", "Betrug", contract": Prime Minister Boris Johnson is still under pressure and is still working on - at least verbally. At Question Time in the basement this Wednesday, it was at the heart of the opposition, and in the meantime other critics have reported themselves: dozens of bishops and his own sister Rachel Johnson.
The well-known journalist and author told the sender Sky News that her brother used words like capitulation, as if the opponents of an EU-outset should be "hanged, dragged, trimmed, beaten, and Springed". She felt this too reprehensible. She did not recognize her brother's version again, said Rachel Johnsons, who had joined the EU-Parliament in the elections for the Anti-Brexit Party "Change UK".
In particular, she said that her brother Jo Cox referred to an EU-friendly deputy who had been murdered a few days before the 2016 Ausits referendum by a neo-Nazi. Their memories could best be honored by passing through Brexit, Boris Johnson had said in the basement. "It is very useless to refer to a deputy who was murdered by someone who called the 'British first'," he now criticized Johnson's sister.
Cox's widow also criticised the Prime Minister. "It makes me sick when Jos Name is used so," he tweeted. The best way to honor her is to be passionate and determined for what you believe - no matter what view you are. But you should never "demonize the other side". He also complained that an atmosphere was created, that the attacks were more likely.
Only a few weeks ago Boris Johnson, younger brother Jo, had laid down his office as State Secretary and his mandate as Tory's deputy. "I was breaking up last month between loyalty to the family and national interest - it is an unresolved tension," Jo Johnson founded the step.
Johnson's language was also strongly criticized in the Church. As the "Times" reports, all 118 bishops and archbishops of the Church of England are criticizing the language that "this country is not worthy of it". In a joint statement they declared: "In the past days, the language, both in debates and outside Parliament, has not been acceptable. We should speak with respect to each other".
Shakira and Jennifer Lopez perform at the Super Bowl
In the year of its 100-year-old existence, the NFL presents a strong sign: in the half-time show of the upcoming Super Bowl, two women with Latino roots appear. They promise "an explosion of fun and energy".
Latina Power at the Super Bowl: The Superstars Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) will deliver the semi-time show at the upcoming finals of the U.S. Football League NFL.
"I feel incredibly honored and humiliated to represent the Latino community in addition to JLo, because it has an incredible strength in the USA," Shakira said in a video.
The final of the American Football League, which celebrates its 100th birthday next year, takes place in Miami on 2 February. In the metropolitan area of South Florida, many people live with Latin American roots. Shakira ("Waka Waka") comes from Colombia, Lopez ("On the Floor") is a Puerto Rican origin.
"I love that the Super Bowl this time puts two women on stage - and two Latinas," Lopez explained. This sends an important message to all Americans and the world. It promises for the show "an explosion of fun and energy".
The 50-year-old was born in New York after her parents had emigrated from Puerto Rico. In the 2000s she landed with songs such as "Waiting For Tonight" or "Let's Get Loud" big hits and later published songs in Spanish. Lopez also works as an actress and has been seen in the drama "Houstlers" in the German cinemas since November.
Shakira was known in Colombia as the star of a telenovela and singer. She created her worldwide breakthrough in 2001 with her first bilingual album and the single "Whenever, Whereever".
The announcement of half-time guests is expected every time in the United States. In this year many value the selection as a political gesture. Finally, the country, not least by President Donald Trump's immigration policy, is deeply divided.
The Super Bowl is the largest US sports event and at the same time a giant advertising show. Artists such as Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Madonna, Bruno Mars and the Rolling Stones took care of Furore. Usually they watch over 100 million TV viewers at the NFL finale, it is also very popular in Germany.
Last year there was political controversy. The reason was the dispute about the quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who had refused to raise himself when playing the national anthem and had been strongly approached by US President Donald Trump. From solidarity with Kaepernick, some musicians had rejected a super-bowl performance - including Rihanna and Pink. That the rock group of Maroon 5 was finally criticised by many.
An actor and YouTube puts Egypt’s ruler: But first, Mohamed Ali stays abroad.
The two men, who influenced the flow of blood back on the streets of Egypt, spent the last week both of them abroad. One of the two swam back on Friday at Cairo Airport. President Abdelfattah al-Sisi returned from the UN General Assembly. In a week, the former General, who arrested the Muslim Brother Mohammed Mursi, the first freely elected head of state of the country, had spent a pleasant time in New York: US President Donald Trump praised Sisis for his actions against political Islam and no change over human rights violations at the Nile - in a week when hundreds of people were arrested in Egypt's security forces, because they had been afraid of "to protest against the presidents of Egypt."
This is what the president of the other man, who is currently determining the events on the streets, is going to be led into confusion. Muhammad Ali, of course, remained abroad, where he withdrew from the access of the security forces who would arrest him immediately when he tried to enter Egyptian soil. Last week the 45-year-old actor was known only to a minority of Egyptians. Today he is the leading voice that dominates the political discourse in the cafés, living rooms and test rooms of the country: With his YouTube channel "Mohamed's secrets", Ali calls on his countrymen to raise himself against Sisi.
He speaks directly and in a completely rustic language. While the people are hungry, the president is starving in luxury and let himself build beautiful new palaces, it is called there. The army leadership on which Sisi is based his government is putting forward Ali corruption and expansion. Because he was doing exactly these business in his second occupation as a construction contractor for 15 years, he seems to know exactly what he is talking about - at least the impression of many Egyptians, as the numbers of those who are just exploding clickers show.
The first time last week, since Sisis's grip on power, thousands of people had demonstrated against his rule, and almost 2000 citizens, including prominent figures from civil society, human rights lawyers and opposition politicians, had been arrested, Ali called for a "million march" this Friday. The fact that so many people would be on the streets was unlikely. But there were several smaller protests, for example in Giseh near Cairo and in the town of China near Luxor. Videos showed protests against Al-Sisi corruption in social media and called for its departure. In the case of these protests, the police also introduced tear gas and rubber shots. These videos were not allowed to be independently verified by the police.
From the city of Mansura in Nildelta, where demonstrators marched banners last week with the President's portrait in pieces, massive police presence was reported on Friday. Security forces built checkpoints in the city and on the highways. In Cairo several subway stations in the city were closed for "maintenance work", most of the streets around the Tahrir Square, the heart of the revolution of 2011, were blocked. And at the Raba Square, where supporters of the defeated Muslim brother Mursi collapsed in 2013 until the army took them under fire and killed up to 800 people, another measure should prevent unsatisfied people from gathering: Sisi future party wanted to count a large stake on the president.
Mohamed Ali called for a change in his tactics: "Our goal must not be the Tahrir Square," said Ali in his video camera in Barcelona. "Let's not meet with police officers." But as a retreat, it is not to be understood: "The whole Egyptian is the Tahrir Square".
When the provider promises too much performance
If the Internet connection seems to be much slower than the provider, there are various possibilities for testing.
If an internet contract is concluded, customers do not need to trust their customers' speed data. Customers can check themselves for how much of it is actually achieved.
Finally, the proposed transfer rates are part of the contract and should therefore be reached, the Consumer Central Bayern explains.
If the connection seems to be much slower than the supplier, there are various possibilities for testing. Thus, the measuring tools of the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) measure the actual data transmission rates and compare them with the contract rate.
"However, the tests by the suppliers are carried out according to specific requirements and are therefore not uniform and objectively calculated," the Consumer Central Bayern suggests.
If the connection is significantly slower than announced, customers can set an appropriate time limit of usually 14 days to produce the promised performance. This will best be done by typing in writing.
If this does not work on multiple calls, customers can cancel and, under the circumstances, also claim damages. However, in the case of lasting success, only the way of complaint will be helpful.
First-class Republicans for Investigation
As the first high-ranking Republican, the Governor of Vermont spoke for an impeachment investigation against US President Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important, yes, and where it comes from is determined by the facts that will be established," said Phil Scott at a press conference on Thursday. He wants to know more about the Whistleblower business before measures - an impeachment procedure can lead to the removal of the president.
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations that Trump repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj in a phone call to investigate the interventions of the democratic presidential candidate and former Vice-President Joe Biden in Ukraine. For Trump observed Biden "for years".
Republikans have so far remained critical of Trump because of the Whistleblower affair; few have been found to be unpleasant. Scott's statements are a first sign of this in Trump's party. Scott, a moderate Republican, has already turned against Trump's policy several times, for example against the lockdown of environmental protection legislation and the tightening of immigration regulations.
Spider-Man stays in MCU: Next Marvel film planned
It was a shock for all Spider-Man fans: At the end of August it was known that Sony and Marvel will be going separate ways in the future. Tom Holland's Spider-Man would therefore no longer be part of the "Avengers" universe. It was completely unclear how it should go with the films around Tom Holland.
Now the surprise: Spider-Man gets another final third film within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) after "Spider-Man: Homecoming" and "Spider-Man: Far From Home". This reports several U.S. media in agreement. Therefore, it is expected that the cinema will be held: The film will start in the United States as of 16 July 2021.
In the magazine "Screenrant", Marvel-Boos Kevin Feige is quoted as saying: "I am glad that Spidey's path is being pursued in the MCU. Me and all of us at the Marvel studios are very pleased that we can work on it ... He is the only superhero with the ability to play in different universes as Sony continues to work on his Spidey verse. You never know what the future will bring".
But how does it come to the sudden good news? Apparently Sony Marvel has to submit an offer. According to industry magazines, the Disney Group, which is also part of Marvel, would participate by 30 percent in the revenues of coming Spider-Man films. However, the message is not confirmed.
This is how Duke Meghan and Prince Harry appear in the "Suits" final
After nine strokes, the series "Suits" in the United States has now arrived at the great finale. In the final result there were many happy endings and also many Cameo performances. And also the royal couple Prince Harry (35) and his Meghan (38), who participated for many years in the series, was beautifully tributed. Attention, the following sections contain Spoilers to the series finale.
One step ahead: Duke Meghan did not return in the final for a final divorce as Rachel Zane, at least not for new scenes. Instead, some retrospectives once again showed the most memorable scenes with today’s Duke. For example, the moments of the failed and happy wedding with Mike or as she welcomed him after his failed imprisonment.
But also her true husband, Prince Harry, was mentioned at the "Suits" final, of course in a wedding scene. When Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman, 49) takes a step towards the altar to marry his fiancée Sheila (Rachael Harris, 51), Harvey Specter (Gabriel Power, 47) makes a multiplicity comment about his attraction. Whether he has actually given up a ghost, the horrified Harvey wants to know from the bride, just to notice nicely: "Louis, you are not the Prince of England."
Eggs: Baby and four other children drown in boat crash
At the center of a refugee boat in the Aegean, a baby and four other children are drunk. In total, seven people died in the accident, as the Greek Coast Guard reported on Friday. The nationalities are still unclear.
The boat fell near the Greek island of Inouses, which lies between the island of Chios and the Turkish mainland. Four children, three women and five men could be saved.
Hundreds of migrants from Turkey now move to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean. Last year, according to the United Nations Refugee Assistance Agency (UNHCR) 174 people died. Federal Minister Horst Seehofer has now announced that both countries want to visit.
Together with his French colleague and the EU Commissioner responsible, he wanted to "inform himself in Turkey about the refugee situation", said Seehofer on Friday. He then wanted to learn more about the "administrative problems of the Greeks" in Athens in order to be able to help with the management.
A spokesperson for the EU Commission confirmed on Friday the planned voyage of seaports with EU Home Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos and French Home Minister Christophe Castaner.
In Greece, there are still unusually many migrants from Turkey. On Tuesday alone 654 people moved to the Greek islands, it was called from the Greek Civil Protection Ministry on Wednesday.
Does the Turkish deal still work?
The increased numbers have raised doubts about the functioning of the EU-Turkey Agreement concluded in 2016, which provides that the EU can send back all refugees and migrants who come illegally across Turkey to the Greek islands. On the contrary, the EU wanted to include a Syrian refugee from Turkey for every Syrian displaced person.
However, the processing of asylum applications is only difficult because of staff shortages on the Greek side. At Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros and Kos, according to the Ministry of Civil Protection, there are almost 29 400 people. The worst is the situation in Lesbos: In a camp with capacity for 650 people, there are currently 5,200 migrants.
Since the entry into force of the EU-Turkey Refugee Pact in March 2016 there have been so many, the state radio reported.
Climate change: Heat leads to more heart attacks
According to physicians, climate change will test the health system in the future. Climate change is "very safe" one of the greatest challenges for the health system in the next 20 to 50 years, said Andreas Zeiher, President of the German Society for Cardiology. Especially the heart cycle system caused high temperatures and high temperature fluctuations within a short time and led to heart attacks. Especially people with heart cycle diseases, older people and diabetics were affected.
Green politician has to answer for a painful photo panel
The chief of the Canadian Greens, Elizabeth May, in the election - was manipulated for this reason by the cup?
The Canadian Green Chief holds a multi-way cup in his hand on a photo. But now he came out: the cup was manipulated.
Ottawa/Canada - It is quite unmarked for a long time - and finally it happened. The reusable coffee cup with metal straw has never been held by Elizabeth May, the head of the Canadian Greens. On the party's website she was to see a photo with this cup, in conversation with citizens. However, the photo was already published and also distributed to the media - and there the cup was still a narrower (Papp) cup, as reported by the Canadian National Post.
Green Chief has to answer for a photo panel
The National Post then released May Manipulation and that the party produced Fake News to appear more credible on the subject of "Environment Protection". And this is in the middle of an election for the sub-house election, in which it is also increasingly difficult for Trudeau because of a standby scandal.
The photo went viral in the social media and called on the discussion about fake news. A user shares a counter-translation of the photos and writes: "The Greens manipulate a photo of their presidents to hide their entrails".
May was shocked and admired on her blog to have nothing to know about this action. To emphasize this, she posted the original: she, in conversation with citizens, had a cup in her hand. However, she put it right, be out of bamboo. She always had it. A speaker of the party said it was only going to put the partyego in the picture, and not to hide something. From the photo on the website is just to see a cut.
May writes, it makes her sad for the employee who did that. "I don't want to call him stupid, but there was nothing to hide," she says to the Guardian, and at the same time she said something about her overworked team: "If they want to edit a picture again, then they couldn't do anything with my face, so I look younger?"
Even the German Greens were shot because of their use of disposable plastics or because of flights in Shitstorms - their images were not photographed. So the head of the Bavarian Greens, Katharina Schulze, ate on vacation ice with plastic bottles, as Mercur.de* reported.
Influencerin wants free upgrade: Long live flight ban at Cathay
Apparently Jaqueline Ng by mail from Cathay Pacific has been granted an upgrade. But when she asked for it at check-in, she was not allowed on board - and she should never fly with Cathay again.
Spontan gets an upgrade for the business class - many of them dream of flying. Sometimes they are lucky, and the employees at check-in offer a change from the economy class for free.
However, this case shows how it should not be done: A self-declared influencer has actively asked for a free upgrade from the Airline Cathay Pacific. On Instagram, Jaqueline Ng followed more than 65,000 users. On May 30, she fled from Taiwan to New York and on June 7th.
On the trip, Jaqueline employees refused an upgrade even though they had shown an email in which they allegedly presented an upgrade to Catay Pacific. The letter wanted to receive the influence of an airline marketing employee. On the other hand, the airline accused Jaqueline of falsifying the mail.
On the return trip, Jaqueline again tried to get an upgrade for the long-distance flight. This time, however, the woman should have shown the same mail with another reference number. The employees at the JFK airport were skeptical: they were at the center. And in fact, the employee, from whom the mail is allegedly from, would have been in contact with Jaqueline. This also confirmed the mail system in which the messages did not appear.
The airlines cancelled Jaqueline's ticket and imposed a lifelong flight ban with Cathay Pacific. For 1,400 US dollars (about 1,280 euros) it was necessary to buy a new ticket to Taiwan.
With her case, the influential woman turned to Elliot Advocacy, a company representing consumer interests. Because Cathay had paid her the price for her original ticket, Jaqueline also claimed the costs for the new ticket.
But as long as Jaqueline does not submit the metadata of the mail, the case remains clear: For Cathay, the influencer has been cheating, it remains locked up for future flights. The operating conditions of the airline also fail to pay for the new flight. Jaqueline does not want to meet - and now activates a lawyer.
Oil prices are reported in Yemen after the report on the ceasefire in Yemen
The oil prices fell by more than one dollar on Friday afternoon. The last price was a barrel (159 litres) of the North Sea variety Brent 61.83 US dollars - about 1.4 percent less than the day before. The price for a barrel of the American species West Texas Intermediate (WTI) fell by 1.3 percent to 55.77 dollars.
The trigger for the course was a report by the Wall Street Journal on a ceasefire in Yemen. Saudi Arabia should have agreed to a ceasefire in four areas.
A drone attack on the oil installations in Saudi Arabia had brought about five percent of the world oil production in mid-September. The Huthi rebels associated with Iran in the country of civil war in Yemen had claimed the attacks for themselves. Saudi Arabia is making Iran responsible as the US government is. A ceasefire would undermine the political tension in the region.
If an agreement is actually in place, you can focus on growth and demand, said Ole Hansen, head of the Department of Nuclear Strategy at the Saxo Bank of the Bloomberg News Agency.
The oil price continues its downward movement over the past few days. A week ago, a barrel of WTI oil had cost up to almost 59 dollars, Brent almost 65 dollars.
Finally, Bloomberg had reported on insider that the repairs to oil installations in Saudi Arabia after the attack in mid-September were faster than expected. Thus, the production volume again reached a volume of eight million barrels per day and moved back towards the original quantity.
Lastly, there were several press releases calling on insiders to report on the rapid progress of the state oil group Saudi Aramco in the repair work. However, raw materials experts pointed out that Saudi Aramco is currently trying to avoid a stock exchange plan and negative strike lines.
At the same time, there was some relaxation in the conflict between Iran and Western countries: the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" is more than two months after the establishment by Iran and the recently granted release on the way to leave the port. The crew is now preparing to depart, while the ship is still in anchor, Reederichef Erik Hånell told the Swedish radio on Friday morning in an SMS.
However, the U.S. announced that the Iranian enemy would be transferred to Saudi Arabia by defence rockets and soldiers. The fear of escalation between the Islamic Republic and countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom had driven the oil prices in the past few weeks to a clear height.
Anti-Tramp Anti-Tramp Intensifies
In the area of possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump, misappropriations against the White House have become loud. Several leading government employees had worked hard to prevent access to the wording of the conversation after a controversial phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selensky at the end of July. This was explained by an anonymous notifier. The spokesperson of the representative house, the Democrat Nancy Pelosi, explicitly told the White House "debate". Trump spoke of a "Hexenjagd".
North Korea holds third summits of Trump and Kim for questioning
North Korea has doubted that in the nuclear dispute there will soon be a third summit of powermaker Kim Jong-un and U.S. President Donald Trump. The sense and prospects of such a meeting for lack of progress in implementing the first summit in Singapore were questionable, said High Diplomat Kim Kye-gwan on Friday, according to the KCNA Agency.
The United States had not done anything to implement the decisions of the summit in the previous year, said the adviser of the North Korean Foreign Ministry. He also criticised tightened US sanctions and the US and South Korea's joint military leadership. However, he hopes for a "wise" and "might" decision of Trump to bring it closer again.
Trump had said on Monday that he only wanted to know what a third summit meeting with Kim was to bring before he made a statement. The negotiations on a disarmament of the North Korean nuclear and missile programme have been on the ground since the failed second summit of Trump and Kim in February in Hanoi. In June, both met in the demilitarized zone between the two Korean states. They agreed to resume the consultations, but still without great success.
Prince Harry: Weapon manufacturers are supposed to help with mine clearance
The British Prince Harry burned and destroyed a bomb in Angola with a blue divider protection vest. Near a British Halo Trust camp near Dirico, he set up the fire circle. In a safe distance, the bomber exploded. With a view to getting free from the goal of Angola by 2025, he later called out to all the countries whose names are on these weapons, but which did not help in the defense, to commit themselves to help.
Pounds under pressure - interest expected
British Pound Sterling
In view of an early increase, the fund loses its value against the euro.
Frankfurt speculations on an early increase in the Bank of England (BoE) add the Pound Sterling. The British currency agreed on Friday up to 0.4 percent to $1.2269.
Sales triggers were statements by Notenbanker Michael Saunders. This led to an increase in conversation, even if a chaotic brexit could be removed, as the insurance would affect the British economy at the time it was in sight. This statement was surprising, since Saunders considered a restrictive monetary policy prosecutor, analyst Ricardo Evangelista of the Brokerhaus Activtrades said.
Last week, the Bank of England had already pointed out the pressures on the economy by Brexit-Hickhack, without signaling a direct increase. Prime Minister Boris Johnson wanted to lead his country without a divorce agreement to 31 October from the EU.
More: With his provocations, the British Prime Minister took a high risk, but it could pay for him, according to commercial editor Kerstin Leitel.
Doping: Show more Russian manipulations
Material from the Moscow Analytical Laboratory is manipulated - this confirms David Howman, former director of the World Anti-Tiping Agency (Wada) and today’s Chief of Integrity of the Light Athletics Association.
In January 2019 the Moscow Doping laboratory finally delivered the required samples from 2012 to 2015 to the World Anti-Tiping Agency (Wada). Now it turned out that they were faked.
In December 2014, the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (Rusada) was systematically banned in Russian sport. During this time, Russian athletes were not completely banned from the world stage. After an individual examination of the 2016 Summer Games in Rio, about 270 athletes from the country were under neutral flag, 168 Russian athletes and athletes were at the beginning of the winter in February 2018. Also in the World Cups, they were allowed to take place in the summer of Russia even the football world with the host.
No Positive Findings
In the following September, the Wada raised the Rusada band again, but called for access to the laboratory and the alleged samples. The data should provide a solution to the extent of the cover of doping cases at the State Doping. They should help to punish athletes and athletes subsequently. Three months later they were delivered.
However, the Chairman of the Independent Integrity Commission (AIU) of the Light Athletics World Association (IAAF) has confirmed that the doping data from the Moscow Analysis Laboratory was manipulated. "Yes. We have received the data nine months ago. We should check that the Task Force has received the correct data," said David Howman in an interview with the "Frankfurter General News" on Friday. "We have detected a number of discrepancies between the data that the Wada has received from a Whistleblower and those that they received from the Russians in January". Many positive findings were missing from the McLaren report.
Not affected by the WM
This confirms the position of the IAAF: The League of Light Athletics maintains as the only organization on the Russian flag. At the World Cup in Doha, 30 Russian athletes start under a neutral flag. They had to prove that they were training outside the Russian system and undergoing tests.
By the beginning of this week, the Wada had already set up manipulations and called on Russia to respond to the projections within three weeks. Russia is now threatening the reincarnation of the Rusada and, in the worst case, also the exclusion of the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo.
