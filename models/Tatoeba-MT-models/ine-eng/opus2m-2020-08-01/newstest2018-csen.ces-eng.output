The civil rights movement issued a travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Advantage of Coloring People (NAACP) has published a warning for colouring people travelling to Missouri on the basis of the State’s discriminatory principles and racist attacks.
‘The travel recommendation of NAACP for the state of Missouri, with effect from 28 August 2017, calls on African-American travellers, visitors and residents of Missouri to pay more attention to the series of racially motivated incidents currently occurring throughout the country when travelling across the country,’ the Association declares.
NAACP stated that this step has been taken on the basis of current laws of the state of Missouri which facilitate the defence of racistly motivated acts before the court, as well as the conduct of criminal proceedings by the authorities which are disproportionately aimed at minorities.
‘There is a violation of civil rights.
People are stopped by police only because of their skin color, are attacked or killed," said Kansas City Star President NAACP for Missouri Rod Chapel.
"We have so far gathered the largest number of complaints."
This is the first warning of its kind issued by the organization for the US.
Among the incidents that the organization was quoting were racially motivated assignments directed towards students of the Black Board at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a black board man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under disputed circumstances at the beginning of this year after gas came on his way across the state and the police put him in jail without charge of committing a crime.
The road recommendation also points to the recent declaration of the highest State representation of Missouri, which states that black-haired drivers have a 75% higher chance of stopping them.
"The purpose of the travel recommendation is to warn people and warn their families, friends and colleagues before what could happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People have to be prepared - they should carry money on any bailout or warn their relatives that they are going to travel the state."
According to the current figures of the FBI programme for reporting hate acts, hundreds of cases of hate were reported in Missouri in 2015, reaching the sixteenth place among all States.
Travel alert is also a response to the new Missouri Act, which makes it easier to sue a company for discrimination in providing accommodation or employment.
The U.S. Civil Liberties Association (ACLU) issued a travel recommendation for Texas and Arizona after the States adopted an immigration law allowing state actors to detain people on the basis of violations of this law, which is to improve racial profiling according to ACLU.
The travel recommendation is usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but in recent times legal groups have avoided these measures in response to specific laws and trends within the United States.
The model was killed by the chef.
Her family doesn't even have peace after 12 years!
The killer is Sally Anne Bowman.
A girl from Croydon was murdered in 2005 by chef Mark Dix right at the restaurant where she worked, he set her up with stab wounds.
The victim and the killer were supposed to have sex and smoke marijuana, then he killed her.
Then the killer sat in a nearby cafe and watched a careful criminal investigation of the crime scene.
Dixie, former chef, was sentenced in 2008 to 34 years' imprisonment for the murder and rape of Sally's model.
The judge only admitted a youth attack and the lawyer claimed that his client had already found a dead girl lying on the street.
Three years later, he was testified by the police.
Dixie claimed that Sally and her former friend Lewis Sportson had a fatal fight at night.
The killer said, "He was really angry and after his attack the girl started screaming."
"She even attracted the attention of the taximen," he said.
The girl was supposed to defend herself as she could, but she was empty.
Lewis was supposed to stab her on the street.
Dixie's version was proved a lie and accused him.
After Dixie's confession, he talked about his tenacity and taste for the girl.
When he wore her after sex, he felt satisfied and had to burn marijuana.
Before the incident with Sally, he was with his ex-girlfriend, drinking alcohol and taking cocaine, said Dexie himself to the police.
He said he felt adrenaline.
Sally started screaming for help, so she attacked her back and put her hand through her mouth," added the Mirror Linda.
And after 12 years, the family faces further attacks by vandals destroying her grave.
In the last half of the year, he was injured four times.
There are so many cruel people who dig these graves.
"So our daughter isn't there anymore," said the Mirror's mother to Linda's fallen asleep girl about the disappearance of the ashes.
Linda was waiting for the attackers, but they always had to attack when she left the cemetery.
Design vibrators are worth tens of thousands.
"The Czechs are neither pure nor conservative," says Martin Ráž, who operates the Prague store of intimacy.
In it you will find design and luxurious erotic aids.
Including those from the Czech designer Anna Marešov.
It started unbeatable, about 12 years ago.
Martin Ráž and his friends went out for a cycle after Moravia.
One of them brought not only a wheel, but also a box full of indistinguishable vibrators.
"Various moles and dolphins and all that was green and yellow and just completely different," she tells me about lunch.
His friend decided to cooperate with another partner with the German manufacturer of Fun Factory design erotic aids, which Martina was interested in and offered to help with marketing.
When the partner left to get another profession, he replaced it.
Today it operates in the Prague Benedict Street store of Intimity, where it sells erotic aids in the way luxury cables or shoes are usually offered.
Why not?
It's also about design objects.
Wait, wait, this is what you're talking about at lunch, are you?
Come on, don't be such a Puritan!
Just Berlin’s Fun Factory shop, which was designed by renowned designer Karim Rashid, served as an inspiration for the Intimity store.
They opened it in 2010 and it was completely different from the concept of erotic trade than everyone is used to.
No covered exhibits, all made in a beautiful, decent style, products exposed more like perfumery.
Martin and his business partner Zdenýk Šebelka began to consider how to understand Prague's business where it should be and what it should be called.
The name of Intimity was popular with both.
"It's all about intimacy, and it's also, you can say, gentle," he says.
It followed the purchase of Internet domains and the search for suitable space, which went parallel to various interior visualizations.
Finally, she won the option that spread the store into the garden of delight and the bedroom that she introduces the bed.
Dagmar Štěpan has prepared it for us from the FormaFatal study.
We found space in 2013.
First of all, he didn't seem completely ideal to us because he's not on the main street, but because of that, he was sitting in the name of the Intimacy.
He's intimate.
He's in the street next to the main one, so no one's making customers," says Martin Ráž.
We wanted to be the first.
We wanted to do a business that would be different, with brandy good goods, in an environment where women, who are mostly our customers, feel good.
And not to be ashamed that they got into such a business at all.
When I walked into the Intimity store half an hour ago, the streets were empty.
Besides, I didn't even feel like I was going to the erotic aid store.
Right at the door, I was surprised by the pure elegance of the interior, which I know from fashion shops.
Although there is only a female service in the store, so that women do not hesitate to ask for help, it does not mean that a man's leg would not greet here.
Most gentlemen come here to buy presents for their girlfriends.
"Men can't estimate the right size and prefer more," he smiles at Martin's frequent error.
These are the predictions, the excited clichés that women need some big help, and it's not true.
So a man in good faith should choose an extra-large vibrator.
Likewise, men prefer mostly black laundry, which usually attracts a woman to pink.
The absolute bestseller is currently a product called Satisfyer.
The expression in my face must be clear that I don't know who's fighting because Martin's explaining right now how it works.
It's such a touchless clitoris stimulator.
Pere needs a teenager in me to get excited about what serious tone I'm being given.
It's like it doesn't smell like it.
And it doesn't really make sense.
It's at a good price and has a perfect user reference.
We didn't believe he'd be so well received.
It's some kind of last revolutionary news.
The first revolution caused the vibrator in the form of a sea horse.
He made sure that women began to be more interested in designing such products.
The other one was a We-Vibe pair vibrator.
He completely swallowed the taboo that some men can survive, and the fact that they see competition in erotic aids.
"Various options are being made," he continues.
With one engine, with two engines, with remote control.
It's a favorite category.
In a loving connection, a woman can have control in her hand and determine the intensity of vibration.
On the contrary, a certain fall is the category of attaching vibrators.
At least we're here.
Czech women seem to prefer multi-plicity aids and buy classic vibrators, although they should only use it externally.
However, in Western Europe, especially among younger customers, it is very popular.
What about the men?
It's hard to say if a similar concept would work exclusively for men.
It's probably supposed to be a little different.
The question is what to offer men," Martin thinks.
"We also have help for them, but to a limited extent." Mostly the masturbator is sold, in this case from the Tenga manufacturer.
It doesn't look like anatomical vagina, but "sleeps like a shower gel or like an egg or a futuristic object.
Much concentrates on functionality and survival when used.
It's completely different in Japan, though.
That's what makes me nervous.
I thought the Japanese would suffer a lot for erotic aids, I'd say.
"It's the reality of the Internet," I'm told.
That's completely different.
Here in Europe, erotic aids are more linked to the use of women.
In Japan they are perfectly normal for men, and on the contrary they are taboo for women." Just for the sake of interest - what the Japanese brand Tenga, which is represented in the Intimity store, sells worldwide, is still about half what is sold only in Japan.
In our waters
The Czechs and the Czechs aren't dirty at all.
On the contrary, we're a very friendly nation.
Certainly different from the country, such as Catholic Poland or Italy.
A typical customer of trade moves between 35 and 50 years and "has some experience with sexual life but with some help.
It will come for something nicer, more quality than it would add to a partner's life or itself." Martin Ráž and his business partner Zdenýk Šebelka are trying to convince each product that it is perfectly functional.
We also don't want to go into special types of bondage and latex, because we don't have room for this, but it's not exactly the case here.
Such things could reflect those we're trying to aim for.
Which are people who were always supposed to go to the sex store because they were afraid they'd see something like that on them.
Many of the products displayed on the shelves are really popular.
It is also given by the selection of distinguished brands.
Some of them even won design awards, including the Red Dot Design Award.
At least the first prize was mentioned by the sea horse "and this led to a change in the whole sector.
It started to get rid of cheap materials and, on the other hand, to work with health-free people, it started to produce other designs, different colors...
It's nice to see some of them standing behind the design of the Czech Republic, the popular designer Anna Marešová.
I have to say that I'm quite surprised how many people here are buying those Whoop.de.doo design things from Anna Marešov, although they're relatively expensive.
They're customers who're going straight to Venice's balls from Anna Marešov.
She did a huge piece of work by representing exactly what we are trying to present in the Czech Republic and abroad - that erotic aids are allowed to do differently, nice, with a story.
Anna's story started as a schoolwork.
Now it's a finished product that's also made from us.
I wanted to have a process of production under control and I also wanted to know which materials and how Whoop.de.doo products are produced.
Because it's not a big deal, but a small series, it's definitely more expensive than a big series.
Maybe I'm going against the current a little bit, but I think it's important to keep our development in the Czech Republic.
It might well be that in a few years we will no longer be able to produce anything," Anna, who agrees with Martin that our company is as open as possible.
He doesn't meet with a negative or a negative attitude.
Maximumly, people are desperate.
"But then you'll start smiling." Currently, Anna Marešová has a vibrator offer that you can let yourself prepare a personal message, and this year she is also planning her own lubrication gel.
The next year should be vibrating eggs and other news.
Limits on healthy sex
I wonder where the limits of what's right are.
Is there anything Martin Ráž wouldn't sell anymore?
It's very hard to define.
What happens to one is normal, another may seem completely abnormal, so we're more of a range of brand manufacturers.
None of them are allowed into any extremes.
Before we say goodbye, I have the last question: What was the craziest question they got?
Just now, an e-mail came in a week in which some lady was asking for a masturbating aid for her friend with the birth of a length of twenty-eight centimeters.
So we had to write that we didn't have anything like that.
It's still a question of whether someone has made fun of us," Martin is measuring me with a suspicious view.
And it happens from time to time...
A wound to Karl Gott.
Two Alzheimer's cancers!
His friend Karel Stödrý is fighting a serious illness.
Carl Gott's best friend is fighting a disease that steals people all memories.
"Yes, I'm sorry, it's the truth," confirmed the sad information Blesk himself sang.
I know about my illness, and so far, in view of the circumstances, I can handle it.
"I take medications that have to slow down the underlying symptoms of the disease," he added, thanks to the close support.
The entire family of the Enlightenment was there to ease Karl’s life.
Eva's wife is trying to be at home, as much as possible, after her father's home on the White Mountain, and daughters from the first marriage of Zuzana and Theresa, Karl's son, Karl's name, is taken care of.
He fought cancer twice and passed his experience on to Slavik to support him during his intensive treatment.
He's got sixty chemotherapy.
He was able to get back to work after them at the tennis court and at ski resorts.
"From an astrologer I'm supposed to be here in the '90s," said Karel Blesk.
He's a warrior.
He still wants to sing.
"I keep repeating the words of the song so I don't forget them," Karel confessed.
The same disease is now being fought in the constitution and the actress Flora Fial.
Do you have a patient with Alzheimer's?
Look at how you treat him.
The Chilean Parliament has abolished the ban on interruptions, the law will judge the U.S.
In Chile, there has been an absolute ban on artificial interruption of pregnancy, so it must not be carried out for health reasons.
"I am sorry that the legislators have complained to the Constitutional Court and that ten people will now decide what we have agreed on in Parliament for more than two years," Socialist Senator Isabel Allende said.
The Constitutional Court in Chile has ten members, and by the end of August it should be given a new president who is, according to the AFP, a close opposition.
The law breaking the absolute ban of interruptions, initiated by current President Michelle Bachelet, approved the Senate on 19 July.
The legal opposition then announced that the law was going to attack the court because it said it violates the right of an unborn child to life.
Members of the vote on the bill postponed last month until it was analysed by the Joint Parliamentary Commission.
In the middle of the parliamentary term, the motion was approved and the Senate did so again.
According to the new legislative amendment, there should be no penalty for artificial interruption of pregnancy in three cases: if the life of a woman is threatened, if the fruit is not expected to survive, or if pregnancy is caused by rape.
Similar exceptions existed according to the Spanish letter El País in Chile since 1931, which is before the women were elected in 1949.
The absolute ban on interruption in 1989 was introduced by the right-wing dictator Augusto Pinochet, just a few months before he left the president's office.
Chile is one of the few countries in the world where there is an absolute ban on interruption.
Others are Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, Salvador, Haiti, Malta and Honduras.
For example, in Salvador, there are now about 20 women on the grid who, for reasons of interruption of pregnancy, repudiate up to 30 years of prison sentences.
In many cases, however, according to human rights defenders, there was a spontaneous execution that the court called murder.
Is there anything else sacred?
The purpose of Trump's White House is now Socha Freedom
The unmistakable sign of change in the regime is the criticism of the soch.
The Americans could tell it as well as all the others - see the carefully staged collapse of Saddam Hussajna in the Baghdad Square of Firdos in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key supporters of the Trump regime, certainly knew what was happening when, during a passionate debate with CNN reporter Jim Acosta on the theme of Presidential proposals to radically restrict legal immigrants, he expressed himself with a symbolic axe on Socha Svoboda.
It's good to add that Miller didn't attack the statue like that.
For that, he would be taxed by the owners of the voyage ships and the copyists of Socha Freedom.
However, he attacked its significance, specifically the fact that in 1903 a plaque with the famous poem Emmy Lazarus was placed on the foundation, until 17 years after the completion of the monument.
Miller rebuked Acousta for saying: “I don’t want to go into history here, but Socha Freedom is... a symbol of American freedom that shines light all over the world.
The poem, which was placed on the foundation additionally and which you refer to, is not part of it."
Miller's actually right, but as he said himself, this isn't about history.
It is particularly about Emmy Lazarus's infective words, which are reasoning today - calling them not only immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Let him come to me, let him who falls, let him who is poor, let him who is freely breathing, let him who is poor in the midst of full cities."
And just in modern times we can better watch these "poor worms" on our screens than ever before.
Miller did not try to criticize poetry - he wanted to explain that these people are not guests in the United States.
This conflict on the importance of socha is part of a comprehensive political and cultural war: it is essentially a conflict on the importance of America.
Emma Lazarus, as well as her friends, who after her death tried to put a poster with poems on the foundation of the statue, knew quite well that she would be released into a high political game.
Socha was meant to express the association of the French and American Republican governments by representing a classic theme, that is, women's empowerment.
Emma Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem, the female character is not abstract, but she has her own voice.
It also has a very different name: Mother of outcasts.
Confronting poetry with women's performance is a brilliant feminist attraction and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And in the same way that Emma Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the rights defenders have long tried to reverse this meaning.
The famous commenter Rush Limbaugh - Jana Brüttel on Trump's rise to power - in 2010 argued that Socha Freedom does not actually call anyone to the country, but represents early neoconstructivism, bringing the American flame to the rest of the world: "Socha Freedom goes ahead.
It brings about freedom from the United States and offers it to the rest of the world.
The origin shall not illuminate the journey to the United States."
Limbuugh's shopping is about an important thing.
The importance of socha depends on the angle of view.
Emma Lazarus describes the ghost from the eyes of the exhausted and damned passenger, who often comes to the new country after a long and frightening voyage across the ocean with hope.
This is a word about the world of people looking for refuge and a chance for a better life.
From this point of view, he expresses hope and listens to their needs.
And that's, of course, a perspective that neither Miller nor Trump definitely knows.
Their origins should not light up the path, but spread hatred, which is their only source of power.
World Championship 2017: Neil Black sings praise to Scottish members of the British team
Elid Doyle recalls when the British team had only two Scottish members
The director of the United Kingdom's athletic federation Neil Black said that a strong squad of 16 Scotts in the World Championship team would be "a huge advantage for the team".
For MS in London 2017, starting on Friday, a record number of Scottish athletes was selected.
Black believes that in Scotland "something special is happening" and British athletes could learn from the Scottish ice cream.
"We are trying to understand and adapt - we will work on it," Black said.
“I spoke to people from the Scottish Sports Institute and they think it has something to do with what they did.
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they did.
British sports: it has something to do with what they've done.
They think it's people on the streets, too.
Whatever it is, it's absolutely amazing."
Several Scottish athletes will strive for medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete with Sir Mo Farah in the 5000 m race, while Elid Doyle was elected team captain.
“Eilid is modest.
Her opening speech was amazing," Black said.
“Several athletes, whether Scottish or athletes of other nationalities, came from a room with a feeling of enormous pride and motivation.
The passion and unhappiness that Elidh spoke to was unrepeatable."
The Silver Medalist of Commonwealth, who will compete in the course of a 400 m obstacle on his fifth world championship, said that he is "incredible", that in the British team there are 16 Scottish athletes.
The previous record from 1983 and 2015 is seven.
In the middle of the race, Muir has only established five British and two European records in the last year.
On MS, the running will take place at 1500 m and 5000 m.
Another of the great Scotts is Chris O'Hare, who runs the track for 1500 m. He won the British Team Championships and Annual Games this year.
Doyle remembers his first championship, where she was the only other Scottish member of Lee McConnell's team.
The team leader said she was “very proud” of the fact that not only had a large number of her colleagues joined the team, but in many cases they would also be attacked to participate in the finals and medals.
"The unusual thing about the team's captain is that I was elected by the other team members. It was a great honor for me, but knowing that I was elected by the team is a pleasure," she added.
“I am obviously very proud of all the Scottish people who have joined the team.
It proves where I moved.
They're athletes who'll think of the front seats on the stage.
What about my opening speech?
Yes, I think she did.
I've just pointed out that we can be proud of this year's championship because it's on the home floor.
It is important to use the support of domestic fans and rejoice in the fact that we are back at the Olympic Stadium.
I got a second chance at the race and I'm going to have an unreal atmosphere."
Blocking the criticisms on Facebook: don't take care of the public function if you don't take the criticisms of the wishes
Our father knew about his criticism.
The Americans loved George Washington, but the newspapers didn't take long to start criticizing him for anything, starting with foreign politics and finally his political views.
Yes, this criticism did not leave her cold.
But he didn't try to criticize himself.
Because in 1783 Washington said: "The freedom of expression can be taken away from us - and stupid and we will be led as sheep to defeat."
This brings me to Maryland is Governor Larry Hogan, who needs to work to start acting like Washington.
Hogan's employees blocked and reduced the contributions of at least 450 people who freely expressed their views on his official Facebook page.
This week, the American Union for Civil Liberties complained about this act.
The complainant’s staff rejected the complaint as unfounded and many views of the type “who is interested” appeared in comments on the Internet.
"It's just Facebook," said many users.
That's what matters, though.
Especially when it's about people like Hogan.
In an absolutely democratic state, it is an extremely popular Republican governor.
He can boast of the second highest popularity of all 50 governors.
Hogan's not puzzling.
It is evident that its state is governed by its own self and strictly adheres to its principles.
It also turned out to be a turning point in the use of Facebook as the main means of connecting with its voters - except there is no publication of the first photo with a bare head after chemotherapy.
Blocking people who welcome the governor's page - which is a public forum, marked as official and managed by his employees paid by taxpayers - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview for Washington Post Hogan's spokesperson Amelia Chase defended the governor by blocking comments from the position of moderation of contributions.
However, using the image of Internet trolls, spammers or scattered people is too easy.
Washington Post told a number of real people that contributed.
And that is exactly what they are -- real people who talk to their chosen leaders; teacher, businessman and pastor, no trolls.
As they all said, their comments were polite and considerate, not rude.
In his comment, the pastor quoted the Bible as referring to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Bowie Lakshmi Sarma Ramani's lawyer, Ms. asked about hate crimes, but her comment was not hate.
"I have hardly noticed that I have been disappointed by his lack of response to hate crimes and other current reports," wrote Washington Post in the section with comments from the newspaper.
"I don't like the idea that once a certain number of people have the same subject, some people are labeled for the promotion of so-called collective effort rather than being regarded as a larger group of interested citizens."
What the governor's employees called "concentrated tax interest" would probably be called "obhajabou".
Modern Facebook age allows us to manage contributions easily by blocking criticism or by making negative comments.
It is much more comfortable than in the past when the same procedure would require sending employees to the streets where they would pick up and burn all the pressure with criticism or arrest or silence Protestants.
And that's exactly what's happening only in digital form.
Hogan is not the last public factor that will be criticised for harassment of Facebook and other social media.
President Trump faces a complaint from Twitter users that has been denied access to his account.
One of the first important regulations was born last week in Virginia.
President Louduun County Board of Supervisors violated the first supplement in Alexandria, according to the interim judge James C. Cacherise, where she banned one of her fans from accessing her Facebook page.
Governor Matt Bevin (R) from Kentucky also received visits from ACLU due to his use of Facebook and Twitter.
That shouldn't be so hard.
In Washington’s time, the low price of mail had practically the same effect as the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of daily prints multiplied, and its position was questioned by many anonymous writers.
And even in those times Washington had to deal with anonymous trolls.
People writing under pseudonyms such as "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belissarius" and "Portius", wrote letters to the newspaper and questioned Washington's decision.
According to historical documents that gathered people in the online project Papers of George Washington Project, petitioners were gathered in his office criticizing his opinion of the Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation agreement with Britain.
But he didn't shut up.
Freedom of expression, of disagreement and of intimidation lies in the very foundations of our nation.
And the real leader must accept it.
The Czechs used free roaming quickly, consuming more data abroad than at home.
In the Czech Republic they consume more of their tariff than at home.
Most often they move in Austria, but data consumption in the summer season leads to Croatia.
On holiday, however, they have more time to browse the web, and under the sun, most do not have the possibility to connect to Wi-Fi.
Beach, swimming and a smart phone in your hand.
So it looks like a typical Czech holiday in Croatia after customers can use the services of domestic operators.
It comes from the fresh statistics of O2.
Thanks to the new roaming rules, most Czech travellers abroad have more data available within the breaker than at home.
It is not surprising, therefore, that in Croatia, where there is a minimum of ours in the winter, data consumption fell even fifty times during the summer season.
In the second place, Italy was then placed in the register of data consumed.
The Czechs spend most of the minutes from Germany, where many of them are out of work for years.
Croatia visits 800 thousand Czechs annually, according to data from the Association of Czech Travel Offices, so is our most popular holiday destination.
However, people here exchanged a book to share experiences with mobile phones.
The record was this July 7th.
"To transfer data would include tens of millions of photos," explained the details of the director of the mobile segment in O2 Silvia Cieslarová.
Although Croatia is in charge of data, the highest number of Czech users is moving in neighbouring countries.
The first is Austria, followed by Germany and Slovakia.
Croatia is the fourth and Italy is the sixth.
We go to Austria on foot and on an active holiday, where we don't have enough time to browse the Internet.
"In addition to the Czech Republic, Austria is heading straight to the Adriatic," Cieslarová explained.
While the data showed the operator after the release of high roaming charges for mid-year growth, the number of phone calls is much lower.
The number of minutes spent in roaming rose against last year to double.
With a huge leap in front of other countries here, Germany dominates.
"The roaming calls are more used by business customers on business routes," Cieslarová added.
Ronan Rafferty hopes in the home atmosphere at the Renaissance Club
The former Ronan Rafferty golf team will be hoping for the next three days in the cool atmosphere at the Renaissance Club in the Scottish administrative area of East Lothian, which hosts the 25th anniversary of Scottish Senior Open.
Ronan Rafferty, who comes from Northern Ireland, last year on the nearby Archerfield Links golf course on his way to the finals, is bound by Paul Eales. This year he will play the role of Ambassador of the tournament in the performance of the founder of the club and CEO of Jerry Sarvadi.
"I watched the Renaissance Club slowly grow in front of my eyes and this year's tournament will show the world its beauty," Rafferty said.
“Players will be able to love the first-class quality of the playground.
Jerry did a great job.
He's a burning defender of this game and he's proud of his success.
This year's tournament is in the right hands."
English Eales will be the first to defend the championship title, despite the fact that during his 32-year career he won the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour.
"I feel good about it," said the Southport golfer.
“I did not have the opportunity to defend my victory at Extremadura Open, because the tournament was cancelled one year after my victory.
The return to this part of the country is magical.
It's a beautiful place for golf.
I remember last year when for me and my wife Sharon meant a real victory.
It was a beautiful time I'd never forget."
Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour after 50 years from the country of this year, is returning to his home country.
This event will be his first participation from Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"I always like playing on the home floor," Orr said about Helensburg.
“You want it to work for you and you feel a lot of stress.
I'm really glad to play again, and I think I'm doing it.
I'm happy with today's result."
Three players will also be joined on the playing field by former winner Masters Ian Woosnam and winning senior tournaments Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former competition captain Ryder Cup Sam Torrance are among six Scottish players on the field; others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Accessory for the tournament is free. Parking is 5 £ per car with one passenger and 10 £ per car with two and more passengers.
All profits will be devoted to Prostate Cancer UK.
Poverty and death in the country of gold
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use spatula.
In fact, he only rarely uses a master.
In his wooden chateau, which is located in the capital of Panai Enarotali in the Indonesian province of Papua, a woman usually simply throws sweet potatoes - in local "note" - directly into the fire.
After half an hour of potatoes, she'll have a taste of them with unwashed hands.
Bardina sits on the muddy ground - the house is not equipped with furniture - where at the same time she does her daily work, such as washing laundry in spicy water from a nearby swamp.
In a room without a roof, a bedding is supplied with a toilet.
As the youngest of her husband’s four wives, she was not assigned any treatment fields.
I guess it's normal here.
Work in late hours of the night poses a danger: most men from the village are unemployed and often drink alcohol. In addition, the village is home to soldiers.
"In the afternoon after five o'clock, no one will let themselves wander around the village," said Bardina.
It is a rare view of daily life at the height of Papua, the former Dutch colony, which was declared part of Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum, when only 1026 elders were brought to vote by public vote before the occupying army.
The current movement protesting the Dutch rules quickly turned its anger against the Jakarta government, which ruled the entire region, with the exception of foreign journalists or civil rights guardians.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua - the independent Papua New Guinea occupied the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is a remote and deserted town where you will arrive after a ninety-minute flight from the capital of Jayapura to Nabire, and then a five-hour ride-by-drive stomach.
A lot of traffic in this place doesn't work.
The town with 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses covered with bamboo plates, roofs of woolen sheets in shades of grey and cut color.
Only a very few Indonesians, including journalists, and virtually no foreigners, were seen in this place.
Before the arrival of Christians, local residents worshiped the God named Uga Tamae.
And that's not all.
"We were not used to wearing these dresses," says Bardina, pointing to her colorful, hand-cuffed turbane, dark shirt and bright skirt.
"We used to wear only sheets."
Papua is the poorest province of Indonesia - 28% of the population live below the poverty line and this child mortality and literacy is one of the worst in Asia.
At the same time, it's an Indonesian gold country.
The largest and most profitable gold work in the world of Grassberg, owned by Freeport McMoran from the American Phoenix, is only 60 miles from Panai - a rocky province about the size of New Jersey, which is home to about 153,000 inhabitants.
Only in 2015 did Freeport bring gold and copper worth $3.1 billion.
In addition, Papua supports the production of wood of an estimated $78 billion.
However, for the Pope, these riches are a source of suffering and a guarantee of oppression by the powerful Indonesian army.
The investigation carried out in 2005 by the New York Times revealed that Freeport paid approximately $20 million to local military agents and units between 1998 and 2004, including $150,000 for one officer.
Popes calling for self-government threaten this golden goose and are therefore severely oppressed.
According to human rights activists, since 1969 more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed and thousands more have been raped, imprisoned and imprisoned by the Indonesian army.
Mass killings in the tribal area of Papua during the 70th century amounted to genocide, according to the Asian Human Rights Commission.
Only last year, more than 3,900 peaceful protesters were arrested by the Indonesian police in the region.
In Will Lose Everything, the report of the 2016 Brisbane Archdiocese describes the cruelty that occurred last year, as extrajudicial corrections, torture - according to another report is particularly popular rape and correction of electric currents - and brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrators.
"It is difficult to calculate the number of victims, because incidents occur every week," said Andreas Harrison, an Indonesian research worker at the Human Rights Watch.
The whole situation has come to light because the papal resources are attracting colonists to Indonesia.
Of the 3.5 million inhabitants of this province, 83% report Christianity, but demographic changes with the flow of Muslim immigrants from the Indonesian islands - Java, Bornea, Sumatra and Sulawes.
Javan canteens sell roasted chicken and gado-gado or a mixture of vegetables with peanut sauce.
Local people are fighting for survival.
"Immigrants began selling chickens and vegetables on traditional markets at lower prices than local Papuans," explains twenty-four-year-old Abeth You, who was born in Panai and moved to the capital of Jayapura.
"The natives of Papua - Mama-Mama (females) - have lost their jobs."
In 2014, Indonesian President Joko Widodo, named Jokowi, promised to resolve injustice and violations of rights in the framework of his presidential campaign.
The former treasurer has secured his way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta 27 of the 29 districts of Papua, including Pania.
But it has changed very little in Papua, and local people feel infected.
"Our heart was broken, because in 2014 we voted for Jokpwi, hoping to hear our call for justice," you said.
The fact is that only two months after the October inauguration of Jacob, the Panai experienced a great shock.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children sang a Christmas song at the camp fire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers came out of the lake at night on motorcycles.
Two of the surprised kids told them they should turn on the lights.
One of the soldiers took this stand and the one who was disfellowshipped and later returned with four other soldiers, the local priest Yavedt Tebai said.
Two of the soldiers in a drunk state followed a group of children and left them with their weapons, brought victims and witnesses.
One of the soldiers then set fire to a group of children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so hard that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, someone set fire to a nearby election committee building and the next day things were still coming up.
About 1,000 young Papuan men and women gathered at the football court in front of the local police station and the military headquarters and demanded justice.
They came with the ritual hunting ports and performed the dance of waita - in which he runs in the circle and imitates the song of birds - of the Papuan tribe of Mee Pago.
Several Protestants started throwing stones at the building.
With increasing tensions, a command was issued to the soldiers via the radio: “If the Daw is tried at least three times for resistance, you have permission to shoot,” said the Times weekly in an official document whose content has never been published in local media.
Jeremias Kayame (56), chief of the district of Enarotali Kego Koto, identified a dangerous danger and called on residents to disperse into their homes.
But no one had anything to do with his words.
“When I turned around, someone shot me in the left wrist,” Time said on the porch of his painted wooden house.
Kayame doesn't know who the shooter was, but according to his words, the bullet belonged to one of the soldiers present.
"There were a lot of people around and a lot of shooting," he added.
One of the local residents, Alfius Youw, was attacked three times, according to his cousin who witnessed the shooting.
"I ran to the body to convince myself that it was really him," said the Times weekly with a sad voice by John, who uses only one name as many Indonesians.
"I saw he was dead... I kissed him."
The Papuanian police inspector, General Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers were only "supplying" the station that was under attack.
"We need to defend ourselves when people threaten us with death," said a press spokesman for the Papuan police in 2015, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistio.
"It's a question of life and death."
According to the Human Rights Watch, five demonstrators were killed and many were killed with injuries.
The murder report was filed by the Jakarta media the following day.
Three weeks later, he gave Jokow a passionate talk in Jayapura and expressed his understanding of the victims' families and promised to deal with violence in Papua.
"I demand an immediate solution to this problem so that it can never be repeated," he said.
In October 2016, the Minister of National Security Wirtanto announced that he would introduce an extrajudicial mechanism to resolve the violent acts that occurred in the past.
Almost immediately, however, they began to apologize.
“Most of the violent acts have been committed a long time ago.
Some of them occurred in the 1990s and some in the early 21st century.
I mean, we've decided to punish these violent acts, but it won't be a simple task," he said.
In a discussion on 5 June for the TIME week that took place in Jakarta, Viranto claimed that he did not plan to take any measures in Papua.
Instead, he said that "all cases will be brought before the Court".
Viranto, who was accused of "crime against humanity" on the basis of more than one thousand deaths during the 1999 independent elections in East Timor - said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have been resolved, including the Pania incident.
The families of the victims of the shooting in Panai welcomed his claim with disbelief.
“In the last three years I have been questioned four times in total, but I have not yet seen anything,” John said.
"I'm tired."
As he says, a few years later, he still lives in fear.
"I'm afraid," as they claim.
"I'm afraid an army will arrest me or someone will shoot me."
His brother Yacobus confirmed the views of many Pania residents who are afraid to speak about the incident.
According to his words, he was kept by members of the army after he helped bury four of the victims.
"After the body was buried, I started looking for an army," he said.
And the shooting's not over yet.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot villagers in neighboring Deiyai.
The reference to which one person died and another 17 were injured was between the villagers and the construction company manager who refused to provide assistance in the transport of a man unconsciously to the hospital.
Ravianus Douw (24), who drowned when fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
The angry villagers protested against the building company.
According to the statement, the village police threw stones at them and responded to them with a warning shot.
Local residents claim, however, that the mobile brigade (indonesian paramilitary police) started shooting at the dam and killed one man.
"There was panic, we were afraid of payback," said Time 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lived near the hospital and was a witness to the arrival of the injured.
"Two days I didn't leave the house."
The Deiyai Parliament demanded the punishment of the police involved and the removal of the mobile brigade from the area.
The ladies were always staring at the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development only deepens the exclusion of native people of the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal families living in central elevations.
Many of them joined the Movement for the Liberation of Papua (OPM) - the army of rebels who protect the rights of the Papuans by attacking and extermination Indonesian police.
Some of the OPM leaders come from Pania, not from Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
As a result of the attacks of the army in recent years, thousands of Pania's inhabitants were arrested and voluntarily detained, all under the pretext of "protection of national sovereignty".
Some of them don't belong anymore.
Panaii is known among the people of Papua as “a tragic and forgotten place”.
Oil in the fire leads to poverty.
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for the local.
And the bread is as unattainable as it is.
Today, the inhabitants grow their food: mainly sweet potatoes, fruit and leaf vegetables.
Women work on the fields; each of them treats four or five fields with sweet potatoes.
Most of the harvest is intended for family needs, the rest are sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of sweet potatoes are worth only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Since Nabire opened more air routes and started to flow new immigrants to the country, there has been an increase in economic inequality between the indigenous Papuans and immigrants.
So few jobs are usually occupied by more educated and richer immigrants.
The popes often have the necessary capital and education to enable them to enter the business.
"Young people move from villages due to lack of work opportunities and money," said John Gobai, president of the Pania Tribal Council.
Thanks to isolation, the province of Papua is hidden from the world.
They also contribute to strict rules for foreign journalists.
At the beginning of this year, two French journalists - Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp - were expelled from the pope for “inadequate cooperation with the authorities”, despite the fact that they received such a rare permission to film.
Phelim China, deputy director of the Asian branch of the Human Rights Watch organization, Yokowi, in his election campaign, promised to abolish strict rules for journalists and achieve transparency and development.
"For foreign journalists working in the most rebellious eastern regions of Papua and West Papua, there is a great risk: non-recognition of visas and blacklisting," he said in a statement.
The lack of reports from per foreign journalists means that the international pressure on Indonesia in the case of Papua is significantly limited.
In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - the UN Human Rights Council on the investigation of "different and widespread violent acts" in Papua New Guinea, including shooting in Pania.
These countries in the past also supported the OPM.
Speaking by the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Arrmanatha Nasir filed charges when he told reporters in Jakarta: “In Indonesia, the democratic system and the media are still free, so it is difficult to mask evidence of human rights violations.”
Local people call after foreign governments participate.
When the official delegation from the Netherlands, in front of the human rights envoy Kees Van Baare, visited Jayapura on 4 May, the local people spoke to the source, who also attended the meeting, but wanted to remain anonymous, the password "we want freedom".
For 2019, further elections are planned in Indonesia, but the popes claim they will not vote for Yokowi.
"Yoko is a man who has good intentions, but is surrounded by people associated with the shooting in Pania," Gobau, president of the tribal council, said.
He wants Jokow to know that the inhabitants of Paniai - apart from living in constant fear of the thief army - are fighting in poverty, poor education and the health system.
Gobai claims that the inhabitants of Panai, as well as the other Papuans, consider their vote to be "debt", which Jokow must pay.
"They don't want money, they demand justice," he added.
Despite the threats and intimidation of the family of the victims of the Pania shooting, they continue in the last symbolic act of rebellion: burying the bodies of the victims on the ground against the police and military station.
Knowing that justice will never be done enough, at least it will not allow responsible people to forget their crimes.
"Our family member was killed," Yacobus said with his head closed.
"What can we do?"
The French Navy has caught a huge supply of cocaine to Australia.
In the Pacific, the French Navy held a 1,46-tonne-cocaine yacht worth about $256 million.
The shipment was headed for Australia.
In the attack, a four-member crew of ships, apparently composed of people from Lithuania and Latvia, were arrested.
Yacht, named after Afalina, sailed from South America and the police then withdrew her to the port of Nouméa, the French overseas metropolis of New Caledonia in the Pacific Ocean.
The Australian Intelligence Service stated that, in cooperation with its international partners, it would strive to determine exactly where and where the drugs were heading and to reveal the "Legal Syndicate".
"We are grateful to the French authorities for the measures that have stopped a large number of drugs leading to Australia," said her executive director, Col Blanch.
The drugs were destroyed in Noumé this week.
Australia is an attractive target for its feeders due to high street prices.
The country is also facing an increasing number of drug addicts.
The current pressure is not the first.
Last month, three men were accused of transporting a large amount of drugs from the United States to Australia, who tried to break through the Pacific in a small plane.
The seniors don't feel jealous. They need to be reminded of the drink.
The problem may be in the homes of seniors, according to a doctor at the Geriatric Clinic, the General Faculty Hospital in Prague Pavly Mádl may have been an infusion of physiological solution, which is dripping with a thin needle under the skin.
But they're still only applied in medical facilities.
The older the person, the lower the amount of water in his body.
"In addition, it loses the feeling of thirst, so seniors generally take less fluid and dehydrate very quickly," Madlová said.
Two liters should definitely drink.
"But getting to the old man so much fluid is a big problem," she added.
In the homes of the elders, she often finds that no doctor is watching.
In patients, dehydration is usually managed by infusions.
"I think that even there should be a gradual introduction so they can get a subcutaneous infusion," she said.
According to it, old people can add up to two hallitres of physiological solution per day.
Lack of fluid may cause weakness, headache, and reduced performance.
Dehydration occurs as a complete loss of self-resistance.
"One day that old man will say he can't get out of bed, he talks confused," she added.
In the event of neglect, it may occur until a stroke.
Blood closes and closes the tube in the brain, also threatens the failure of the kidneys.
Lying patients should not be covered by a pen, which is the maximum cotton spread.
The problem can also be one-time prey.
"It's more difficult to treat, but it would be ideal if the patient sometimes discovered and let the skin explode," the doctor said.
The Torch has already burned the second cloud in Dubai
In Dubai, on Friday, one of the world's largest residential skyscrapers was in flames. The Hassicians had to evacuate all inhabitants 337 meters high and 79 floors.
In the last two years, there has been a second fire of this tall building, which bears the appropriate name The Torch.
All the inhabitants of the building were evacuated, and there was no injury, and the cause of the fire is unknown.
“We slept and woke up the alarm. We heard a scream.
It took us ten minutes before we ran down from the 50th floor," he told Reuters Geroge, one of the people of the night.
Dubai's civil defence stated that the firemen managed to get under control around the fourth hour of the morning (0:00 GMT), which continued to cool the building.
Government representatives have added that they provide replacement accommodation for the disabled.
The incident could again lead to a discussion about the safety of materials used to cover high buildings around the world.
The results of the investigation initiated by the conduct of the Torch lighthouse after the fire in 2015 showed that the coating and external panels used for decoration or insulation were most damaged.
The British police indicated that the system of isolation and siege of the London Grenfell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of fire during the red fire, with nearly 80 people killed.
The results of the survey showed that more than one in five U.S. passengers carry prohibited items on board an aircraft
A survey among passengers showed that more than 20 percent of them were knowingly or unconsciously found prohibited items through the U.S. Government Transportation Security Administration inspection post on board the aircraft. At least six percent of passengers entered the aircraft with knives or other sharp objects.
Less than one percent of passengers claim to have been late in their journey with guns, ammunition, or explosives.
From the results of the survey carried out by Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - which answered more than 1000 respondents - it has been found that young passengers are more likely to violate the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they deliberately tried to travel with the object prohibited by the TSA, 19.7 per cent of passengers with several thousand hours flew compared to less than 15 per cent of the members of Generation X.
Among the most common items that have avoided TSA attention are food and alcohol.
More than three per cent of respondents were aware of a sharp object, while 2.2 per cent of the women and 3.7 per cent of the men were also aware of their intention to carry banned drugs on board the aircraft.
The company indicated that it had carried out a survey among passengers around the world to find out how many of them had accidentally detected unauthorized items through airport controls and how much they had done so approved.
It is not surprising that most people who have transferred unauthorized items - whether they know it or not - travel by plane very often.
As the company pointed out, TSA directives are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People often don't know what fluids and how much they can get into the plane.
It is not surprising, then, that TSA has had the greatest amount of prohibited fluid.
For a certain time, people thought that TSA would handle books in the same way as stuffed goods.
The transfer of fluids is permitted within foreign years, not international.
Head of EPA Scott Pruitt on the postponement of planned guidelines for the reduction of Obama's emissions
After the Environment Agency was complained about by fifteen states, her former head Scott Pruitt withdrew her decision to postpone the implementation of the plan of the former Obama administration for reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
Pruitt presented changes in his plan. It reacts as fresh as previous government to the needs of state environmental regulators.
However, he did not mention the legal challenge against his previous position before the Federal Court of Appeal.
This applies to the last deadline fixed on 1 October when States are expected to implement the 2015 Regulation for the reduction of ground ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would postpone the agreement for one year and arrange for a more detailed study of the plan to avoid "infringements with local decisions or threatening economic growth".
Pruitt, who, before reaching the role of Chief EPA President Donald Trump, held the position of State Attorney General Oklahoma, served for a long time as a reliable supporter of more stringent environmental regulations.
Since its establishment in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved or removed the regulations proposed by the chemical and fossil industries.
The sudden mid-term trend is the biggest legal failure for Pruitt's regulatory agenda.
Last month, the Washington Federal Court of Appeal decided that the EPA operator exceeded its authority in order to remove Obama's administrative plan, which required oil and gas companies to reduce methane leaks.
In a statement issued on Wednesday evening, Pruitt proposed its version of the ozone standards and reinforced the EPA's commitment to cooperate with States through complex processes and the implementation of new standards within the timeframe.
“For previous governments, the EPA has often failed to meet the deadlines and waited for complaints by active groups and others to agree with the alignment and further planning,” said Pruitt, who put more than a dozen complaints in his previous position to the EPA.
"We do not believe in regulation by means of judicial dispute and we take the deadline seriously.
We never look at our statute and authority that comes from it."
However, the EPA statement states that Pruitt can use, at a certain point, "the possibility of extension and all other legally available authorities" to ensure that the regulations "will be based on sound policies and the most available information".
The Republicans at the Congress are pressing for a broader regulation of the ozone rules.
The budget of the White House approved last month seeks to postpone implementation of the 2015 rules at least eight years.
The measures have not yet been passed by the Senate.
New York's Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who was in front of a coalition of states that complained this week, the EPA stated that the group would not allow it under legal pressure.
"To address the EPA's views - following our judicial review - is an important victory for the health and safety of the 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by air pollution," Schneiderman added.
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Washington, D.C.
The ground ozone occurs when conventional harmful substances emitted cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere with sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive people and every year thousands of premature deaths.
Public health defenders and environmentalists are praising Pruitt's sudden change.
"It is worrying what pressures we need to develop to change the thinking of responsible people and protect the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd from the Biodiversity Centre.
"We must continue to fight the ideological pull of Trump's administration, which is trying to help polluters and special interests."
He's a man of acid, but he's not dangerous to the court.
You never know what can happen to you.
One moment you're home with your family and you're laughing, the other will suddenly change your whole life from base.
And the worst part is that you can't do anything about it.
A similar judgment met Andreas Christopheros from Great Britain, whose face was fused with acidic acid, an unknown attacker who was finally relieved of his guilt.
Information introduced web Reuters.
In December 2014, someone knocked on the door at the Christophers.
Andreas woke up to open up.
He thought there was probably a courier at the door who was supposed to deliver the Christmas present for the family.
Instead, there was a great surprise waiting for him.
A man he never saw in his life, immediately after he opened it without warning, he said, "This is for you, my friend."
That pain was indescribable.
The clothes fell apart on me like nothing and I felt just a real pain in the skin," Andreas said.
His family quickly took him to the hospital, but his neighbors found out about the terrible news - according to doctors he had no chance of surviving.
Several weeks after the incident, doctors were constantly afraid that their patient would suffer an infection that threatened to get into his wound.
His wound was very serious.
Of the ninety percent was hit by the face that doctors tried to put together with the skin from other parts of the body.
The loss of the eyelids became a major complication for Christopherus.
It's probably the most painful thing I've ever experienced.
"You can't hide from the unexpected light, you can't close your eyes," he described his grief.
Today, Christophers has twelve operations that are far from the last.
The seizures that victims of acidic attacks may require hundreds of surgical procedures and years of treatment, according to plastic surgeons.
Even after difficult and long-term treatment, the victims have tissue detected for the rest of their life.
"Sometimes people don't change, and throughout their lives they fight deformation and defamation," said Professor Peter Djewulski, spokesperson for British associations of plastic and aesthetic surgeons.
The attacker was wrong.
As for the attack, Christophers is certain that an unknown man had to deal with someone.
In fact, the patriarch believed that the man who sexually abused his close friend was being punished.
The police investigated the whole case properly, and the attacker was subsequently investigated.
The man was initially sentenced to at least eight years in prison.
Later, however, the verdict to the admiration of Christopheros’s family changed in principle.
"The three judges finally concluded that punishment should be abolished, because a man is not considered a threat to the public," Christophers said.
In the last few years, the number of seizures of fatty substances has increased significantly.
The Ministry of the Interior expressed itself in a way that it was planning to lay down new guidelines for State representatives on the classification of cereals.
You should be classified among dangerous weapons.
However, victims of similar attacks are not prepared to give up.
They demand that the British government impose more and more severe sentences on people who attack their environment with acid or other fatty substances.
They also require increased controls on the sale of dangerous substances, which are often available in different trades, as these are different cleaning products.
In the largest city of the United Arab Emirates, Dubai burned a famous cloud of The Torch at night, which is one of the largest residential buildings in the world.
According to the Dubai Civil Defence, the inhabitants of the 80-pater building were able to evacuate in time and no one was injured.
According to the spokesperson's Dubai police, a fire broke out on the ninth floor and spread upwards.
However, according to some residents, this was the opposite.
"It started on the 67th floor, so they told us," said one of the tenants.
Also, according to another tenant, who was quoted by the agency Reuters, the fire broke out in the highest floors and spread down with falling fiery concerns.
We slept.
He woke us up, people yelled.
"We ran down the stairs, it took us about ten minutes of 50 feet," said the tenant George.
Another witness for CNN estimated that the flames had captured about 40 apartments.
On the ground fire destroyed at least two cars when they were hit by the burning parts of the building.
About two hours later, according to the civil defence report, the fire was able to get under control.
The cause of his origin is not known yet.
According to the witnesses in the surrounding buildings, there was a flow.
The vast fire damaged the Dubain skyscraper The Torch also in February 2015, destroyed over a hundred apartments.
There are about 680 apartments in the whole building.
Even then nothing happened to anyone because the residents managed to evacuate in time.
The Torch was built in 2011 and then became its 352 metres tallest residential building world.
The record was prepared immediately next year by another dubian cloud.
The culturalist had 14 incredible doping substances in his body.
He didn't win anyway.
According to Corriere della Serra, there was a festival of illicit drugs from steroids through diuretics after Parkinson’s disease or anorexia in a sample of three-year-old Ippolita.
Paradoxically, this wild mix didn't help him with his title. He finished fourth.
Now culturalists are threatened by four years of distance and criminal struggle.
The record was 11.
Last year, Italian ragbist David Vasta was positively tested for 11 doping substances, which was a record number of caught athletes.
A third-party player started taking steroids a year before he lost his culture.
Lucka Vondračová, Czech Republic.
She had a big hug with an ex-girlfriend!
Lucka Vondráčová has stepped into the territory of the Czech Republic, in one round.
He also pays attention wherever he comes from.
Last time she got into her arms, her former lover, Michal Longy, who lived with her for three years.
At the time, the actor was 12 years older and longed for his family.
Lucius was only 19 years old at the time, and she certainly did not complain about hanging her career on a cemetery.
So they went away from each other, but friends stayed until today.
Which they also proved at the TV Prima press conference, where they met for a while.
By chance, they were both in a blue color.
At first, they didn't notice themselves, but then they got close and Lucie laughed at Michal's jokes when she felt like she was in the belly.
Then they hugged and called the photographers willingly.
However, their meetings were not an accident, because they are playing a couple of miles together in the new Primy Captain Exner series.
In the United Kingdom, the Islamics received their lives to prepare for the assassination.
On Thursday, the British court sent four members of the Islamic cell to live on the network, who were called Three Musketeers, and according to the prosecutor's office, planned a terrorist attack on the police and the army.
Four men, two of whom took part in the training camp in Pakistan and were previously convicted of similar acts, were arrested in August.
At that time, the authorities thought they were going to attack immediately.
In one of the men's cars, security agents found a partially finished tube bomb, knives with inscriptions that in Arabic mean "unbelievable", and a machine gun.
It happened at a time when the MI5 Secret Service agent put the listening device in the car.
"The recent assassinations have shown what fear the charges could cause if they were not stopped," said prosecutor Sue Hemming.
Three convictions at 28, 25 and 33 years of age may apply for release after 20 years.
The fourth convicted person, who is 38 years old, can do it after 15 years on the grid.
The men in the process in London declared they were innocent and that the weapons found in the car were placed there by agent MI5.
The court also heard her, but then the defendants' claims were rejected.
Thursday was the hottest day of the year.
They measured 38.3 °C in Hodoninsk.
The Tuesday temperature record of 37.3 degrees Celsia remained at the peak for only two days.
At 38.3 degrees Celsia, which was recorded in The Watchtower in Hodoninsky, beat her Thursday, which has become the warmest day of this year.
This was confirmed by the staff of the Czech Hydrometeorological Constitution.
On Tuesday, but on Thursday, there were not many thermal records.
On Tuesday, 35 of the 145 meteorological stations measuring over 30 years were overrun or levelled.
On Thursday, record temperatures were recorded for only nine long time at the measuring stations.
Perhaps in the Watchtower, the fourth temperature was the same as the previous record of 2013.
In Lednica at Břeclavska, the initial maximum of 37.5 degrees was exceeded by four tenths of degrees and the current record of 37.1 degrees was exceeded by 3 tenths.
Both records as well as the Watchtower came from 2013.
In the west there were ten degrees less.
High temperatures appeared on Thursday mainly on the south and east of Moravia.
After the Watchtower, there was the biggest wind in the Dyjakovics on Znoemska and Brod nad Dyj nad Breclavska, where the mercury was evaporated to 37,8 degrees, but the record did not surpass.
On the other hand, for example, in western and northwestern Czech Republic, the ČHMU website has so far been the fourth highest temperature only around 22 degrees Celsius.
"The temperatures there started to grow until later this afternoon," the meteorologists reported.
The current weather in the Czech Republic will be gradually recharged according to the ČHMU, and more rain may come on Sunday.
Most Moravia sites, however, will remain high temperatures on Friday and in the southeast of Moravia and on Saturday.
China lacks tourists.
Beijing is losing billions due to visa policy.
China has been trying to apply its influence for decades without the use of force.
He spends ten billion dollars a year in support of language schools and the construction of universities abroad, pushing his entertainment industry into foreign markets and trying to attract Western tourists.
But Peking can't do that.
The dark state media are talking about a plan to make tourism a force for economic change and modernisation.
However, the number of arrivals increased only 3.8 per cent last year and approximately 80 per cent of tourists to China came from Hong Kong, Macaa and Taiwan.
It is appropriate, among other things, that despite all its global aspirations, China does not welcome foreigners just with open arms, assessing the situation in the world's most populous country professor of economics at the Beijing University Christopher Balding in an article for Bloomberg.
An example that speaks for everything is Chinese visa policy.
Only 13 countries have unbound contact with China, the citizens of these other countries have to deal with the visa with the front.
The Chinese authorities in the United States are therefore comparable to the Chinese New Year's celebrations.
The visa is worth $140, but if a person does not want to wait for long hours in front, he has to pay $100 and more for additional services.
Such restrictions will constitute significant economic obstacles.
Study Journal of Economics and Finance showed that the need for visas decreased the number of visitors in the country by 70 per cent.
In 2015, only two million Americans visited the mainland of China, while Hong Kong, which shares less than three percent of China's gross domestic product and lives there less than one percent of all its inhabitants, visited 1.8 million Americans.
China often deepens this problem by using tourism to achieve its political goals, for example in disputes with Taiwan and South Korea.
When China in spring restricted transportation to South Korea in a break around the South Korean missile system, the South Koreans paid it and China avoided it.
In May, the number of visits fell by 42 percent annually, while Japan recorded an increase by 85 percent.
All of this affects macroeconomic stability.
According to a recent report by the U.S. Central Bank, Fed was able to leave China as a result of Chinese foreign travels up to $190 billion, while China will receive approximately $35 billion per year in the context of its sales to tourists.
According to official balance of payments figures, China had a $217 billion deficit in tourism last year, which is equal to 44% of the total Chinese surplus in trade in goods.
A small number of tourists, that is, the country that carefully defends the flow of capital, are causing a very painful wound.
However, the above factors are only one manifestation of general restraint towards foreigners.
In many places in China, it's almost impossible for anyone to hear about immigrants.
More than a million foreigners lived in China in 2013.
There are more of them in the United States and some individual cities.
And Japan, which is not exactly the crossroads of immigration, has a double.
A number of scientific work shows, however, that immigrants usually revive economic growth, business and innovation.
But you can't find them in China.
To solve these problems will be politically demanding, but the step that is being taken is to simplify the visa.
Other Asian countries, particularly India and Vietnam, have recently made a great effort to simplify and reduce visa procedures.
If China wants more foreign tourists and their hard currency, it should be easier for them to get there.
In the plzen zoo, they multiplied deadlyly poisoned beaches.
The Plzeň Kingdom of the Journey can enjoy the youth of just three rare, mortally eaten beaches.
At the exhibition, visitors will see only all nine freshly born Turkish snakes.
This species lives in northern Anatolia, which is also 2000 metres above sea level.
"The length of the subway is growing," said the spokesperson zoo Martin Vobruba.
Young people of the other two species, mortals and red cobras, will still take power in the backyard.
We still can't tell when people will see them.
"We wouldn't like to lose them," said Dr. Miroslav Dohnal, saying it could take a year or two.
Australian snake mortals came into the world eight, they are descendants of a breeding couple from a population in the vicinity of Sydney.
"The only thing visitors can see at the exhibition is among those who died in Perth's area," Vobruba said, saying that it is necessary to winter 6-8 weeks at the temperature of 13 degrees Celsius in human care.
A percentage of success was achieved by the snooze of African swimmers of red cobras.
A couple in the pulsary zoo got out of four eggs of a total of four young men.
"The incubation lasted 65 days," added Vobrub.
This species in nature sprays poison on its victims, and it's up to four meters away.
He's looking at his eyes, he can cause permanent blindness.
Young people of all three species live in a zoo with mice.
Within 40 days in the garden, they still expect a drop from their mother's black dream, eggs are stored in the incubator.
According to the unverified phone call review, Trump creates pressure on Mexico for payment for the border wall
The U.S. newspaper Washington Post published a rewriting of President Trump's phone calls with leading representatives of Mexico and Australia.
In a phone conversation on January 27th with Mexican President Enrique Peño Niet, Trump ordered her to stop publicly reporting that she would not pay for the construction of the proposed wall.
The U.S. president told him that he was publicly judging the building of the wall, allegedly saying, "You can't talk like this in the press."
Trump in his campaign promised to build a wall along the southern border and reported that he would pay Mexico for it.
He also avoided his first call to the public with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, revealing a tense exchange of views.
President Trump told Turnbull that the U.S. Refugee Surveillance Agreement towards Australia is "mocky" and "mocky" and he insisted that if he agreed with such an agreement - which became President Obama's government - he would look like a "drugged" after he proposed a ban on the entry of refugees into the U.S.
Trump ended the call after he explained to Turnbull that "this is my most unpleasant call day".
Tusk spoke again at the D.A. for Smolensk.
"He has nothing to fear," said the President of the Government of Law and Justice PiS Jaroslaw Kaczyński at the address of the brother of the dead president.
"I have nothing to fear, Kaczynski doesn't scare me," Tusk said and read to the current leadership of the country that he is trying to abuse justice against political enemies.
At the departure of the prosecutor's office, he waited on Tuska on TV 24 dab, who was scandalizing Donald Tusk! and wanted a hundred-year policy!
Tusk thanked for his support and assured me that he had a clean conscience: "I have nothing to fear, and Kaczynski doesn't scare me."
He doesn't count on prosecutors according to his words, but he doesn't doubt that justice now has to serve the Polish rulers as a tool against enemies, opposition or people who don't like, and I'm afraid I belong to this group.
He's had a second in the interview.
Expremiér was questioned at the prosecutor's office again, this time had to be asked about the doubts about drinking the victims of the Smolen disaster.
In addition, there was a replacement of the bodies in the ribs.
The families were forbidden to open up cancers, and there must have been some reason for that.
And the reason was that they were afraid of the scandal, because it would make Polish-Russian relations more difficult.
"Maintaining good relations at any price, despite such horrific events, should serve to make Donald Tusk one of the most important in the EU," Kaczynski said on Catholic television Durvam.
He added that a possible conflict with Russia would deprive Tusk of the opportunity to obtain the most important chair in the Union, but Poland has nothing at all.
At the same time, Kaczynski declared that he had warned German Chancellor Angel Merkel that Donald Tuske could have had a different effect, but she didn't realize it.
Tusk filed an eight-hour investigation at the prosecutor's office on April 19th.
He didn't even speak as a suspect, just as a witness.
However, many of his appeals to the hearing were regarded as part of the obvious efforts of the Polish government and the head of PiS Kaczynski to discredit Tuska as a political rival in connection with various scandals.
The Prosecutor's Office shall be placed under the authority of the Minister of Justice in Poland, who shall play the role of the Attorney-General.
The appeal came after Tuska's election as head of the European Council, which Kaczynski tried hard but tried vainly to prevent, among other things, the visit of Merkel to Warsaw.
At the EU summit against the extension of the Tusk mandate, only Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydlová protested alone.
In this case, he left Warsaw on the reels and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.
Barma and Senegal.
Where can the Czechs love everywhere?
In the autumn parliamentary elections, registered voters will be able to re-vote the composition of a camera from Burma, Senegal or Luxembourg.
In these and several other countries, the Czech Republic has opened its offices since the last parliamentary elections in 2013.
It comes from a statement that regulates the delivery of ballot cards to a foreigner.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has prepared its update, currently under review.
Four years ago, ten thousand Czech citizens were elected as MPs abroad.
"Since the last update of the announcement in 2013, there have been some changes that need to be taken into account in these lists," the Ministry explains its approach.
"In some countries there have been new law enforcement agencies, some law enforcement agencies have been closed, and, where appropriate, there has been a change in the level of representation," the material says.
The notice shall contain two annexes, the first of which shall be the representative authorities to which the ballot cards are delivered.
This group includes representatives of the Czech Republic in neighbouring countries, i.e. Germany, Poland, Austria and Slovakia.
More than a hundred Czech authorities will receive ballot cards in print.
Their list of announcements is changing.
Four years ago, Czechs could choose for example at the Czech Embassy in Libya or Zimbabwe.
Today, both embassies are closed.
The Czech Republic also cancelled its participation in the Malaysian Bamak and Japanese Kyu.
He won't even be elected to the General Consulate in Donetsk.
The Czech Republic closed in 2014 due to the war in eastern Ukraine.
They are now on the list of embassies in Kenyan Nairobi, Senegalese capital Dakar and Zambian Lusace.
Since the last parliamentary elections in Asia, the Czech Republic has extended its representation on the General Consulate in Iraq and the Czech Republic, the capital of the province of S'Chchuan.
Voting cards will also be available for registered voters in Czech Embassys in Burma and Cambodia.
The Czechs have had the opportunity to elect deputies in the polls at the deputy offices or consulates four times so far.
In advance of each election, the State electoral commission shall determine the country for which the candidates are voted abroad.
This was the first time in 2002, when it was decided among the Yugoslav candidates.
In the following two elections, Czechs were elected abroad among Yugoslav candidates.
In 2013 the Central Czech Republic was chosen as this year.
The number of Czechs voting abroad is rising steadily.
At the premiere 15 years ago, about 3,800 people came to vote, in 2006 they were around 6700, four years later 8222.
In the early elections four years ago, 10,571 voters were taken to the embassy.
Masakr on Moore's Ford Bridge: Activists recalled racist lynching
Ford Mercury from 1948 traveled around the inhabitants of Monroe, Georgia, and went along the way to Moore's Ford Bridge.
However, before the car with four passengers of black platypus and the white driver had enough to get to the bridge, a group of whites with weapons had made his way.
The leader of the group - a middle-aged man in a dirty suit - for a long time came from a cigarette and stared at the front glass of the car.
The passengers were terrified inside.
"We want that n--a Roger!" said the man.
"Bring it to me!"
Quietly breaks the nest of a young black man who is pulled out of the co-pilot's seat.
Fortunately, this scene is only a reconstruction of the events that occurred on July 22nd.
But if one of the men goes through Roger's neck in the face, the obscurity is excited by excitement.
From 2005 to the Moore's Ford Bridge, a regular group of activists who rebuild that fate night of 1946, when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcolm and George and Mae Murra Dorsey - killed members of the Kukluxklan.
No one's been tried for murder yet.
"It is strange that in all those years there has not been a single person arrested - although we still see them in our community; even though we know their identity," Tyrone Brooks, who is helping to organize the reconstruction of the event, said.
"It's bad for our history and the burden in our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former congressman of the state of Georgia and a lifelong fighter for civil rights.
In his eyes, the reconstruction of the event represents a dramatic challenge to progress. Each year, Monroe’s community recalls that justice has not been done enough.
"We demand judicial review and closure, we want peace of mind and reconciliation, but justice above all," Brooks said.
"Until then, the process of healing and reconciliation cannot be initiated."
The doctor covers one of the bodies of the lynching victims at Moore's Ford on 27 July 1946.
According to the FBI reports received by NBC News, the lynching was to take part in up to 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding periods.
However, no one has ever been tried before.
Although suspects remain at large after decades of freedom, civil rights supporters claim that both causes of lynching - politics and sex - were known to all citizens of the city.
In April 1946, on the basis of the decisions of the Supreme Court, the black people of the state of Georgia were entitled to participate at least for the first time in the elections scheduled for the summer.
And right during the summer elections, according to the FBI, a black farmer named Roger Malcom had during the campaign to stab the landowners of the white plate Barnett Hester - allegedly because of his wife.
According to Brooks, it was tradition that Hester took care of Malcolm's wife, Dorothy, and brought her to a different state.
According to the statement of the FBI, on 25 July 1946, the then significant landowner of Loy Harrison's white plate for Malcolm's bail amounted to $600.
He was escorted to prison by Dorothy and his cousin Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
On their return from prison, just before entering Moore's Ford Bridge, a group of suspects took their way.
"As it turned out, the murders were planned and organised by Harrison," the FBI said.
“It is also clear that there has been a secret agreement between state and local law enforcement officers who not only participated in lynching, but also took away the evidence and hid the identity of the witnesses.”
Brooks made himself more specific about the whole thing.
"It was a massacre for electoral rights," he said.
"The murders had a clear subtext for all the locals of the black community: 'this is how you will be affected if you register and go to choose'."
The annual reconstruction of the event at Moore's Ford bridge is organised by Cassandra Greene for nearly ten years.
Its presentation is pictorial, fascinating and exciting. It shows deep rooted racism that many would like to see in modern America as extinct.
It's not easy to track this reconstruction and it's harder to turn the eye away, but Greene says it makes sense.
"No one wants to talk about lynching, because we have to face the unpleasant feelings that are hidden in each of us," Greene said.
"But there is no relationship between us unless you hear what I have to go through."
The main tests of this year's reconstruction began in June and immediately on the first day about 30 actors - a dozen whites, the rest of blacks - included in the room where Greene met with a very carefully planned performance.
Wade Marbaugh runs the position of assistant director.
For many years he played the leader of Kukluxklan, but according to his words, the role is exhausting.
"I have a bad feeling about it because it resists who I am," Marbaugh said.
"I think it is very important to remember this part of the story regularly, because we never want to go back to that time."
The actors Darrys Bradshaw and Nick Rascon, who play Roger Malcolm's role, Barnett Hester's role, are practicing.
The show begins with a show - Malcom deals with Hester and blames him for sleeping with his wife.
"Get out of my land--e!"
Rascona can't be found.
It's coming to the line.
At that moment, everyone (at least every black-skinned actor) will explode into laughter.
Greene laughs the most.
"What happened?" asks Rascon.
He's confused.
Was I too rude?
"No," Greene said.
“I just don’t think the whites used to say “n-r” in such a tone.”
"Precisely," one of the black-haired actors will shout.
"You have to put more emphasis on R."
Energy in the room is all of a sudden better; hostility replaces a sense of closeness.
Everyone wants it to be an authentic performance, just for the four victims of the massacre.
The actors repeat the scene.
Rascon this time emphasizes the correct expression of the word to N.
No one's laughing anymore.
The performance ends violently and quickly.
Riv, shot... and found silence.
A woman dressed in black stands over the bodies of actors and sings a sad song by Billie Holiday's Strange Fruit.
With every word in the room, there's a feeling of sadness.
Behind it all, about a dozen viewers are tearing out the pot and tears from their eyes.
In the neighborhood there are practically the same number of blacks and whites.
One couple traveled all the way from New York to Ithaca, a lot of people looking around them.
Each of them has a local wet climate for almost eight hours, and Brooks leads them to the graves of Malcolm and Dorsey.
To this point, the killing could have been looked at with a retreat, but now, standing at the same place where the lynching came to be, the atmosphere is terrible.
With the last words of a song, he will call on Greene's duffel looking at the inspection of the bodies.
The children kneel to the victims' heads, follow false blood and unmoved bodies and whisper something into their ears.
"They're not dead," the little boy whispers.
He'll run for a few minutes, and Greene thanks for the obscurity.
The actors are cleaning up the wool and they're tearing their tears.
Bradshaw includes Marbough, the man in the suit who played the leader of the Kukluxklan.
Nick Rascona embraces his two friends and cries in their arms; at last he has emotions.
"It's okay," one of the women whispers.
“We know you have a role to play.
But you had a reason."
Later the same day, he will sit in bed with the actor for dinner.
At one table, a young white couple are busy talking about a presentation with a black couple they met today.
Denise Duplinski barely found words that would express her feelings from today's show.
“It’s hard to listen to those bad words and look at the horrible things... that people who look like you do because they look like you,” she said to the reconstruction.
"It makes me realize that lynching is still the current theme," she added, "it's just called police lines."
On the other side of the room, Tyrone Brooks sits in the courthouse, enjoying dinner and talking about civil rights.
According to his own words, he was already planning a performance for another year.
"The reconstruction of these events is inspiring because it describes the fear we had to endure - but it is also a moment of thought," he said.
“If we don’t learn from it, who knows... it could happen again.
People who don't know and study the history of their countries are condemned to repeat it."
I love instructions for use.
One of my friends says that the instructions to use are just sly.
I disagree, on the contrary.
It's one of the modern forms of art, often surrealism.
With nostalgia I remember a long time ago, where the instruction to use anything was more of a rarity order.
So maybe my first gramophone contained only one paper, on which were hieroglyphics showing the involvement of some parts, there were some secret marks in all.
After years, when something happened inside, I offered the list to shaman who was not afraid to scratch the backboard.
He gave me a hint of what that paper with the labyrinth is worth.
Yes, it was a regular help when the toilet paper was chronically depleted.
He found a broken wire and allowed me to listen to precious vinyl pies again.
New age brought new instructions.
Even a relatively simple fruit-repellent, where the overcrowded grep simply held, demanded about ten images.
In particular, it was a outline of how to move one part into the other.
The combination was ambiguous and another procedure just wasn't possible.
On the contrary, it required considerable effort with the need to break certain plastic components.
My contempt for guidance ended with my self-motivated Seat Leon.
The year 2003 was still the year of production of such a booklet with detailed corrections, which included, among other things, the exchange of flashlight lamps.
It was simple.
A total of three steps and the work should be done.
Unfortunately, the author of the guide pointed out that while the lamp went to the right, it was really only in three steps.
One, take cover.
2. Rinse your flashlight and pick up a new one.
Third cover.
The lamp on the left had a problem in the way of placement of the battery cover.
At first I thought that I would pull the right top ends into the car to break down some supply, screw which he would cover easily and then drive points 1-3 of the savings author of the service book.
I don't think so.
The cover had no place, no space, no room for the bare hand of the Pope, so the Federal Slezan.
I've lost half an hour of my life, and it's completely without any success.
The condition was still reinforced by my wife's entrance to the garage, which he called for a ris and words that from my mouth heard quite exceptionally.
"What are you doing here?" she asked.
My answer lasted about 90 seconds, however, if I miss the vulgar terms, there are only two publishing words.
I'm changing the lamp.
"And why does it take you so long?" she ventured into a thread that could be her last in a long-lasting relationship.
I slowly explained the problem to her, focusing on the torture of the author of the instruction, where blessing with the iron on his hand that he wrote, after her grasping that he could never write again, was a mere introduction to the wide scale of Kladiv's instruction on the witch, including his commissional fire on the top of the Losin Castle.
"What do you want to do with that box?" the woman passed the battery.
In a clear despair it came and then step 1-3 was as easy and quick as the right side.
I thought nothing could surprise me.
And that's until the day my colleague called me, who was just talking about collapsing condition after two State Drug Control Officers.
I know her as a well-balanced colleague who has experienced impossible in the field and who can also interpret wild stories with unrestrained voices.
"Just imagine that I've been punished for not having a high hand-to-hand instruction," he told me with a weak voice.
Gradually, I faced him with a whole problem, which was that he didn't have an image of a washing machine in his hands.
His argument to the Commission official that adults are usually able to wash their hands and that there is no need for icons to manage the usual activity of decent people, has no beneficial effect and has become a lot of money.
"It's not just like that," she told him.
He realized that the simple softening of the dipped hands of running water is a primitive action at the level of the chromium, that a modern man, Homo sapiens sapiens, carries out this ritual in ten steps.
So it's necessary to tell you that it's necessary to get out of the water.
The whole process has eleven points in total, but in the end it's a joy to find that a man has washed his hands exactly the way he's ordered a crash from SÜKL.
Finally, I have to point out that I've been inspired and I'm preparing a detailed plan of action on the toilet.
In the case of defecation, the procedure is uniform, the problem does not arise, in the case of urine, given a certain difference between the two sexes, it will be necessary to hang the two instructions.
The problem remains those icons, because creating a perfect procedure means also a precise description of all anatomical details, which could cause a certain recovery to be caused by a careful visitor's toilet, since it can finally find out that he has been opening his entire life with a completely faulty procedure.
Pearson will release another 3000 employees and reduce dividends in an attempt to revive trade
On Friday, the British Pearson Education Group stated that it would release another 3,000 employees and reduce the temporary dividend by 72 per cent in response to another restructuring programme in order to change the business model.
A further wave of release, to which, according to Executive Director John Fallon will come at the end of 2018 and from the beginning of 2019, follows the previous decision of the company to release 4,000 employees in the framework of the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced a cost reduction plan of another 300 million pounds (394 million) in May under the third programme to reduce costs in an effort to create a declining trade as a result of the rapid development of digital education.
The company, which agreed last month to sell its share in the Penguin Random House of Bertelsmann, stated that the outlook for this year remained unchanged after it announced a one-percent increase in basic sales in the first half of the year to 2.05 billion pounds.
Attack on the convoy in Kabul: NATO soldiers were killed in a suicide blast
A suicide assassin attacked a military convoy in the capital of Afghanistan, Kabul. In the attack, one NATO soldier died and several others were injured, officials introduced.
Five soldiers and a translator were injured, as NATO said.
According to informal reports, three civilians died during an attack in the city of Qarabagh.
This month, Afghanistan launched a bomb attack - over 30 people were killed on Tuesday during an explosion in a heroic mixture.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
In its statement, NATO stated that the Tuesday explosion occurred after monitoring with members of the Afghan army attacked “local person with a sub-manufactured explosive device”.
The declaration further states that all wounded soldiers are beyond the risk of life and are located in an American military hospital at the base of Bagram.
According to the rapporteurs, the increasing power of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in the area of Qarabagh is a significant source of concern to NATO's allies in the nearby Bagram.
According to the UN, at least 1662 civilians died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, 20 % of whom died in the capital.
At the end of July, at least 30 people died in a car bomb in the Kabul district of Shia.
The Taliban signed up for the attack.
On 31 May, a large explosion in the city centre killed more than 150 people. It is the most deadly militant attack in the country since the US troops threw the Taliban government in 2001.
Violence is undermining the already questionable situation in Afghanistan, and US President Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of American soldiers who should help military units and police in the country.
According to the rapporteurs, the suicide attacks that he has experienced in recent weeks have raised public confidence in the government, its regulation, and in particular in the reputation of President Ashraf Ghanín.
In response to the complaint, the EPA reassessed its decision to remove smoking rules
The U.S. Environment Agency withdrew its decision to postpone the Obama Administration Act, which ordered States to reduce emissions, only the day after the Agency had appealed to 15 States.
The EPA announced its decision to apply the 2015 Ozone Standards in the middle of the night, saying that it is proposing the Agency’s commitment to cooperation with the States.
"We believe in dialogue with our state partners and we will listen to their views," said EPA Director Scott Pruitt in a statement.
Pruitt announced in June that it was attempting to remove the ozone standards - which measure actual air pollution in specific areas of the country and on the basis of the measurement, they set the limits to be met by October 2018.
A group of fifteen of the majority of democratic states, together with Washington, D.C., filed a complaint on Tuesday, arguing that the EPA negotiations are illegal.
The administration of President Donald Trump seeks to prevent many environmental regulations that former President Barack Obama has proposed - according to Trump's words, in an effort to boost economic growth.
However, the new government's efforts have led to countermeasures by Democrats and Conservatives who fear the impact of emissions on public health.
The EPA on its websites states that breathing air with ozone content "can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms", such as asthma.
The singer Ladislav Bubnár got the wound and flow of blood!
This, in our relatively new singer, may have already been recorded in June this year, when this almost unknown singer has arranged a monstro action against us in Czech terms, which he has hated such leading personalities as Master Karel Gott, Lucie Bílá, Simona Krain and a number of others, and the action has no one but Leoš Marès.
The purpose was to show himself to the public and to present his music video to the song of Sarah, whose baptism was lost to the newly named personalities.
But few people already know that the solo film of the video that took place in Russia did not go through without problems and the solo singer Ladislav Bubnár had to be treated.
It was his first big film with Russian national ballet stars and it didn't go through without a bad trap.
Sarah's song is very emotional and is based on unhappy love of two lovers.
For the dramaticity of the scene, the video of the singer’s juice had to indicate the impact of the façade.
At one point, however, he struck him so strongly and directly into the nose that the young singer had to be treated by doctors.
"It was a morning, I didn't expect it, immediately coming down from my nose," said Ladislav.
Colleagues and producers said the situation on the spot was an unfortunate accident and Ladislav was unable to react in time.
Fortunately, the injury was not so serious as to affect the continuation of another film.
The young artist's video we're bringing to you now, you can also record the scene with the impact.
Unannounced version with blood, but it wasn't better used.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomačenko spoke at a meeting on opportunities for mutual duel
Vasyl Lomačenko and Mikey Garcia, two boxers who could stage the most puzzling boxer match in light weight, met for the first time at the Tuesday meeting.
Each of them was in a separate room at ESPN's offices in Los Angeles, while Garcia - an unbeatable champion in the World Boxing Council Lightweight League - did not go down to the hall where Lomačenka welcomed the champion in the World Boxing Organization.
After Garcia's victory on the basis of a unanimous decision against the former four-time World Champion Adrien Broner in the showtime Saturday match, both boxers got on the list of five best boxers in a light weight.
Garcia pulled his trigger and said: “How's it going, champ?
Good luck."
She defends her title against Miguel Marriaga on the ESPN Saturday at 19:00.
The boxers pose for photographers and the manager of the Egis Klimas, adds that the potential combination of the boxers would be "perfect test".
"I'm an ex-tampering champion," Garcia says.
“I had to pick up a match with Broner (67 kg), but I'm not that big.
I'm a little on my 63 kg.
I'd like to go back to the light weight category.
It's got to be done again to get on a light weight... and then we can get on.
That's what fans want.
Why don't you fill it out for them."
The hammer agrees.
"The box would benefit this game."
The climate has required payment for viewing - which is part of its strategy. The team should complete its debut in a lightweight tie at the end of this year and next year fight with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts) who also expressed an interest in the match against the duel Jorge Linares vs. Luke Campbell, who competes on 23 September for a title in a lightweight tie in the Forum arena.
"The pact should be conducted in the style of payment for watching, as the fans are asking," said Garcia, who later said that an opportunity was open to send the match through the television station, which will come with the best offer.
“We are the main attraction.
No one else draws such attention to himself.
We'll wait for the right opportunity..."
Garcia said that he recognized Lomačenka as "a great boxer" and could participate in his Saturday match.
But he didn't give Garcia the praise when he said that the three divisions of Riverside seemed "very slow... sorry to Mike, but you're saying knockout."
Garcia said his goal was to show strength and then a box.
Both boxers indicated that they felt a growing tension in front of each other’s duel.
“You will not forget this game.
No other match is worth so much attention.
And with great comfort, I'll put it in the fire," Garcia said.
"I've been waiting for the best boxers, and this is Mikey."
It'll be a great match."
A young couple 12 years ago disappeared without a trace.
Their cars have now been found at the bottom of Volha.
Two young Russians Ilja Žirnov and Kira Čerkasov have been missing since December 2005.
There was widespread search for them, but without success.
And the police finally ended the investigation for lack of evidence.
The families of the lost couple lived in uncertainty that they wouldn't know what happened.
After 12 years there was a sad wedding of the whole story.
The wreck of their car found a lay submarine at the bottom of the Volha River in the city of Čeboxsary in Chuvaška.
Thanks only to the documents left in the car, the police managed to identify a few.
The documents survived the whole decade under water, and without them, the police would have been long enough to find out who they were.
A couple were last watched when Jirnov borrowed his father's car so he could pick up his girlfriend from work.
The diver who discovered the car is still anonymous.
He reported his findings to the Cheboxar police who pulled the car the next day on the beach.
Investigators believe that the death of a young couple was an accident caused by a narrow road leading along the river.
However, the investigation continues and further details will be published after its completion.
Latest results of testing for the age limit of asylum applications in Sweden
The latest results of the testing of asylum seekers in Sweden, who have been detailed in the new method of their age, show that over 80 percent of people were questioned as older than 18 years, but not everyone believes their accuracy.
Swedish Medical Agency (Rättsmedicinalverket) started new tests at the beginning of this year.
The aim of the method is to assess the asylum applications more accurately. The measure was accepted after the Swedish Migrationsverket was criticised for its failure to determine the right age for some refugees who lied about their age.
To date, the Swedish Migration Agency has submitted 6880 cases to be investigated and the Forensic Medical Agency has now published a total of 2481 tests carried out from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
80 per cent (2002) was considered to be 18 years of age, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medical Agency found that the question was "maybe 18 years of age".
In another 423 cases, it was decided that the question was "maybe younger than 18 years".
Tests shall be granted only if the age of the contested is at issue.
According to Johan Gåranson of the Forensic Medical Agency, the results correspond to the previous month.
"In contrast to last month, statistics are kept in busy trains and the numbers are very similar," The Local said.
A higher number of asylum seekers whose age was estimated at 18 years of age do not necessarily mean that asylum seekers lie at their age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and indicated that in 442 cases it was found that "the person concerned is 18 years of age or older".
News Svenska Dagbladet investigated 581 published cases and found that in 243 cases he indicated that he was 18 years of age.
Critics have also come across a medical method of age determination, which includes X-rays of the teeth of wisdom and MRI scans of knee joints, which are subsequently judged by dentists and X-rays.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, which deals, among other things, with the assessment of the biological maturity of the people to determine the age when the person concerned went through puberty.
“I had reason to think about this problem and I do not think that these types of age assessment measures are correct.
The assessment of the biological age is, in a sense, very improbable.
If we can't determine the age with accuracy, we shouldn't pretend otherwise," Metro said.
The forensic medical agency Agency's GÃ©ransson defended the decision: “In general, the risk of misconception of a child as an adult is small.
The highest risk is the fact that the person in question is under the age of 18, which in this case corresponds to 10 percent of all those in question."
Trump was threatening the president of Mexico on the phone.
U.S. President Donald Trump, in his January phone call to Mexican President Enrique Peñov Niet, threatened that he would not meet with him if he would publicly say that his country would not pay for building a wall between the United States and Mexico.
Trump in the interview said that the financing would somehow be set up, even though he assumed it would have to be secured from other sources.
Similarly, Trump spoke openly to Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
It comes from the interviews that the American newspaper The Washington Post published on Thursday.
Trump has built a wall on the southern border for Mexican money as one of the main promises in his last election campaign.
In the first conversation with the Mexican president shortly after the entry into the function of Trump Peña Neta, the non-diplomatic karal was not able to be critical of his plan to build a wall.
The southern neighbour has solved as a growing political problem and pressured the Mexican president not to publicly say that his government will never pay for the wall.
"You can't say this press," Trump said over and over again in the January 27th interview and threatened to interrupt contacts with the Mexican president if he continues to issue a polite statement.
It's like financing's gonna come up with something and eventually it's gonna work out.
"But if you say Mexico won't pay for the wall, then I don't want to meet you gentlemen anymore because it's unacceptable for me," said Trump, according to the American newspaper.
Now he has identified the least important thing we're talking about, but politics may be the most important thing.
The executive command to build the wall Trump issued shortly after the takeover of power.
Mexico refuses to build and finance a wall of 3200 kilometers long, which has resulted in both countries' relations being won.
At the end of March Trump said the project would be paid by the United States.
Trump finally met with his Mexican opponent for the first time at the July G20 summit in Hamburg.
The Washington Post also reported on Trump's phone conversation with Australian Prime Minister Turnbull on 28 January.
The head of the White House called the conversation a joke.
To this end, it has been replaced by an exchange of views on the agreement that Australia will provide asylum to the Central American refugees in exchange for the acceptance by the United States of persons from international facilities in the Pacific States.
Trump first considered the deal stupid, but later he joined her.
"You can certainly say that this is not the agreement you made, but you will have to stick to it," said Trump Turnbull.
In some passports, the phone conversation with Turnbull was almost horrific, for example when Trump considered the good idea of Australia's refusal to accept refugees sailing in ships.
"You're worse than me," Trump joked.
Suddenly, though, the conversation was over.
"I hate the reception of these people," Trump remarked.
I assure you they're wrong.
That's why they're in jail now.
"There won't be great people going to work for local milkers," he said.
In the interview, he also pointed out that in five years the fugitive could become an assassin from Boston.
Trump led at the end of January, about a week after coming to the White House, telephone conversations with a number of world states, often even during one day.
The conversation with Turnbull finally marked the least pleasant one for the whole day.
Before he finished, he pointed out that he had already had a pleasant conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
They fixed the man who killed Rana before the dam.
He looked at her father, too.
The repair was carried out at the square in the capital of Yemen Saná.
Muhammad al-Maghrabi chose the little Ran Almatari who lived in his neighborhood for his sacrifice.
Al Maghrabi kidnapped the girl, took her father's home, where he raped her and stabbed her with his bare hands.
He then raped her body, which then hit the body close to the mixture.
The violent death of a little girl struck the whole country facing the threat of civil war.
Yahya Almatari stood in the first row of thousands of gifts that he met to become a witness to the correction.
Muhammad al Maghrabi was sentenced under the law of the Sharia.
The victim's father communicated his feelings to the media after repair.
I feel like I'm reborn.
I'm relieved.
It's the new day of my life.
Other members of the family were present, along with the crowd, shouting the password "Let justice live".
The attacker on the scene brought in a police van that he was pulled out of.
The police put him on the chest.
One of his supporters turned his weapon against him and fired fire from the immediate vicinity.
The present day celebrated every morning that was burned.
Mr. al Almatari told the MailOnline website that justice was done in accordance with the country's legal system.
"Justice, Allah and the right of the Sharia won," he added.
I was standing at the Space of Liberation in Sana and waiting for my daughter's killer to be corrected.
Then my family and I went to the morgue.
We took Ranina's tiny body and buried him in a nearby cemetery.
My wife and I, Jamileh, are grateful that justice has been done.
The police were afraid that the dust gathered in the square would fall into the hateless madness, the killer would fall and gloat.
The correction was ordered by a court under the administration of the Shiite Huts.
Originally, however, Maghrabi was sentenced to 100 wounds immediately after his arrest, but his act sparked such rebellion that the judge decided to punish him.
Al Maghrabi was arrested two days after the girl disappeared on June 27th.
The wounded family knew him well.
When the police searched his house store, they found evidence that a man was planning his act.
Mr. Almatari described him as a creature.
What could have been his motive?
Even animals would be more merciful to the wound.
"Our family doesn't have enemies, and the injury that brought Ranina's body was terrible," the media said.
"The morning disappeared on the afternoon, we announced it to the police that day, we told the newspapers and all our television stations, posters with her photo hung everywhere," he continued.
Everyone thinks the police got a tip from the killer parents who suspected their son of a horrible crime.
The girl's mother, Jamileh, had to be hospitalized after she learned that her daughter's body had been found.
The morning she was out playing with the other kids from the neighborhood.
After 10-15 minutes, I went out to see where she was.
We were looking everywhere, but Rana was gone.
We walked around our block, our friends took the cars and drove around, but we were looking for nothing.
The Yemeni people were abused by crime and began to gather in front of the police station where al-Maghrabi was held and to demand immediate punishment.
The representative of the Ministry of Justice read the current record of the investigation to calm it down.
The accused, according to all his actions, did not show any pity.
Just before the execution of the sentence, the police read his judgment, but the convicted man was only looking at his rector for the summer.
The whole event was filmed for national television, but there were many recordings on the internet that he ordered.
West Virginia Governor announced political change
The Democratic Governor of West Virginia Jim Justice announced on Thursday evening at the meeting of President Trump that he is going to the other side.
"Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have turned their backs on me," said the Governor of Justice.
"Today, after a long prayer and meditation, I announce to you... today as a West Virginia resident, I say that I can no longer support you from the position of democratic governor."
The audience’s presence was filled with joy.
"I will join the Republicans tomorrow," Justice added.
"As a coach, I can tell you that it's time to jump into another match."
Trump had already promised people an important announcement at a meeting in West Virginia.
Trump won 42 points in West Virginia and Justice did not support democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, which is the only billionaire in the country, according to Forbes magazine, was elected in 2016.
Forbes adds that Justice inherited a large estate from his father and owns several coal mines.
The value of his property is estimated at $1.59 billion.
In the meantime, the Republican National Committee issued a statement on Thursday evening, stating: "The Government of Justice's move is another morning for the democratic side, which puts us on the road, instead of making a commitment to raising our country."
"For the democratic side, which has only 15 governors and has at least the legislative authorities in history, the announcement by the Governor of Justice is the last step for the so-called leader-in-chief who is desperately trying to find a positive and unified report," President RNC Ronna McDaniel stated in his statement for CBS News.
Sebastian Coe commends Russia's "fair" excuse for the doping scandal
Former prominent sportsman Sebastian Coe commended Russia on Thursday for an honest apology for the doping scandal, but repeated that the right time had not yet come for Russia to return to the sports world.
The chief of the Russian athletes Dmitry Shylakhtin said at the IAAF Congress - which took place on the night before MS in the athlete - that his country's expulsion from the sports world was right and that he was determined to fight doping.
He apologized to “all athletes who thus lost gold and silver medals.”
Despite his comments, members of the IAAF Congress voted to retain the ban that entered into force in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) reported that Russia supported doping its athletes.
"I think we have witnessed very honest responses and presentations today," IAAF Sebastian Coe told reporters.
"All members of the Council and Congress were pleasantly surprised that Russia has admitted its error and is working with all the strengths to correct and restore the proper function of the whole federation."
Coe said he was also "enjoyed", that Russia had accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think that today has been very successful and we have stepped to another stage, but the Congress supports the recommendation of the crisis staff to maintain the punishment that was imposed on Russia," Coe added.
"In the coming months, we have to do everything we can to stabilise the situation.
Our effort has always been to separate decent athletes from those who are rude," he concluded.
At MS in the sport, which starts on Friday in London, 19 Russian athletes who have complied with the strict IAAF rules will compete under the neutral flag.
The head of the crisis team IAAF Rune Andersen said Monday that Russia still has to meet several criteria before it is allowed back.
The drug presence tests are still unsatisfactory and the exclusion of coaches continues to operate, he told reporters in London after the presentation of the IAAF Council.
The Czech Trade State Order received Františka Savova, whose state is silent.
The Czech Trade State Pro-Export Agency received a public contract from the Young Front of Františka Savova.
Officials gave him 100 percent points in all qualitative criteria.
They did not mind, however, that the Czech State complained to Sava about tax fraud and asked for his release to the Czech Republic.
The pro-export agency of the Czech Trade Ministry of Industry and Trade issued a public contract in April to provide editorial content for the BusinessInfo portal for four years.
A total of 30.8 million crowns received a contract from the Young Front of the company Františka Savova.
However, the Czech police have already accused him of tax evasion in 2014 and is suing him for his escape.
Savov fled to Great Britain, and the Czech Republic asks for his release.
For the case, the server alerted Current.cz.
According to the original Czech Trade criteria, the award of the contract had to be determined by 60% of the price offered and by the remaining 40 beauty competitions, i.e. the quality of the project.
In fact, it was the second criterion that helped the company of Sava’s company.
According to Dotyk.cz, she received 100 points in all the partial quality criteria.
As a result, she was moved to another candidate, the Vltava Labe Media VLM publishing company, which offered a better price.
While the Young Front operated 404 900 crowns a month, VLM offered 324 350 crowns.
Unlike the Young Front, however, it was obtained from assessors in all qualitative criteria of a sub-average rating, a total of 62 points.
The company BDO Advisory and Digital Agency R-Media, which is also part of the server Aktuální.cz under the publication Economy.
VLM published several objections to the outcome of the trend, considering its evaluation to be unfair and insufficiently substantiated.
Following their refusal, it was decided to attack the competition with the Authority for the protection of the economic competition of the ÚOHS.
The Czech Trade is believed to have been in violation of the law.
"The proposer is convinced that the tenderer has reached the decision to select a public contract supplier on the basis of the draft subjective assessment, clearly favouring the participant of the Young Front, etc., on behalf of the proposer and other suppliers," the proposal on the start of the OUHS procedure this week, which published the server Currently.
According to the Director-General and the chairman of the VLM Michal's delegation, the position of the selection committee appears as an incredible and significant evaluation of the Young Front project by all its members as an extraordinary suspect.
"Every independent observer must view such a miraculous success of one of the competitors as unlikely and suspicious," the current Climate said.
The Czech Trade has not yet expressed itself to the situation.
The Czech Trade Agency essentially does not comment on public contracts prior to their closure.
All information about you is published in the Job Profile and in the Public Orders Journal in accordance with the law.
"After the end of the contract, a full written report will be published, but during the duration of the contract, we cannot express ourselves about its course," said Dotyk.cz media representative of the agency Štěpán Dlohý.
The young front responded by saying that it was extremely problematic that the publishing of the economy was affected by the article in Aktuální.cz to the competition where it had its own commercial interests.
However, this fact was set out in that Article.
In her tender, she could help by providing the BusinessInfo editorial service portal in the previous four years.
For the first time in 2013, she complained when the Ministry of Industry and Trade led Martin Cuba ODS.
Františka Savova blames the police for the tax evasion in connection with the excessive tax rebates of his company, which has caused the Czech state a alleged damage to up to 770 million crowns.
The Czech Republic has been asking the United Kingdom to issue it since 2014.
According to Savov, he is behind his criminal chief of the ANO Andrej Babish movement, whose influence is the Mafra publishing.
Last year, the London court rejected Savov's appeal against the issue, but the businessman appealed.
"From our point of view, the case from yesterday has not moved anywhere, from Great Britain to the acquisition of the legal power of judgment, we have not yet received any understanding," said Štěpánka Zenklová, spokesperson for the Prague City State Office.
In addition to the ownership of the Young Front, Savov was represented in the company Harvey Limited with a seat in Cyprus, which was owned by the Czech Buddhist beer maker Samson, and in the Cypriot company Maraflex, which is profiled as an investment fund that buys dangerous assets.
It should also be owned by the company Heavy Machinery Services, previously Legios, which owes more than three billion crowns.
In the past, Sav was also linked to the extraction of property from a former Socialist Youth Union.
The motorbike drove down the halls and the park, ended up in the quad.
The motorcyclist directed attention to an independent ride through the streets, walkways and parking tickets in Úšović.
When the watch began to chase him, he decided to take her in the direction of the scene.
"Polices of men with increased caution pursued the city when on one of the sideways behind the Marian Laznas failed to manage and drove with a motorcycle into the field where he was crashing," said police spokesman Daniel Dvořák.
Finally, he had to fly to a rescue helicopter that transported the injured motorist to a hospital in Plenary.
The police later found that the motor driver had a wrong driving licence, the registration marks on the motorcycle were cut off, his production number was broken off and his own production label was removed.
It's so possible that the machine was stolen.
The origin of the motorcycle is the subject of another investigation.
"A breath test was performed on the site of the driver’s presence of alcohol, but the test found a positive result on the substance methamphetamine," the police spokesperson added.
As financial rules for football affects Neymara’s move to Paris
The rules restricting the financing of European football clubs do not in any way disrupt Neymar's record transition from Spanish Barcelona to French Paris-Saint Germain.
Any punishment for Paris Saint-Germain will be carried out by EUFA, which oversees European football teams and has the power to ban teams from participating in the prestigious league of champions.
The financial fair play rules (FFP) introduced by UEFA in 2011 provide that the PSG will have to prove that Neymar's transition has not been financed without significant losses.
Barcelona has only paid EUR 222 million in a recosting to buy Neymar out of his contract and Neymar will claim a salary of several tens of millions a year.
It follows several financial conditions of Neymar's transition to France.
Given that the PSG team is funded by a rich cathartic family that has been rich in the sale of energy, it can allow Neymara to bring such a star football family.
Clubs may be lost to buy players a huge amount, but on the other hand they have to prove the legal sources of revenue, which enables them to cover the direct costs of trading activities related to football.
The FFP introduced Michel Platini after reaching the seat of the Director of UEFA in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that would owe themselves to new forces in the hunt would ultimately cheat and risk bankruptcy if banks or owners refused to provide.
In 2011, the FFP's rules redirected its attention from club debts to monitoring their losses.
This change meant that the business model used by Roman Abramovich and Chelsea in 2003 - buying a potential club and losing the horrendous amounts for players y to build a global brand - suddenly it wasn't so beneficial.
During the current three-year trial period ending in 2018, clubs may lose up to EUR 30 million.
And despite the fact that Platini had to leave his post in 2015, his successor Alexander Cheferin was determined to defend the prohibition of excessive loss.
"The FFP rules are still in force and we decide to strengthen them in the future," said Press Associated Andrea Traverso last week, who is monitoring compliance with the FFP rules.
Although the PSG has paid the amount for the purchase of Neymara in a one-off payment, it may extend the amount for accounting purposes throughout the duration of the contract.
Neymar signed a five-year contract, so the transfer can be signed at EUR 44.4 million per year for five years.
The first wave of the highest sanctions of the FFP struck in 2014 the PSG together with Manchester City, which owns Abu Dhabi.
The PSG received a fine of EUR 60 million (US$ 82 million) - which was later reduced to EUR 20 million - and an order to reduce the team of the League of Masters to 21 players in the 2014-2015 season, instead of 25 players.
UEFA is paying attention to teams that can try to maintain financial regulators by increasing their revenues through clubs-related companies.
Therefore, even if the company sponsors the PSG as soon as the financing exceeds the value of the standard market rate, UEFA shall be entitled to prohibit the calculation of the amount.
A similar measure was introduced by UEFA in 2014 after it decided that the amount of funding provided by Qatar Tourism Authority to the PSG team was too high.
According to some reports, the share of Neymar’s PSG revenues could be replaced by the MS’s organisational commission at the 2022 football in Qatar.
However, PSG and MS 2022 representatives in Qatar objected to the fact that Neymat should become MS ambassador in football and that such a manoeuvre would be easy to detect by UEFY.
The previous sanctions imposed on the PSG mean that UEFA will closely monitor any attempt to comply with the rules,
According to UEFA, the Tuesday-expressed dedicated persons did not initiate any investigation in the case of Neymara’s infringement into the PSG.
The source of this report wanted to remain anonymous, as the situation with PSG is not allowed to comment, the Agency The Associated Press stated.
The last published accounts show that the PSG closed 2015-2016 with a net profit of EUR 10 million and a turnover of EUR 542.4 million.
The accounts for the current financial year have not yet been published.
The PSG expects the arrival of Neymara to be a huge opportunity for sponsors, merchandising and clothing sales.
The club from signing the contract promises to increase the turnover by up to 30 percent.
The representatives of the Spanish league, obviously concerned with the departure of one of the largest stars, sought to eliminate Neymar's departure, arguing that the PSG would violate the rules of the FFP.
"It's a clear case of the "financial doping" club and the state," said the president of La Ligy Javier Teba for the Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the property of the PSG club as a catalysed syndicate.
The manager of Arsenal Arsen Wenger, whose club owns an American sports magnet, shares the same position as La Ligy on the financing of the club.
"This is the consequence of property that has changed the world of football from its foundations in the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"As soon as the club's owner becomes, everything is possible.
Compliance with the rules of financial fair play is very difficult because the state may have different interests in participating such players in its club."
Partanian hostage Russian: Changes are painful, but we have to believe.
Sixteen thousand applauding fans on their feet.
Tomash Rosky's going to the square.
Same scene as Sunday's fight against Bohemians.
The Spartan treasurer pushed against the Red Star game, invented several heads, but his partners did not die in black.
The flight team, powered by new multimillion forces, ends after the start of the European Cup.
Was it hard to do anything else after the Belgrade gates?
Four shots had to be fired after the incarcerated throat, which was hard for us.
At least we didn't want to lose, to raise our minds to get back from what we had to do in other fights.
We had a chance.
We have to work together as a team and move our game.
Why couldn't Sparta get into the fight so long?
The game is very elaborate.
The combination of rivals was much better than ours.
We didn't get anything, we shot once in a while.
That's, of course, very little if you have to win two or three goals.
The second half was much better, we managed to play with them in the final third.
But you have to push your opponents more often into such positions.
Is there a problem with a large number of changes in the structure?
Of course, it's one of the pain when a new team is formed.
We only played three competitions and the composition is still changing.
It's about the coach finding the perfect eleven who's sitting down.
Is it an encouragement to you that you've already played part of two matches?
They're still just part of the game.
I don't know how my condition will develop and when I can finally play from the beginning.
Are you still optimistic about the changes that have occurred in Sparta?
We have to be, otherwise it can't be.
It's the same as the wound.
If you don't believe it, you can't come back.
Sparta decided somehow, we have to be optimistic, otherwise the situation will be even worse.
The fans came again in large numbers, but they went out in despair.
What can you tell them?
There was a wonderful visit again, just like with God.
I'm so sorry we can't make them happy with better performance.
Lead something they'll come for next time.
We can thank them for coming.
I don't remember such visits when I played here fifteen years ago.
Could it be a season with no cupboards at least as a benefit to the league?
So far, we're fighting each other, we're getting involved, so it's not such an advantage for us.
In the event of an extreme tax evasion, the operator shall stay for ten years.
The Constitutional Court rejected the complaint by Jiří Toman, who has been sentenced to a considerable fine for ten years in prison.
The estimated damage is 645 million crowns.
Toman argued in the complaint that justice violated his fundamental rights, the actual finding of the courts in Zlina and Olomouci are perhaps incomplete.
However, the Constitutional Courts identified the complaint as unwarranted, found the CJK from the Court’s database.
The U.S.S. is not another appeal court.
"It is not possible, as a fourth instance, to assess the actual or legal doubts alleged to have been allowed by the General Court, if they do not represent violations of constitutionally protected rights and freedoms," the resolution states.
Toman was tried as a fugitive.
The verdict has been valid since November 2015, when it was confirmed by the Supreme Court in Olomouci.
At that time, Toman was in an issue in Argentina, where he was also in the time of the decision of the ÚS.
The penalty imposed is legal interest on the upper limit, which according to the verdict corresponds to the damage caused.
The Supreme Court referred the case to the extreme tax evasion which has a macro-economic impact on the state budget.
The man acted in 2005 to 2008 as Chairman of the World Service Representation.
The damage of 645 million crowns occurred only during the period from January to July 2008, the total escape from the knowledge was over billion.
For procedural reasons, however, it was no longer possible for Toman to pay the full amount.
According to the complaint, World Service did not include all invoices in its tax confession.
Instead of monthly VAT and consumer taxes, at least tens of millions of crowns have been taxed only in statistics.
World Service and some of the companies with which the company was trading have a relationship with Radomír Electoral, whose justice has been measured for VAT machining in trades with 13-year-olds in prison.
His complaint was also rejected before the Constitutional Court.
The series "Friday for Survival" and "Comrade Detective" play on the nostalgic string
This iteration is nostalgic for the characters of the famous 80s; so for the dirty 90s (when genius David Wain and Michael Showalter introduced the MTV comedy "The State"); and, of course, for modern times, especially in 2001, stars such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd discussed larger projects.
As a cultural artifact, it is a light parody and at the same time the embellishment of our modern facebook age of lasting memories.
But from the French point of view, it looks like someone's breathing.
The "First Day of Camp" series worked surprisingly well - not only because of absurd humor (for example, the story of the creation of a talkative box with a vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
The authors turned away from the main point of view - middle-aged actors who play the teenage children - and could not hide from previous events.
The continuation of "Ten Years Later", in which adults play not so much pressure on the emotional plane and satire is places to sporadic, including parodys on thrillers from the 1990s as "Hand on the cobblestone".
At one point the building will find on the collection of Apple Powerbook, Wheelchairs and "many other things from 1991".
Many main history lines are repeated.
Mr. Shawalter, the writer, has not yet moved through his love to Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still panicking.
Not to mention a crazy trick involving Ronald Reagan (including Mr. Showalter), which George H. W. Bush (very well-contained Michael Ian Black).
As always, the best part of the French are many side stories.
It is especially fun to watch forever young Rudda with long hair alias of Matt Dillon from the Young Film, whose once-honored character Andy is now an old paprika.
Frenchmen could start moments of random madness, as if they would return to the "Seven Up" series, until they reach what I assume will be a logical reasoning: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", when in the last stage the whole group will be released to the "Flights for Survival".
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon, meanwhile, appeals to another type of nostalgia: Revivalism of the Cold War series "So Normal American", the movie "Atomic Blonde: No Regret" and even the "GLOW" series, in which icons meet the Eastern and Western Wrestling scenes.
The comedy of authors Brian Gatewood and Alessandra Tanaka in the Rhyse Thomas mode is supposed to act as a television scene: a drama about two Bucharest policemen from Romania in the 1980s who fought for truth and atheism in the way of Marxism-Leninism.
The main roles - the charming Gregor and the idealist Joseph - are Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Street, which were provided in the English language Channing Tatum (executive serial producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a great idea.
Unfortunately, it's not much more.
In some jokes you laugh (like policemen watching chess on TV - parody on American football).
The series lent its voice to many famous actors - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny.
Comrade Detective, however, focuses too much on the unsightly propaganda drama - which includes the killer with the Reagan mask - and it also looks like it.
Six long episodes are too exciting and comedy moments are not enough.
At a shorter pace, a propaganda satire in Comrade Detective could function, such as in a scene when Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the United States Embassy, where two fats are held by hamburgers made up of a large crowd.
A clear message for imaginative communist obscenity is that Western culture can turn everything into a dish and an orgy.
The idea of Romanian creators was not wrong: we do what we do with our own culture, as well as with theirs.
The Russian athletes did not welcome the cancellation of the IAAF's ban.
The International Athletes Federation of IAAF at the London Congress confirmed the extension of the international ban on the launch of Russian racers due to the state-supported doping programme.
The vote at the World Championship, which begins on Friday, was very clear, as expected.
For the extension of the ban, 166 delegates voted against only 21 votes.
The main reason for the rejection is the fact that Russia is unable to meet all the requirements for the introduction of the anti-doping system, as the IAAF Rune Andersen, the head of the special investigation group, observed before the congress.
His group recommended that the ban continue.
Some older doping cases remain unresolved, a number of suspected athletes have not yet been heard and coaches still work in the country with a deranged reputation.
The Russian anti-doping agency RUSADA, which does not meet the standards of the World anti-doping agency, is not fully operational until now.
However, RUSADA can already carry out testing under the supervision of foreign experts and British anti-doping agencies.
"Even if progress has been made, there is still much work to be done," said President IAAF Sebastian Coe.
The Russian athletic federation was suspended in November 2015 and Russian athletes thus lost, among other things, the last Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.
Despite the ban on incoming MS, 19 Russians participated, who had previously proved that they had been tested outside the Russian anti-doping system for a longer time.
But they won't be able to start at the championship in national colors and in the event of victory, they won't be able to play Russian hymen.
The Bank of England will maintain a interest rate of 0,25 %
The Bank of England should be expected to announce that the interest rate will remain unchanged as a result of unrelenting economic growth and a weakening of inflation, which has led to speculation about rapid growth.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth would remain "in the background" in the context of maintaining interest rates - despite family budgets.
The policy-makers of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Bank of England voted six to two to maintain a interest rate of 0.25%.
In its annual report on inflation, the Bank predicted growth of 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 and warned that family budget cuts would continue.
At the same time, the Bank indicated that over the next few years it should grow as a result of the inflation caused by Brexit and also stated that rentals from the mobility should grow more in the financial markets than expected.
Members of the Committee also voted in favour of downloading part of the Mammoth Package, whose task was to support the economy, which was put into practice a year ago as a response to Brexit.
As a result of the above, it should begin to pay from the next February the plan for future financing, which will offer a cheap grant to banks, although the Bank of England has indicated that it will now offer £15 billion less than the planned 115 billion.
Just before the decision was taken, the bank stated: "The MPC predicts that the gross domestic product (HDP) will, from a short-term point of view, be stagnant together with the pressure on real household income and the burden of consumption."
On the subject of the rate, the bank stated that it would be necessary to "retract austerity monetary policy" to calm inflation, which is "to a greater extent" than the markets expect.
Markets currently forecast first growth in the third quarter of next year and further growth in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that any increase would be "optional" and "limited".
The Bank reduced the forecast of growth for this year and next year compared with 1,9 % and 1,7 % predicted in May.
The expected growth in 2018 of 1,8 % remained unchanged.
After the estimates were published, the pound fell to the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5 % to $1,31 and by 0,4 % to €1,11.
The decision to maintain the current state came after the disappointing increase buried hope for further growth - GDP stopped at 0,3 % in the second quarter compared to 0,2 % in the previous three months.
The growth is likely to remain at 0,3 % in the third quarter, although the Bank’s statement should increase slightly by the end of the year.
The latest inflation report is an inconsistency for households affected by rising inflation and poorly rising wages.
The report further states that the monetary policy cannot "stop" the decline of revenues in the next few years, but it is expected that wages will "exactly" go up to the end of the three-year forecast.
The economy should also grow due to a high interest in British goods due to a weak book, which compensates for a lower percentage of consumer expenditure.
This decision came year after the rate in August was reduced to 0.025 % in response to the shocking vote on the EU referendum, resulting in a decrease in the book.
The Bank estimates that the full unification of prices and the economy will take at least four years.
Prior to the Bank's decision on the latest rates, many have demanded a rise in rates together with rising inflation, which has increased the pressure on households further. Three political factors required a 0.5% increase in June.
Inflation fell back to 2,6 % of June 2,9 % last month, even though the bank indicated that such a change was expected and inflation should rise again during the next month.
The Bank stated that the overrun was relative to 2 % of the target as a result of a weak book.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: “Because of the recent drop in swap rates, it appears that competition on the mortgage market will only decline once believers begin to compete on contracts with a view to a good view of the end of the year.
The market looks especially good for those who end up with existing contracts and re-loans - there are options free of charge in the offer, as well as low rates that are available."
NHS prescribes controversial HIV medicine in 10,000 patients
From September, patients have gained access to ‘transformative’ treatment for HIV prevention on the basis of decisions of the highest court on NHS funding.
The National Health Service (NSH) announced that the pre-exposure prophylaxis pill (PrEP) that is used before sex and reduces the risk of infection in high risk patients to 86% will be offered through health services to approximately 10,000 patients within a three-year trial period.
NSH agreed to finance the trial period after the appeal court supported the decision of the highest court last year, saying that NHS had financial resources to compensate PrEP despite the declaration that the medicine should be financed by local authorities.
The decision announced on Thursday was taken by NHS England at the mouth of Director-General Simon Stevens as “a significant intervention”, while the National AIDS Trust (NAT) described the decision as “a decisive moment”.
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to accept patients. Other clinics will be connected in October and will be fully implemented across England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a medicine used to reduce the risk of HIV disease before sex.
Tests have shown that PrEP significantly reduces the risk of transmission of HIV among patients at risk.
PreEP before sex means that there is sufficient amount of specific medicines to prevent infection in the patient’s body.
These medicines can be taken every day or at least two hours before sex.
Among the patients tested are homosexual or bisexual men, transsexual people and HIV-positive partners who are not successfully treated.
The clinics shall identify eligible participants who sign agreement with the participation in the test, including men, women, transsexuals and partners whose HIV status has not yet been controlled by the appropriate treatment.
People living and registered at GP in Great Britain can also apply to their local sexual health clinic and be considered a potential participant in testing.
The programme will bring taxpayers to £10 million and NHS England signed the contract this week to distribute medicines after obtaining international public contracts.
The trial period is designed to gather clinical evidence and assess the full potential of PrEP, its purpose, use and implementation to a large extent.
Simon Stevens added: ‘This important intervention should complement and make it increasingly difficult and more successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in more than thirty years' efforts to stop one of the greatest challenges to human health."
Deborah Gold, Executive Director of NAT (National AIDS Trust) said: “We are witnesses of a decisive moment in the fight against HIV.
If PreEP is given correctly and patients are at risk, it will offer the possibility of a change in the English HIV epidemic.
NSH will offer a new powerful tool that is individually controlled and independent of the need to talk to a partner, which will lead to a high risk of HIV infection.
We welcome this declaration."
Ian Green, Executive Director Terrence Higgins Trust, said: ‘The priority number one must be rapid testing across the country; we must ensure its availability to each patient.
We now have a trial drug PrEP and we are on a good way to protect more than 10,000 people who are at risk of HIV infection.'
The shadow ministry of health Sharon Hodgson said: ‘The beginning of the PrEP trial period is a welcome and long-awaited change after months of delay and withholding from the government.
Evidence indicates how transformative this medicine can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and the end of the transmission of this life-threatening infection.
The following tests will bring us closer to full understanding of the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that we start tests as soon as possible throughout the country and protect those who are exposed to HIV and thus, together, end the spread of HIV in society."
Life on high feet: interspatre and smart design changed this small apartment at the Earls Court into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, exchanged a big house in Knightsbridge in 2014 for an Earls Cour apartment.
On the first floor is the smart Queen Anne terrace - and is an iconic display of modern design, which uses the maximum available space.
“For the first time, I lived with my ex-husband in a much larger house in Knightsbridge,” Joanne said.
“I was looking for something more reasonable.
I ran into this apartment at the Earls Court and had the same ceiling.
I just fell in love with him, and I was staring at him the other day."
Since then, the apartment has been in the size of 1000 meters of complete four-foot renovations.
The one-bedroom apartment with a complicated layout - to get into the bedroom, you had to walk through the kitchen - Joanne wanted to add storage facilities and an interface to use a high ceiling.
“I’ve been looking for high ceilings, big windows and lots of lights.
That's what my demands were," she said.
For this purpose, Erfan Azadi from the design and design study Duck & Shed with a seat in Notting Hill used an almost four-metre ceiling to create a home that was not only a project but also a place to live.
The ceiling did not reach such heights that two spaces were above it - a challenge for architects so it was to create an interface that could be encountered.
Erfan had to engage in his creative thinking.
"The steel structure is quite complicated," he explained.
“We had to arrange both rooms so that we could walk straight.
It wasn't just to build a simple platform, but at the same time to push the steel structure so that at the right height above and below the ceiling."
This arrangement allowed Erfan to build two decent rooms on himself - and at the same time to add to the drama.
In the meantime there is a beautiful living room with an old copper-finned frame in the design of Retrovius.
The mirror furniture in gold color, silver line and retro mirror Serge Mouille creates a unique style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in drama, space and lighting.
A short walk is fitted with mirrors on both sides and looks so far.
The mirror leaves in the kitchen look like a window to another room.
At the entrance doors there are storage spaces equipped with mirrors for the storage of supplies and glasses.
The advantage of the living room, which lends the impression of a significantly larger space to the whole apartment, is the possibility to separate it from the kitchen if it is not used.
The compact kitchens are nothing new.
What's unique about this solution, however, is the closing door.
"We had to solve the technical site," Erfan says about the inflated doors.
"The door shall be counterweighted to avoid very easily."
Thanks to the wise use of space and storage space, Joanne gained another 16 meters square, second room and a better overall spread of the apartment.
"When it comes to this, what you sell is a residential area - or the appreciation of your property," Erfan said.
‘The real estate lessor shall, in principle, calculate its price on the basis of the residential area when entering the apartment.’
In this case, it was possible to raise the residential area while maintaining quality materials that lend space to a luxurious view.
"Material is very important because you touch it and create an emotional bond with your home," Erfan added.
“You don’t love the discharges of electricity in the walls.
Yes, they're important, but your hearts don't get it."
As has been shown, quality design and improvement of living space can change the ordinary apartment to exceptional work.
And just like Joanne, you can finally decide to stay.
The United States is breaking up.
The cultural and political gap between blue and red states is deepening.
California has declared a ban on the travel of its citizens to Tennessee and seven other states.
The State of Tennessee paid her and declared a legal ban on the travel of its citizens to California.
Of course, it is not a ban in the full sense that citizens of the United States can travel freely throughout the 50 countries.
It is said that California has banned the provision of state money on the roads of its citizens to eight other countries, including Alabama, South Dakota, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.
Who's gonna stop this crazy?
California is strong for LGBT and any expressions of disagreement with LGBT's lifestyle consider discrimination.
Tennessee, however, has adopted a law on the protection of the conscience that the psychotherapeutic person who has a moral problem with the treatment of patients in the LGBT community is not obliged to provide it, but is obliged to provide these patients with another therapist who does not have such a problem.
Texas and the other states have again adopted laws under which religious charitable organizations, which have received children from mothers after birth, do not have the obligation to provide these children with the same sex.
Because of these laws, California has banned the financing of its citizens' travel to the eight states of the Union from its resources.
In practice, this means that California professors should not have access to scientific symposia, for example, from their universities in Texas, because they are co-financed by the state of California.
Similarly, school sports teams cannot travel to tournaments or competitions, for example to Tennessee with financial support from their schools.
They have to get either federal grants on their way, but it is absurd for the federal government to finance public travel from state A to state B, or private sponsoring.
Tennessee has been patient and his parliament has adopted a law that does not like California's policy of high taxes, high government expenditures, high deficits and the tolerance of illegal immigrants, but still does not apply to California because of that travel embargo.
They're being blamed for the California travel embargo on Tennessee.
And the same will happen to every state of the Union which would have ordered a similar ban on travel to another state for any reason.
At the same time, he called on the parliaments of all states to stop this madness.
That's the fact, now comment.
The situation is toxic.
First of all, everything is constitutional, nothing is constitutional.
States shall have the right to adopt laws on the protection of their conscience and to decide what their money is and what it is not.
Second, what's wrong with a conscience?
If a farmer has a religious problem selling pigs, why not offer only cattle, sheep, poultry, and fish?
Why do you even have to sell him under the penalty of being a pig when it's enough to offer bullies?
In the state of Colorado, one baker faces an anti-discrimination complaint and a high courtesy because he refused to bake a cake for a homosexual wedding.
But he also refuses to bake Halloween or containing alcohol.
Why don't you punish him and leave him in his room and the proper cake to not order at the hundreds of other bakers?
Third, the beauty of the federal system is that the constitutional rights of all the citizens of the federation are guaranteed, but individual states can have domestic, domestic policies in powers other than federal, to adjust according to their own preferences, i.e. their citizens.
Then there is diversity, diversity, diversity.
California can be California and Texas can be Texas.
But California wants California to be California and Texas and seven other states to be California too!
Fourthly, members of LGBT communities have at times rightly advocated tolerance for their lifestyle.
Today, many members of this community are governed by the rule of life and let live, which should be guided by all reasonable people, but some activists do not seek to be tolerant to themselves or to others, but to be extremely intolerant to others.
According to them, no one should ever show a moral, religious or philosophical disagreement with LGBT's lifestyle, and if he does so, he should be criminalized.
The mentality of these activists is total.
They're modern enemies of freedom.
Fifthly, I don't know the situation in American history when states have done so for political issues, except in the case of one.
Even in the times of the civil rights struggle of the Blacks, where the North and the West were on the side of integration and the South on the side of the segregation, the states did not impose sanctions on themselves.
This was the only case in the 50th century, the political cause was slavery, and it turned out to be the North war against the South.
Of course, nothing like this will happen now, but the situation is still toxic.
The cultural and political gap between the blue democratic and the red republican states is deepening and the United States is mentally disbanding.
Unauthorized agitation.
Critic Putina has been severely tortured.
Russian opposition policy Alexei Navalnyj received a fine of 300 thousand rubles for violating the rules of the campaign before the presidential elections, which will take place next year.
He was fined by the court for calling on people to participate in unauthorized demonstrations.
In the last two months, Navalny has organized two major anti-government street protests and announced that he wants to be the head of the state in March next year.
The chief director of Kremlu Vladimir Putin has not yet announced his candidacy, but he is generally expected to do so and win again.
Navalny said the police came to him in the morning and took him to court.
The pity he received was that he invited people to demonstration through videos posted on the YouTube internet portal.
Pokuta's three hundred thousand.
"We'll cut them off later," he joked on the Twitter critic Kreml.
The Russian electoral commission recently concluded that Navalny could not participate in the presidential elections because he had been previously convicted of fraud.
Navalny, who is considered to be a fighter against corruption, however, the relevant judgment is considered to be politically motivated.
The fines amounting to 300 thousand rubles, the fine of 25 thousand rubles of the court also placed two members of the Naval Pre-election Team, Leonid Volkov and Nikolai Ljaskin on Thursday.
Navalny entered Russian politics as an anti-corruption blogger and gradually became a dominant character on a fragmented opposition scene.
The authorities are trying to defend the Navy in the campaign.
In February, he was sentenced to five years' imprisonment for stealing the forest company Kirovles.
In May, the verdict confirmed the appeal court.
The judgment is so powerful, which prevents the Navalanche from running under the Russian laws.
Brothers fight for an empire worth over $500 million
Two brothers now, more than four decades after the establishment of the empire of their Italian family, move about one of the most precious Victorian properties worth over $500 million.
Former director Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis is staying in Toorak, only three rooms from his younger brother Paul, who has been arguing about common property and commercial property to the highest court.
Paul wanted to leave his family business already in 2014, but the fierce dispute is still being tried before the highest court.
Together with her mother Anna, the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars. The first shop bought a family in 1973 at Smith Street in Collingwood.
This place was founded by a family of Westco Jeans, which grew into a chain of 160 stone shops.
In 1999, the family sold the entire company in a recalculation of $85 million.
Other properties and portfolios of the De Lutis family have been purchased for money now include offices, building grounds in Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments on the Gold Coast and Mt Buller and shopping centers in the suburbs.
Paul owns about one third of the company's assets, while his father Colin, who is according to Paul's words "a significant force and dominant personality" of the De Lutis family, owns two thirds of the assets.
The court records indicate that Colin owns his properties worth $316 million, while Paul manages his properties for $176 million.
For Paul, it was a problem to distribute property and funds.
"Colin's proposal was expressed in my eyes in particular for his benefit," Paul wrote in a cross-sectional statement to the court in 2015.
Last Friday, after a few unsuccessful attempts at peace, the first session of the Supreme Court took place.
The brothers now also struggle to control existing business - from which Paula cut off Colin according to his statement.
Colin resists that it's not true and accuses Paul of miscarriage with some properties.
In his previous cross-sectional statement, Colin stated that he believed in a fair solution to the conflict.
"My Italian origin dictates to me that the family is one of the most important," he wrote.
Hundreds of pages of cross-border statements, e-mails and messages from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, including Allana Myerse, QC and the defenders of both sides, are involved.
Ms. De Lutis and her late husband, Luigi, were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and lashes since the 1950s and bought a walk in Brunswick in the 1970s.
They bought a property in Collingwood, where Colin opened the first family business with jeans.
Colin said that when he founded Westco “in the last year of high school, Paul was still a small, about 10-year-old boy.”
Anna De Lutis stated that together with Luigi, who died in 2012, they hoped that the transfer of the property to the sons would take place in a good way.
“Lugi often said he never wanted his sons to end up in court,” she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis family. Colin stated that Mark was compensated for 10 million dollars when he left and Luke for 26 million dollars.
As Paul, Luke and Mark said, “they were not satisfied with the terms of their financial compensation”.
Since then, Colin has been holding back, despite the fact that he is a former member of the AFL team's representation, as stated in his 2015 autobiography Eddie McGuire, known television personality and best friend Colina.
Fairfax Media contacted Colina and Paula de Lutisova and their lawyers on Friday.
He replied only through Colin's textual report, stating that, given the fact that the dispute is being resolved before the court, "I have nothing to add".
"It is very sad that my brother Paul decided to handle the whole matter before the court," he wrote.
In mid-2016, he stated in a statement at the Court of Justice that he was trying to adapt to his brother’s demands.
"Our father would be very unhappy if he saw our current situation," he let himself be heard and added that "he still hopes for a decent solution".
On Friday, all hopes were inconceivable.
"Our disputes will be resolved in a timely manner in court proceedings," Colin wrote.
Wind in the Czech Republic.
Teachers shower the children.
The MDD drivers fascinate with water and summer clothing.
At the mother's school in Chodovci, Prague, where there are now about 35 children, it only comes out in the morning.
The school is after reconstruction and planted trees still do not provide a large shade.
There's no pool there, but the kids' teachers are showering in the cemetery.
In the afternoon, the kids stay in classes where they're downjayed and covered curtains.
The air is trying to cool clean air because they don't have air conditioning.
It's also difficult for teachers and cooks.
"The temperature, which is inside and outside, exceeds the hygiene limits for maternal schools, so we should not have an open operation during this period," said the school director Miloslav Makovicová.
In school there is a smooth corridor where the temperature is moving around 40 degrees.
We wind up in the morning at 6 p.m., the windows will be closed and we have on the south side the wound we're protecting.
"But it won't help much," she added.
The best conditions are in the forest school in Hráz in Hostivicí, where children spend most of their time outside.
We have grown trees on the ground, so we're under them.
"We've got a beautiful kitchenette, there's a table underneath it, and there's things we're doing," said Barbara Kompan's school director.
Teachers with their children are trying to go into the woods where they're older.
The kids are wet hats and they have different water games on the program.
"We have a hand-pressed device that is used for flowering, and we use it for showering children," Kompanová said.
The director of the mother school in Novoborská street in Prague Prosec Jitka Vilimovská said that teachers of children are trying to stay in the shade and the drop is water.
"We have a relatively grown garden, so they're under the trees," she said.
He goes out in the morning and then after 3:00.
Every child must have a head covering.
Teachers also remind children that they should drink.
They can choose, for example, a little sweet tea or a red juice and have a drink with water in the garden.
Every day they also eat vegetable salads and always fresh fruits and vegetables that their parents sometimes bring them.
"Maybe today a mother here brought about a decimal melon for children," Makovic added.
Drivers get water or summer cobblestone.
The Prague transport company DPP provides them with hot days of water, ion drinks or summer cobblestones.
The cabs of drivers tram and buses are in most cases air-conditioned, spokesperson DPP Aneta Röhková said.
Apart from the cabin, some trams are air-conditioned even in the passenger room.
Tramvoy's high-temperature colleges haven't really hurt anything yet.
A minor damage occurred in the shed in Hostivar.
At present high temperatures, we are primarily concerned with the availability of sufficient quantities of drinks for drivers.
"The cooled drinking water is available in all loops, midpoints and coaches," the Greek said.
Employees have so-called sodas that produce a cold soda in their cars and in some intermediate locations.
Drivers also get soluble ion safe drinks.
"They can also use summer uniforms that increase comfortable drivers during their daily shifts," the speaker added.
The hot and dry weather of the last days has resulted in an increased number of fires.
On Tuesday, their firemen throughout the Czech Republic liquidated 108, i.e. double the long-term daily average.
On Tuesday, the day the temperatures in the Czech Republic splintered over 35 degrees Celsius, he employed firefighters mainly with fire.
"They carry fires in the natural environment and also those associated with the harvest work," said the spokespersons of Nicole Zaoralová.
It did not even bring the fires to the left, nor did it bring about a night’s change of weather when the heat in a row of places was cut off by storms and typhoons.
In connection with the storms, firemen went out to 236 attacks.
In particular, it was the removal of fallen trees and plants.
"The most affected in the Central Czech Republic," Zaoralová continues.
But the help of the firemen was also needed in Stvolinsk in the Czech Republic, where 60 people from the child camp were safely evacuated because of the storm.
Tropical temperatures have also given work to the Prague rescuers.
On Tuesdays and Wednesdays, ambulances drove out to dozens of cases of carcinogen poisoning.
That's why people should let their water heaters check, savers.
The carbonised oxide is a colourless gas without smell which is released when it is not completely burned.
Signs of poisoning include nausea, vomiting, headache and feeling faint.
In case of suspicion of poisoning, leave the frozen room.
Trump's new Chief of Staff plans to restrict the president's media diet
Many have tried before him and have always failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can really do it.
If so, it will be the first.
Portal Politico stated that the new Chief of Staff in the White House plans to limit the flow of information from President Trump - including reports in television news - in hopes that he will keep Trump at a level.
Here is part of the report by reporter Josh Dawson:
“When the new Chief of Staff of the White House John F. Kelly met on the first day of the new function with the staff, he created the key problem of Trump's White House, which is going to fix: incorrect information that gets the president in hand.
Kelly informed the employees that he must personally approve all the information - whether in paper or in speech - because the President can decide on the basis of the correct information."
Kelly's diagnosis actually makes sense, but many of his predecessors were in control of Trump and his presentation in the media broke their teeth.
Trump's relationship with the media is dated back several decades - and now that he sits in the White House, his habit of watching TV is even stronger.
"If Trump, as a candidate, was disturbed by honest reports, it was appropriate to show him that in a positive light a lot of other media were talking about him, which was easier to convince," said Politico Sam Nunberg, former campaign advisor in February.
Tara Palmeri from the Politico portal then wrote that "the key to maintaining Trump tweets on the floor - at least according to the six former organizers of his campaign - is to ensure that Trump regularly monitors the media that sings praise to him."
Okay.
However, the idea that Trump's tendency to publish his views on Twitter was "under control" is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign organizers know something the others don't know - that Trump's tweets would be more exciting if someone didn't check them out.
About tweets that Trump never sent off, we'll probably never know.
If his employees managed to keep him on the roof at least several times, their efforts did not go unnoticed.
However, no one has been able to stop the Trump regularly to raise controversial issues.
Part of this problem lies in the fact that in the White House, which is made up of rival groups, people are regularly trying to strengthen their agenda by the fact that the Trumps are moving materials - which they can, but do not have to be reliable - that support their view of the world.
The Politico Portal, which covered the issue from all sides, published a report in May on the intention of advisers to submit suspicious information to the head of the state.
This is an example of such information from the peer reporter Shane Goldmaker:
“The current and former Trump officials claim that the President often reacts very angryly to negative news from the media, especially reports of information leaks, and tries to find their origins.
The situation came at the end of February when someone stressed to the president a copy of the article from GotNews.com - the website of the provocator Charles C. Johnson - who accused the chief of staff of Katie Walsh of being a ‘source of many leaks of information’ from the White House.
No matter what Johnson was always shown on Twitter for trouble; or that he did not submit his claim with any evidence; or that he had already published false charges in the past and then called them off.
Trump read the article and began to ask Walsh."
Goldmacher added that then the chief of the Reince Priebus staff and the secretary of the White House Rob Porter “were trying to implement the system for the administration and documentation of the information received by President Trump”.
Would that work?
Kelly is now three months later trying to push the same strategy.
Maybe it turns out that he's more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump's impulse doesn't just disappear and his assistants are still fighting for power.
These unchanging factors of Kelly's mission are certainly straining.
Tourists discuss the landing and return to the “Millionary Quarter”
Several of the most prominent homeowners in the West Midland County will again be released to the press with determined tourists who negotiate with the local authorities on the right to regain the field for their seats.
Tourists parked 20 caravans on the field at the flourishing street in the town of Solihull, which is called the “millionaire district”.
Bringing horses, children and a caravan army, tourists come back after they were shown in May. They did not even care about a plot that was dug in place under the regulations of the authorities in order to prevent their entry.
The Tactical Group found gaps in the defense and penetrated the field with caravans unprotected by the border that served as the way.
The powerful inhabitants of the neighborhood attacked the Solihull City Administrative Council by ‘not being able to solve the problem’.
One of the residents who wanted to remain anonymous said: ‘ They planted this place on Monday evening after they moved to the street of Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at other people.
The Governing Council should be ashamed of its inability to solve the problem.
All the tourists were moved to another place and now they're back.
Last night the next one arrived, and today they're probably going to get even more.'
She added that : ‘The Birmingham Board of Directors knows how to impose this problem.
I live on Streetsbrook, and I don't mean to keep paying taxes until the board of directors deals with tourists."
Another of the anonymous residents said, ‘It’s ridiculous. We have just watched the last traveling tourists and now they are back.
And this time they're even more and this time they've brought a horse with them."
The Solihull City Administrative Council said: “We are aware of an unjustified stay on the ground near Streetsbrook Road and, in cooperation with local police, we are taking the necessary legal steps to resolve the whole problem.
In order to gather as much evidence as possible, it is necessary that as many locals as possible declare any illegal or illegal conduct by police on number 101.
We're going to get this whole picture we're going to take to court."
My husband hit a car in Brussels.
He was brought by a government special.
The government special brought the wounded Robert Žitnjanský to Bratislava on Wednesday afternoon.
Two ambulances were waiting at the airport, and the plane was under constant control of the Slovenian doctors.
The long-planned flight took off without any complications.
According to information from JOJ TV, Robert Žitnjanský had a serious accident at the beginning of the summer in Brussels.
He's been hit by a car, and he's been in serious condition ever since.
After transporting to the government, he was transported to a specialized workshop in one of the Bratislava hospitals.
The economic analyst is the husband of Slovene eurobond Jany Žitnjanský by NOVA.
She didn't want to say anything about the incident.
Couples have three kids together.
Italians join in the fight against NGOs' rescue ships with immigrants on board
Italy announced that it would prohibit the arrival of rescue ships of NGOs that are joining the Italian coast with Mediterranean immigrants unless the NGOs sign new rules governing their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign new rules of conduct, it will be difficult for us to imagine that they could continue their operations," said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with Turin Daily La Stampa.
The day came after the Italian authorities had entertained the ship of the German rescue organisation Jugend Reettet for suspected trafficking with people, which greatly facilitates illegal immigration.
The rescue organisation, which operates for the first year, refused to comment on the whole matter on the grounds of the accusation by the Italian State Prosecutor Ambrogia Cartije.
"It is for us and there will always be a priority number one saving lives, so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in rescue zones at this time," the organisation said in a statement on social networks.
"We can only comment on all current charges after collecting all the information and assessing the whole situation."
The Italian authorities have been monitoring the ship of Juventa of Jugend Retette since October.
Her crew is suspected of transporting immigrants on board who were handed over directly to them by traders with people, and repeatedly.
At least one meeting was reportedly only 1.3 miles from the coast of Libya, according to the complainant.
The crew of the ship is suspected of violating the law and following the Italian Coast Guard, which oversees rescue operations in this area - from humanitarian excitement, more than anything else.
The Code of Conduct establishes the presence of an Italian police officer on board a ship such as Iuventa to monitor activities.
Only three out of nine non-governmental non-profit organisations that are involved in rescue operations have so far agreed to comply with the Code: Save The Children, Maltese MOAS and Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms.
The latter organisation stated on Thursday that the new rules are not necessary but acceptable, since they do not represent any "substantial change or obstacle" with regard to rescue operations.
For example, the adoption of the new Code of Conduct has also been rejected by doctors without frontiers (MSF), which is the holder of the Nobel Prize.
In the meantime, he let himself be told that a sharp decline in immigrants in recent weeks, which is taking place in Italy in the context of rescue operations, indicates that an effort to strengthen the sights of the Libyan coast and to cooperate with local authorities is bearing fruit.
"We are beginning to see light at the end of the tunnel in the last few days," the minister said.
He also revealed plans for further negotiations to be held this month with Libya's elders on the subject of economic development initiatives, as well as representatives of Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants that these countries will abandon in the hope of achieving Europe.
Mesarošov is not ashamed: She had silicone and cellulite lying out of the way!
The hot summer days are totally afraid to take on the most necessary that will cover the most intimate parts.
Just Dominic Mesaroš does it the other way around.
At the afternoon meeting in the Prague zoo, where the actors, moderators, singers and all that they have to do with TV Prima, just jammed their body into a mini overhang.
And it took just a few ordinary moves and the model showed everyone their silicas, but also the ass.
He took over her for how many times he set up between half, and he also kicked her so high that she had to keep correcting him.
The attention of the gentlemen and the photographers present certainly did not have to.
Michelle Carter's conviction for sending text messages promoting the suicide of Conrad Roye
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to imprisonment for two years for encouraging her friend to commit suicide through text messages and phone calls.
Michelle Carter lives for 15 months from a two-year sentence on the net and then spends five years in parole.
Carter was convicted in June of the accidental murder of Conrad Roye, who took his own life on 13 July 2014.
Roy’s father said on Thursday at the courthouse: “The whole family is screwed.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was left at liberty until the decision was taken.
She was threatened with imprisonment for up to 20 years, but her lawyers argued that she and Roy had suffered from mental illness.
Dressed in red trousers and creamy blouses, Carter stood in the voice of a judgment on the spot with tears in his eyes, his hands were covered and his eyes directed toward the ground.
"Its execution killed Conrad Roy," the judge told the plaintiff.
“She ended her life to get rid of herself.
She couldn't accept her own responsibility," she said.
"She didn't show any results."
However, the legal representative of Carter said that these were “unfortunate circumstances that he is unforgivably sorry”.
Judge Lawrence Moniz added that “their age or level of maturity or even mental impairment do not have a significant impact on her performance”.
The complainant read Roy’s mother, Lynn Roy’s statement: “It won’t be a day before I miss my son.
I want him to be proud of me - I care for his sister and together we will bear the unbearable pain that we will bear with us forever," he said.
Roy's sister Camdyn Roy proved that she was "hunting her" with the knowledge that she would never participate in a brother's wedding and never be his aunt.
"The loss of the person I've seen since I was born is the pain I'll bear in my life," she said.
The State of Massachusetts does not have a valid law that would affect a person who is trying to commit suicide to another person, so this case is a legal precedent.
Carters were 17 years old when Roy was found in 2014 on the car seat, poisoned by carbon dioxide.
The case came to the attention of the whole nation after Carter's textual reports were published that led to suicide.
“I don’t care if you jump out of the building or point out,” wrote Carter’s textual reports just two weeks before his death when Roy was on his family leave.
A few minutes before his suicide, she wrote to him: "You have to do this Conrade" and "Just replace the generator and you'll be free and happy."
Judge Moniz stated that Carter wanted attention through Roy's death and ordered her to hold any comments in the press.
The case has raised many questions.
One of the people who stood on Carter's side was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of the murder of her British roommates in Italy in 2007.
Ms. Knox (30) published a statement in the Los Angeles Times: "Michael Carter deserves to understand and help, not prison."
Audi modifies up to 850 000 diesel vehicles in response to an acute response
Only the day before the announcement of Audi car manufacturer BMW indicated that it would offer its customers an update of the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW President said that the company believes that "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions" in response to European cities, including Munich, which are located in BMW, which consider the ban or restrictions on diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that he will adjust three million Mercedes vehicles across Europe to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies referred to this decision as an download.
European car manufacturers have promoted to a large extent the use of diesel cars in Europe and the United States to comply with the regulations on carbon dioxide emissions.
However, nitrogen oxide that emits diesel engines is considered to be carcinogenic and can cause asthma.
At the same time, there is an increase in car costs on the installation of a gas-neutralisation facility issued by diesel engines, which facilitates the competitiveness of cars.
While German car manufacturers are facing close visits, Chancellor Angela Merkel is faced with the accusation of dissipating powerful car companies and ignoring their problems.
The company is trying to avoid Volkswagen’s errors, which in order to meet the emission limits installed software in its vehicles, which reduced the volume of emissions released during testing, but under normal conditions the software was disabled.
Several senior representatives of Volkswagen were accused in the United States and others are investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former leader of the engine development department in Audi would be arrested in Germany.
The former manager of Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is an Italian national and does not apply to him extradition, so he may face a trial in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi engaged in a criminal investigation of the German police in the case of the Volkswagen car after the authorities accused Audi of installing a system that was to cover European emission limits - and extended the charges that Audi is facing in the US.
The inclusion of the Audi car in the investigation may have a negative impact on Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer constitutes an disproportionate share of the Volkswagen profit.
The plane landed urgently on the beach.
The man and the girl are dead.
An accident took place on the beach Praia de São João in Costa da Caparica, about 30 kilometers south of Lisbon.
One of the witnesses to the TV channel SIC Noticias said that the plane flew close to the people who were on the beach.
Some people from the beach may have fled from danger to the sea.
Unfortunately, two people couldn't escape from the machine.
A 50-year-old man and an eight-year-old girl were killed on the beach by local media.
"The plane hit and they were dead," local police chief Pedro Coelho Dias described.
Their nationality has not yet been known.
On board the plane were two people, both of whom were killed alive by the accident, and the police took them to questioning.
D11 or how not to set up a highway.
And the roads in the Czech Republic are complete?
I'll give you a guess.
It's unconstructed, even though it started to build in 1978.
Even though it's impenetrable, it's still being fixed.
And it's still not supposed to be built, even if it's a building permit.
What's that?
Yes, the D11 main road.
The construction of its next section for at least a few months has just stopped the movement of the Earth.
We easters get the highways by the bits, like when the salads are done.
They'll hide the wheel and then they'll just see when and if we'll even get another one.
Then we don't want anything miraculous.
We just want to shorten the time of the trip and we want to get trucks traveling to Poland or from Poland from villages and cities.
The endless streams of trucks go directly through the city of Jaromeř or Nachod, which is not a reasonable destination.
But so far, the last piece of our dream highway was operated in 2008, that is, nine years ago.
Since then, not even a rat.
So when the construction of the remaining four kilometers of unfinished section to Hradci Králova and other sections to Jaromere began with an archaeological study that began at the end of this year, you could hear a loud burst of sponges in the eastern Czech Republic.
No one believed in it anymore.
Last week it turned out that the building won't be built this year.
And maybe not next year.
The movement of the Children of the Earth-Club for sustainable transport from Brno gave an explanation.
Children of Earth repeat their D1 tactics.
They attacked a building permit decision all over the place.
They shall request a review of all binding opinions already issued by all the authorities concerned.
For example, the mayor, the Ministry of the Environment, but also the Ministry of Defence or the Drainery.
So far, from D11, we're getting to a village not far from the village called the Funeral.
So we're going down, we're just going down the road, and suddenly we're standing on the side of the road, and we're giving priority to getting into the column.
The worst part is that you see similar stories all over the Republic.
It's a scary, constantly busy trip to Benešov, D1 or D8.
Everyone has their own funeral.
What do the Earth’s Children Ask for?
What is the essence of the problems of building communications in the Czech Republic?
And why is the road network virtually inexhaustible in the current system?

Levendole from Provence threatens climate change
Levendule has become a symbol of Provence in the area of southeastern France, but now they are threatened by climate change.
Levanduli lives as a result of dry weather and harmful moisture, causing fear on the faces of researchers and farmers who are looking for solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the CRIEPPAM Agricultural Research Institute in Provence, said: “The cultivation of lavender in Provence is under threat because in the last few years this plant has been exposed to climate change, which brings less shock to spring and autumn.
It affects the life of the lavender.
They also have their fault with the cicadas and whales that transmit microbacterials, which can be done in the dry climate."
There's a lot in the bet.
Lavandule attracts tourists and the oil produced from them is an important component of perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: “The place of long and beautiful flowers is growing smaller, undeveloped and often weak plants.
The quantity of oil obtained from these lavenders is, of course, smaller."
A possible solution can be a more efficient distribution of water and slowing down water evaporation from the ground, but also a tap of lavender with a protective mixture of water and water and several species resistant to dry weather.
The murder of journalists underlines the growing threats in Mexico
Employees of the Riodoc weekly regularly meet every Wednesday to discuss news about the concerns that are taking place in the area of Sinaloa for the participation of organised criminals, corrupt officials and unwarranted drug wars.
Today, however, under recent events, it is mainly because of its own safety.
They learn that it is important to change their habits.
Two deserving journalists are talking about what would be safer: taking their children with them to the office where someone attacked the grenade in 2009 or leaving them at home.
Security experts wrote three simple words on the black table: opponents, neutrals and allies.
They ask journalists to give names to every word - there is no need for any evidence, just to use imagination and imagination.
To choose from what - drug dealers, politicians, traders and journalists are suspected of taking money from government or drug cartels - a catalogue of criminals whose task is to cover criminal conduct.
Violence does not stop and the bodies are scattered across the country; journalists remain among them: according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, at least 25 of them have been killed by President Enrique Pena Nieta in December 2012; 589 journalists have been under federal protection after attacks and threats; and seven of them have been killed in all seven states this year.
Among them is the co-founder of the journal Riodioce, editor and inspiration for colleagues, Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and work as a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books about violence that are consumed by drug trafficking.
His loss is tangible, although his presence is all-passing - a large photo of Valdez with the inscription "Justice", on which a mediator hangs in front of the building; two journalists - Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez - over 30 years old, have a shirt with a photo of Valdez with a smile on his face, glasses on his nose and Panamanian hat.
The meeting takes place about two months after his death; journalists talk about each other’s traumas, nightmares, insomnia and paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor was established in 2010 to deal with cases of journalists, two suspects have been sued, according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists.
Most of the thousands of murders that occur every year are linked to drug trafficking and organised crime.
Journalists from Riodace insist that they will inform about the violence taking place in Sinaloe; although the destruction of the area is now very treacherous.
Without information about the killers and without a vision of justice, the meeting on security is pointless, says Ibarra.
"It is foolish to waste time on such meetings," he adds.
"If we don't get more information, we can't trust anyone."
On the morning of 15 May, Valdez left the center of Riodoce in Culiacán, the capital of Sinaloy.
He managed to capture several blocks when his red Toyota Corroll was stopped by two men who pulled him out of the car and killed him with 12 shots, according to all the name of the article - which can be translated as the Twelfth River.
The shooters then got into his car and ran away from the crime scene.
Valdez died at the age of 50.
He left his wife and two grown children behind.
It seems that the news is spreading rapidly in Culiacan.
In Valdez's case, however, there is a suspected silence.
Since the last arrest of Guzman and his January release into the United States, Sinaloa has become one of the country's most bloody fighting forces, as the rival group tries to fill an empty space.
Every day several people are killed in the streets of Sinaloa, and the cemetery is full of scattered double-patrial mausoleum for drug kings, many of whom are larger than homes.
Remember, by the word "adjustment", one drug cartel is thought to control the coastal state with precious ports and important routes that travel to the United States.
Despite this, as well as the fact that Valdez was intimately aware of the risks of his employment, Ismail Bojorquez (60), co-founder and director Riodoce still insists that he did not protect his friend.
He believes that two doubts have contributed to his death.
The first was the February talks with Damaso Lopez, the leader of one of the rival drug cartels that waged war with Joaquín Guzman's sons.
The peace could have angered the sons; the suspected gang members gathered all copies of the news at the time they arrived on the billboards.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after entertaining the other news in which the same story was printed.
Valdez became a legend in Mexico and abroad and his death was seen as an important milestone in the fight against Mexican criminals against journalists.
He managed to survive for so long, and all his friends and colleagues believed it would never change.
In the Noroest magazine he was practically a veteran when in 2003 he decided to sell his stock at $50 and start with five colleagues in Riodoc.
In Sinaloe, "it was impossible to operate a newspaper and not mention drug trafficking," Bojorquez said.
Riodoce eventually gained a good reputation for brave and true news; the newspapers began to do so.
Journalists were happy to go to the subject of trouble and publish texts without censorship - readers were fascinated by reading stories that no one else dared to publish.
Eight years after the foundation, Riodoc won the prestigious award of Maria Moores Cabot for a Latin American report.
The same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for its brave reports on Mexican drug trade.
Valdez openly admitted that he was afraid.
"I was afraid of my life," he said when he accepted the price.
Drug dealing in Sinaloa is "the way of life", Valdez said in an interview last October for Rompeiento TV.
"You have to take the role of a journalist - or play stupid.
I don't want anyone to ask me, 'What did you do to the face of death... why didn't you tell me what was going on?'
He was a good friend who liked to give advice and embrace - a teacher who knew how to survive.
Everyone relied on his daily routine.
He always wore his hat.
He often went to the El Guayabo bar opposite the office and sat at the same table.
Now they're asking, did this routine blame him for his death?
His death also raised questions about his own assumptions - how to do his job as best as possible and stay alive?
"They don't like you messing with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret landing areas."
"These things were forbidden," Bojorquez said.
As a result, there is a high level of self-censorship and self-esteem.
You have to trust your instincts.
If you feel like something's not playing here, get your hands off me.
The problem is, editor Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that "what makes sense is that it can be crazy... and then it came to that thing with Javier."
According to him, the old rules, like the others, no longer apply in Sinaloae - just as in the states of Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states that are home to a toxic mix of lucrative passport tracks, weak governments and corrupt policies.
The country is constantly changing.
No mobile phones are allowed in the room where Riodoc employees meet; a few days ago, Spyware was discovered, which bought governments to monitor Mexican journalists and activists.
In front of the building, two policemen are located in the shade of a nearby tree.
They were chosen by the state to protect the office of Riodace, which is located in a four-storey building in the city district of Culiacan.
Newspapers are hiding from whether these policemen exactly belong to those 50 percent of the law's defenders who are, according to the government's statement of corruption.
It's been a few months since the press last released themselves into the horny areas that basically control drug cartels.
There are three major stories on the program this week.
The first of them is the murder of former boxer Julio César Cháveze's brother in Sinaloe.
They are also devoted to suspected government expenditures carried out in the home city of the governor of the state.
Recently, there have also been several abortions at one of the most luxurious Culiacan restaurants, only a block from the State Representative's office.
No one officially announced the identity of the kidnapped people or the circumstances of the kidnapping, so reporters took note when they were going to write about what every city's inhabitants know: that the restaurant is the favorite destination of drug and political traders.
One of the journalists read from the public records that the restaurant was registered on behalf of which it is linked to a certain policy, which is a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which governs all levels of the political scene almost throughout the last century.
Several PRI governors have recently been accused of corruption at high stations.
Villareal asked reporters to write about the previous incidents that occurred at the restaurant, including the incident where one of the sons of Joaquín "El Chapo" Guzmán escaped the military intervention unit.
A month ago, readers would have read about this topic in Valdez's address, which was the best source of input information.
"Valdez would certainly solve the case," said Villareal (46), who is renamed "El Flaco" for his upright character.
"Now all the informants have turned their backs on us."
Valdez's office has changed into a cedulium warehouse and a label for protests against the killing of journalists. Employees certainly did not expect to become press activists.
The journalist, Miriam Ramirezová, dropped several signs and gave the following morning a demonstration before the State Representative's office for another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared only three days after Valdez's murder in the western part of the state of Michoacán.
There was only one body that was burned, and the authorities say it's Adamea's DNA analysis.
The activity of journalists is progressing across the country. Many of them organize protests and attack the halls and buildings of “SOS print”.
The director of the news Bojorquez is the day of a visit to Washington, where he is trying to obtain international support and achieve justice for Valdez's death.
At a meeting with Governor Sinaloy, who took place the day after the murder of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of monitoring journalists and their murder for the declaration of truth.
In the meantime, she asked to be transferred to another department for fear that her anger could endanger her impartiality.
Valdez repeatedly stated that Mexican journalists are "obstructed" by organised crime, corrupt officials and the public.
In his last book on Narco-Journalism, he wrote that journalists die not only by hand of drug cartels but also by order of policies and security forces who cooperate with organised crime.
The Media Oversight Group Article 19 charged more than half of all attacks on police and public officials.
"You die in Mexico because they want to silence you," Ramirez added.
The murders obviously work.
No one will forget the death of blogger Marie Elizabeth Macías, who came six years ago at the northern border of Tamaulipas.
Her body was found together with a message allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: “This is how I ended up with my messages.”
Next to her head was a keyboard and an earphone.
Some of the sides decided to end the activity, such as the El Norte newspaper, which is located near the northern border of the state of Chihuahua in response to the March murder of the rapporteur, Miroslavy Breach.
The others continue, as did El Manana of Nuevo Laredo after the death of their director in 2004.
In 2010 Diario de Ciudad Juarez addressed public drug cartels with an article on the front page entitled “What do you want from us?”
Some journalists fled their homes or even across the border.
It's an awkward decision.
Finding a job in exile is difficult, just as it is difficult to get rid of the feeling that someone is still stalking you.
And journalists are persecuted and killed, such as in the case of Ruben Espinos, who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in the apartment in Mexico City, three months after the escape from Veracruz.
For those who have decided to stay and not give up their jobs, there is a great risk every day.
Ibarra, who wanted to be a poet once, admits that writing about drugs scares him.
"Mexico is going to hell, so I became a journalist," he said.
It's Friday afternoon, and Riodoce's employees are sitting on the hall in front of the office - the latest edition sent to the printer - drinking beer when the phone starts calling.
It is reported that 19 people died at a gunfire between gang members and policemen near the beach resort in Mazatlán.
The war is escalating, just as many of the messages left in this area by the members of the union have promised.
Newspapers publish this news from a mobile phone on the Riodace website.
Not one day will pass and the initial title will change again.
The sounds of the police sirens indicate another shot.
Bojorquez looks at the police station in a cool light to see if they're paying attention.
If they're scared, they don't make it any sense.
Under the huge portrait of the fallen co-founder of their journal - whose mediator is an excuse for the whole of Sinaloe - all Riodoce employees follow his steps.
"How can we just think about leaving," said Bojorquez, "when on the same day that Javier was killed, did one internalist ask me to send her to the street?"
The dinosaurs used camouflage to avoid enemies
At first glance, it looks like a socha, however scary.
Researchers have now discovered the conclusions of the first finding of an amazing creature about the size of the rhino, whose perfectly preserved remains - which experts called 'Mona Lisau dinosaurs' - found a Canadian mine.
The remains were kept to such a high degree that the experts were able to determine the red blood cell color of his dirty skin and indicated that the dinosaur had a ‘problem past’.
The article in the magazine Current Biology stated that it is “the most indiscriminate ever found in a protected dinosaur and one of the best species of dinosaurs in the world”.
The stone is a new species of Nodosauridae. Dinosaurus lived in the period of the Creed, about 110 to 112 million years ago.
His perfectly preserved condition literally shocked researchers who described it as “very remarkable”.
According to National Geographic, the armored whiter is still the best preserved stone of its kind.
Shawn Funk, who discovered the stone on March 21, 2011, is looking for the Suncor Millenium down near the Canadian Alberty.
He attacked something that looked like a foreign object and decided to examine it closer.
The stone was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
The researchers spent the next six years working on animal cover from a huge piece of land weighing 1100 kg.
After completion of work, the dinosaur is ready to reveal.
“It’s enough to keep your eyes shut and you believe it’s asleep,” said Caleb Brown’s head of work and a naturalist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the animal is exhibited.
“It will certainly be written into history as one of the most beautiful and preserved species of dinosaurs – Mona Lisa dinosaurs.”
By studying his skin, researchers have found that this excavator - although he was covered in armor and reminded of a walking tank - was most likely facing a serious threat from masso-gas dinosaurs.
Heavyly protected dinosaurs used red and white camouflage to protect against predators and used a masking system that uses many animals today.
Experts say that this made him better able to cope with his surroundings and avoid enemies. The masking system suggests that he was a favorite food for larger dinosaurs.
News of 110 million years of old Nodosauridae' dinosaurs first appeared in the newspapers in May. Currently it is available at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
The researchers gave him the name Borealopelt Markmitcheli after Mark Mitchell's museum's technique, which, along with the team, spent more than 7,000 hours searching for fossils.
Thanks to the amazingly preserved state of fossility, Dr. Mitchell and the international team of scientists were able to document the pattern and shape of shells and armor throughout the body.
They discovered the method of masking commonly used by animals today in defense - the upper part of the animal was darker than its lower part.
Although this masking effect is common in nature, the discovery of researchers is surprising because Borealopelta's size far exceeds today's animals using the same technique.
It is therefore possible that dinosaurs were such a number of predators that evolution gave the advantage of masking before confrontation in survival.
Many modern animals with masking - such as deer, zebra and or pasture - are much smaller and also more vulnerable as a benefit, which suggests that nosodaurus had to fight about his surviving words.
“The transmission of a huge and heavy armored dinosaur is apparently illustrating the dangers posed by predators during the time of the crisis,” said Brown.
The chemical analysis of the organic ingredients contained in the mushrooms also revealed that dinosaurs had probably a reddish coloration.
Researchers continue to study animals and look for further knowledge of their life, including the retained contents of the stomach, to investigate their last food.
They believe that the dinosaur fell into the river after he died and was taken to the sea where he drowned at the bottom.
In the Alberta area at that time there was the same climate as today's Florida and the rivers and oceans moved much further into the interior than it is today.
“This nodosaurus is truly remarkable in that it is completely covered in perfectly stored dirty skin and at the same time it is kept in three dimensions and so we can see its original size,” said Brown.
“For these reasons the animals look practically the same as in the time of the crest.
To rebuild it, you don't have to use your imagination; it's just a bit of an eyebrows and it looks like he's just asleep.'
During the time of the Crescents, there were huge earthquakes, massaging dinosaurs, who moved on two feet.
Although the king of all dinosaurs - Tyronasaurus reg - lived several million years after Borealopelta, this armored dinosaur could have been the favorite benefit of his equally terrible ancestors.
Among them is Acrocanthosaurus, 11.5 meters long monster weighing more than 6 tons.
Researchers, whose latest findings were published in the magazine Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta’s body was discharged into the sea after it was mummified in the bath.
Shawn Funk, who discovered the stone on 21 March 2011, is looking for a return to Suncor Millenium below Canada's Alberty.
According to the museum, it is the world's best preserved protected dinosaur, including skin and armor, which is also complete from the jaw to the jaw.
The animal reached an average length of 5 metres and weighed up to 1300 kg.
His shoulder was about two inches [50 cm] out of his shoulder.
Researchers believe that this exhumer has sailed across the land of Canada today until he ends up in the river that flooded him into the sea.
His underwater tomb kept the body in perfect condition.
Fossil residues of this type are also retained to the extent that the protected coatings around the skull are still covering the rest of the skin.
As Michael Greshko wrote the gate for National Geographic, “finding such a protected entity can be compared to winning in the lottery.
The longer I follow him, the more shocking the finding seems to me.
Fossil residues of this type are also retained to the extent that the protected coatings around the skull are still covering the rest of the skin.
On his side lies his right front leg with his fingers pointing upward.
I can easily count the holes on his feet.'
How did one activist find out the answer to the question, ‘Whose Streets?’
On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell shook all over the body.
The day after she arrived in New York, St. Louis's parents sat down in the airbnb room and went through Facebook contributions on their phone.
But she made a contribution to some high school student.
"The police just shot an 18-year-old young man whose body is still lying on the street," he said.
She was surprised that no one else wrote her this post, so she shut down Facebook and opened Twitter.
The user @TheePharoah constantly retweeted her contributions to the wall.
Rapper from St. Louis posted his contributions on Twitter about Michael Brown's death, an unarmed 18-year-old young man who was shot by a white man in Ferguson, Missouri.
He published a photo of Brown's body, which lies in a stateless street, where no one even took it for four hours.
"That's crazy," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to her and her community.
She left the phone to return to him on the night she watched tweets about people gathering at Canfield Drive.
One of the men said he was the victim's father and held a note with the title "The Ferguson Police killed my unarmed son"!
She was following live news - one of the police stood before a group of protesters, holding a guide in his hand, and at his second end of a jumping dog.
In another video, another cop was holding a gun in his hand, which he was pointing at and saying, "I'm going to kill all of you... animals."
"It's not normal," said Ferrell.
“This is not the type of murder that we have been accustomed to and which we can call normal.
I felt a bunch of skin all over my body.
"I was angry and cried."
She went back and went home the other day.
After arriving at 23:00, she took her six-year-old daughter from her father and decided that they would be released to Ferguson in the morning.
The story of what happened to Ferrell and the city of Ferguson over the next three years describes the new document "Whose Streets?", which will appear in the cinema on 11 August.
It is a story of survival and protests, love and resistance, strength and incompetence told from the perspective of the people living in the community who go out to the streets and demand answers.
On the way to Ferguson, Ferrell initiated a dialogue with his daughter - dressed in a flower dress and the same flower front - on the subject that had been discussed many times before - "about black experience".
"Do you remember how I taught you about how black people had to fight for what they believed?" she recalls the conversation.
"Now we're going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old and that's not right."
"It didn't seem like I'd take it with me," Ferrell later said.
“Today’s events are the fulfillment... of what has happened in the past.
She had to know and see it in her own eyes and grow up in it.
She needed to develop not only in activism and organization, but at the same time she needed to know the difference between different layers of black experience and what we need to do to get rid of ourselves.
Although I am able to assure her of the conditions in which she does not live on her own skin of racism, she does not differ in any way from another black child-wife.
I feel that if I were to protect her from this experience, I would only harm her."
After arriving in Ferguson, South Florist Road was the first stop on the road to the police department, which became the basis of activists who expected policemen Darren Wilson's words about his possible involvement in the incident.
This is where Ferrell and his daughter met the local businessman who prepared for the other food.
Together, they prepared food for the bags and helped to spread it to Protestants.
In the eyes of Ferrell, he began to give birth slowly to a new type of activism.
"My activism turned up on foot after 9 August," said Ferrell, adding that when studying at the University of Missouri-St. Louis High School, she was the president of the Minority Student Nurses Assn. Association and sought to introduce health care and food in black communities.
“I had no experience with the organization.
It was natural."
A few weeks later, during the evening demonstration, Ferrell met a later co-director of the document, Sabaah Folayan.
Folayan said that he and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farnar wanted to "document" the current events.
But Ferrell thought, "Are you working on a document or are you trying to find a story that could be used?"
Such a type of skepticism has penetrated the community through many people, often white people, who wanted to earn on pain and decisions.
As Folayan explained in a recent discussion: “We have heard that the voices of people who are born and raised in Ferguson are very often overlooked and we wanted to change that. ”
Folayan has already engaged with co-rapporteur Damon Davis, who is a renowned local artist who deals with the subject of prisoners for the purpose of death.
His participation in the project also interested Ferrell and the other six locals who were following the "Whose Streets" team in the years following Brown's murder.
"No one speaks for us in this document, but it is our statement," said Davis.
"It was important to me - how these people will be represented - because I will be represented in the same way."
While the aim of the document was not to focus on the experiences of Ferrell - in an attempt to show that the movement "not about the rescue leader, but about the proximity of the community," Folayan said - it proved that it was precisely she that was most intimidating to participate in the filming.
The document "Whose Streets?" describes the very personal aspect of Ferrell's life, for example how she fell in love with her wife.
"I felt naked," said Ferrell with a smile on his face when thinking about the first moment when she looked at the final version of the document.
"But I understand that in order to do this work and to protect black people, I have to open up."
The story of Ferrell also highlights the role of the middle black woman in the broader aspect of Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of movement - who created in response to the murder of Teenager Trayvona Martin in 2012 on social media campaigns under #BlackLivesMatter - call themselves weird.
"Black central women in leading positions are ultimately behind the movement," Ferrell said, "because we are constantly fighting on multiple fronts.
Black Central Women must bear the burden of these events."
Folayan agrees with this statement and adds that “the movement is actually supported by black women and a large number of middle black women.”
However, it follows that "this is not just an affirmative matter" and Ferrell is not the main hero of the document because of his opinions.
"It was just her driving power and energy," she said.
“It is not an accident that she just felt in the front lines, because life on these crosshairs in the skin of a black strange woman is dangerous.
You feel the energy attack even before the screen."
In the meantime, back in Ferguson, television station cameras have cleared their position, but the difficult race between the community and the police are surviving.
Ferrell is a two-and-a-half-year condition for blocking the road during demonstrations.
The social political atmosphere in the area called home is described as "an disorder."
Yet it does not stop in its efforts, which she has committed to since three years ago, to the streets of Ferguson.
“It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We have to love and support each other.
The only thing we can lose is our chains."
There was a field burning in Cologne.
There were dozens of firemen in place, helping with the helicopter.
Not far from the Czech Ship in Cologne, between the towns of Bylana and Liblice, the area was about 15 hectares long from 14:00.
The fire stopped spreading around 15:15 , the firemen declared the third stage of fire fire from four possible .
According to the spokespersons of Ladislav Holomčíka, he helped fire from the air to fire a helicopter.
At 6:00 p.m., the fire broke out, and the fire damaged 700,000 crowns.
There were dozens of professional and voluntary firemen fighting on the spot.
The fire was caused by a technical mishap in the motor space of the van.
Hasit also helped the helicopter, who carried out a total of six wells of water.
"Instead of the intervention we have handed over to the owner until 8:00 tomorrow, the unit of voluntary firemen will watch him," Holomčík said today.
And Coming Resemblance: artists create portraits using the DNA of Chelsea Manning
In the middle of one of the rooms of the New York Fridman Gallery, there are just a few faces of different shades of fur - white, black and breakfast - hanging from the ceiling on the wires.
All 30 portraits were made by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from the lipsticks and hair sent by Chelsea Manning.
Manning's samples were sent from Fort Leavenworth Prison, where his former analyst was punishing 35-year-olds for unauthorized publication of secret cableograms on WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which was launched on 2 August, bears the name A Coming Resemblance.
It is the result of a two-year correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, which combines his experience with technology, information and art, and Manning - a transsexual and pro-scientist dissident whose sentence was reduced by Obama three days before his departure from the post of President of the United States.
By using DNA Manning's algorithmic analysis and using 30 portraits to illustrate how a person with this genotype would look, Dewey-Hagborg created a brilliance, unless an intellectual comment on DNA's susceptibility - as well as many ways in which DNA can be interpreted - and the ingenious determinism of these interpretations, as well as identities.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward Manning, has been talking about being considered a woman since her youth. She was convicted in 2013 on the basis of twenty charges, including violations of six spy laws, computer fraud and theft.
All her photographs were kept by the prison staff. Only one black and white photo of the lower quality was left to the public, on which Manning, apparently concerned, sits on the driver's seat in the platinum blonde paruce, which is now connected.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg’s 2012 Foreigner Visions project was still positive.
In the context of this project, Dewey-Hagborg used various forensic objects - such as cigarettes and chewers - to create images of these people.
And right now she got e-mail from Paper Magazine.
"They were going to interview Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted to add an article to their portrait," Dewey-Hagborg explained when opening a new exhibition.
However, visits and photography were not allowed, so they asked Chelsea if she would be interested in DNA portraits.
The artist and her prisoner must have been shy for two years through correspondence.
They even created a comic with the name Deleted Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanung, who represented a vision of what would happen if Chelsea was loved and could participate in the exhibitions personally.
President Obama actually asked for Manning's release a few days after the comical release, which was a welcome change after several years of unbearable military prison in Kansas.
It is interesting, indeed, that the exhibition is taking place right at the time when Donald Trump is waging a war with people who are trying to publish government information and transgenic soldiers, while trying to find new ways to encourage their tweets to protect in areas that should be supported.
In answer to a question about this special timing, Dewey-Hagborg stated that “all is happening for some reason”.
According to the artist's statement on one of the wall of the gallery, Manning is calling on his huge signature (literally "i" is run by the heart) after the end of the "self-contained fractionation based on sex, race, sexuality and culture".
On the opposite side are the sequence of its mitochondrial DNA - a hundred letters C, G and A recorded by the pen.
By listing 200 letters (or nucleotides, according to the sophisticated scientific dictionary of the artist) Dewey-Hagborg wanted to illustrate how surprisingly similar, at least on the biological side, we are all.
“I hope that people will take care of it, that our genome does not depend on who we are, and that genetic data is subjective and everyone can explain it according to their own," Dewey-Hagborg said.
"DNA will tell many different stories, this is 30 of them."
The last sample of the exhibition, located in a separate room, is the only page from the above-mentioned graphic novelty.
He's showing Manning who's driving King Kong from the United States Disciplinary Barracks prison with a megaphone in his hand.
"As soon as they stop you from speaking, they win," it says.
"Never let yourself be silent."
"It's a direct recipe from one of the letters," the Fiddlelf said to the artist.
"When I think about it, my skin jumps."
Manning’s exhibition has not been personally visited - as foretold in the comic book - but when this happens, it will be welcomed in the middle of the room with its masks, its own genomic characters, sorted as a crowd of Protestants.
Which was also for the purpose of the exhibition, including almost 160 cm high soybeans of Maning, on which her genetic haplos groups are recorded with ink.
"In the past, they were placed on the walls, but this time I wanted to make them feel a touch," Dewey-Hagborg said about portraits.
"I wanted to give you the impression of mass movement that takes Chelsea's form and frees her."
Professor of the Northwest University and employee of the Oxford University for murder
In these days, an international search is being carried out for professor of Northwest University and Oxford University staff who are charged with murdering a man who was found stabbed to death in a luxurious Chicago apartment, the police said.
On Monday, the arrester was issued for the murder of the first degree on a man named Wyndham Latham (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. Jamese Cornell-Duranleau, the court's Cook County.
The document says that Cornell-Duranleau (26) died of several stab wounds.
The Chicago police reported that the body of the dead was found on 27 July.
The police were informed by telephone. Upon arrival at Grand Plaza Apartments they found the victim in one of the apartments with several market wounds.
Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead and the detectives are investigating the case as murder.
Lathem has been working on the position of professor of microbiology and immunology at the Northwest University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice-President of the University for Public Relations, stated in his e-mail statement that Lathem is now on administrative leave and was forbidden to enter the university's school premises.
"The whole matter is now being investigated by the competent authorities and the Northwest University is working with them fully," Cubbage said.
Warren is an executive financial manager at Oxford University.
Speaking Universities and Somerville College stated in an e-mail statement: “The British police contacted us and we are ready to assist the American police as well.”
The statement also states that Warren's colleagues were really shocked and wanted to report to the police.
Anthony Guglielmi, head of contact with the Chicago Police Department, said he called on suspects to surrender to the competent authorities.
"Police has information about their place of residence and the attempt to investigate suspects is stagnant," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi added that local, regional and international authorities are helping to investigate suspects.
According to Guglielmi, the police received a call from the manager of the Grand Plaza building, who was alerted to the events that were to occur in apartment number 1008.
The police described the whole scene as very violent.
Guglielmi said it was not clear if the incident occurred on July 27th.
He added that Latham and Warren were captured by security cameras.
"We believe that Professor Latham knew his victim," Guglielmi said.
The Grand Plaza management issued a statement for all residents: “Police is now working on establishing a timetable and profile of the victim and is investigating various motives, including domestic violence.”
"In the near future we will complete the plan of WADA" - Vice-President of the Russian Government Mutko
The Vice-President of the Russian Government Vitaly Mutko said it would not take long to implement the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and the re-establishment of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSAD).
‘At present, part of the criteria for the new plan has already been completed and RUSADA has already obtained the right to plan and test in cooperation with the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
In view of this fact, the WADA plan was updated," Mutko said on Thursday.
The vice-president commented on the second part of the WADA plan to implement the Code - which describes the criteria for restoring the validity of RUSADA - which was recently published on the organisation's website.
According to Mutka, the Code contains nothing Russia should worry about.
“All have been notified and everything will also be implemented.
The results will be available to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and Wada as soon as possible," he added.
However, one of the above criteria calls for the alleged sponsorship of Russian sportsmen's assessment of the results of the Wada investigation by Richard McLaren after public notice.
Mutko said on this subject: “We know the investigation because our antidoping system has obviously failed.
It has been adapted to all measures.
However, there have been no state programmes in our country and we cannot therefore admit anything that has never existed."
Mutkov's words were confirmed by Vitaly Smirnov, Director of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
In his interview with Russian RSport Smirnov, he acknowledged the problems of Russian anti-doping factors, but added: “On many occasions we have stated that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one plans to accept the report entirely without exception," Smirnov married.
WADA suspected RUSADU of carrying out doping checks in Russia in November 2015 immediately before the doping scandal.
However, the organisation approved the planning and pooling of testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD) this June.
Following a visit by the Moscow Centre of the Organization in July, Director General WADA Olivier Niggli stated that RUSADA is "in the right direction" to restore its validity.
The police accused three people, one of them young.
The police accused three men of setting up a central fire of a rare wooden church in Trincium-Gutech on Frýdecko-Místeck.
One accused is young, all three are Czech.
For a crime of general danger, they are threatened with 15 years in prison.
To the press today, Moravian Police Director Tomáš Kužel told the press.
He thought it was an intentional crime.
"It's a very fresh matter and the police are currently working on the motive of the whole matter," Kužel said.
He said the police would be dealing with possible arrests of the prisoners.
Further information according to the Director cannot be published.
"More so now I can't communicate because, in fact, the criminal police and investigation and the state representative who is overseeing the case are working on matters," Kužel said.
The wooden church of God’s body in Gutès dates back to the 16th century.
He was a valuable monument with many original equipment and images from the first half of the 16th century.
Major damage is estimated to be up to tens of millions of crowns, but historical loss is uncountable.
The raids after the fire began to consider rebuilding the church.
Most of the costs should cover the insurance, other costs are prepared to be shared by the Ministry of Culture and the City, the public collection is also being prepared and calculated with the contribution of the memory owner, i.e. local parishes.
A similar wooden church of St. Catherine of the 16th century in Ostrave-Hrab also destroyed 15 years ago a fire.
It was then an electrical installation facility.
Then there was an exact copy of it.
The State shall count with the citizens in the defence of the State.
He'll support their training.
With financial support for companies that are useful in the defence of the State, with voluntary shooting training or with a team of trainers, the primary purpose of the law on the readiness of citizens to defend the State is to be calculated.
The Ministry of Defence, which has been commissioned by the government, promises to increase the physical capacity of the Czechs and their capabilities, which could then be used in crisis situations.
It comes from a proposal made by the Ministry.
If the law were to be passed in the future, the state would have imposed hundreds of millions of crowns in support of the defence.
The basic objective of the proposal is to create, in the opinion of its authors, an effective system that would help increase the readiness of the Czech Republic to defend the state, beyond the exercise of the defence obligation and on the basis of will.
For example, the State would support radio amateurs, shooters or quinologists with financial or material support and would enable their members to be better able.
In return, he would receive information about people who are willing to come to the country at a time of crisis and about their abilities or material equipment.
They could also be accredited instructors who would help companies and other stakeholders in training or training.
It also includes organizing words with war veterans or people who have behaved heroicly.
One possible option assumes that a new authority would be created which should be responsible for administrative and project coordination.
The authors of the proposal stress that participation should be voluntary and should make use of their abilities until the state of threat has been declared.
"The whole concept must respect the gradual shooting of previously apparent boundaries between individual types of threats," the reference is made to the risk of so-called hybrid threats.
Ministers have noted that it is therefore necessary to focus on support for the widest possible number of capabilities, not just those of the military.
"The basic objective is to create a very broad framework that will enable every citizen to respond adequately to the situation that threatens the sovereignty of the State or life, health and property of persons, to protect himself, where appropriate contributing to the protection of others, and to avoid misbehaviour by the armed forces of the Czech Republic," the aim is stated.
The adoption of the law would bring a lot of financial demands.
Their height will be determined by the Ministry on the chosen variant.
For example, the Office provides financial support for projects to prepare citizens for the defence of the state up to 100 million crowns.
If an administrative and coordination centre was set up, its operation could be around 60 million crowns a year.
Other money would go to pay or to build an information system.
The proposal also assumes that it would have to extend the scope of the National Military Commands, which would employ 42 other soldiers together.
The representatives of the Ministry have previously stated that the law should also help resolve the disagreement between certain Czech policies with the introduction of the European Union Directive on the possession of arms.
Its adoption would allow shooters who will be part of the system to leave some of the weapons prescribed by the directive.
Startups that will help your company not to be with another Uber
Amy Errettová wanted to measure the level of satisfaction of the employees of her e-commerce startup, but she did not find the appropriate research.
The answers were often inaccurate, useless, or even misleading.
And although she promised an anonymous survey, some employees expressed their distrust of the whole process.
"I was looking for consistency and objectivity," said Errett, owner of Madison Reed's e-commerce hair care company, who lives in San Francisco, who employs 75 people.
So she asked for help outside.
New startups from the human resources sector are constantly on the market, helping companies to explore the satisfaction of employees.
The creation and licensing of software for the purpose of measuring employees' obligations enables start-ups to conduct rapid voting, to target specific teams and demographic groups, further offers a complete anonymity of employees and a hot line for complaints, and in some cases also allows informants to be monitored and contacted directly by the Director.
"There are tools on the market such as Strava and Fitbit that monitor your health status, but where is Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of Glint with a seat in Reedwood City.
Errett stated that in three years' time, Glint gained more knowledge of what her employees thought and how they felt.
In addition to quick research and voting of specific teams, Glint offers a company's temperature map and a random overview of groups with the highest number of complaints, as well as a list of low-rated managers - which allows users to work on repair.
Communities are beginning to realize that it is necessary to look after the culture of the working environment - in the event that another Uber becomes one of them - who fails in the scandals after the former employee published on his blog a contribution describing the business environment and the difficulties of employees who dare to speak openly.
For startups like Glint, a demand for company culture research is a lucrative business opportunity.
According to the Let's Talk Payments website, which deals with technical and financial progress, the value of the global control, regulation and compliance sector can exceed $118.8 billion by 2020.
Startup Converter from Denver, Colorado, who is helping companies to prevent and detect inappropriate behavior, saw a slight increase in interest and activity at the beginning of the year, just before Uber's scandals.
Between nearly 600 Converter customers are Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Recently, Uber was also accepted under his wings.
Like Glint, the Converter allows companies to send custom "light" research, collect confidential information in real time and display hot maps of problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous text hotline that allows employees to report inappropriate behaviour.
If the Director-General is involved in the problem, the complaints shall be forwarded directly to the Management Board.
"The Court of Justice of Public Opinions has empowered regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and executive director of the Converter.
If the company is proven to be guilty of wrong conduct with its employees or non-ethical conduct - and if the regulators do not proceed - it can face the costly consequences of boycotting customers, exhausting employees or court proceedings, Quinlan added.
The Ruby Tuesday restaurant network, which employs over 25,000 people across 500 locations, uses the Converter more than a year to raise employees' awareness of corporate principles and procedures and to ensure an easy way to contact corporate management.
Earlier, if the employee wanted to report any problem, he had to search for a telephone number or e-mail to run the company, officially give complaint and hope in a fair solution.
It was often a frightening and unpleasant experience, said James Vitrano, deputy general Ruby Tuesday, who said that there had been no reliable way of monitoring complaints against employees.
Now that the company is using the Converter, rapid detection and resolution of problems that have never occurred before to managers sitting in offices have been ensured for miles away from the actual settlement of complaints - such as discrimination, difficulties or unfair treatment.
"This is close to a holistic, overall view of employee experience," said Vitrano, who runs Ruby Tuesday's risk management group.
"At the same time, we protect shareholders from judicial disputes on the part of employees."
The companies stopped taking on the ethics, values and participation of employees on a lightweight basis in 2002 after accounting Arthur Andersen collapsed after Enron's fall on the abuse of the ethical rights of employees, Quinlan said.
But just when "the social media has been lighting up everything", companies have begun to realize that they can't just hide their bones in the box in the online world.
"Before people started using technology to monitor ethics, they relied on faith," Quinlan added.
Glint and Converter offer their software in the form of a service for which companies pay regular fees.
It is a business model and opportunity approved by courageous capital investors who supported both startups.
The Converter has chosen within his February campaign from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital a total of $10 million and finally took the capital of $47 million.
Glint won $10 million in November from Besemer Venture Partners and won $60 million throughout the campaign.
These investments are a surprise because of the mutual nature of companies, culture and risk capital.
The increasing number of studies clearly confirms that today’s employees expect more from their workplace than ever before.
And in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, they are not the main advantage of high wages and interesting projects.
Employees want to see that they are accepted and appreciated and that they are spending their time in a company that is trying to do a positive job.
"If people in their work are happy, they believe their voice is heard, and their work is rewarding, they strive for the success of society," said Nina McQueen, Vice-President of Global Benefits and Employment Benefits LinkedIn, who uses Converter and Glint.
Investors earn if companies and companies prosper if they are satisfied with their employees.
And when there is an analytical tool on the market that ensures the commitment and commitment of employees to the company, it is not surprising that there are many investors who support this effort.
According to labour culture experts, it is important to have data on employee satisfaction.
But the data itself is ineffective if the company does not take the necessary steps.
The fact is that once the company requests feedback from its employees, there may be major changes.
And if the change does not happen quickly - in the worst case at all - it can lead to disappointment and lack of interest on the part of employees.
"As soon as you ask for 4000 opinions, you must be prepared for 4,000 conversions," said Russell Raath, the consulting director at Kotter International, who was the witness of many companies that relied too heavily on the data itself.
“Because as soon as you don’t get to the end, the employees start asking themselves, ‘ Did they hear me at all?
Do they care about me?
And if not, why should I be interested?"
Madison Reed, who now regularly conducts a survey among employees each month, can solve the problem by one day, Errett said.
After collecting feedback from employees who were frustrated by slow decision-making and quality of communication, Erretová was able to reorganise several teams within the company and start communication training to solve the problem.
Ruby Tuesday has a very important view of her employees and hopes that she will achieve a long-term high level of employment in the field known as frequent dismissal.
"If you do not try to create a transparent working environment, employees will not believe you," Vitrano added.
“And once you start losing the employee, you will lose customers.
And with customer feedback, the whole company ends up."
Thursday became the warmest day.
Thursday is with 38.3 degrees recorded in The Watchtower in Hodoninska until the warmest day of the year in the Czech Republic.
He won such a Tuesday, which was originally the warmest day of the year with 37.3 degrees.
The staff of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute were informed about this.
On Tuesday, however, there were not many thermal records.
Weather hit Moravia mainly, in the Czech Republic it was mostly cloudy.
On Tuesday, 35 of the 145 meteorological stations measured over 30 years were overrun or recorded.
On Thursday, the record recorded only nine long-term measuring stations.
Perhaps the present temperature in The Watchtower was the same as the previous 2013 record.
In the Ice Age of today's 37.4 degrees, the original maximum of four tenths was exceeded and the current 37.1 degrees exceeded the record by three tenths in the Burns in Brno.
Both records as well as the Watchtower came from 2013.
High temperatures have emerged today mainly in the south and east of Moravia.
After the Watchtower, there was the biggest wind in the Dyjakovics on Znoemska and Brod nad Dyj nad Breclavska, where the mercury was evaporated to 37,8 degrees, but the record did not surpass.
On the other hand, for example, in western and northwestern Czech Republic, the ČHMU website has now reached the highest temperatures of only about 22 degrees Celsius.
"The temperatures there started to grow until later this afternoon," the meteorologists reported.
The current weather in the Czech Republic will be gradually recharged according to the ČHMU, and more rain may come on Sunday.
Most Moravia sites, however, will remain high temperatures on Friday and in the southeast of Moravia and on Saturday.
We've had such a mess here.
The billionaires do not have the same vote in elections as any one full-time man in the country.
They want to decide directly, and because not all are as bold as Andrej Babish, who wants to own a state, they buy political parties.
The owner of Penty Marek Fellowship with other colleagues for Martin Burdou and Antony Fryč sponsors Robeyškov Realists.
The second life of the Civil Democratic Alliance is funded by the owner of the insurance and the businessman in the reality of Pavel Sehnal, who is also president of his party.
The convicted corrupter and the king of Czech gambling Ivo Valent ordered the Private Party.
The political movement of Agrofert, as Andreje Babiš's project has been misnouncing the cross-border mayor Jaroslav Germany, is a chapter for himself.
Their billionaires have recently caught the Mayors too.
He's Dalibor Grandpa, the company's owner of Jablotron's security system.
According to his own words, he enters politics to do good.
Entrée in the old man's dress, but Grandpa didn't make it too well.
"I've never had little goals," he said at a press conference.
That means that my goal is to move the UN to win the mayor's move in the election of twenty percent.
Leckdo's pussy.
Grandfather's denial is more subtle.
The billionaire Dalibor Grandpa is a man of strong opinions.
While he intends to vote on the votes of the voters in the Old Age dress, he continues to support Andreje Babiš.
Grandfather has supported Babi in the past parliamentary elections.
"Babish is not a sharp speaker and does not rule the popular rhetoric of political hads," he wrote about him before the elections in 2013.
But it certainly doesn't go into politics because he wants to improve himself.
For me, Babi will remain a hero.
He's willing to step out of his world under his control and do something for all of us.
Shortly after the mayors introduced her as a new force, he confessed to his admiration for Babish again.
And he said he wanted the Elders to learn how to work together with Granny.
Some may estimate that the Grandfather does not change his views and stands behind him regardless of what dress he wears.
Others may speculate if Babish is sending to the elders to build his bee someone so impervious.
Another question might be asked if Jablotron's boss and Agrofert may not have grown up in the wrong place in the store and is not looking for another way to defend his rival.
Granddad's first public performance, but it wasn't just around Granny.
Grandpa promised to send ten million crowns to the mayor's campaign.
And if they need more money, they'll send more.
A few years ago, it would be hard for anyone to stop over a similar sentence.
The other well-known guaner Zdeněk Bakala, before the 2010 elections, spent millions on all sides.
The political division of the security agency Vita Barty, TOP 09 and civil democrats have come together to almost thirty million.
But today's another time.
The law prohibits any political party from giving more than three million.
When Grandpa was getting into politics, he could at least study the rules of the game.
Maybe then you don't have to ask yourself why our policy is so bad.
His first days in politics then Grandpa crowned the proposal to tax benefits for families with students.
People with higher education come to us every month for about 50 thousand.
You're based on a few 20s.
A man with fifty thousand is rich on this side.
The one with the 20 poor.
In the Grand Duchy's vision, poor people pay taxes and rich people benefit from the functioning of a social state that they do not share.
The rich need to help them not to lose their sense of urgency.
The elders can congratulate one another on their new acquisitions and Babi will have many hands.
The rest of us can confirm that the billions are not good people.
Then there's another question to choose.
For me, those who know the rules of the game and want to keep them.
Those who do not have their members and members of their party or citizens and citizens of the State as their employees and the country as their property.
And finally, those who want to live well in a rich land, not just some.
No one wanted Trump's paradise.
The villa complex had to cost 234 million.
Selling real estate is sometimes not easy.
And sometimes he can't help 11 beds, a beautiful view of the sea, or the fact that the property is selling US president Donald Trump.
At the sale of the villa complex Le Chateau des Palmiers, the price went down to an incredible 8 million pounds.
He's been reporting on this website, Mirror.co.uk.
The brochure says, "Hello, Donald J. Trump."
Stay away from the place like no other.
However, neither the association of a real society with the US President was able to defend an extreme price.
Donald Trump had to lower the price of his Caribbean seat by an incredible 8 million pounds.
The original property price was 21.5 million pounds, the final price fell to 13 million pounds.
Even after the loss, the villa complex stands at about 76 average apartments in central Prague.
And there's nothing to be surprised at.
St. Martin has a beautiful 5 acre area on the Caribbean island of St. Martin with 12 fully-fledged bathrooms, 11 bedrooms, many dining rooms, solid and other rooms.
It consists of several buildings.
There's also a swimming pool and tennis court.
There are dozens of palm trees planted on the ground.
From the terrace is a beautiful view of the sea.
According to actual experts, the price showed that connection with the president is not enough to attract potential buyers.
Now the property is closer to the usual property prices on the island.
Trump bought real estate in 2013.
According to speculation, he paid about 15 million pounds.
Immobility was to be purchased for rent.
Le Chateau des Palmiers was the most expensive property on the island of St. Martin.
With a new price, it's going to second place.
The property in the neighborhood was estimated at 13.5 million pounds.
The NSAA decided to end up with two workouts a day.
The eleven mornings are coming and UCLA UCLA's American football players are catapulting at the side of a new school playground.
Some of them take their clothes off and discover a comfortable back, the unmistakable sign of the first day of the training camp.
For most of the team's members, this few minutes of work is due to the afternoon break.
Players enrolled in the summer semester will go to rooms after three-hour training to study final exams before returning to the Wasserman Football Center for the meeting that will take place in the morning at 6:30.
"For these boys there will be a real cat for the next three days," said Coach Bruins Jim Mora just before Monday's crash on Tuesday.
By removing two trainings in one day, the NSAA wants to make it easier for players - paradoxically, the training days are even longer - at least until Friday, when the final tests are over.
That's why the first three UCLA exercises are scheduled for 19:15 - to get stuck in so many students' already crossed diaries.
At least for the first time in six seasons, which spent Mora on the position of coach in Westwood, the Bruins training camp starts a week before last year and the training is limited during the summer semester. Its influence should also limit the number of trainings from two to one day.
A total of eighteen training sessions are scheduled until 20 August, starting formal preparations for the first match against the Texas A&M team in September.
It must have been heard that it supported the decision of the NSAA, although it added another item to the already loaded player diary.
"Three or four days players are under great stress and this is very exhausting for them," Mora said.
"But no one has given up, everyone is trying. They're great.
I think that on Saturday, when we have more time, everything will calm down."
UCLA will be closed after completion of the training camp, which will not be easy in view of the clear line of surrounding land from the adjacent parking lot and luxury hotel Luskin Center, which has occupied the players after the protection network is closed.
The Bruins players should want to bet this week, but Mora admits that when the rooms are empty during the season, a problem could arise.
"The land will be guarded by the security service," Mora added.
“Safety is taken care of, but it is not excluded that someone can rent a room and record our training.
He's doing a good deal with this stuff.
Luckily, the hotel will keep a safe, as well as parking lot No. 8.
Let's use our resources to the maximum.
I believe everything will work out well.
It's all planned."
Facebook plans more thorough fact-control to limit the number of false messages
Facebook will send more potentially false articles to control third parties and display findings under the original contributions in an attempt to fight the so-called "fake news", the largest social network said on Thursday.
The company in the statement on its websites writes that it will start using updated machine learning to detect possible hoaxes that will send to third parties to verify and potentially display the results of the study under the original contributions.
Facebook has been designated as one of the main sources of false news and many believe that these unconfirmed reports have influenced the last election of the President of the United States.
The French voters are flooded with false news about the May presidential elections and Germany is planning ahead of the September elections to put a stop to the social media network if they do not quickly remove angry contributions.
Facebook stated on Thursday in its next statement issued in Germany that it is about to launch testing the new function of checking false news in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to displaying reports verified by third parties, people are asking more content to be better informed and can decide what they can share," said Sara Su, a product news manager on Facebook.
She added that Facebook continues to test the "related articles" function and is also working on other changes to reduce the number of false messages.
Creating a graphic novel: story about A Castle in England
The small castle of Scotty Castle recently played a leading role in the Squeeze band music video and found its shelter in it also Margaret Thatcher during the 70th and 80th centuries last century.
However, Scotty was from his shelter at the Bewl River in British Kent, a 700-year-old stormy history that inspired the coarse Jamie Rhodese from the York County, a well-known bay in historical documents, to create a graphic novel.
"A look at the letter of a man who is 300 years after my death fascinates me," says Rhodes with an important face.
"When I hold a letter in my hand, I feel a personal connection."
The graphic novel A Castle in England records the lives of families who lived in the castle of Scottney from the Middle Ages to the Edward period. Each story illustrates a different British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
However, it is not the first book of Rhodes' inspired archives: it is also the author of Dead Men's Teath and Other Stories (2014), a collection of inspired documents of the British Library - a project that was very emotional to him.
"He took my finger print on a letter written by a double agent in the 1970s who worked for Jakobity," he said.
"It's a fingerprint of his finger!
And letters always smell like smoke, because in those times you had to burn a candle to read.
When I get to the letter now, 300 years later, it's like I'm back in time.
How I love archives!"
For someone who is so fascinated by the old papers, support from the National Trust and Arts Council England organization and the possibility of staying in the castle for almost four months as a dream. ("To tell the truth, I stayed a little longer.")
Rhodes spent time examining the Victorian "new" castle, browsing archives and studying many treasures and curious, such as the head of hyenas on the wall and the bottles that were buried after centuries in the countryside.
He walked through the land and examined the ruins of the old castle, spoke to the strangers, gardeners, and sometimes with artists who worked on illustrations to his book.
On the night he "drinked whiskey and wrote."
The confidential story of Scottney is relatively unknown, since the National Trust has gained access to documents until 2006 after the death of the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the employees were just beginning to penetrate the archives that Rhodes described words, as if “the aristocrats of many centuries were spreading out with the words, ‘Know it in the basement’.
Diaries, letters from the time of the British Empire, maps depicting assets: "You may think the dispute about the land is boring," said Rhodes, "but I struck one case when two families were dragging on the shore.
Let the people go!"
Some stories in the book use the castle as a reflective bridge, and it goes deeper into English history, including a story called The Labourer, who follows a man who leaves a newly built castle to join the English uprising in 1381.
"I found a record of the revolt on the castle in 1380, which was called Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex," said Rhodes.
“The English uprising actually started in this area and I thought that rebellion was a good starting point.
Maybe it's kind of related together."
Other stories are closely related to the history of the castle - for example, The Priest, who tells the story of the Jesuit priest, who hid Darrell's family after seven years during the English reform.
Or The Smuggler about an 18th-century paddle named Arthur Darrell, who supposedly staged his own funeral when he filled out the rock's cancer (which was discovered up to a few years after the discovery of the cancer).
Rhodes’s favorite family are Darrells: “I was intrigued by the generation of men — then men were always indebted and wasted money on things they could not afford.
The various generations of the Darrells' family have resolved this by taking rich or old ladies - I imagine they were the men of sight who were shaped by the heads of the heirs."
With the end of the stay at the castle, the Patriot Rhodes after other adventures.
He recently returned from a two-week station in the Finnish wilderness, where he inspired his next book about Elämenmäki, a former sanatorium from the beginning of the 20th century that was absorbed by nature.
But it's a special place for Scottney.
"I was sad when I left," he said.
"I said, 'Now I'm going to go back to real life.'
Washington changes the terms of the green card
The media published President Donald Trump's words on the new US immigration plan, which will also change in the granting of a green card.
The number of legal immigrants is expected to fall by 50,000 every year as a result of more stringent rules on temporary work visas and restrictions on family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and the President.
The bill will soon be submitted to Congress.
"This law reduces poverty, increases wages and saves billions of dollars for taxpayers. We aim to change the rules for issuing green cards to residents of other countries.
The law limits the number of immigrants and replaces the current scheme.
The new application process is a priority English-speaking applicant who is in the hands of financial resources and demonstrates the capabilities that will benefit our country," said Trump, quoted by the media.
Sexual robots are on the rise - we should be careful
Just when it seemed that 2017 could not be more bizarre, the report on the technological development of sexual robots appears online.
Yes.
Sexual robots are really popular at the moment.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently issued a statement on the development of sexual robots within the next five to ten years.
According to former professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University and FRR co-founder Noel Sharkey, it is necessary to take seriously the rise of sexual robots.
Customers can choose the color of the eyes, the shape of the beard and the look of the nails.
"People are hiding from them, but they are growing, and we need to be prepared to see them as often as possible," Sharkey said on the occasion of the release of the report.
Modern sexual aids are transformed from inflaming Mr. to Robotic women with silicone skin, which is pleasantly warm to touch - of course is artificial intelligence that imitates human behavior.
The user can "adjust" the robot to his image - from the color of the eyes and shape of the beard to the look and color of the nails.
It is very worrying, however, that many robots have their own "personality", which would also bring reproach on the Stepford Miss.
Modern fissures developed into a robotic woman with silicone skin.
The owner of the RealBotix robot can set up his replacement wife's different character patterns, including shyness.
And then there is a sex robotic woman Roxxxy Gold company True Companion, which is supplied with pre-programmed personalities, including "frigid Farrah", which is characterized by a shameful character and "wild Wendy" with a "good" character.
“The personality of Roxxxxy Gold is set in such a way that it reflects your personality as much as possible,” says True Companion’s website.
So he likes what you like, and he likes what you like.
She's even as busy as people.
It can be tired, loud or "in the mood".
The rise of sexual robots is alarming right now for several reasons - among which there is no substitute for real inter-military relationships. Concerns are more of the inferior feminine features and violent attacks - e.g. frigid (read insulting) Farrah.
True Companion on its websites compares Roxxxxy to a man vibrator.
"If a woman can have a vibrator, why couldn't she have a man Roxxy?" it's on the page.
However, sexual robots are not just fetishes or sexual aids.
Their emergence and almost perfect sophistication indicate something darker and deeper rooted in our culture - a retreat from ideal or sexual equality towards thirst for undermanive sex with selective passion.
Most men obviously do not buy a robotic woman and while the FRR is talking about their growing popularity, sexual robots are still at the edge of the public interest.
However, this territorial interest can become a mirror of the present modern era.
And most people aren't weird or violent until they've got a free market.
It is no coincidence that these sophisticated sexual robots appear at a time when women around the world enjoy their rights and sit in the White House, a president who is often very shy at the address of a woman.
The most terrible aspect of the series History of the Service is not what we see - wrapped bodies and eye-breaths, as rather the reality of these visions.
The book presentation The History of the Servant represents a step in the right direction, but at the same time it seems to be a small step.
Sexual robots are as much like real women as possible (although with porn rates).
Their creators build them so that they are nice to touch and act on the first look as a real woman.
However, when it comes to their "personality", the robot cannot replace a real woman.
They can't break up with their partner or just leave.
They have no work or history, nothing that would cause their independence or undermine their loyalty to their Lord.
In other words, they're pleasant slaves.
Says the 21st century: official.
NBA star on the green line.
Curry's fighting in California about the corner.
The star basketball player Stephen Curry didn't lose his first premier start in spite of the packed first fire among professional golfers.
The double winner for the most unfavourable NBA player played the Ellie Mae Classic lower web.com Tour in California's Hayward first round on 74 wounds and will fight for cut.
The Golden State player, who won the second title of the Warriors team in NBA this season, started very nervously and ended his first waste in a drink holder in a golf car parked at the fairway.
Even after that, he was not as accurate as under basketball cart, yet behind him with his balance four wounds over a couple of dozen professionals.
"It wasn't the ideal way to start, I had to call the judge immediately after the first fire, but then it was a bit of a sit," Curry said, saying that he was hit by a huge team.
It was very nervous to fire the first morning at the tournament, but it was all I hoped for.
"If you'd told me I'd play 74 in the first round, I'd take it immediately," he added.
If Curry is able to get through with a hearing that is likely to be two wounds under the pair, he will become the first representative of another sport that he can do on the Web.com Tour.
"I want to play next better and now that I'm out of time, maybe it's going to go," said an enthusiastic golfer, who has already played the tournaments and mixed competitions for amateurs and professionals in the past.
In Hayward, it's the first time he starts a tournament that falls under the PGA.
To participate in Ellie Mae Classic, he won a sponsorship and kept his amateur status.
Web.com Tour series is about one category under the elite PGA Tour.
The trumpet's big victory?
In contrast, Mitt Romney is a healthy reason.
The Trump era is an unmistakable sign of political divisions that divide American voters and in microscale also break up the entire family.
In the period of Christmas and Thanksgiving, it was in the U.S. newspapers that the advice was to consult relatives who prefer Trump.
Guess we're just waiting for the nerves to let us go.
Less attention, however, is devoted to the ability of the Trump family to stumble.
I'm talking about it because this week my cousin in New York visited me -- a poet and left fan who lives in Chicago and who paid for the Republican doll for a long time in our family.
She reminded me that in the face of a common enemy, loneliness can have a powerful effect.
Now, with Trump in the White House, there is all of a sudden a whole family - including all the Republican neighbours who have been away from politics for years - on one wave.
At dinner at the family table, it's a good thing; but it's infecting me that in a broader context it's a major risk.
Trump strengthens the left, but the negative effect of his presidency has the power to push all of us out.
When we are talking about "normalization" and Trump, we refer to the terrible possibility that his jokes could one day lose their appeal.
However, there is an even more horrendous long-term scenario in which Trump "normalizes" the Orthodox Republics who, by resisting its standards, will be surprised by what is called rational.
In these days with nostalgia in my heart I remember Mitt Romney and his version of crazy behavior - the dog on the roof of the car, 14% tax on income (at least we were aware of his tax confession) - of which both examples look like very small cuts compared to Trump.
After Trump leaves, the next Republican candidate will be at least normal, which will be an unmistakable improvement.
We used my sister's visits and we took the kids to Central Park for the biggest circuit that runs the New York Park Department - for your three dollars you won't find a better use if you don't need caffeine.
The horses are huge, the middle warrior is covered with sklolaminat - the clowns and animals are filmed and in fear of their own shoulders - a completely cloudy view and zinc music of the shop resembles public transport.
Many clichés soon freeze: the view from the tall buildings, the panoramas are looking, instead of the atmosphere and the reality of the city is missing from your imaginations.
About 50 years later, I still haven't moved through the fact that Swiss Cottage is actually not Swiss cheese - it doesn't count the thematic house Ye Old Swiss Cottage - but the subway station in London.
In Central Park, however, it is a remarkable magical experience to the extent that it will have a great time with two two-year-olds, as well as two mature women.
If I could evaluate around here, he'd deserve a maximum of points, but no one's lucky.
This week, I experienced similar experience in the store when I was asked to assess my "loans" on a scale from one to five when I paid the credit card.
In the coffee shop on the corner of my street it's the same, except that I can score 15% for something I buy behind the counter.
Not only does it slow down a different fast sale, but the waiter is forced to sneak into the nice buyers when it's not necessary.
The woman in the store smiled at me when I reluctantly rated my credit card transfer with five stars.
Oscar Pistorius was transferred from prison to hospital for chest pain
This is the second thing that Pistorius had to be transferred to the hospital.
Last year he was treated for cutting wounds on his wrist, which, according to the prison statement, caused himself to fall into the cell.
The Pistorius was convicted of murder after the appeal against the original judgment for murder.
He killed his girlfriend Steinkamp in the early morning hours of Valentine's Day in 2013 with several gunshot wounds through the door of the toilet box in his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed he was wrong with the thief.
The complainants announced their intention of revoking this time against the six-year punishment of Pistorius, which is too modest according to their words.
The National Prosecuting Authority stated that it is referring to the South African Supreme Court and that the trial will take place this year.
In the event of success, Pistorius is threatened with an extension of the sentence to 15 years.
There is no death penalty in the South African Republic.
For the first time in history, she gave birth to a young man who was being held captive by a savage.
For the rescue program, it's a huge success.
The center is trying to expand the genofunds of the pands kept in custody.
Chang Č-chung's center worker told the New China agency that the herd's behavior poses a major risk to relatives.
Only 471 p.d.s. lived in captivity at the end of last year.
There are only two thousand survivors in the open countryside.
Trying to get caught up with those savages is such a first step to help the herd protect this species.
The fifteen-year-old Cchao-cchao was released to the natural reservation at the beginning of the panda maturing period on 11 March.
Thanks to the monitoring device on the neck, scientists could observe every step of it.
She met her chosen Cchao-cchao 12 days later.
The sexual relationship with a male panda lasted a minute and a half and achieved a successful outcome.
It can also be seen as a small miracle because male pandas are not considered to be the most successful pet kingdom.
Males are relatively poorly estimate the time when females are ready, and in addition, they are often confused and unaware of what to do.
A young woman was born healthy and, given that Chao-chao had an extraordinary appetite during pregnancy, weighed 216 grams.
The average weight of the newborn panda is 70 grams lower.
Two Bulgarians were detained for illegal camping in Greece
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced the detention of two Bulgarian tourists in the territory of Greece for illegal camping, the statement quoted bTV.
A group of tourists, including two Bulgarians, were detained in the early hours of the Estonian police.
They were all released the same day, but the investigation continues.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced to the BTV that Bulgarian tourists were later released.
The Greek authorities have stepped up the rules of free camping and impose strict penalties on anyone who is caught in a place where camping is not allowed.
Controls will take place throughout the season.
The Ministry has stated that the court may impose a fine.
Spilk is after the first round of the British Open in the 50th place.
Golfist Klara Spilková is the first major of the British Open in the 50th place.
The playing field in the Scottish Kingsbarns had a score of one hit under a pair when she played three times a Birdy and twice a Bogey.
A 20-year-old Czech player so hopes that the famous Major will be heard for the first time.
The top American star Michelle Wieov, who won the first round in the 64th injury record, was awarded a $3.25 million prize.
Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands are downloading millions of toxic eggs from the market.
As a result of the incident, the Netherlands alone has temporarily closed 180 poultry.
The Dutch Food Safety Authority NVWA reported that it is investigating 20 per cent of all Dutch poultry, which in its view means that 80 per cent of eggs on the market are inconvenient.
The Authority stressed that the risk represented only a limited number of types of eggs identified by specific numbers.
According to the German authorities, the amount of toxic substances in eggs is small and poses no danger to adults, but the potential threat is for children.
The Czech SVS spoke Petr Majer said that eggs and chickens from the Netherlands and Belgium, where the authorities also joined in closing their flocks, were not moving to the Czech Republic lately.
However, veterinarians will take egg and chicken sampling samples originating in Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Italy, Germany and Poland, on which the problem signs of insecticide have appeared on the markets.
The eggs from Belgium were last on the Czech market in April and the eggs from the Netherlands last on May.
The chicken meat from Belgium last appeared in the Czech Republic in June.
In the Czech Republic, however, there is a certain amount of chicken meat from the Netherlands.
Fipronil is a substance that is part of preparations against lightning, all and clichés.
However, it must not be administered to animals whose meat is consumed by humans.
The WHO World Health Organization considers it to be a bit toxic.
His high doses lead to feelings of nausea and vomiting.
Riga is beautiful, I'm gonna miss it, says Golman Sedláček and is looking for an engagement.
I'd like to catch ten more years.
"Maybe I'll go back there once," said a 27-year-old Sedláček, who could start the season in the waxy dress.
It depends on whether the engagement will take place before the start of the new anniversary.
What were the four years you lived in Latvia?
If I were to evaluate it as being in school, it would be three.
The first year I didn't catch too much. I had an experienced golman in front of me.
I learned.
The second year I started to catch.
I thought they were giving me more space before the third season.
But they brought a new golman I met again.
Last year, I assumed I'd still be catching.
But during the opening ten matches, we got only five points, so the coaches started playing.
In the end, my colleague caught more.
But that's how it's done.
They wanted to play him next season.
What was life like in Rize?
It's beautiful.
It's little Prague.
A beautiful, European, historic city.
I'm gonna miss it.
I found my girlfriend there.
We're together for the third year, next year we'll get married.
So I got something.
How hard is KHL for the barber?
The first ten teams are really good.
Then there are teams like us or Slovan who have to change their game style against them.
Skill is on the other side, so you have to replace it with something.
It means playing more back, fighting more.
I didn't see a problem in the width of the playground.
The difference is that the Russians want to play empty.
The minute they shoot, and even if they have a half-empty branch in front of them, they prefer to record.
There's only more shooting in the Czech Republic.
Didn't you have a problem traveling and moving over seven time zones?
If you don't have a family, it's not a problem.
He can sleep in peace.
The program is mostly done so you can play four games outside and then you have two days off.
How does Lotyshi even perceive their club in KHL?
Like a national team.
The whole of Latvia is watching hockey, together with basketball, it's a national sport.
Fans, all of them.
Even though it didn't work out, a lot of people went.
Did the action of Dinam in KHL help to bring Latvia to the fourth quarter of the world's championship this year?
KHL has been playing since 2008 and Dinamo has been there since the beginning.
And from the same time, their results on the world's championship began to go up.
At the 2014 Olympics in Soči, they fell in the quarter final with Canada just 1:2.
That was an unreal result for them.
Thanks to KHL, they got to a higher level.
More and more Latvian players are heading to the Czech Extralige.
In Zlina Roberts Bukarts passed and Ralfs Freibergs before signing the contract.
How come there's so many of them?
They're not a baseball player, they're really good.
These teams are looking for cheaper and younger players from abroad, Lotis among them.
It's a natural direction.
KHL's starting in three weeks.
Why are you still unengaged?
By the beginning of February, I knew I wasn't going to continue in Rice.
That's when we started looking for something.
There was Sparta on the table.
But because they didn't have a golman's budget, we didn't agree.
Then it was classic.
We've been dealing with different teams that decided for someone else in the final.
So I'm training at home in Zlina and I'll wait for something to happen.
Aren't you nervous about that?
That was four years ago when I left here and didn't know what was going to happen.
The current situation is not the best. On the other hand, I'm at home for a while.
I caught something in KHL, so I'm already taking it differently.
The question is when and where I'll sign.
How real is the option that you're going to have a new anniversary in Zlina?
The state can do anything.
We'll see what happens next month, where we'll figure out what's going to happen.
Now I can just wait for the agent to make a deal.
Do you prefer any competition?
The past season wasn't such that I could choose.
So I'm waiting on the phone.
The government's flight to Let continues.
In January of this year, I wrote about a camp in Letech near Orlík in the care of the proper owner.
The underlying problem remains the same, and so I will allow the complainant's passport to be remembered.
He's been talking about camp in Flights for years.
For readers who don't know exactly what this is about, it's probably best if they look at the official cultural sites of Pietní place Leta.
In the introduction of the historical survey, it is found that the camp stood two kilometers east of the village of Leta, that it served as a labor camp since 8.8. 1940, that it served as a collection camp from 1.1. 1942, and that it became a Zicanian camp from 2.8. 1942.
The next text describes the life course of the camp, including non-human conditions, until March 1943, when the first years of the prison were included in the light transport.
On 4.5.1943, 370 persons were transported to the largest transport in the freezing camp.
All of them were 420.
The very sad history of the insanity of human beings that caused them to become human beings and repudiate ideologies.
There is no dispute that it is necessary to keep these events in mind.
There is no dispute that this reminder should be played at a memorial site in the place of the suffering of these people.
The problem is somewhere else.
Socialism was a little forgotten in the camp, and in the 1970 ’ s it was built in the vicinity and in the part of the former camp.
The history of the camp was discovered by chance in 1992 by American Paul Polansky, a monument was discovered in Letech in 1995.
By the mid-1990s, the government had promised to buy up and throw up a pig, but it has not yet.
In 1998, the monument was declared a cultural monument and since 2009, it has been managed under the Lidice Memorial.
In July 2013, the UN Human Rights Committee called on the Czech Republic to close the debate.
So closely the facts of the camp's military fate.
When February the government approved the purchase of piglets and decided to draw up a knowledgeable price assessment.
According to the Minister of Agriculture, then the government will buy you back.
According to the Minister of Culture Herman "some numbers exist, but I'd probably dream of going to public with them."
We'll see what the expert opinion brings.
According to some unofficial estimates, it can cost hundreds of millions, while others say the price can reach up to a billion.
So it won't be a cheap matter in any case.
However, only a few hundred metres from the former camp stands a monument to which the state has invested nearly ten million crowns in 2010.
Even if the whole transaction was beautifully funded by the UN Human Rights Committee, which is probably not a threat, it would be in my opinion to throw money away.
Does the government have no other priorities?
A memorial, a dignified southern place, stands the will of history practically near the immediate vicinity of the tragedy that has taken place and anyone who wants can bow down here to the memory of those who suffer and are killed.
I don't see any reason to change this!
Let's leave it as it is, and keep the south place with maximum care.
A responsible person, in this case the Czech Government, should deal with the care of the proper economic operator, should be entrusted with the property, i.e. the taxpayer’s money.
At least with a guy like his own company!
Of course, the Minister of Finance and the Vice-President of the Government are not the entire government.
But from the above facts, I still see the UN leader's password as an empty pre-election proclamation.
This year, in May, I went to look directly at the spot.
Very decent arrival route, adjusted parking lot, replicas of wooden camp barracks.
In one exposure, in the other integrated toilet with running water.
A small natural amphitheatre with the possibility of sitting and having a view of its own southern location, which is created from stones located in a small area.
Lots of flowers and vines.
All the attributes corresponding to the meaning of this place, how they are and belong.
Archaeological research is currently being carried out at the site of the original camp.
It would be reasonable to consider whether, for example, part of the discovered foundations could not be law-enforced and at least visually accessible in an appropriate manner.
In this way he could exert his efforts by the Minister of Culture Daniel Herman.
If he succeeds in running the government to buy a pig for state money, it will only be another unfortunate step in his already quite problematic action as a minister of culture.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolates may reduce symptoms of inflammation of the intestines (IBD)
For your survival system, red meat and dairy products can be a nightmare.
However, the new study suggests the opposite: diet rich in animal protein and dairy products could help reduce symptoms of inflammation of the stomach.
An incurable disease that affects up to 1.3 million U.S. citizens and 300,000 patients in the United Kingdom causes abdominal pain and blood flow, weight loss and extreme vomiting.
Patients are usually reminded not to use meat and milk products to relieve symptoms. Researchers at Washington University found however that essential amino acid tryptophan contained in protein helps create immune cells that support the resistance of the intestines.
Dr. Marco Colonna's study explained that immune cells protect the stomach and ensure that harmful microbes are removed from the food.
The number of active cells is balanced by the number of cells that support tolerances and protect the body without damaging the sensitive tissue.
As soon as the mucous membranes bend to the side of the inflammation, it may lead to inflammatory bowel disease.
As part of the research, scientists have found the presence of immune cells supporting body tolerances in the stomach of mice with specific bacteria.
This bacteria requires the presence of tryptophan cells - one of the building blocks of proteins.
Professor Colonna put it this way: “We have found a link between one type of bacteria - Lactobacillus Reuters - which is a common part of the stomach microbe and the development of cells that support body tolerance.
The more triptophans had mice in their diet, the more immune cells they had."
At the same time, he suggested that if it turns out that the same applies to humans, then the combination of L. Reuters bacteria and food rich in tryptophane would help develop a more sustainable and less inflammatory atmosphere.
The postgraduate researcher Dr. Luis Cervantes-Barraganwas in the study of a certain type of immune cells supporting body tolerance found that one group of test mice had these cells, while the other group of the same mice were treated separately.
It has led to the fact that one group of mice has different wheat microbes - a community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that usually reside in the gastrointestinal tract.
The tumor was tested using the DNA sorting method, and researchers found six types of bacteria in mice with immune cells lost by the second group of mice.
The mouse, which was kept in the sterile environment and was lacking wheat microbes - so this type of immune cells - was not developed - the bacteria L. Reuters were given - and they created immune cells.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, researchers grew L. Reuters into liquid and then transferred small amounts of liquid - without bacteria - to undeveloped immune cells that were stored in isolation.
Immune cells developed into tolerant cells.
After removal of the active substance from the liquid, it has been shown that it is a secondary product of tryptophane metabolism known as indolyl-3-octic acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophane in the food of mice, the number of these cells increased by 50 percent.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells as mice, and most of us have L. Reuters bacteria in their gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether secondary products of tryptophane from L. Reuters cause the development of cells in humans in the same way as in mice, but genetic defects related to tryptophane have been found in humans with inflammatory bowel disease.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan added: “Each of us should probably try to develop these cells because they control the inflammation of the internal surface of the intestines.
Potentially high levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. Reuters bacteria may increase the population of cells."
José Mourinho considers the signing of a contract with Nemanje Matić and his transition to Manchester United as “genial”
Manchester United won his team "genia" in the form of Nemanja Matić - at least he thinks it was José Mourin after the hostage was debuting in the mid-term fight against Sampdoria.
Matić, who signed the 40 million pound contract, entered into the first victory 2:1 in Dublin - the last pre-season match before UEFA Superspear, where United met with Real Madrid on Tuesday - and admired in his role as a depositary on the side of Paul Pogby and Andreas Pereira.
However, since he did not participate in the team's pre-season Asian tour, Matić did not have the form and played only 45 minutes, according to Mourinha's words to work before the next Primer League season began.
"It takes time, but it's experienced, intelligent and has a brilliant mind - thinking football," Mourin said.
"Let's help him get into the condition as soon as possible."
Like Matić, his new associates Victor Lindeföf and Romeo Lukak also played the first match at Aviva Stadium and Maurina begins to slowly form their eleventh for the next season.
The independent source this week announced that Mourin still wants to sign a contract with the other three players, but it is said that the club has done "fantastic work" and has led to the team of three of the four most important players.
"Thanks to the club for helping me get three out of four players," he added.
"Four out of four would please me more, but I admit that they did their best for me."
The life challenge of the King of Chicken Skins Lady Hrushes.
He wants lessons from Pohlreich!
This generous image began to draw thanks to a new series on TV Prima Zděnkov Academy.
The bug immediately blew up the chance.
"Dear Son, I'd like to join your cooking academy because I think I can learn a lot from you," he called him in a video on a social network.
And because the two of you've been staring at each other for a few years, the Lord didn't forget him this time.
"On the other hand, I can teach you sweaty from diet chicken, American cucumbers or invite you to water and show you why it's a favorite cheese," Hruška whispered.
His participation in the Pohlreich's new show is really serious.
It's time to move up and learn from the master.
"The question is what the boss is about," he said to Blesk.
But Pohlreich did not express himself because he filmed new parts of his next series Yes, boss!
To participate in the Culinary Academy, Prima only reacted by taking the whole matter as his personal activity that goes beyond television.
In December 2004, Hruška Pohlreich founded his first chef.
Over 300 thousand pieces were sold in a few days!
The new show that Prima presented yesterday at a press conference to the autumn broadcast scheme is an unfavorable cooking school.
Pohlreich picks his pupils from a number of spectators and is familiar with twelve cooking techniques in 12 parts.
In the last part of his show Now the boss cooks in November 2014 Zdeněk let his shirt on the back of his shirt be turned on.
If my face was there, I'd laugh a lot.
"I'm just laughing at the puppie -- the puppie is healthy fruit and has a lot of vitamins," Ladja replied.
She thinks of Lady's culinary art.
"To cook according to Lady Krušky doesn't come into mind at home, because I don't let go of gastropunk at home," he says clearly.
I respect Pohlreich's opinion very much, even he thinks I'm making chicken on honey.
In my order, however, his recipes will certainly not appear," Hruška refused.
He's an asshole!
He's not a chef for me, he's a TV clown.
"Gastronomic illiteracy or stupidity," said Pohlreich about Hrushkov in one lecture.
"I'm not twenty to be able to shake hands on them, but I don't solve them like that either," said Hrusha on the account of the alleged insults.
British inventor uses a microchip in his hand to untangle the car and the house with the mating
The British inventor became the first person in the country with a microchip placed in the body. With a simple twist of the hand, he can unlock the door from the house and office and even start the car.
Thirty-three years old Steven North has allowed a small chip to be implanted between fingers and toes and at the same time offers the same service through his company BioTeq to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives using technology.
Dr. Geoff Watson, an anesthesiologist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, oversees the implantation and maintenance of medical procedures.
Technology works on the same principle as microchips implanted in dogs and cats and the whole procedure takes 30 seconds.
Northam's company also offers a service for the exchange of doors and cars compatible with a microchip. The price of one lock is £300.
The married father of one child has allowed technology to integrate the BMW Z4 brand into his home and car, which starts with a simple handshake.
White House Recruitment cost taxpayers thousands of dollars
The White House's decision to fly with a Navy helicopter to South Lawn to celebrate the American manufacturing industry that took place last month came according to the Navy records issued by the TIME Week for $24,000.
The Green White Helicopter Sikorsky VH-3D, also known as Marine One in the presence of the president on board, was the top of the program on 17 July in the White House, which was a review of American design programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and several senior officials of the White House looked at the review of products from all 50 states.
The Connecticut helicopter was displayed next to Maine yachts, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a huge high-speed vehicle from Mississippi.
The military officer of the White House issued a fragmentary order or FRAGO and requested the presence of a helicopter of not more than 36 hours prior to the landing of the helicopter on South Lawn in the "extraordinary" event, the records of Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) - units responsible for managing the helicopter.
"I wanted to make sure you knew about this important event," said Commander HMX-1 in his e-mail to his superior, the commander of the Navy for flight the day before the event started.
The report indicated that the helicopter would arrive at South Lawn on 17 July at approximately 7:00 p.m. on the occasion of the inspection, which is scheduled to begin at 15:00 p.m. and will remain in place until the complete clearance of the entire site, which was planned between 18:00 and 21:00.
In the e-mail, it was further stated that if there is a delay in departure from the White House, a replacement crew will be sent for the return flights due to the Working Time Regulation.
The original crew stayed on the scene that evening with the helicopter and with them a safety team.
Of the records - which the TIME week received - it was not clear whether the second crew was finally sent.
Hatch Act prohibits state officials from using government assets for political purposes.
The records indicate that HMX-1 investigates possible infringements of this Regulation.
"We were wondering if it was a breach of the Hatch Act and we were sure everything was okay," the commander wrote.
"It sounds like you're blocked," the deputy chief said.
This review “Made in America” was marked by the White House as an official event and Hatch Act would therefore not apply to it.
But official events also have political sub-texts.
In his participation in the event, the president advocated a health reform that was passed by the Senate and spoke of an attempt to maintain the government regulation.
The use of aircraft, such as Marine One or Air Force One, for political purposes is a difficult new phenomenon.
The presidents use them when travelling.
However, their presence is unusual for presentation reasons.
Trump ordered a check in February after the president's plane went in the background at his first meeting in the Melbourne campaign in Florida. His Twitter account is filed with complaints about the use of his predecessor's presidential aircraft.
"The White House is pleased with the ‘Made in America’ survey, which presented products from all 50 states producing American materials," said the deputy press secretary Lindsay Walters.
Helicopter HMX-1 crews often train landings in Washington and South Lawn and train possible opportunities with the President of the United States to the White House with maximum accuracy.
While Trump took part in the G-20 summit at the beginning of July in Germany, HMX-1 performed 58 exercises at the White House.
The summer of the Made and America survey was part of the current crew training, the state factor stated.
The helicopter unit flew on the same day within the "unpresided support missions" for another eleven hours.
The White House stated that no further claims were made from taxpayers’ money.
Sikorsky spokesperson stated that the company was not interested in any way in the negotiations on the exhibition of a helicopter on South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not keep records of the budget for Presidential Flights and it is difficult to determine the exact costs of the survey, according to the maritime statement.
According to the Ministry of Defence, the hourly price for fiscal year 2017, DoD expenses for VH-3D $24,380 per year.
The unit records 30 minutes from the Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico base in Virginia and back.
The White House argues that the actual operating costs of helicopters move significantly below that amount.
"The introduction of taxpayers' costs on the basis of estimates for reimbursement of expenses is very inconvenient," Walters said to the whole thing.
“These estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs, which are included in annual costs.”
According to the 2015 RAND study, DoD expenses do not include staff costs, but include fuel, maintenance and contractual costs.
The then White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of a helicopter for inspection purposes.
"The idea of a review to be made this week is to present products produced in the USA," Spicer said.
“I am aware that Sikorsky and Connecticut state are very proud of the fact that they are contributing to our state’s defence and that they provide jobs to hundreds, unless thousands of people.
I think, like most Americans, we're proud of the helicopter and other military equipment on which there are lots of American citizens.
This fact should be remembered."
It's not clear if Trump was also watching a helicopter during his walk to South Lawn. Of course, it's just that he's been sitting behind the wheel of one of the fire cars.
Back in the White House Trump spoke to Sikorsky's representative and joked with the media about his own fleet of products.
"Sikorsky I know very well," said the president, "it's my own right now three."
A young woman tied up in the bay at Mach's lake, the police boarded her.
The girl went to the beach on Sunday about the second hour of the morning.
Instead of swimming, she was trapped in the wetlands.
When she decided to use the phone to ask for police help, she had the last 12 percent of her battery.
"That's why the police soon lost contact with her," said police spokesman Ivan Balákova.
A few police guards appeared at the location she described, but finding a young woman was not easy at all.
"Some of the policemen had to broach with a hundred meters of racous wet before they felt a solid ground under their feet again," Balákova said.
And so was she wrong.
The police were oriented according to which direction her call for help came from.
"In order not to come to this connection at least, they agreed with her that she would charge out loud," said the speaker.
Police found a woman up to three-quarters to five in the bays in the village of Borny.
She was on the edge of physical and mental forces and showed signs of under-coldness.
That's why she's been transferred to the Cheskolipa hospital.
The Grandfather's connection to Stan?
The bride's request becomes a saleswoman.
That's a little irony.
I'm looking for my web project as if a billionaire wanted to basically say that STAN suffers from the lack of decent people.
And he also stated that the political party is not born with less well-known concerns and independent parties, in fact there is no state-run programme for the election.
Her election candidate will only become a decent person after consultation with Grandpa, regardless of his political opinion.
That's how Vit Bart started, and it didn't work very well.
In addition, his reputation for decent people and personalities, which may also be replaced by some seniors, which he has also admitted to the Gazdík, is also the favorite argument of the head of the Stan, that the greatest value of movement is political scrutiny and experience of seniority, traditionally the most popular policy, and according to research.
They're now quietly disposing of quickly picked up unknown personalities.
The total division with the people, after which Stan changed the logo and logo, the Gazdík also explained that the movement did not want to lose its identity on the candidates of the people.
But if stan of identity suspected only a few people at the time, after his arrival Grandpa will end up playing an identity game.
Not only did the Gazdík oppose the UN Andreje Babis long, on the first joint press release, but Grandpa, who is publicly praised by Babis, said: "My goal is to make the movement of the UN, i.e. the movement of the Elders receive 20 percent in the upcoming elections."
Let's hope he didn't make a move.
Grandpa is a successful businessman, and the billionaire is certainly not an accident.
She often talks about politics like Babish, unlike him, but she doesn't build her own political brand.
Stan has been remembering more reality show than the real political side and Grandpa's helping hand as if she were a sales girl from the bride's request.
For a while, Stan went with TOP 09, then with people and now he's looking for decent people to change.
Let's hope someone will respond.
Police dogs practiced in the Bridge by a helicopter
Dogs specializing in the search for explosives and patrol dogs practiced at Lake Bridge by helicopter.
The police dog can't be scary and afraid of flying, said leading police cynologists in the Ustian state of Petr Tomášek.
The police dog exercise takes about two years.
At the Bridge, they practiced the adult training of dogs, the ones who just went through the training.
In addition to the standard training, where they were to detect sharp samples of explosives in the lake and find a lost figure, all 12 animals had to get into the helicopter and fly over the lake.
The main purpose of the exercise is to test dogs in the helicopter.
So that as soon as the helicopter gets here, the dog can go to work so he doesn't have a problem with the helicopter.
"So far the helicopter, the dog goes and is looking for immediately," Tomášek said.
A dog who is restless or who is not able to work immediately after the helicopter journey is expelled from training.
"Most of them then leave them in the garden, for example," Tomášek added.
The police have 76 dogs with various specialties in Ústeck.
The German sheep dominate, but also Belgian sheep.
The password keeps him out of the dog's mouth.
"He is raising him himself, preparing him for the service that the dog will do for us," Tomášek added.
The animal undergoes repeated veterinary examinations that may reveal any health handicaps.
If the dog is healthy and fearless, the first test is in 20 months.
"It takes about two and a half to three years," Tomášek added.
The length of the police service depends on the dog's health.
Most of them serve up to eight to ten years.
Then they experience most of their passwords.
Trailer for the 3rd Narcos season: Pablo Escobar is out of the game and Cali Cartel becomes the hub of the Netflix hit series

Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the head of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) plays the brain operation, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) is concerned about the connection with Mexico and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) reigns New York.
In the new trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, a styling American and Colombian rights defender in the fight against drugs.
Among the other players are Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third Narcos season will take place on September 1st.
According to the UN, Afghan democracy relies on women in politics
Elections may be likely only if all members of the company, including women, are involved in them.
Nicholas Haysom, leader of the United Nations Assistance Mission, said that elections to local representations include hundreds of women, three women act as vice president and more than 30 per cent of newly registered volunteers are women.
"The role of women cannot be overlooked," he said in his middle statement.
Elections may be fully representative and confidential only in the event of women participating in them, as well as all related processes associated with elections.
The local and presidential elections in Afghanistan take place on 5 April.
The Taliban has issued several threats to the electoral process, which moves international combat activities on the other hand.
In the elections this year, for the first time, one democratically elected government is handing over its power to the peaceful next government.
Haysom said the strong role women play in strengthening Afghanistan's democracy.
The Afghan Independent Electoral Commission has indicated that 1.2 million women make up of a total of 3.6 million registered voters.
A unique beer maker cooks beer again.
For a good beer to a reborn beer.
The inspiration and sincerity of new owners returned a few years ago to the life of a beer maker in Lobča near Mšena.
Pivovar, mentioned for the first time in 1586, has a renaissance core and in the nineteenth century was converted into a parastrophy operation.
She followed the years of flowering when the beer was declared mainly by dark beer.
During World War II, unfortunately, production was stopped and beer was nationalized in 1984.
Since then, the buildings have served the state ship.
The damage was done by the brewery owners after 1989.
The abandoned area was devastated and destroyed on construction material.
In 2007, however, new hopes were brightened in the form of new owners, architects Jana and Paul Prouzov.
These buildings began to repair with maximum respect for the spirit of the building and every detail.
Carefully dedicated and dedicated to the study of archival materials, they try to preserve original materials and building elements.
The brewery has the same shape as in the nineteenth century, when its golden era began.
Their work was appreciated by the declaration of beer as a cultural monument by the Ministry of Culture and the building became part of the European industrial heritage tracks.
In 2015, the tradition of cooking beer was celebrated.
If you want to taste a great lobe beer in the picturesque region of Kokořínska, visit the brewery area.
In cooking beer, they use coconut water from protected landscapes, strawberries, and javelin.
You can taste a traditional light bed in the cliff, but also dark beer and specialties.
And don't miss a beer tour, it's on Saturdays and Sundays and a half.
Československa's largest firearm?
One of the greatest strengths of his type on a global scale?
This unique building was supposed to be the fortress of Stachelberg between Trutnov and Jacler, at the top of the land cemetery above the village of Babi.
Originally, it was to be made up of up to 12 bunkers connected with extensive underground.
Here there were to be a department, a post office, a ammunition warehouse, a material, an electrical plant, a machine and a hospital.
But the construction ended with the Munich Agreement.
A few years later, he was able to build the only possible iron concrete bunker and subterranean spaces were demolished.
Thanks to the excitement of Spolka Stachelberg, who began to rebuild a unique building in the early 1990s, you can also see here.
The ground is already available by 75%!
The area is part of the T-S 73 foot-and-mouth disease area with exposure and ground and armed facility of light-supply, two further spread foot-and-mouth disease, burial and teaching path of the Trutnovska.
Extensive, cozy necklace and beautiful landscape views guaranteed!
This unique and beautiful Czech building has been added to the list next to such monuments as the Great Chinese Wall, the Traian port of Rome or the Assyrian palace in Nineveh and Nimrud.
The monastery of Chotéšov, originally from the beginning of the 13th century, today is the most powerful four-class building of a convention over a beautiful garden.
The list he got, but unfortunately it belongs to a unique building that threatens to destroy.
The audience, however, do not want to give up, and there is a lot of action to take in support of the monastery.
One of them is the next year's dinner for the Cloister of Chotéšov this Saturday of the fifth August, where it will show m. Vladimír Misík, Ivan Hlas, you will see the Shermír's performance and look at the places of beautiful extended buildings that are usually not available.
But mostly use the atmosphere of this great place.

Know the plant by one click.
The new free Pl@ntNet app will help students with the creation of herbs and ordinary lovers of plants.
If they are interested in what plant they have just been exposed to on the walkway, they will be advised by this application.
The only thing they'll have to do is take a picture of the plant and the application itself will recognize what kind it is.
The new app, which is available for iOS and Android, was presented on Tuesday by representatives of the Centre for the Ethical and Environmental Education of CEEV in the Bratislava Mountain Park under the Project The City's Secret Life.
The project also involved students from 50 Czech and Slovenian schools, who with teachers in the application database photographed and added plants from their surroundings.
The newly created French app is free to download on the pages The City's Secret Life.
The main objective of the French programmers was to make the most of people contribute to the application of their images, thereby increasing the number of plants that the application can identify.
"The children who hold the tablet or cell phone in their hands can go out into the woods," said the coordinator of the project Ivana Poláčová.
Based on sufficient quality photo of the flower, leaf or fruit of the plant, the application will be able to identify its name within a few seconds, which will then be added to the photograph in Czech and Slovenian.
The French allowed us to translate the city's Secret Life application into Slovenian and Czech.
It is therefore welcome for users to contribute to the plant image that is not yet available in the database after the application is started.
"Françous will assess whether it is beneficial and then add it to the database," Poláčová said.
GMB concerns about investment in McVitie's factory in Glasgow
The Committees require assurance from the manufacturers of McVitie's dryers about the long-term manufacturing obligation in the factory in Glasgow.
The Scottish Association of the GMB stated that for the time being the company was silent about any investment in the Tollcross factory.
More than 500 employees are employed in the factory, who manufacture products and dryers from Hobnob and Rich Tea.
The owner of McVitie's, Pladis, said that over the past few years she invested more than 5 million pounds in the entire area.
She added that the staff and representatives of the committees would be "first informed" in the case of changes in the operation of the factory.
In a letter to the building company, the Scottish boards expressed their concern that McVitie's "will not get its promises to finance and modernise production lines."
GMB chief organizer Drew Duffy added: “The fact that we have not received clear answers from the building manager regarding the needs of the company and the future investment plan in Tollcross is very worrying for our members.
Many families worked here for many generations, and employees come mostly from the local community and Glasgow area, where work in this factory represents a critical pillar of decent employment in the area of high unemployment and social exclusion.
From the point of view of work, wages and benefits - and despite the view of Brexit, rising life costs and decreasing slow production - the eastern part of Glasgow needs a prosperous producer such as McVitie's."
The spokesperson of Pladis said: “Tollcross was given a letter from the GMB only yesterday and the company issued a statement as soon as possible because we appreciate our continuing commitment to the employees and representatives of the committees.
Regular meetings with GMB staff and representatives in Tollcross took place two months ago and many problems were discussed openly at this meeting.
We spoke to the employees that, as in all companies operating under extremely competitive and uncertain economic conditions, we will assess our operation on a regular basis, which applies to all our operations so that we can continue to compete successfully with others.
She added: “In recent years, we have invested 5 million pounds in Tollcross, especially in manufacturing lines and operating efficiency.
We appreciate the heritage of Tollcross and this locality and, in the case of any change in the operation of this factory, employees and representatives of the committees will be informed without delay."
Did the PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar's move three years ago?
La Liga may regret her interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain won't allow Neymar's efforts to get on his side after he made $189 million, which means the amount needed to buy Neymar out of the contract, but warned this French team Barcelona about his record trip three years ago?
This sensational transition has exposed the waters of summer. Club League 1 is prepared to overcome more than twice the previous record amount for Paul Pogby to Manchester United, who paid 89 million £ for him last season.
After confirming and finishing the transfer Neymar will become the most expensive player in the world and at the same time the best paid professional sportsman in the world - after tax he will collect more than £500,000 per week from the PSG team.
Barcelona is upset by the way Neymar got out of his contract, despite the fact that the confidential source confirmed that the club has always tried to compensate Neymar in everything since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
However, has the football world been alerted to this reality three years ago by the President of the PSG?
When Manchester City in 2014 expressed its interest in Blaise Matuidi, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned all clubs that would be interested in the transfer of one of the best PSG players.
"I'm not afraid because once someone tries to get one of our players, we'll definitely talk to one of their players," Al-Khelaif said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to get one of our players, they will face the consequences."
Barcelona seems to have crossed the concordance when in summer she expressed an interest in PSG Marc Verratti's depositary.
The PSG made clear in the sense that under no circumstances would allow the departure of the Italian representative. It is therefore possible that Barcelona now swallows a bitter pill for its trouple of conversation with Neymara.
Who'll explain the sanctions?
Does political punishment have broad-based rules?
Donald Trump was on anti-Russia sanctions.
The United States imposed sanctions on Venezuelan President Madura the day before.
And about the day before, Trump wrote that China is not doing anything about the North Korean threat and that it won't go on.
And it's a clear idea of punishment as a break from the boot.
Those things can't be thrown into a bag.
Madur's Venezuela really took her way to the dictatorship, totally.
China just doesn't act the way the American president would like it to be.
The Russian capital is for itself.
But if someone wanted to sum it up so that even a regular will, American, European or other, could understand what it is based on and which system of rules is based on sanctions policy, it would be almost impossible.
In the sanctions against Russia, President Trump is only concerned with what President Obama has already invented, just giving him an implementing stamp.
So why is that?
Last year, Europe was afraid that if we win the American Trump election, we'll hang out with Putin and revoke the sanctions.
It's a terrible idea.
In practice, it's the wrong thing.
Trump's sanctions are not released, but they're intimidating.
But Europe is even more afraid.
The German Minister of Cyprus says Trump's sanctions violate international law.
It's like the basketball is only sanctions approved by the UN Security Council?
But then there are neither the EU's anti-Russia sanctions.
The head of the European Commission Juncker once again complains that Trump's sanctions are jeopardising EU energy security.
It's like they're only supposed to use sanctions so weak that they don't threaten anyone?
The usual desire for tape.
He heard three years ago that the condemnation of anti-Russia sanctions depends only on the implementation of the Mining Agreements on the Propagation in Ukraine.
It is now known that it is the EU's energy security.
The volume of tape and wider.
There are sanctions on Russia for mounting too much where it is not.
China's lost because it's getting low.
The Venezuelan President is punished for building a dictatorship in his country's borders.
All these punishments or just considerations have their rationality.
But does anyone see the system, the rules or the rules?
Andrej Babish: I don't consider working with Okamura.
Andrej Babish married, crosses the Republic with his visionary book and finalizes the election program.
Besides the Pardubian country, he already has all the candidates ready.
According to his words, he did not directly interfere with them.
He even agreed to lead the Moraviansleskie Heitman and shadow minister of the UN Ivo Vondrák School.
"If he succeeds, however, he will have to choose whether he wants to be a MP or a heitman," Babish confirmed his earlier opinion.
A lot of representatives and state politicians were angry at you that the direct election of the mayor and the prime minister should run the villages and cities themselves, just with the managers.
Are you serious?
It wasn't like that.
I am a supporter of direct democracy, we choose the President directly, and I am convinced that we should also choose mayors and prime ministers.
In my book, I'm not talking about disrupting representatives, they can be there in peace.
The question is how many will be there.
When I presented your book about what I dream about, when I happen to sleep, I heard in my own ears that you were talking about cancelling representations.
I don't remember.
I was talking about a direct choice and a reduction in the number of representatives.
New York with nine million inhabitants has five districts and 51 representatives.
Prague with 1.2 million citizens has 1171 representatives.
And the prime minister is expected to build little and not make big projects, but she doesn't have the power to do that.
The same applies to the government that only two people in our history, Klaus and Zeman.
Which I'm not saying they did well.
The current prime minister is not running anything, he's just slowing down the debate.
So it can't work.
That's why you want to set up a majority system?
It would be perfect, but it's hard to get through.
There's only a change in the program to a single-choice election to the Senate.
We have also proposed a clumsy mandate of ministers and the adjustment of the Minutes' Rules of Procedure to prevent the excessive display of Members who are to work mainly in committees and committees from taking part in the Minutes.
It is certainly not true that I want to destroy the parliamentary system.
But that's exactly what your opponents are afraid of.
That as a dictator you will run the government, control the camera with 101 MPs, abolish both the countries and the Senate, and by means of grateful care and primacy you will control the entire country.
It's certainly not.
There is nothing wrong with discussing the number of Members.
The French President Macron has announced a reduction in the legislative body for a third, while there are 57 thousand French in one legislator, while we have 17 thousand Czechs in it.
However, Macrona is not accused of threatening democracy.
Even if someone in the Czech Republic won most elections, we have mechanisms that would prevent him from making dramatic changes.
The virtues of who has a majority in Parliament are great, but it is enough to look at Poland or Hungary.
Nothing like that in the case of the motion of the UN.
We just need a team that will work in government for people, not for their parties or resorts.
I don't understand why we couldn't agree that only teachers, cultural workers and social services will get paid.
Why were I voted out and added 21 percent to the GIBS members who are already taking 60,000?
Would you like to be the prime minister?
The Prime Minister is supposed to strike when ministers behave inconveniently, messing up government with travel offices, and for the state's money, they would like to run as Marian Jurečka, who wanted to buy forests in Romania and the land in Africa.
The ministers in the government don't argue, they're supposed to argue outside.
There's got to be a finished material in the cabinet, where there's no room for a coalition break, a strong vote and a fight, there's got to be a decision.
How do you want to have a coherent team when the ministers are mostly partying?
There's a constitutional law on the sides.
When it came to breaking bread, Sobotka said the coalition contract was not paying, and he expelled Babies from the government.
Any prime minister can do that.
However, if he is a personality and has management skills, a similar gesture does not need.
It measures everything the same and requires perfect performance from all.
Do you know who you'd propose to the Minister of Finance?
I don't think about it at all, but we're probably not in that government, and no one wants to cooperate with us, even though I don't know what I've done so awfully.
There's not so much squeezing in place.
The elders have won the Grandfather's business, who would like to cooperate with you, may win the wing of the loyal Jiri Chunk.
I don't think so.
ČSSD runs Lubomír Zaorálek, which does not exclude the coalition with the United Nations, may cause Václav Klaus ml., which will also not object.
I'd leave it at the polls.
Vice Prime Minister and Vice-President Richard Brabec said that you have many points in common with SPD Tommy Okamura, for example in the field of economics.
So the eyebrows come to mind as a coalition partner?
Mr. Brabec says he didn't say that.
Mr. Okamura has his political history, he ran as a VV Vita Bartya doll, then he got the money from Úsvita for his company, he went some way there.
He is, of course, an outstanding personality.
Of course, it's kind of disgusting.
When I take his program, there's a broad involvement of people in the management of society, directly democracy, that's what can be agreed with.
I'm not asking you that at all.
I wonder if you are the acceptable person who has xenophobic opinions speaking on demonstrations with matches and wants to get out of the EU?
We don't consider cooperation with Mr. Okamura, I can't imagine.
It's obvious he went into politics to benefit from it.
And what about the silent support of the communists of your minority government?
I can't even imagine it, but the voters will decide.
It's about negotiating a win with another in line, but God knows who the winner is and who the two are.
Of course, it is important for them to be able to agree on a coalition government programme.
Let's go back to your attempt to become a firm.
But the government just has to drive, Prime Minister Sobotka has let everything go, he never decided.
Coalition issues such as CEB or EGAP did not work.
But Saturday is his doll, and I think that was why he fired me.
As soon as he did, CEZ ruled over the Czech government.
It is incredible, however, that the Prime Minister has brought a resolution written by the management of the ČEZ, which stores the Minister of Finance, how he should vote on the ČEZ General Assembly.
If you become a prime minister, will you change your personal circumstances in the Supervisory Board and exchange the top management of the ČEZ?
Jesus, if I'm a prime minister, he'll see you.
I'm not her yet.
It seems that ČEZ has already sent signals in your direction.
Good cooperation with ČSSD would like to exchange for even better with the UN.
Well, after the election, it'll all go on.
I don't know anything about it.
I don't have any Humor or Pink lobbyist, I'm a separate unit, and I don't even solve this.
Answer it directly.
If you stand in front of the government, will you try to exchange ČEZ, Czech TV or General Health Insurance, i.e. institutions that you criticise?
I want CEZ to be a transparent company.
So far, he's been doing what he wanted for years, and I've been providing for the traditional political parties.
Just look at Mr Schwarzenberg's expressions.
Although he was supposed to be in the CHEZ majority, he never drove him, he was only there to count, which is wrong.
It's a trivial matter for me.
ČEZ is to take Dukovany, evaluate them, apply them to a subsidiary, arrange funding, make a supply competition or get a co-investor and build a new nuclear block.
The idea that the state should finance and build new nuclear blocks is absurd.
What about Czech TV?
Some of her shows against me run a permanent target campaign, but I don't have and I won't have any power to throw anyone out.
But you can control it.
I don't want to control anyone.
I'm just saying that citizens are paid for public advertising and pay-TV of around 7.2 billion a year, but actually they don't know how these institutions operate.
How come they don't know?
However, the Commission approves the report on their management, which has a direct impact on the position of the Directors-General of ČT and the Czech Republic.
Look at how these reports are being discussed, about that super power pact Sobotka Kalousek, who always worked.
It pays both for the current parliamentary commission to escape from the investigation records and for lex Babish.
And Saturday was so stupid that he let Kaluske push me out of the government, which saved the top 09 percent, but the ČSSD took them off.
They're afraid of disrupting their corruption system, and so they're talking about threatening the democracy of Babish.
Nobody's immune.
What do you say to the articles describing how the first vice-president of the UN Jaroslav Faltynek builds a powerful background by bringing his son to the Supervisory Board of Tepláren Brno and arranging for the co-legislator Kvetoslav Hlín's contracts with city and state companies such as the Prague Transport Company or the Czech Roads?
We have a permanent dispute.
I don't like it, and I've read it to him several times.
Faltínek argues that the lawyer in question works at a significantly lower rate and is reliable.
I wouldn't do that.
As a finance minister, I didn't have anyone.
We, unlike the socans, have never had a corrupt affair, no Pelt, no short-term, Bresin.
If there was any sign of clientelism in our house, we just fired that guy.
I am uncompromising in this direction.
If something like this happens, we get rid of anyone, it doesn't matter who it is.
