Large assembly representatives are worried that they will "look like Muppets"
Some assembly representatives (Assembly Member, AM) have shaken the proposal that they may be called representatives of the Great Parliament in the future.
This was due to plans for the assembly to be renamed to the Velska Parliament.
Congregational representatives from all political spectrum are concerned that they could become the subject of defeat.
A parliamentary representative from the Laborist Party said his group was concerned about the fact that the name is "rumed with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: on the big twp means stupid, and pwp shit.
The representative of the party of Wales (Vol. Plaid Cymru) said that the group as a whole "is not satisfied" and proposed alternative solutions.
The Grand Conservative said his group was "open" to change names, but that MWP could quickly become Muppet.
In this context, the word "w" is similar to the word "u" in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently preparing the law to introduce a change of name, announced the following: "Of course, the final decision on how the Assembly representatives will be entitled to be on their own."
The law of the government of Wales of 2017 gave the council authority to change its name.
In June, the Committee published the results of a public consultation on the proposals that have received broad support for changing the name of the assembly in the Velska Parliament.
When it comes to what representatives will be called in the assembly, the Committee has been inclined to call "the members of the Great Parliament" or MWPs, but the MWP option has received the greatest support during public consultation.
Assembly representatives propose alternative options, but the struggle to reach consensus could bring a better head of the Elin Jones Assembly, which is expected to put forward a bill of amendment within a few weeks.
The Reform Law will include other changes in the way the congregations operate, including rules on the disqualification of representatives and the establishment of committee systems.
During the discussion of the law, congregational representatives will have a decisive vote on the question of what they want to be called.
Macedonians go to a referendum on the change of country name
Voters will vote on Sunday whether they want to change the name of their country to "The Republic of North Macedonia".
The purpose of the vote is to resolve a multi-denominated dispute with Greece's neighbour, in which there is a province called Macedonia
Athens has long endured the claim that its name as a northern neighbour represents the occupation of the Greek territory and has repeatedly opposed the launch of its process of accession to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, a plebiscite opponent of the name change, said he would not recognise the referendum decision.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaeva, claim that the change of name is simply the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bell was silenced as the churches in Harlem fought for survival.
"The older people I spoke to said that in the past there could be at least a church on every corner," Mr. Adams said.
"There's no one else today."
He said the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"People get together today in another way," he said.
"Bars no longer represent living quarters where people regularly live."
When it comes to churches, however, it is concerned that money from the sale of property will not last as long as the church leaders think and "before or after it will be found again at the beginning."
He added that the churches could replace residential buildings with apartments where people would live who wouldn't help the rest of the churches in the neighborhood.
"A great majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he said, "will therefore come the day when these churches will be completely closed because it is unlikely that the residents who moved to these buildings will become members of those churches."
Both churches built white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community church in 1870, and St. Martin ten years later.
The original white Methodist Congregation moved out in the 1930s.
The black congregation that held the services nearby took over the building.
The church of St. Martin took over a black congregation with Reverend John Howard Johnson on the forehead, who led the boycott of the merchants on a little in 125th Street, the main street for buying in Harlem, who opposed the employment or promotion of blacks.
The 1939 fire badly damaged the building, but since the parishioners of Reverend Johnson planned its reconstruction, they ordered a series of bells, called carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and heir to St. Martin, proudly called the Carillon "the bells of poor people".
The expert who played at the Carillon in July used the second title: "cultural treasure" and "unchangeable historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, pointed out that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who has been playing on a larger carillon in the church of Riverside for 18 years.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin didn't replace him.
What is being played in St. Martin over the past few months is a story about architects and performers of construction works, some of which were brought by lay leaders of the church and others by the episcopal diocese.
Sacristija, the governing body of the parish made up of time, wrote to the children in July about the concern that the child would "try to transfer expenses" to the Sacristia, although the Sacristija was not involved in the engagement of architects and construction workers who sent the child.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the child.
Sea dog injured 13-year-olds during diving for lobsters in California
According to the official report, a sea dog attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday as he ran for a lobster in California on the day of the hunting season.
The attack took place something before 7 a.m. near the Beacon beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel said at the KSWB-TV station in San Diego that he ran with his friends about an hour and a half on Saturday morning when he heard the boy's call for help, and then led the group to the attack site to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said that he first thought it was an excitement about the caught lobster, but then he realized he was shouting, “He bit me!
He bit me!"
Hammel said that when he approached the boy, he noticed that his whole key bone was broken.
"I insisted that everyone get out of the water: "There's a sea dog in the water!" Hammel added.
The boy is transferred by helicopter to the Child Council Hospital in San Diego and is still in critical condition.
The kind of shark responsible for the attack is not known.
The rescue team captain Larry Giles said at a press conference that the sea dog was seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was found not to be a dangerous type of sea dog.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries on the upper part of the body.
The authorities closed access to the beach at 48h from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami in Ecinitas to conduct the investigation and safety of the bathroom.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in that area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plans to enter the UK’s beauty market
Sainsbury’s becomes a competition for chains such as Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams by introducing cosmetic desks in the style of shops and by hiring specialized sellers.
As part of a large entry into the UK's beauty market worth GBP 2.8 billion, which continues to grow in comparison with the fall in sales of clothing and household equipment, larger cosmetic desks will be tested in 11 shops across the country and will expand to additional shops next year if they show up successful.
Investment in cosmetic products is one of the ways supermarkets try to use space on the police that was once intended for televisions, microwaves and home equipment.
Sainsbury’s representatives said they would double the offer of cosmetic products to 3000 products, including the first time and brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
And the existing assortment of companies L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will get more space with certain trade brands like Boots.
Supermarket at the same time relaunches its assortment of decorative cosmetics Boutique, so most products will be suitable for vegans, which is what younger customers are increasingly looking for.
In addition, Fragrance Shop perfume dealer will use concessions in two Sainsbury’s shops, the first one that was opened last week in Croydon in southern London and the second one that opens in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Net purchase and return to daily purchases of small quantities of food in local food stores means that supermarkets need to do more to attract people.
Mike Coupe, Director-General Sainsbury’s said he would fly out more and more like a business house while this supermarket chain is trying to resist favourable trades such as Aldi and Lidl offer a larger number of services and non-food products.
Sainsbury’s introduced hundreds of outlets to Argos, as well as a large number of Habitats departments because he bought both chains two years ago, thereby encouraging the sale of live foods and making those acquisitions more profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to renew its cosmetic and pharmaceutical products has not been successful.
Sainsbury’s entered into a joint venture with Boots in early 2000, but it ended with a dispute about the distribution of drug revenues in its supermarkets.
The new strategy followed after Sainsbury’s three years ago for GBP 125 million sold its pharmaceutical business at the 281 Celesius store, owned by Lloyds Pharmacy.
Lloyds claims to have a role in the plan by categorizing a range of luxury products for skin care in four stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks commercial director Sainsbury said: “We have changed the appearance and perception of our cosmetic products departments to give our users a more comfortable environment.
We also put in special training a colleague who will be at the disposal of the buyers and give them advice.
Our assortment of trademarks is designed to meet all needs, and the attractive environment and the available locations means that we are now an attractive destination for the purchase of cosmetic products, which will lead to changes in old shopping habits."
Peter Jones "whispered" after Holly Willoughby gave up an 11 million pounds contract
The Dragon’s Dan Peter Jones show star left to "cook off anger" after the TV leader Holly Willoughby gave up a worth 11 million pounds contract with his trade brand to focus on his new contracts with the Marks & Spencer and ITV store
Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand of home clothes and fashion accessories Truly.
Their trade mark is compared to Goop Gwyneth Paltrow's trade mark.
This morning's show director (37) on Instagram announced he's leaving.
Holly Willoughby left the Dragon’s Den Peter Jones show to cook out of anger by retreating from the joint profitable business at the last moment to focus on her own new great contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was "infuriated" when a golden girl television during a tense meeting on Tuesday in the headquarters of his business kingdom in Marlow in Buckinghamshire admitted that her new contracts amounted to up to 1.5 million pounds means that there is no longer enough time to dedicate to their brand of household clothing and fashion accessories True.
This job was compared to Goop Gwyneth Paltrow's trade brand and was supposed to double Willoughby's fortune estimated at 11 million pounds.
When Willoughby (37) announced on Instagram that he was leaving True, Jones flew from Britain to one of his holiday homes.
The source said: “Truly was one of Holly’s top priorities.
It was supposed to be a long-term investment in the future that would ensure it for the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw has ruined everything involved.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday so close to the whole line.
In Marlow's headquarters there's a lot of goods ready for sale."
Experts believe that due to the departure of the Head of This Morning, one of the stars in Britain where it is most profitable to invest, the company could suffer millions of losses due to the large funds invested in products in the range of pillows and candles to clothing and household clothing and the possible additional delay in running the line.
And that could mean the end of a long-term friendship.
The mother of three children Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, were ten years close friends with Jones and his husband, Tara Capp.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones (52) joined them as president of the board in March.
Couples spend vacation together and Jones has a 40% share in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become an M&S trade mark ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as the leader of I’m a celebrity.
Source close to Jones last night said "We do not want to comment on his business activities."
Hard negotiations, and then we fell in love.
He joked about the criticism he was going to get in the papers because of the comments that some might consider "decent president" and because he had such a positive attitude toward the North Korean leader.
"Why did President Trump give so many concessions?"
he said Trump, echoing the voice of the news leader.
"I didn't give any concessions."
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a big step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
But negotiations on denuclearization have been held.
More than three months after a meeting in June in Singapore on Saturday, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that the north did not notice the "relevant reaction" of the United States to the disarmament activities of North Korea.
He noted that instead, the United States has not yet abolished sanctions aimed at further pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic position in his speech.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
"We were threatened by a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would suffer.
Now we have a great relationship."
He said his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim had positive results – stopping the launch of rockets, helping to free hostages and returning the remaining American soldiers home.
He also defended his unusual approach to explaining his relationship with Kim.
It's so easy to act like the president, but instead of this crowded arena waiting for 10,000 people, we'd have about 200 people there," Trump said, pointing to a bunch of people directly in front of us.
The tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia devastated the island and killed hundreds of people
For example, after the earthquake in Lombok, foreign NGOs were said not to be needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok has been displaced, there has been no declared national disaster, which is a prerequisite for the use of international aid resources.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they were very clear about not seeking international assistance, so it was a little problematic," Mrs. Sumbang said.
Although Save the Children is a team that will travel to Pala, it is not yet certain that foreign personnel will be able to work on the ground.
Mr. Sotopo, spokesman for the National Disasters Office, said that Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palau in order to see whether international agencies would be allowed to participate in aid efforts.
In view of the continued undermining of the land in Indonesia, this country is still unfortunately not prepared to bear the wrath of nature.
Although shelters in the case of tsunamis are built in Aceh, it is not something that is common on other parts of the coast line.
The absence of siren to warn against tsunamis in Palau, although the warning was in force, was likely to contribute to the loss of life.
And at best, traveling between many Indonesian islands is not easy.
Natural disasters make logistics more difficult.
The ship of the hospital that was anchored in Lombok to take care of the victims of the earthquake on the way is in Pala, but it takes at least three days to reach the place of a new disaster.
The improvement of Indonesia's fragmented structure was the basis for the election campaign of President Joko Widodo and a lot of money was invested in roads and railways.
But the state administration under Yoko is struggling with the lack of financial resources, and the next year the new elections are held.
Joko also faces pressure from other sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where Muslim majority members embraced a more conservative form of religion.
More than 1,000 people have been killed, and tens of thousands have been displaced from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fight on the streets with swords, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge hit the match against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool on Saturday from defeat in the Prime Minister's match against Chelsea in 89 minutes at the Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received an addition from Xherdan Shaqiri while he was about 30 meters from Chelsea's naked score of 1:0 for Chelsea.
He moved the ball on his left leg before he shot her at the opposite stop.
The ball flew high over naked toward the top right of the net.
At the end of the race, Kepay ran away from Arisabalaga, which jumped towards her and entered the net.
"It was necessary to get to that position, get to the ball, and players like Shaq are always trying to get as close as possible to the goal, so I tried to give as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com
"I saw Kante coming and I only once touched the ball. I didn't think too much about it and I just shot."
Chelsea led in half an hour with 1:0 after the meeting of the Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The blue attacker passed the ball back to Mate Kovacic during that game before he turned somewhere in the middle of the field and ran into Liverpool's half.
The Kovacic performed a quick addition in the middle of the field.
Then he directed a beautiful passerby ball that had led Hazard naked.
Hazard surrounded the defense and with his left foot hit the ball in the net at the opposite stop next to the goalman Liverpool Alsson Becker.
Liverpool plays a club game against Naples in the League of Champions at 3:00 a.m. on Wednesday at the stadium of Sao Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea is hosting Videoton at the UEFA European League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The number of deaths in the Indonesian tsunami increased to 832
The number of deaths in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia increased to 832, the state disaster office announced on Sunday morning.
Sotopo Purwo Nugroho's spokesman said at the press conference that a large number of people were reported to be trapped in the ruins of the building after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake that felt on Friday and caused waves of altitude up to 6 meters.
The city of Pala, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is filled with remains of ruined buildings.
Police arrested a man (32) for suspicion of murder after the woman was stabbed to death.
The murder investigation was initiated after a female body found in Birkenhead this morning in Merseyside.
The 44-year-old was found at 07:55 with stab wounds on Grayson Mews in John Street, and the 32-year-old was arrested for suspicion of murder.
The police called on people from that area to report if they saw or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hogan said: “The investigation is still in progress, but I would like all of us who were near John’s street in Birkenhead, and they saw or heard anything suspicious.
I would also like to invite everyone, especially taxi drivers, who might have recorded something on their car cameras to contact us because they may have information that is of key importance to our investigation."
Police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found in Birkenhead and found in the building.
This afternoon on the stage came friends who thought they knew that woman to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation was under way, and the police said it was in the course of and the procedure for informing the nearest victim's family.
The cab driver who lives on Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment, but the cops told him that no one can get into the building or get out of it.
He was left without a word when he found out what happened.
The tenants are now told that it will take several hours until they can return to their homes.
The cop allegedly told someone that the whole area is now considered a crime scene.
The woman showed up at the crime scene in tears.
He keeps saying, "That's so terrible."
At 2:00 p.m. in the fenced area, there were two police vans, and another one was parked outside.
A large number of police officers stood inside the fenced area and monitored the residential block.
All those who have any information are asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously address the Crimestoppers organisation on number 0800 555 111, calling on record 247 of 30 September.
Kip Cromwell in Parliament is the latest monument that took place during the debate on "extermination of history"
His prosecution would be poetic justice for almost destroying so many English cultural and religious artifacts that his fanatic Puritan followers did.
But Cromwell's society called Mr. Crick's attempt to "stupid" and "trying to break history".
John Goldsmith, president of Cromwell’s Society, said: “In a debate that is currently being conducted on the removal of statues, it was unquestionably that Oliver Cromwell’s character in front of the Westminster Palace became the subject of the debate.
The iconoclasm of English civil war is not something Cromwell ordered or carried out.
Maybe the wrong Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the proceedings of his grandfather Thomas in the previous century.
The wonderful revitalization of Cromwell Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is proof of the way of thinking of the 19th century and of the history of a person that many still consider to be worthy of honor.
Mr. Goldsmith said of The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is widely regarded, perhaps by the end of the 19th century, as the advocate of foreign pressure in parliament today, of course, in his case as the pressure of the monarchy.
Is that a completely credible opinion the subject is a continuing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century formed the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a unique recognizable figure that represents one side of that division.
His achievements in the role of the Lord of Protector are still worthy of honor and recognition."
Pig killer killed a Chinese farmer
According to local media reports, a pig attacked and killed a farmer at a market in southwest China.
A man mentioned only by the name "Yuan" found a dead cut artery and covered with blood near the market in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou published the South China Morning Paper on Sunday.
The pig breeder was preparing to vaccinated pigs in the pighouse on May 30, 2005, in Xining in the Chinese province of Qinghai.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from nearby Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead, and the door of his neighbor's pig was opened.
He said there was a big male pig in the stable with blood on his mouth.
According to the report, the forensic examination confirmed that the pig had nearly 250 kilos thickened the breeder to death.
The evening news of Guiyang indicates that a relative named "Wu" said: "My cousin's legs were bloody and tainted."
The security camera footage showed that Yuan entered the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan didn't belong to him or his cousin.
The market manager said about the Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent someone from attacking while the police are collecting evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and the management of the market are allegedly negotiating a payment for his death.
Although this rarely happens, pigs' attacks on humans have already been recorded.
Pigs attacked their wife and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts in 2016 and their husband suffered life-threatening injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 30 - pound [300 kg] pig had attached a large farmer to the tractor until his wife had driven the animal away.
After the pigs ate a farmer in Oregon in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told the CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that blood taste can act as a "delicate".
"They're just played.
They're grizzling, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
They just need to show respect," he said.
The remains of the Rosa hurricane bring heavy rains to the southwest of the United States
As announced, Hurricane Rosa is weak as it passes across the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
But in the next few days, Rosa will bring flood rains in the area of North Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
At 05:00 in the east time, Rosa smoked at 140 km/h, making it a Category 1 hurricane, and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, above the Pacific, a low-pressure area is created and moved to the West Coast of the United States. On Monday, when Rosa is approaching the Baja California peninsula in the form of a tropical storm, she will start pressing a deep layer of tropical moisture towards the north-west of the United States.
Rose will bring up to 250 mm of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then the tropical moisture in interaction with the approaching low pressure area will cause the emergence of strong dams in much of the southwest.
In local areas, between 25 and 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous storms, mud showers and possible cliffs in the desert.
The deep layer of tropical moisture will cause the formation of dams that will reach about 50 to 75 mm per hour in some places, especially in the parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Even 25 to 100 mm of rain is expected in some parts of the southwest, especially above most of Arizona.
Boiling floods are possible with rapid deterioration of the condition due to the dispersed nature of the tropical rain.
There is no advice on going to the desert of the foot due to the danger of tropical dams.
Strong rains could turn canyons into wild rivers, and rain showers with thunderstorms will bring local storm winds and dusty winds.
Approaching the low-pressure area will bring local strong rains on the southern coast of California.
It is possible to cause holes in a volume greater than 12 mm, which may cause less mud holes and sloping roads.
It will be the first supply in the wet season in this region.
The scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona on Sunday late at night and on Monday early in the morning before the end of the day on Monday and on Tuesday cover the wider area.
A strong rain will spread on Tuesday to the area where the borders of the states of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah are reached and will last all day on Wednesday.
In October there are possible major temperature changes across the United States as the Arctic cools, but tropical parts will remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature at small distances.
Sunday is a great example of dramatic temperature differences in the Central United States.
The difference in temperature between Kansas City in Missouri, Omaha in Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moins in Iowa is almost 20 degrees.
During the next few days the remaining summer heat will continue to grow and expand again.
In most Central and Eastern USA, the beginning of October is expected to be warm from 27 degrees from the South Plains to parts of the Northeast.
The city of New York could reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a great possibility of rising temperatures in the east of the United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people watched six television networks on Thursday testifying to the candidacy for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman who accused him of having been sexually assaulted in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, political accounting continued, and the reporters interrupted the regular programme for the conversion notice at the last moment of Friday: an agreement reached by Jeff Flake, Senator of Arizona, that the FBI would conduct a one-week prosecution.
Ford told the Senate court that she was absolutely sure that Kavanaugh had touched her in a drunken state and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in a burning witness that he was absolutely sure it didn't happen.
Friday's hearing was probably followed by more than 20.4 million people, the number mentioned in Nielsen's report.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There was no immediate access to the number of viewers for other networks that transmitted the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen's usually having trouble measuring the number of people who look at the content in the offices.
To give you a better idea of this, it's about a audience that looks like the one who's watching American football or Oscar.
Fox News Channel, whose guests in the study strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, had the largest number of viewers with an average of 5.69 million during the whole day hearing, reported from Nielsen.
ABC has taken another place with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen reported that CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million.
The interest remained great after the hearing.
Flake had a central role in the drama that took place on Friday.
After the office of that moderate Republican issued a statement that he would vote for the benefit of Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras recorded on Friday morning shouting protestors on him while he was trying to go to the hearing of the Justice Committee.
For a few minutes, he stood down looking alive in front of CNN's cameras.
"I'm standing here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to this country?"
They said to him, "You have power while so many women are helpless."
Flake said his office had issued a notice and before the elevator door closed it would say more at the committee hearing.
A few hours later, all cable and television networks were monitoring live when the Judicial Committee had to vote on the direction of Kavanaugh's nomination to vote all over the Senate.
But Flake said it would only do so provided the FBI investigates charges against the candidate during the next week, which required minority democracy.
Flakea was partly convinced of talks with a friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons, and then a few more senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's decision was important because it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve the Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an investigation into the FBI's charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accused critics of "playing politics" with Brexit
In an interview with Prime Minister Theresa May for Sunday Times, critics of their plan to leave the European Union accused of "playing politics" with the future of the United Kingdom and undermining national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived on 29 September 2018 at a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom.
Boris Johnson, her former foreign minister, continued to criticise her so-called Chequers Plan for Brexit in another interview with her on the same issue, saying it was a proposal that the United Kingdom and the EU should charge each other with "full nonsense".
The murder of Waydea Sims: Police arrested Dytheon Simpson, a suspect for the death of the LSU player
Police arrested a gun-killing suspect by Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson (20) has been arrested and detained under arrest for arrest, Baton Rouge's police administration reported.
Officials posted a video of the conflict between Sims and Simpson, and the police said Sims lost his glasses in the conflict.
Police found glasses at the crime scene and reported finding Simpson's DNA on them, reported WAFB, a CBS branch.
After the investigation, Simpson police reported that he confessed he shot Wayde and killed him.
A $350,000 guarantee was requested.
On Friday, the City Council of Eastern Baton Rouge's death official published a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound through the neck.
The police administration thanks the working group for the fugitives of the state police force Louisiana, the criminalist lab of the state police, the Southern University police and the citizens of the area for the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked the local authorities for implementing the law on "hardness and searching for the truth".
Sims was 20 years old.
The player on the wing was 183 cm tall in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne played basketball for LSU.
On average, he had 5.6 points and 2.6 jumps in the game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "depressed" and "in shock" because of Wayde's death.
"That's what we always worry about," Wade said.
Volcano throws ashes into Mexico City
The ashes that cast out the Volcano Popocatapetl reached the southern parts of Mexico's capital.
The National Centre for Disaster Prevention on Saturday warned Mexicans not to approach the volcano after increased activity in the crater and registered 183 gas and ashes emissions over 24 hours.
The center was followed by multiple slamming and smearing.
Pictures on social media showed thin layers of ashes on windshields of cars in Mexico City districts such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed the increased activity of volcanoes 72 kilometres southeast of the capital since the 7.1 magnitude earthquake in 2017 shook central Mexico.
Vulcan known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Conflict between police and Catalan separatists meeting the annual vote on independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after demonstrators defending independence clashed with the intervention police and thousands of people joined protests to mark a Catalan polarizing polling.
A group of masked separatists who were taken advantage of by the intervention police began to shoot policemen with eggs and paint in dust, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that would otherwise be flooded by tourists.
The fights broke out later the day the police used bats to calm the fight.
During a few hours of the group that advocates independence, "No forgetfulness, No Forgiveness" was scandalized, and the Unionists called them "Long Living Spain".
Fourteen people were admitted to the hospital because of the easier injuries gained during the demonstration, local press reported.
The tensions in the region that weighs on independence have not reached a year after the 1st October referendum, which Madrid declared illegal and which the Catalan separatists celebrate.
The vast majority of voters decided on independence, although the exit was small because those who opposed the vaccination were mostly boycotting the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured in severe conflicts last year after the police tried to stop voting in polls across the region.
Groups claiming independence spent Friday night on the street to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
The demonstrations were held, but the demonstrators were forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes (68), an electrician who attended separatist demonstrations with his husband, said he no longer hopes that Catalonia will gain independence.
"Last year we experienced one of the best moments.
I watched my parents cry out for happiness that they could vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite their achievement of a key, close victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan independence parties have managed hard this year to keep track because their most famous leaders are in the self-intentionary exile or in detention awaiting trial because of their role in organizing a referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded demonstrations on his phone in support of the police, said the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
"The situation is getting tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who has been in prison since the end of last year, announced that he will run for elections to the European Parliament next year.
"The candidacy for European elections is the best way we can perceive the regression of democratic values and the repression we have experienced from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Arrested men after killing a car in the house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after several times in Londonderry's house.
The incident took place on Thursday about 19.30 BST in Ballynagard Crescent.
Detective insp. Bob Blemmings said the yard door and the building itself were damaged.
It's possible that at some point on the car a shot was fired from a single shot.
The Menge event brought Livingstone to victory over Rangers with the result of 1:0
First goal Dolly Menge for Livingston won
The new Scottish Premiership League League surprised the Rangers and forced Steven Gerrard to admit his only second defeat of the 18th match at the head of the Ibrox Stadium Club.
The Dolly Menge hit proved decisive as Gary Holt's team dealt with the Iberian in a second.
Gerrard's team is still unbeatable in guests in the Prime Ministership this season, and next Saturday they play against Hearts, the leading club in the league behind which eight points remain.
Before that, Rangers in the European League will host the Rapid Vienna Club on Thursday.
In the meantime, Livingstone has increased his winnings to six games, and Chief Coach Holt has not yet experienced defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed opportunities against dead guests
Holt's team was supposed to lead before they got that hit, given that their directness in the attack caused a whole series of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson tried, but there was a gap on the way to the naked, and then Alan Lithgow could only point the ball wide after he had cleaned up to cut Craig Halkett's head off.
Hosts are happy to let Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they can cause difficulties for guests
And that's exactly how the key goal was achieved.
The Rangers failed to stop the free strike, and Livingston invented an opening, whereby Declan Gallagher and Robinson together assisted the Menge who hit in the middle of the goal.
Until then, Rangers had control of the ball most of the time, but they faced an unprovoked domestic defense, so the goalman Liam Kelly had nothing to do with it.
This continued in the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to defend the strike.
The legs of the Golman Rangers Allan McGregor have made way for Scott Pittman, and Lithgow has led a wide-ranging blow from another organised Livingstone attack.
Long additions did not succeed in crossing the target line of Livingstone, and two one-aesters were not sentenced – after Halkett's conflict with the replacement player Glen Middleton and one to play by hand.
"Great" by Livingstone – analysis
Alasdar Lamont from the Scottish BBC in the Arena Tony Macaroni
Excellent game and the result of Livingstone.
Everyone up to one was great, so they continued to exceed expectations on that entrance path.
Their style of games and staff barely changed from their return to their big clubs, but great credit goes to Holt and the way he united the team from his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great at the head of an excellently organized defense, and Menga did not allow Connor Goldson and Joe Waral to have a beat.
But the Rangers lacked inspiration.
They were far from the standards that set up a good game under Gerrard.
They couldn't get the ball to the end, they just opened the hole in the home team once, and that's their kind of call to market for Rangers in the middle of the board.
Erdogan welcomed with mixed feelings in Koelna
On Saturday (September 29th), everything was full of smiles under the clear sky when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany -- whose goal is to repair the relationship between NATO allies.
Opinions on issues involving human rights, freedom of press and Turkey's accession to the EU have been divided.
Erdogan then headed to Koeln to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
For security reasons, the police blocked the gathering of 25,000 people in front of the mosque, but a large number of presidential supporters who came to see him appeared nearby.
And hundreds of protestors of Erdogan’s opponents — including a large number of Kurds — raised their voices in condemning Erdogan’s policy and the German government’s decision to welcome him with welcome to the country.
Confronted demonstrations reflect the division caused by a visitor some German Turks celebrate as heroes, while others attack as autocrats.
Road crash in Deptford: a biker died in a car crash
The biker died in a car crash in London.
The crash took place near the intersection of Beswood and Evelyn, on the road with dense traffic in Deptford on the southeast of the city about 10:15 BST.
The car driver stopped and got an ambulance, but the man died on the spot.
The crash took place a few months after the death of another biker after the crash and the driver’s escape from an accident on Chiders Street, about a mile and a half from a Saturday’s accident.
City police have reported that police officers are trying to identify a man and inform his nearest family.
As a result of the accident, roads are closed and bus transport is redirected, and motor vehicle drivers are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six police officers injured in unrest
The prison administration reported that six police officers were injured in the riots in the male prison of a prisoner.
The riots broke out in Long Martin prison in Worcestershire about 09:30 BST on Sunday and are still going on.
The special "Tornado" units were brought to reduce the disturbances involving eight prisoners and were limited to one wing.
Police officers on their faces are being assisted by smaller facial injuries.
A spokesperson for the Prison Service said: “Specially trained prison personnel are being hired to resolve the incident in the Long Lartin prison.
Six staff members were helped by the injuries.
We don't tolerate violence in our prisons and we want to make it clear that everyone responsible will be handed over to the police and that we can spend a long time behind bars."
Long Lartin prison has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was announced that the prison manager ended up in the hospital after he was attacked by a prisoner.
And last October, the intervention police were called to prison to resolve a serious situation in which staff were attacked by pool bullets.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with fruitful floods (possible benefit for dry areas)
It is rare that tropical depression hit Arizona, but there is a probability that it will happen just as soon as the next week when Hurricane Rosa goes through the rest of the Southwest and poses a threat to the rainstorms.
The National Hydrometeorological Service has already issued warnings about fruitful floods for Monday and Tuesday in the area of West Arizona, through south and east Nevada, Southeast California and Utah, including cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa should get close to Phoenix late Monday with the rain and go right through it on Tuesday.
In his tweet, the National Hydrometeorological Service in Phoenix reported that “from 1950 on, only ten tropical cyclones have brought tropical storms or depression in an area of 320 kilometers [320 km] from Phoenix!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) passed 40 miles from the Arizona border."
The latest model of the National Hurricane Centre provides 50 to 100 mm of dams, with isolated quantities up to 150 mm on the Mogollonian edge of Arizona.
In other areas of the Southwest including the Walloon and the Great Pool there is a probability of a range of 25 to 50 mm, with possible isolated total quantities up to 100 mm.
For those out of danger from the rainstorms of Rosa, it could come as a rescue because the region was hit by drought.
Although floods are a major danger, part of these dams could be useful because the current drought is on the southwest.
"According to the American dry land map, just over 40% of Arizona was hit by at least extreme drought, second highest category," weather.com said
The journey of the hurricane first approached the coast along the Mexican peninsula Baja California.
On Sunday morning Rosa still had a hurricane power at the maximum wind speed of 130 km per hour and was 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and moved north at 20 km per hour.
The storm hit the colder waters of the Pacific, so it weakened.
Therefore, it is expected that the Gulf of Mexico will be approached on Monday afternoon or at night by the force of the tropical storm.
The rain on the parts of Mexico could be strong and pose a significant risk of flooding.
"The number of total barrels expected in the area from the Baja California peninsula to the northwest Sonore ranges from 75 to 150 mm, possible maximum 250 mm", weather.com said.
Rosa will then head north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early in the morning as a tropical depression that will then pass through Arizona and south Utah by Tuesday late at night.
"The main danger expected from Rose or her remains are very heavy rains on the Baja California peninsula, on the northwest of Sonora and in the American Southwest," the National Hurricane Centre reported.
It is expected that these rains will be caused by the life of dangerous storms and mud storms in the deserts and cliffs on the mountain plain.
Midsomer Norton's attack: four people arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old were arrested for suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old stabbed wound was found in Somerset.
About 04.00 BST on Saturday at Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton found an injured teenager.
He's taken to the hospital and he's stable.
Avona and Somerset said 17-year-olds, 2 18-year-olds and 20-year-olds were arrested during the night in the area of Radstock.
Police officers have called to call everyone who has a video of the events.
Trump claims that Kavanaugh suffered the evil and anger of the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the brutal and shameful tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a pre-election assembly in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "suffered evil and anger" the Democratic side during the nomination process.
Kavanauh witnessed on Thursday before Congress and resolutely and emotionally rejected Christine Blasey Ford's charges of sexual assault several decades ago when they were teenagers.
And Christine Ford testified to the prosecution of the charge she filed.
The president said on Saturday that day "the American people saw the brilliance, quality and courage" of Kavanaugh.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugha's vote to confirm one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a judge with an unprecedented career in public service," he said to the assembled supporters in West Virginia.
The president touched on Kavanaugh's nomination as he spoke about the importance of the Republican's leaving for elections in half the presidential term.
"Five weeks are divided into one of the most important choices in our lives.
I'm not a candidate, but actually I am," he said.
That's why I fight for great candidates everywhere."
Trump said the democratic mission was "to create resistance and obstructions".
The Republican leadership assistant told CNN that the first key procedural vote in the Cavanaugh nomination Senate is expected no later than Friday.
Hundreds of deaths in Indonesia’s earthquake and tsunami, and the number continues to rise
The authorities said on Saturday that at least 384 people were killed, many of whom were pulled away by huge waves that hit the coast when the great earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the city of Pala on Friday when in the evening waves of altitude up to six meters hit the coast, dragging many of them to death and ruining everything on their way.
Cunami followed after the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"When there was a danger of tsunami yesterday, people were still on the beach and they didn't run away immediately and died," Sutop Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for the Indonesian Agency to mitigate the consequences of the BNPB disaster at the Jakarta press conference, said.
"Cunami didn't come alone, he dragged cars, fats, houses, hit everything on the ground with him," Nugroho said and added that the tsunami passed the open sea at 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
"Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived," he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palau.
The photographs from the air published by the disaster agency show numerous destroyed buildings and shops, damaged and destroyed bridges and the mosque surrounded by water.
The subsequent strikes continued to punish that coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes could be felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) announced in its statement that the energy released by the massive earthquake on Friday corresponded to the double power of atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
It states that the geographical location of the city at the end of the long and narrow Gulf may have increased the power of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels were destroyed.
He also said that the bodies of some victims were found trapped under the ruins of the building and added that 540 people were injured, and 29 are considered missing.
According to Nugroh's words, the number of victims and damages may be greater along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in the area called Dongal and which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
"Communications are completely broken and we don't have information from Dongal."
"More than 300,000 people live in this area," says the report of the Red Cross, which also includes that staff and volunteers have moved to affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but the situation could get worse," the statement said.
On Saturday, the agency received a lot of criticism about the failure to provide information that the tsunami hit Pala, although officials claim that the waves came at a time when the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social networks, it can be heard that a man on the top floor of the building panics people down on the street about the coming tsunami.
Within a few minutes, the water wall collapsed on the shore, carrying with it buildings and cars.
The Reuters Agency could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the video.
The earthquake and tsunamis caused the disappearance of electricity that caused the interruption of communication around Palu, which made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the rescue action.
According to the authorities, it began to send cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, but food and other necessary landings were still needed.
The city airport is reopened only for humanitarian activities and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit the evacuation centres in Palau on Saturday.
Cunami in Indonesia took more than 800 lives.
The situation is extremely bad.
"Although World Vision staff from Dongala have successfully arrived in the city of Pala where the employees are sheltered in inter-alternative tents located in the yard of their office, they have passed the sights of destruction on the way," Mr. Doseb said.
"They told me they saw numerous destroyed houses," he said.
The situation is extremely difficult.
Although humanitarian groups have launched wheelchairs to help in disaster, some have complained that foreign humanitarians with great expertise are unable to arrive in Pala.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supply and employment of staff from other countries can only begin if the accident is declared to be a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at the province level," said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"After the government says “Okay, it’s a national disaster” we can receive international aid, but such a situation has not yet been declared."
When the second night of the earthquake and tsunami fell on Paul on Friday, friends and families of those still considered missing hoped that their loved ones would be one of those miracles that mitigate black scenarios of natural disasters.
The boy was saved from the sewer on Saturday.
On Saturday, the rescuers freed a woman who had been trapped for two days under the wreckage of her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandano, coach of the Indonesian state paraglider team, trained two missing paragliders for Asian games held earlier this month in Indonesia.
Some of those trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Peter Mandagija, were his disciples.
"Given the many years spent in paragliding, I carry my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon recalled that after news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel, which expanded to the paragliding community, whatsApp sent messages to the Palu competitions who participated in the festival on the beach.
But his messages are still marked with a grey hook instead of two blue hooks.
"I think that means messages have not been delivered," he said.
The thieves took 26.750 US dollars while filling ATMs in the center of Newport on the Levee
The thieves stole 26,750 U.S. dollars on Friday morning from Brink's employee who filled the ATM in the center of Newport on the Levee, reports for the Newport Police Administration.
In a statement by Detective Dennis McCarthy, the car driver emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and prepared to fill it with new money.
While he was busy with it, the other man "came to the race to the back of Brinkov's employee" and stole a bag of money that he was supposed to put into a ATM.
The witnesses have noticed more suspicious persons fleeing the scene of the theft, but the police have not mentioned the number of persons involved in the incident.
All those who have any information about their identity should contact the Newport police at number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper renames to Ye
Raper Kanye West will change its name to Ye.
In a Saturday's post on Twitter in which he announced the change, he wrote: "Life will be officially known as Kanye West."
West (41) has a nickname Ye for a while and used it as the title of his eighth album published in June.
The change comes before his guest at the Saturday Night Live show, where he is expected to launch his new Yandhi album.
The show was replaced by a singer named Arian Grande, who quit for "emotional reasons".
Except for the shortness of his current artistic name, West said earlier that this word had religious significance for him.
“I think that “yes” is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means “you”,” West said earlier this year in a conversation about his album title with the radio leader Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It came from Kanye, which means “one”, in only Ye – it is a reflection of good, bad, confused, everything in us.
The album itself is actually a reflection of who we are."
He's one in a number of famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he wants to be called Love and Brother Love.
And the former West's co-worker, JAY-Z, played with the versions of his name without a drawing and with a drawing and written in great words.
Mexican AMLO promised not to use the army against citizens
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised he would never use military force against citizens as the country nears the 50th anniversary of revenge on students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at the Tlatelolco market that "he will never use the army against the Mexican people."
The military squads fired during peaceful demonstrations on that market on 2 October 1968 and killed even 300 people at the time the leftist student movements began to spread in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador undertook to support the young Mexicans by giving monthly support to those studying and opening a larger number of free public universities.
He said the unemployment and lack of education attracted young criminal gangs.
The United States should double investment in artificial intelligence (AI)
"Since China is becoming more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount that it invests in research in that area," the investor said in the field of artificial intelligence and expert Kai Fu Leeu who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
That comment came after various parts of the U.S. government announced plans for artificial intelligence, although the US lacks a formal strategy for artificial intelligence in principle.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to become the first country of AI innovation by 2030.
"Double increase in the research budget in the field of artificial intelligence would be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind the United States and that we are looking for the next great discovery in the field of artificial intelligence," Lee said.
"Two-fold increase in investment could double the chances that next major achievements in the field of artificial intelligence will come to the United States," Lee said in a discussion with CNBC this week.
Lee published this month's edition house Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, Director General of Sinovation Ventures, which invests in one of the most outstanding AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that won the best American player in the game Othello, and later he was director of Microsoft's Research Department and president of the Google China border.
Lee praised the previous U.S. government technological contests, such as Defence Advanced Research Projects, Agency’s Robotics Challenge, and asked when the following will be held to find new visionaries.
According to Lee's words, researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get state scholarships.
"It's not China that leads academic leaders, it's corporations," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have engaged the brightest minds at the university to work on researching artificial intelligence over the last few years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the United States to boost its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think doctors in the field of artificial intelligence should automatically offer green cards," he said.
The Chinese State Council published the next generation's artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
"The Chinese National Institute for Natural Sciences provides financial resources to persons in academic institutions similar to the National Institute for Science and Other State Organizations providing financial resources to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China," Lee said.
Earlier this year the U.S. Ministry of Defence established the Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, whose purpose is to include partners from the business and academic community, and the White House announced the establishment of the Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month DARPA announced investment worth $2 billion in the initiative called AI Next.
When it comes to NSF, he is currently investing more than 100 million US dollars a year in research in the field of artificial intelligence.
In the meantime, American legislation that wanted to establish the National Commission for Security on Artificial Intelligence has been doing nothing for months.
Macedonians vote on a referendum to change their country's name
Macedonian citizens voted on Saturday's referendum on whether they want to change their country's name to "The Republic of North Macedonia". This is a move that could resolve the dispute with Greece that has lasted for decades and which has blocked Greece's opening negotiations for accession to the European Union and NATO.
In Greece, there is a province called Macedonia and Greece claims that its northern neighbour's name represents its territory and has put a veto on the country's entry into NATO and the EU.
Two governments agreed in June on a proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that this change would undermine the ethnic identity of the majority of the famous Macedonian population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycotting campaign cast doubt on whether the outcome would meet the minimum 50 percent needed for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum ballot was: "Have you been joining NATO and the EU with the adoption of an agreement with Greece?"
Actors of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaeva, claim that it is worth the price to pay for Macedonia, one of the countries that occurred after the collapse of Yugoslavia, to allow access to bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"Today I came to vote for the country's future, for young Macedonians to live freely under the auspices of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us," said Oliver Georgievska (79) in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote is not legally binding, enough Members of parliament said they would respect it to be considered decisive.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state electoral authority stated that no irregularities were reported within 13 hours.
However, output was only 16%, compared with 34% during the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote for my children, our place in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a voter from Skopje's capital.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Duško, joined a referendum on 30 September 2018 on the change of country name, which would pave the way for NATO to join the Union and the European Union.
54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov in front of parliament in Skopje set a small stage and sparked chairs in front of the tents that were set by those boycotting the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join raised heads, not as servants," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership will bring so much-needed investment to Macedonia, a country with an unemployment rate exceeding 20 per cent.
"I believe that a large majority will support the referendum, as more than 80 per cent of our citizens support the EU and NATO," Zaev said after the vote.
He said that the "positive" result would represent "the confirmation of our future".
The poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research shows that between 30 and 43% of voters will join the referendum, which is below the necessary response.
Another poll conducted by Macedonian Telma TV showed that 57% of respondents intend to vote on Sunday.
Of that number, 70% said they would support the referendum.
In order for the referendum to be successful, the output must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failed referendum would be the first serious blow to the policy of the Western government since it took over its mandate in May last year.
See: player Manchester City Sergio Aguero passes through the entire Brighton defense to achieve a hit
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester in England defeated Brighton's defense and won Manchester City with the result of 2 : 0.
Aguero made the victory crazy simple, reaching a hit in 65 minutes.
The Argentine attacker received an addition in the middle of the field at the beginning of the attack.
He broke through three Brighton's defense players and then got into an open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four opponents in green shirts.
He went around one of the defenses and then overrun them a few more on the edge of Brighton's space.
Then he added the ball to the left towards Sterling.
The first attempt by the English attacker returned the ball to Aguer, who threw the right-wing ball into the net and defeated Brighton's doorman Matthew Ryan.
"Aguero has some trouble with his feet," reporters reported to Manchester City Manager Pep Guardiola.
"We planned to play which 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're happy he got a shot at that moment."
But Sterling was the one who gave Sky Blues the first advantage in the Prime Minister League.
That shot was made in 29 minutes.
Aguero got deep into Brighton's field during that game.
He beautifully added the ball to Leroy Sane along the left side.
Sane pushed the ball a few times before he pointed Sterling to the station.
The Sky Blues attacker put the ball into the net before the car went off.
Manchester City is fighting Hoffenheim in the team game League Championships on Tuesday at 12:55 at Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in Sinsheim Germany.
Scherzer wants to disable Rockies' progress
Since the Nationals players were eliminated from playing, there were no too many reasons to insist on a new start.
But always in the competitive mood of Scherzer hopes for Sunday's victory against Colorado Rockies, but only if Rockies, who have the advantage of one game over Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League of the West, get to play.
Rockies on Friday night with a 5 : 2 victory over the Nationals at least secured a place in wild card play, but they still hope to win their first title.
"Although we play for nothing, we can at least throw away the atmosphere here in Denver with a multitude of fans, and another team would play at the highest level I'd witness this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in that?"
Nationals still have to publish a Sunday launcher, but they're supposed to be willing in that case to offer Scherzer to play.
Scherzer, who's going to make his 34th start, got warmed up in the dump room on Thursday and played Sunday, when he usually rested.
The Washington Right in this season achieved a score of 18 : 7, average winning races (ERA) of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 two-thirds changes.
Trump at a gathering in West Virginia
During his speech on the importance of Republican voters coming out in general elections, the president commented on his election to judge the Supreme Court.
"All we've done will be tested in the cold.
It's another five weeks to one of the most important choices in our lives.
These are one of the big, big – I didn't run, but I'm actually in the race and that's why I'm everywhere to fight for great candidates," he said.
Trump continues: “See this terrible radical group of democrats, you see it happening right now.
Their intention is to regain power in any way; see evil, corruption.
They don't care who has to be injured, who have to be beaten to take over power and control. They want power and control, and we won't give them any.
Democrats, they say, have a mission "to resist and interfere".
"You've seen it over the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "serious, evil, corrupt and false".
He praised Democratic Senator Diana Feinstein of the Senate Justice Committee on behalf of the Senate, which caused a loud public outrage.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you let the document go to the public?
Uh, uh, what?
No, uh, no, I'm waiting for the document – it was really a bad speech of the body, the worst speech of the body I've ever seen."
The labyrinth party no longer respects different opinions.
He does not tolerate the adoption of personal opinions
It didn't surprise me when Momentum activists in my local stranger voted to censor me.
Finally, I'm the last representative of the Laborist Party who was told not to welcome – and all because of what we said in our minds.
According to my associate, Joan Ryan was treated similarly because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
I was criticized for not agreeing with Jeremy Corby in the censorship proposal.
With regard to the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically similar issues that Jeremy Corbyn did not agree with previous leadership.
The Nottingham East Labour Party meeting was announced on Friday that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
Most of the eight years I've been working as a local representative of the Labour Party's main board meeting on Friday night were exactly the same.
Unfortunately, today many meetings are taking place in a different tone, and the promise of a "kinder, more gentle" policy has long been forgotten, if its fulfillment has ever begun.
It has become increasingly evident that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and each opinion is assessed on the basis of whether it is acceptable to party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, since the collaborators I thought we were sharing similar political opinions from me began to demand drastic change of opinion and acceptance of positions that I would never agree with otherwise – whether it was national security or the EU's single market.
Whenever I speak to the public – and it doesn’t really matter what I say – I follow the rumors of insulting words on social networks that call for my opposition, which are repudiated by the politics of the Centre, and I am told that I should not be a member of the Laborist Party.
It's not just my experience.
I really know that I've had more happiness than some of my colleagues because they're comments that are mostly political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face each day with a variety of sexist or racist comments, but they never give up.
One of the aspects of this political era that disappointed me most is the tolerance of insulting speech.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should encourage a culture of tolerance.
The reality tells us that we no longer consider different opinions and that with every proposal of mistrust or change of electoral rules, we are becoming more and more ingrained parties.
Many times in the last two years they've advised me to raise my head, not to be so loud and tell me that then everything will be all right."
But that's not why I got into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, encouraged by the neglect of the Margaret Thatcher government, which left my school multi-purpose student behind, I wanted to provide better public services for those who needed them most – either as a local councillor or as a minister in the government.
I've never hidden my policy, nor in the last elections.
No one in the Nottingham East could have been misled about my political positions and areas of conflict with current leadership.
All I would recommend to those who supported the proposal on Friday is that, at a time when the country is grabbing against Brexit, which will be negatively reflected in households, companies and public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leadership of the Laborist Party.
But in fact, the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my election units, whether it's the members of the Laborist Party or not: I'm proud to serve you and I promise that no threat to recall or political benefit will deter me from acting as I think it is in your best interest.

Air – Melrose: 38 : 17 Unbeatable Air goes to the top
Two late attempts may have influenced the final outcome, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this extremely interesting day game at the Tennant's Premiership League.
Now they've reached the top of the ladder and the only ones are unbeatable by ten teams.
Finally, top defense and better use of opportunities led them to victory, and coach Peter Murchie certainly had reason to be satisfied.
"So far they have tried us at every game and we are still unbeatable, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of the Melrose Club said: "Every honor to Ayra, they took advantage of opportunities better than us."
The attempt by Grant Anderson in the 14th minute that Frazier Climo led Ayr, but the yellow card for the Scottish player Rory Hughes, who was excluded from the game by the Warriors, enabled Melrose to raise the score, and Jason Baggot took advantage of an unrealized attempt.
Climo increased Ayra's leadership to one-aester before, in the middle of time, he achieved a hit and made an independent attempt to change the result for Ayr to 17:5 in the eyes of the strike.
But Melrose began well in the second half and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which realized Baggot, reduced the priority to five points.
At that time, a long stop took place due to the serious injury of Ruaridh Knott that was carried on the carrier, and when the game went on, Ayr continued a good game by trying Stafford McDowall that realized Climo.
Captain Ayra Blair MacPherson then got the yellow card and Melrose made the extra player pay again, and this unrealized attempt by Bruce Colvine at the end of the game under heavy pressure.
The lateral player, however, came back, and when Struan Hutchinson got the yellow card to tear down the climate that didn't have a ball; from the line to the penalty blow, MacPherson made a laying behind Ayra in a full swing of passage.
Climo realized how he did it almost from the beginning, after Kyle Rowe received a high blow from David Armstrong and sent Gregor Henry to the fifth attempt by the domestic team.
The Still Game series star seems ready for a new career in restaurant activity
Ford Kiernan, a Still Game star, seems ready to continue working in service after it has been found to be appointed director of licensed restaurants.
A 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in his favorite BBC series, which is also one of the stars, along with a longtime comedy partner, Greg Hemphil.
The two announced that the upcoming ninth season would be the last one to be displayed, and Kiernan seems to be planning to dedicate his life to Craiglang.
According to the official records, he is the director of Aragingmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although one source for the Scottish Sun said Kiernan wanted to be included in "a growing restaurant activity in Glasgow".
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, who has no way out of the sea, hopes that the court will assign her an exit to the Pacific Ocean
Marines are patrolling the seabed with a full-fledged elevator in La Paz.
In public buildings there is a flag of ocean color.
At sea bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon, the winged woman says: “We have the right to the sea.
It's our duty to return it."
In the whole of Bolivia, which has no way out of the sea, the memory of the lost sea coast for Chile during the conflict over the 19th century is still alive – as well as the whistling for the re-ships of the Pacific Ocean.
While Bolivia is awaiting the verdict of the International Court of Justice, which is expected to be held on 1 October, after a five-year procedure, and hopes may be at the highest level in the last few decades.
"Bolivia has a moment, a spirit of unity and peace and, of course, optimistically awaits the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians throughout the country will look at the verdict of the International Court of Justice on large screens and hope that the Hague court will decide for the benefit of Bolivia's position that Chile, after decades of demanding negotiations, is obliged to negotiate the accession of a sovereign exit to Bolivia.
Here's Morales, a Bolivian charismatic autologous president facing a controversial battle to be re-elected next year, can also benefit from the verdict on Monday.
"We are the result of the return of the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will judge for the benefit of Bolivia and that it would change a little if it did.
The UN body with its seat in the Netherlands has no authority to allocate Chilean territory and has said it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The judgment of the International Court of Justice comes only six months after final hearings, means that the case "was not complex", said Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
Instead of promoting Bolivia's interest, they may have been behind them for the last four years.
"The question of access to the sea has now been adopted by Bolivian leadership," Zárate said.
Morale's war rhetoric has buried every good will of Chile, he thinks.
Bolivia and Chile will continue their dialogue at one time, but after this it will be extremely difficult to negotiate.
These two countries have not exchanged the ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivian representative in The Hague, disagrees with the view that the court made a decision unusually quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia will bring "individual opportunity to start a new period in relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "stop 139 years of disagreement with each other", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America – used the maritime issue as a political stick.
"Bolivia will never renounce the right to access the Pacific," he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea said it wouldn't come to nuclear disarmament if it couldn't trust the U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people would never be nuclear weapons unless he could trust Washington.
On Saturday, Ri turned to the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to keep the promises of the day during the meeting of the leaders of these two opposing countries in Singapore.
Commenting on the moment when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seemed inclined to resume diplomatic talks on nuclear issues soon, which comes more than three months after a Singapore meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says that sanctions have continued due to "despite imagination" and that opposition to the U.S. Declaration on the End of the Korean War will not at all throw the North on its knees.
Washington is not willing to support the declaration without Pjongang taking concrete steps to disarm it first.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want to hold another meeting at the top.
But there is widespread skepticism about the serious intention of Pjongang to give up the arsenal that this country probably sees as the only guarantee of its security.
Pompeo plans next month to visit Pjongang to prepare for another meeting with Kim and Trump.
Paris’s fashion magazines reveal that the last line of big ones covered their heads on the way to luxury trade in your neighborhood
If you want to upgrade your hat collection or completely protect the sun, don't look any further.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne on the fashion trail presented a line of decoupled bulky covers for their spring and summer collection 2019 and cheered lovers of style in Paris's fashion week.
Extremely impractical hats this summer have taken on Instagram, and these designers have sent their creations that attract attention to the track.
The example that came to mind was Valentino, and it was a large hat with a wide range of beads like feathers that completely "takes" the head of the model.
The other bulky additions included beads decorated with jewelry, magic hat, and even pineapple, but these additions are not designed to warm your head.
Thom Browne also presented a collection of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many hairy masks had hairy lips and were more like Hannibal Lecter than the high-mode parts.
One creation was like a diving suit with a slide and a mask, and the other looked like a cornet with a melted ice cream.
If you follow the great fashion statement – happiness is on your side.
Stylists predict that huge caps could come to luxury stores in your neighborhood.
The huge hats perfectly fit with the "La Bomba", a striped hat with a width of about 60 cm, which is seen on many famous and famous persons, from Rihanne to Emily Ratajkovski.
The cult slave trade mark, which is behind an extremely impractical hat that has subdued social networks on the fashion track, sent another great creation – a broken beach bag almost as large as a model in the bathing costume it wore.
Nagasto orange bag of rafia, decorated with rafia cuts and white skin lunch, was an exhibition sample in the summer collection Jacquemus' La Riviera for 2019 in Paris's weekly fashion.
Stylist of well-known and famous, Luke Armitage, said to FEMAIL: "I expect big hats and beach bags in luxury shops next summer. Since the designer left such a strong impression, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for great fashion supplements."
John Edward: Language skills the citizens of the world need
Scottish independent schools have a tradition of academic excellence, which continued in 2018 with another package of extraordinary exam results, giving added weight to individual and shared success in sport, art, music and other activities in the community.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, this school that represents the Scottish Independent Schools Council (SCIS) is trying to provide the best level of service to its students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further education and higher education, the career they want to pursue and make them to the citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement that school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be the favorite and desired object selected in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head.
If you speak his mother tongue, it goes into his heart."
This statement is a strong reminder that we cannot use only English if we want to build trust and relations with people from other countries.
The latest results of this year's final exams show that the most evaluations in languages have been carried out by graduates of independent schools.
A total of 68% of students learning foreign languages received excellent grades.
The data collected at 74 SCIS school members show that 72% of students received an excellent assessment for Mandarin, while 72% of German students, 69% of French students and 63% of Spanish students also received the highest possible assessment.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as the key skills that children and young people will surely need in the future.
Today, languages are considered as elective objects as important as STEM objects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculum of independent schools, as well as elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the United Kingdom Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 revealed that 17% of employers cannot fill jobs due to a lack of language skills.
Thus, language skills are becoming increasingly imperative for the preparation of young people for careers.
Since more and more jobs are looking for language knowledge, skills are key in a globalized world.
Regardless of the choice of career, those who have learned to speak a foreign language in the future will feel the benefits of such a long - term skill.
A person who speaks more languages can communicate directly with strangers, which gives her an advantage over competition.
According to a YeGov survey involving more than 4,000 adults in 2013, 75% of subjects in the United Kingdom do not know foreign language well enough to communicate on it, and French is the only language that speaks a double-digit percentage of subjects, which is 15%.
Therefore, investing in language learning is very important for today’s children.
If children learn more languages, especially the languages of developing countries, they will have more opportunities to find good jobs.
Every school in Scotland offers different languages.
Some schools in their programme will classify classical, modern languages, while others will decide on languages that are considered to be the most important in the United Kingdom 2020, for example Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the interests of your child, in independent schools you will always have a variety of choices, as well as teaching staff who are skilled in this area.
Scottish independent schools provide an environment in which children will learn to prepare and arm themselves with the skills needed for success, regardless of what the future holds.
It cannot be ignored that today's global business is very important to know the language for the future of each country so that it must also be reflected in education.
Thus, knowledge of modern languages should really be seen as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer the choice of language, diversity and excellence for young Scottish people.
It's a good thing to do.
John Edward is director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council
LeBron will play in Lakers' dress for the first time on Sunday in San Diego
The fans will soon welcome LeBron James' first show for Lakers from Los Angeles.
Coach Lakers Luke Walton announced that James would play the first pre-season match against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But you still don't know how many minutes they're gonna play.
"More than one and less than 48 minutes," Walton said to Lakers' official website.
Reporter Laker Mike Trudell tweeted that James probably won't play the whole game.
After training at the beginning of this week, James answered questions about his pre-season plans in Lakers, which consists of six games.
"In this phase of my career, I really don't need pre-season games," he said.
Trump is holding a gathering in West Virginia, channel on YouTube
President Donald Trump is campaigning for numerous meetings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five planned meetings that Trump will hold next week, including short visits to Tennessee and Mississippi.
Trump has not yet given his vote for the new Supreme Court judge and plans to increase support for upcoming elections because there is a danger that Republicans will lose most in Congress after the vote in November.
In what hours does the evening Trump's gathering start in West Virginia, and how can you look at it on the network?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 19 hours in the east time, tonight, on Saturday, 29 September 2018.
Trump's collection in West Virginia can be viewed online via live stream on YouTube.
Trump will probably comment on this week's hearing of the judge of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh, who have raised controversy over charges of sexual abuse.
However, the primary objective of this series of meetings is to help the Republicans to make the elections in November a priority.
Therefore, Trump's presidential campaign officials report that five sets scheduled for next week have "stimulate volunteers and consents because Republicans are trying to maintain and increase the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives," Reuters reports.
"Most in Congress are so important to the president's plans that he will travel as many countries as we enter the burn campaign," Reuters, an anonymous speaker of Trump's campaign, said.
Tonight's gathering to be held at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract the "Ohia and Pennsylvania as well as the Pittsburgh media", reports West Virginia Metro News.
Trump will visit West Virginia on Saturday for the second time in the last month. In that country he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help a Republican candidate for the Senate, Patrick Morrisey from West Virginia, who remains in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to help him improve the ranking of polls," Politologist Simon Haedar of the University of West Virginia told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The US team left its heart on the field before the individual raids on Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, the couple's breakout on Sunday afternoon may be exactly what Ryder Cup was supposed to convert.
"Happiness Wheel Turns" is a phrase that is especially valuable in sport and in which athletes believe, especially in competitions such as this.
Who's lucky enough now?
"They had six points of advantage, and now they have four. So, I think happiness is currently on our side," Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europeans are in favour of four points, while 12 points remain until the end of the game.
Spieth says the Americans got a little wind in his back and encouraging his game in pair with Justin Thomas, with whom after the whole game he won three out of four points.
Spieth played murdered from tea to green and can serve as an example to others.
The cheery celebrations were becoming louder when Spyeth and Thomas reached two points behind, and everything culminated in the key path that Spyeth came to an unresolved outcome.
After the trip he won a 15-hole game, he followed a similar cheery urchin in which hope and faith can be recognized that Americans can reverse everything.
"You just need to concentrate and think about your game," Spieth said.
It's all that's left for the players now.
18 holes and I can celebrate.
The only players who won more points than Spythe and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the Ryder Cup sensation.
A strange European couple has a maximum number of points and can't be wrong.
"Moliwood" is the only couple who didn't lose score on Saturday afternoon, but he also avoided Bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and back nine on Friday morning.
This winning series, as well as the incredible energy that connects Fleetwood and Molinaria, show that it is just those players to be won on Sunday. There is no more popular player than the two of them who can seal the European victory while the sun shines over the Parisian Le Golf National.
Maybe they both win at the same time at different holes.
But it's too early to talk about European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly got Alex Noren and Sergey Garcia who had a great performance at the couple's game this morning.
One bogey and two double bogeys at the first nine holes in the playground buried Spanish and Swedish in a hole from which they failed to dig.
However, on Sunday, there will be no one to help individuals dig out of their hole.
It's fascinating to watch close pairs games because you can see players' interactions in pairs, hear advice that they give and those they don't give, as well as study a strategy that can be changed at the moment.
Europeans have been playing better as a team so far, and in the last day they enter with considerable pretence, but this game in pairs has also shown that the US team has the necessary combat, which some, especially the Stateside, have suspected.
Europeans in the last day Ryder Cup enter with 10 : 6
Europeans enter the last day of the Ryder Cup after Saturday's games in pairs with a significant advantage over the United States of America from 10: 6.
The dynamic duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari with two victories over Tiger Woods brought four points of difference to Le Golf National.
European team Thomas Bjorn trying to win the trophy she had run out of Hazeltine two years ago was more powerful than the American team in the morning games in pairs achieved the result of 3 : 1.
The U.S. team showed greater fighting in pairs by winning two games, but the difference in points was already great.
To win the team, Jim Furyk needs to collect eight points in 12 individual games held on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first European team debuter to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari are known as "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend only another couple who won four points in the game in pairs in the history of Ryder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed at the fourballs, they proved themselves powerful in the game against Woods and US debutant Bryson Dechambeau with a 5-4-4 victory.
Woods who didn't show the best performance in two Saturday games did some genius moves, but now there are 19 defeats of 29 games in fourballs and couples and seven defeats in a row.
Justin Rose paused the morning fourballs to return with partner Henrik Stenson to the match with couples and experienced a 2+1 defeat from Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepki, the first and third best player in the world.
But the Europeans didn't all go as if they were anointed during a pleasant day southeastern of Paris.
The triple winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas won two points on Sunday and thus set a ladder high for their American team.
First they defeated Spanish Jon Rahma and Ian Poulter with a result of 2+1 in fourballs and then defeated Poulter and Rory Mcllroy with 4&3 in pairs after losing the first two holes.
Twice throughout history, Ryder Cup's team that was behind four points managed to get back in individual games, although Fury's team just needs an unresolved result to keep the trophy.
After two days in the background, it seems that Sunday's counterattack will be hard for them.
North Korea announced that "no chance" for untrustworthy unilateral disarmament
Foreign Minister North Korea said on Saturday in front of the United Nations that further sanctions are increasing mistrust in the United States and that there is no way North Korea will unilaterally disarm and give up nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said in the UN General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant measures of good will" last year, for example, stopped nuclear and missile tests, dismantled the nuclear test station and decided to stop the development of nuclear technology and weapons.
"However, from the United States we have not received a satisfactory response," he added.
"If we don't trust the United States, we don't have faith in our national security.
Although Ri reiterated the well-known complaints of North Korea against Washington's "step-by-step" approach to denuclearisation in which North Korea would be phased out of sanctions, his statement was significant because he did not reject unilateral denuclearisation as Pjongang did in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jonga Una and Donald Trump at the first meeting in the history of the current president of the United States and North Korean leaders in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work on "denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula", while Trump guaranteed the security of North Korea.
North Korea wants to officially put an end to the Korean war that lasted from 1950 to 1953, but the United States has made it possible for Pjongang to renounce nuclear weapons before that.
Washington also ignored calls to reduce severe international sanctions for North Korea.
"The U.S. insists that denuclearisation be carried out before it and increases the pressure by sanctions in order to achieve its goal, and even opposes the "declaration of the end of the war," Ri added.
"The perception that sanctions can throw us on our knees is just the delusion of people who know nothing about us.
The main problem is that the continuation of sanctions increases mistrust."
Rei didn't mention whether there were plans for another meeting of Kim and Trump, which the president of the United Nations was talking about at the beginning of the week in the United Nations.
But the minister pointed out that Kim and South Korea leader Moon Jae-in have held even three meetings in the last five months and added: "If denuclearisation had sought South Korea, not the United States, denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have come to this end."
Regardless of everything, Minister Riya's tone of speech differed greatly from last year when he spoke before the UN General Assembly and said the goal of the continental United States missiles was inevitable after the evil President Trump called Kim a "human rocket" on a suicide mission.
The Trump, who threatened "complete destruction" of North Korea last year in the United Nations, praised Kim for his courage to disarm, but added that there was still much work to be done and that sanctions had to remain in force until North Korea was denuclearised.
Trump said on Wednesday that there was no time frame for denuclearisation and added: "It doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia expressed the view that the UN Security Council should reward Pjongang for the measures taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo of the UN Security Council said Thursday: "The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must continue strictly until complete, final and verifiable denouncing is achieved."
The Security Council unanimously imposed sanctions for North Korea in 2006 in an attempt to stop funding a nuclear and ballistic programme in Pjongang.
Pompeo met with Rio at the UN's main meeting and then said he would visit Pjongang again next month to prepare for the second meeting.
Pompeo's visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit didn't go well.
He left Pjongang in July and said he was making progress, but North Korea called him after a few hours for "gangster demands".
North Korea has agreed a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle the missile location and nuclear complex that will be achieved if the United States takes "relevant measures".
He added that Kim discovered that these "relevant measures" refer to the security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and certain steps towards stabilizing relations with Washington.
Students at Harvard attend a course to learn how to rest well
A new course at Harvard University has enabled all students to sleep well in an effort to fight the growing culture of learning with caffeine and sleepless nights.
The academic found that students at the best university in the world often have no idea of the basics of caring about themselves.
Charles Cheisler, professor of sleep science at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has invented a course he considers to be the first of those species in the United States.
He came up with the idea of a course after he gave a talk about the effect of sleep deprivation on learning.
At the end of the class, a girl came to me and said, "Why did I know this just now, in the last year of college?"
She said no one told her how important the dream was, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is held for the first time this year, explains to the students how good sleep habits help in academic and sports success and generally improves health.
Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of the Health Service at Paul Barreira University said the University decided to introduce a course after a serious lack of sleep during the week was observed among students.
The uniform course consists of a series of interactive tasks.
One of these tasks includes the picture of a student bedroom where students have to click on cupcakes of coffee, curtains, tennis and books to find out what the effects of caffeine and light are, how the lack of sleep affects success and how important a sleep routine is.
During the lecture, students learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
After that, the campus map with interactive icons is shown that encourages students to think about their daily routine.
"We know that student behavior will not change immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know how cigarettes affect health," added Professor Cheisler.
The culture of pride in whole night learning before the exam continues to exist, says the professor and adds that modern technology and increasing pressure on students prove that the lack of sleep is becoming a major problem.
The professor says that the secret weapon of students against stress, exhaustion and anxiety should be a good and good dream. Sleep helps in the fight against obesity because lack of sleep affects the brain, throws it into a state of hunger and causes constant hunger.
Raymond So, 19-year-old student of chemistry and biology from California, helped Professor Cheisler invent a course after he attended his first year of Harvard.
He says the course opened his eyes and inspired him to expand the course throughout the campus.
As a next step, he plans to ask all post-graduate students to complete a similar study subject before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Cheisler recommends that students include an alarm during sleep, as well as during awakening. They must be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" that emit screens of electronic devices, as well as LED lights that can interfere with Circadian rhythm and cause sleep problems.
Livingston – Rangers 1 : 0: Eating goal defeat Gerrard's boys
The Rangers suffered another defeat after Dolly Menge's shot crushed Steven Gerrard's lack of defense and ended the match with the Livingstone victory with the result of 1:0.
The team from Ibrox wanted to win the first round after the triumph in February and results 4:1 in St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard's second defeat in 18 matches, so his team now lags eight points in Ladbrokes Prime Ministership for the leading Hearts.
Menga reached an event seven minutes before halftime, and the Rangers as if they had no inspiration, and it didn't seem to equalize the result.
While the Rangers now fell to six places, Livingston climbed to the third with only one chance of difference behind the hibernian.
There might be new problems for Rangers after the line judge Calum Spence got a head injury when some object was dumped from a distance.
Gerrard made eight changes on the sides and so opposed Ayra to the half-final Bethfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same stand of Livingstone that Hearts last week took action and would be thrilled to see his well-designed stand stifled every attempt of the opponent.
The Rangers may have had more balls in their possession, but Livingstone achieved more with her.
They had a chance to make an appointment two minutes after Menga was first kicked out of the game that Scott Pittman had opened up space to go to Allan McGregor's goal, however, the fiancee missed that opportunity.
Deeply free hit Keaghan Jacobs intercepted Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense player Alan Lithgow could only pass an inaccurate blow to the rear lines.
The Rangers took control at one point, but in the final third of the game they seemed to play with hope instead of conviction.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that the judge should have sentenced him to one in 15 minutes after his match with Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson didn't import Colombia's request.
In the first half of the day, the Rangers were able to direct only two balls to the goal, but the former Ibrox doorkeeper Liam Kelly was one hit with Lassana Coulibaly's head and the pitfalls hit Ovie Ejarie didn't represent a big problem.
Although the 34-minute playing of Livingstone has slowed down the game, no one can deny their efforts.
The Rangers have failed to use Jacob's deep back ball again.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher added a ball to Scott Robinson who kept his integrity and chose Meng for a simple end to the attack.
Gerrard reacted during the stand and replaced Coulibaly by Ryan Kent. The replacement almost had a current effect because the wing player added the ball to Morelos, but impressive Kelly blocked it off his line.
But Livingston continued to drag visitors into exactly the same game they enjoyed while Lithgow and Halkett made a long hit for each other.
Holt's side could have extended leadership in the final moments, but McGregor effectively disabled Jacobs before Lithgow made a wide-ranging invasion of the corner.
Rangers' replacement, Glenn Middleton, once again, was late looking for an asterist because he had a fight with Jacob, but Thomson and this time he looked away.
Almanah: Geiger's inventor
And now it follows from our Almanah page at Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and a few days ago ...the day of the birth of future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hansa" Geiger in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detection and measurement of radioactivity, and from this invention later developed a device known as Geiger's counter.
Since then, Geiger's main science champion has become the main champion of pop culture, for example in the 1950's "Bells of Colorado" film, in which the main roles were apparently incredible scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is it, God?"
Rogers: “It is Geiger’s counter, and it is used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can actually hear atoms reacting to radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: "Look at this, that's what you're hearing!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name still lives on.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" bad cells
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" bad cells and destroy them
"The vaccine teaches the immune system that it recognises bad cells as part of the treatment
The procedure includes removing immune cells from the patient and changing them to the laboratory
Cells are treated so that they can "recognise" the protein that is common to many types of cancer and then reinject themselves to the patient
The experimental vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
In one woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells, ovarian cancer has been withdrawn for more than 18 months.
The procedure includes withdrawing immune cells from the patient, changing them to a laboratory so that they can recognize a protein called HER2, which is common to many types of cancer and reinjection of cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Institute for Cancer in the city of Bethesda in the federal state of Maryland said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 stimulates the growth of several types of cancer, including breast cancer, ovaries, lungs and colon cancer," explains Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach to withdraw immune system cells from patients and their "learning" how to recognize cancer cells was successful in treating one type of leukaemia.
Kanye West joined the discussion on Trump after hosting the Saturday Night Live show and supported it by wearing a hat entitled "Let's Make America Big Again".
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was released for the study during the Saturday Night Live show after the event with the interruptions in which he praised US President Donald Trump and announced that he would run for President 2020.
After performing the third song of the evening called Ghost Town during which he wore a hat entitled "Let's Make America Big Again", he continued to speak against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"I talk to white people so often and they tell me how you like Trump, he's a racist."
Well, if I were to worry about racism, I would have moved from America a long time ago," he said.
The Saturday Night Live show began with a satirical jump in which Matt Damon ridiculed Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the U.S. Senate's Justice Committee on Christine Blasey Ford's allegations of sexual abuse.
Although it wasn't broadcast, the video of West's speech to the social media was broadcast by the comic book Chris Rock.
I don't know if he was trying to appeal to West by publishing Rock.
Also, West complained to the public that he was being promoted behind the stage because of the hat he was wearing.
"They harassed me behind the stage.
They told me, "Don't go anywhere with that hat."
I'm being treated!
They said I sank," Washington Examiner said.
West continued: "Do you want to see the bottom?" and said he would wear his Superman coat because that means I can't tell him what to do.
Try with love."
Variety wrote that his comments at least two times caused public unrest, and members of the Saturday Night Live show felt ashamed, while one person told the magazine: "The whole studio has been shut down."
West has been called at the last minute as a replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller died a few days earlier.
By performing the song "I Love It", worn like a bottle of Perrier mineral water, many were amazed.
Westa supported Candace Turner, the leader of the TPUSA Conservative Group, who posted on Twitter: "One of the bravest people: Thank you for your support for Mafia."
But the show leader Karen Hunter on Twitter announced that West was simply "his own and that it was absolutely wonderful".
"But I choose NOT to reward someone (by buying his music, clothing or supporting his "art") whom I believe will accept and expand the ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
We are, too," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he changed his name, saying that he is now "will be officially known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow Diddy's steps, who is also known as Puff Diddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague, Snoop Dogg, was called Snoop Lion, and of course, the music legend of the Prince has changed his name into a symbol, and then into an artist previously known as the Prince.
A charge of attempted murder by a knife at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was accused of trying to kill a man in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The police reported an incident in Ballyhackamore.
The accused should appear on Monday before the Supreme Court in Belfast.
The charges will be reviewed by the prosecution.
Star series game of the capital of Kit Harington has cleaned up toxic husbandhood
Kit Harington is known for the role of Jon Snow who is a cheap sword in HBO's violent medieval fantasy of the throne game.
But 31-year-old actor turned to the stereotype of a hero, saying that because of such television roles, boys often feel that they have to be strong to gain respect.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed that "something went wrong" and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic matrimoniality in #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married 31-year-old colleague Rose Leslie from the series of the Games of the throne, admitted that he wanted to "very resolute" to face this problem.
"I personally feel very determined at this moment – where we have made a mistake with masculinity?" he asked.
"What have we learned from men as they grew up, in relation to the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that thanks to the very husbandly figures on the screen, television could partly be responsible for the growth of toxic husbandhood.
He continued: “What is born, and what is taught?
What do you learn from TV and on the streets, and that makes the boys feel they have to have those specific male drawings?
I think this is actually one of the big issues of our time — how can we change it?
Because obviously something went wrong for the boys."
He also admitted in the interview that he would not record the continuations of the game of the throne at the end of next summer and said that he "ended with battles and horses".
From November, Kit will play a new performance by True West author Sam Shepard, a film producer and his brother as a robber.
The actor recently discovered that he felt that meeting Rose's wife was the best thing that happened to him during the filming of the throne game.
"I met my wife by recording that series, which gave me my family and future life," he discovered.
Rose was in a fantastic series that won Emmy's award to play Ygritte, the love of Kitt's character Jon Snow.
Couple got married in June 2018 at the possession of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reported an increase in new disease cases of 14 %
China reported that the number of people living with HIV/AIDS increased by 14%.
Health workers say more than 820,000 people are infected in the country.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were recorded only in the second quarter of 2018.
Most new cases of infection have been transmitted by sex, which has changed compared to the past.
In the past, HIV has been rapidly transmitted throughout parts of China as a result of a blood transfusion.
At a conference in Yunnan Province, the Chinese health authorities said that the person infected with HIV in this way is almost gone.
However, every year the number of people living with HIV and being is increasing by 100,000 people.
The introduction of HIV to sex is a constant problem between the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but it is said that discrimination against LGBT is a big person.
Research estimates that because of conservative values in the country, 70 - 90% of men who have sexual relations with other men will eventually marry a woman.
Many cases of transmission of disease in such relationships occur due to inappropriate protection during sex.
As part of its efforts to deal with this problem, the Chinese government promised in 2003 free access to HIV drugs.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of the public has given up information on the GOP senators, calling it "dangerous lies" and "theory of conspiracy"
US representative Maxine Walters said on Saturday that a member of her staff had published personal data by three republican US senators on Wikipedia sites.
A democratic representative from Los Angeles is convinced that these claims are spreading to individuals "outer right wing", as well as websites.
"False, lie and more disgusting lies," Waters said on Twitter.
The published data reportedly contained home addresses and phone numbers of American senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatcha, both from Utah.
The information appeared on the network on Thursday, and it was published by an unknown person with Capitol Hill during a hearing in the Senate on allegations of sexual abuse by the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh.
The information was leaked after the three senators examined Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have published that the IP address that reveals the source of this information belongs to the Waters representative's office, as well as information on the staff member's representative, reported The Hill newspaper.
"These unfounded statements are completely wrong and absolutely false," Waters continued.
"My staff member – whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised as a result of these false and false claims – is in no way responsible for the leaking of these data.
These unfounded statements are completely wrong and absolutely false."
Mrs. Waters' statement quickly attracted internet critics, including former spokesperson for the White House, Ari Fleischer.
"This is an angry denial," Fleischer wrote.
"It shows that Waters has no temper to be a Congressman.
Someone who's accused of something he didn't do shouldn't be angry.
It can't be broken.
He must not re-examine the accused's motives.
He must be calm and steady."
It was felt that Fleischer compared Barbara Walters' reaction to the criticisms that democracy is pointing to Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of becoming too angry during the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who competes in general elections against Waters, also reported on Twitter.
"It's important if it's true," he wrote.
Watersov stated in his statement that her office had announced these false claims to "the moderate bodies and organs of the order".
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are exposed and that they bear legal consequences for all actions that are harmful and dangerous to my entire cabinet," she continued.
Review of the film "Johnny English: Again on the Task" – not enough interesting Rowan Atkinson fights against spy
Now it is already customary in every new British film to look for messages about Brexit, and it seems to be the same in a new display of the action series "Johnny English" whose first sequel entitled "Johnny English" was first shown in 2003 and returned to large screens entitled "Johnny English Again".
Will our own satire on how much we are obviously worthless become a new national export opportunity?
Incapacitated Johnny English naked eyes and rubber face again has permission to complicate situations, while his name says more than anything about a comic creation for a wide audience designed for countries in which cinema is not in English.
He is of course a deranged secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims on the "diluted" glamorous reminder of Inspector Clouseau, has a touch of Mr. Bean's character and a bit of a reminder to that guy who played one note of the introduction of the "Chariots of Fire" at the opening ceremony of the London Olympics 2012.
His character is also inspired by a passenger and a mysterious world man whom Atkinson once played in the now forgotten TV ads for Barclaycard and who is the payoff of chaos.
There's one or two hot moments in this latest movie release.
I liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor and when the propeller suddenly hit his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is visible, but humor is perceived to be rather uninteresting and unusually excessive, especially now that "serious" movie titles such as "007" and "Impossible Missions" and themselves offer elements of comedy.
humour seems to be intended for children, not adults, but in my opinion, the deranged stories of Johnny English are not as innovative and focused as those Atkinson's non-gags inspired by Mr Bean.
The assumption that Britain is in serious trouble is already a general fact.
Hacker entered the most secret British web-network spy and discovered the identities of all British agents, to the horror of an agent on duty, which unfortunately plays Kevin Eldon's short appearance.
It's filled with a glass of Prime Minister's patience, superior and wartime character who is experiencing a complete breakdown of the system because he's politically hated: Emma Thompson is trying to prove himself faithful to the guy who should represent Theresa May, but she didn't get exactly the material to do something.
Intelligence consultants reveal that all active spies are compromised and will therefore have to rehabilitate a retired agent.
And this person will be careless Johnny English with his head and beard who is currently employed as the principal of some sophisticated school, but secretly teaches how to become a secret agent: here are some pretty geese because English teaches rock-style spying.
English quickly brings the government room to an emergency meeting, where he meets with Bough, his former partner and his eternal victim, who plays Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to an overly enthusiastic submarine commander who plays Vicki Pepperdine, whose potential is largely wasted.
And so the two members of the Secret Service of Her Majesty who are all doing entirely wrong are returning to action and meeting a beautiful fatal woman, Ophelia Bulletin, who was framed by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously under the influence of a charismatic technological billionaire who claims to be able to solve British computer problems, the evil Jason Volte played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their exciting journey with absurd and funny stories: the burned-in waiter is replaced by a French restaurant, the challenge of a huge mess being smuggled into the Volta luxury yacht, and English is causing a complete anarchy by trying to use hearing aids for virtual reality to find out what the inside of Volta's house looks like.
Everything has been done as needed for this last continuation, but as much as the film was attractive and dissipating, it still contains a lot of children's elements.
Quite a central achievement.
And as was the case with other movies about Johnny English, I was once again wondering if the British film industry could not give Rowan Atkinson a role that would suit his talent?
The labyrinth party denies that the British plan is to work four days a week, and will be paid in five days
The labyrinth party of Jeremy Corby will consider a radical plan that British would work for four days a week and would be paid for five days' work.
The party allegedly wants the heads of companies to save workers from the past from the artificial intelligence revolution (AI) and give them an additional day off.
That would mean that employees would be entitled to a three-day weekend with equal pay.
The sources suggest that the idea could be "integrated" into the foreign economic programme and plans to make the country respond to workers' interests.
The union congress supports shifting to a four-day working week as a way for workers to benefit from changes in the economy.
A high source from the Laborist Party said about the newspaper "The Sunday Times": "The policy review is expected to be published by the end of the year.
"The four-day working week will not be achieved overnight, but it represents a trend that fits in the approach that this party has to balance the economy for the benefit of the workers, as well as the overall industrial strategy of this party."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, since the Green Party promised a four-day working week during its general election campaign for 2017.
However, the Laborist Party does not accept that desire at all.
The spokesperson for the Laborist Party said: "The four-day working week is not the party's policy and the party is not considering it."
The shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour Party conference to elaborate his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he decided to take over the power from the hands of "unfair managers" and "profit" in municipal businesses.
The plans of the shadow offices also mean that current shareholders in the water economy may not be able to regain their full role because the Labour Government could make "debts" based on perceived irregularities.
It also confirmed plans to include employees in the corporate boards and to create inclusive equity funds to give 10% of the private company's capital to employees, who would earn an annual dividend of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy are talking about "60 Minutes" about whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh could change their opinion
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has finally suspended the vote on his candidacy for the Supreme Court for at least a week and raises the question whether the Agency's conclusion could affect the Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview that was held on Sunday, the correspondent "60 Minutes", Scott Pelley, asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether there was a possibility for the FBI to discover something that would lead them to change their mind.
Kennedy felt more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said after the debate, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, after they had been brought to you, and said, 'Have you done this?'
He was determined, uncompromising, unconcerned."
Graham's voice, however, is as if it were stuck in a rock.
"I am determined when it comes to Brett Kavanaugh and really should be a strong accusation to change it," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know the following: Brett definitely rejected everything," Graham added thinking about Christine Blasey Ford.
"None of the persons she nominated could confirm her claim.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see anything change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and has it achieved anything about poverty reduction?
This Saturday New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with an extremely impressive star list and an equally impressive mission – ending poverty in the world.
For the past seven years, the Global Citizen Festival will bring together tens of thousands of people in Central Park to enjoy not only star performances such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raise awareness of the real goal of the event, ending extreme poverty by 2030.
Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the project Global Powery Project, an international group of advocates hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to get a free ticket for the event (unless they were willing to pay a VIP ticket), the concert visitors had to perform a series of tasks or "work" such as volunteering, sending e-mails to world leaders, telephone calls or any other meaningful ways of raising awareness of their end poverty.
But how successful is Global Citizen actually since he has 12 years left to reach his goal?
Is the idea of awarding people free concert the right way of convincing people to demand an action call, or just another case called "clickivism" – where people feel that signing an internet petition or sending a tweet really changes something?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has claimed to have marked more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters who have tried to achieve a number of different objectives.
It claims that these actions have been an incentive for world leaders to announce commitments and policies that will result in an amount of more than $37 billion that will have an impact on lives by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group entered into 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its activities, of which at least $10 billion was already paid or collected.
The group estimates that the funds secured so far directly affected almost 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include "The Power of Nutrition", the partnership of investors and managers in the United Kingdom who are committed to "helping children develop to their full potential", promising that after receiving more than 4700 tweets from the world's citizens, they will provide $35 million to help Rwanda to end malnutrition in this area.
"With the help of the United Kingdom government, donors, national governments and citizens of the world, such as you, we can achieve that social injustice of nutrition becomes only a fuss in history," said Tracey Ullman, an ambassador of the Foundation "The Power of Nutrition", published at a London concert in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions taken to improve food for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the "The Power of Nutrition" project to provide food interventions for 5 million women and children.
As an answer to one of the most frequent questions on his website, he says, "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
The Global Citizen answers: “It will be a long and difficult time. Sometimes we will fail.
But we're going to succeed, just as we've succeeded in making big moves for civil rights and against apartheid before us, because we're stronger together.
The performances Janet Jackson, Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae belong among some of the performances on this year's New York event that will lead Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy as a "block" to prevent Russian exports of energy - Interior Minister
Washington can, "if necessary", use its Navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, has discovered US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke, as Washington Examiner reported.
Zinke said that Russian engagement in Syria is particularly where it acts at the call of the legitimate government .
"I believe that the reason why Russia is in the Middle East is that it wants to sell energy in this area as it does in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe," he says.
But according to him, there are ways and means to solve this problem.
"The United States, with the help of the Navy, can ensure the openness of maritime routes and blockade, if necessary, in order to ensure that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinkke addressed the presence of the event whose host was a non-profit Consumer Energy Alliance group that is represented in the United States as "the voice of energy consumers".
He compared Washington's approach to Russia and Iran, stressing that they are actually the same.
"The Iran-Russia economic option is more or less fuel use and exchange," he said, and for Russia it says it is "uses the same trick" in economies dependent on fossil fuels.
Statements were made simultaneously with the purpose of the Trump Administration to increase exports of its oiled natural gas to Europe, thereby replacing Russia with a far cheaper option for European consumers.
In this sense, officials of the Trump Administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "unappropriate" Nord Stream 2 (Northern Stream 2) pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin a "prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline is worth 11 billion dollars, which will double the existing gas capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that the fierce opposition of the Washington project is simply driven by economic reasons and that the example of unfair competition is an example.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after meeting US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position provoked Germany's reaction, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German industry organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), called on the United States to avoid EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country is involved in our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), said after a recent meeting of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "consider seriously" the possibility of running for president in 2020, states the federal state senator Massachusetts
The federal senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that he would "consider seriously" the presidential candidacy after the mid-term elections.
During a direct meeting with the citizens of Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she thought she was running herself.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, which means a woman on the forehead," The Hill said.
"After November 6, I will seriously consider the possibility of running for the president."
Warren gave an opinion on President Donald Trump during a meeting with citizens, saying that "this country is leading the wrong way".
"I'm terribly worried about what Donald Trump is doing for our democracy," she said.
Warren openly criticised Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet she posted on Friday, Warren says: "Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
However, the poll published on Thursday showed that most of Warren's voters do not think they should run in 2020.
According to a survey by the Centre for Political Research at the University of Suffolk / Boston Globe, fifty-eight percent of "probably" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidacy.
The poll showed greater support for former Governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38% votes for potential candidacy and 48% against.
The other names of the Democrats that were discussed in connection with the potential race for the President in 2020 are former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'd make an official decision by January, reports the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions PTSP Track Palina at Donald Trump
Track Palin (26) spent a year in Iraq after applying in September.
He was arrested and accused of an incident of family violence that occurred on Monday night
"What goes through my son, what goes through after returning, is comparable to other families that feel the consequences of the PTSP and other wounds our soldiers are returning with," said the public at Donald Trump's gathering in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin's arrest called for a general problem that he was still silent about and said about his son and other war veterans that "they came back a little different, they came back solid, they came back asking if there was respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots, and all the other members of the army, gave for this country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilli, Alaska, and accused of family violence against a woman, the interruption of the application of family violence and possession of weapons in an alcoholised state, says Dan Bennett, spokesperson of the Police Administration of the city of Wasille.
18 federal states and D.C. support the re-examine of new asylum policies
Eighteen states and the District of Colombia support the legal challenge of a new US policy that reduces asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives of 18 federal states and districts submitted a friendly report Friday in Washington to provide support to the asylum seeker who opposes politics, NBC News reports.
The full name of the prosecutor in Grace's suit against the Sessions that the US Civil Liberties Union filed in August against the federal policy has not been found.
She said her partner "and violent members of his gang" abused her, but US officials refused her asylum request on 20 July.
She was arrested in Texas.
National lawyers who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum-seekers in the United States come, as countries facing current gang and family violence.
The new asylum policy in the United States has changed the immigration committee's decision in 2014 which allows immigrants who do not have documents to flee from domestic violence, to apply for asylum.
National Attorney-General of the District of Colombia Karl Racine said in his statement on Friday that the new policy "is ignoring decades of state, federal and international law".
"The Federal Law requires all asylum claims to be settled on the basis of concrete facts and circumstances of the prosecution, and such a ban violates the principle," the court's friend's report states.
Lawyers further argued that policies that reduce immigrants' entry would harm the American economy, arguing that it is more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary workforce".
Chief State Attorney Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing family violence and gang violence in June.
"Assil is available to those who leave their homeland for persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or membership of a certain social group or political opinion," Sessions said in his statement on politics on 11 June.
The purpose of asylum has never been to alleviate all the problems, even all the serious problems, that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palau as the number of victims doubles in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was getting harder.
"The situation is very tense," said 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, as she comforted her boy who was shaking in a fever in the evacuation centre in the devastated city of Palu.
"Vehicles of emergency assistance every minute of the body's import.
The government is wasting clean water."
The residents were seen returning to their ruined homes, reading through flooded things, trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the hospitals, damaged by a 7.5-degree earthquake, were attacked.
Some of the injured, including two Hariss, who had suffered a fracture of their back and shoulders, rested in front of the military hospital in Palu, where patients were treated openly because of continued severe post-disaster earthquakes.
The tears filled his eyes as he spoke of the feeling of a violent earthquake that shook the hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I think I was trapped inside the ruins of the wall," Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had come to the city for the wedding.
"I heard my wife call for help, but then silence followed.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
The US Ambassador accuses China of "balancing" through "propaganda"
A week after the official Chinese newspapers published four pages of a long ad in the US daily newspaper that promoted the mutual benefit of US and China's trade, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of abuse of the American press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump turned to a paid newspaper supplement in the most sold newspaper in Iowa, Des Moines Register, on Wednesday, after accusing China of wanting to get involved in American congress elections on November 6th, which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to get involved in American elections marked what US officials in Reuters' statement characterized as a new phase of Washington's escalating campaign to exert pressure on China.
While it is normal for governments to place advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in a escalating trade war that has led to high import tariffs.
China's retaliation at the beginning of the trade war was designed to strike exporters in countries like Iowa that supported the Trump Republican Party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, an American ambassador to China and former long-term Governor Iowa, chief exporter of agricultural products in China, said Beijing had damaged US workers, farmers and companies.
In an article in the Sunday issue of the newspaper Des Moines Register, Branstad says that China "now doubles this abuse by promoting advertising in our own free press."
"By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses American tradition of free speech and free press by placing paid advertisements in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, in a newspaper kiosk on the streets of Beijing you will find limited votes of opposition and you will not see any true reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese people may have on the disturbing Chinese economic path because the media are under strong pressure from the Communist Party of China," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most prominent Chinese newspapers refused to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspapers were in question.
Cavanaugh debacle Republicans have removed voters from the middle-term elections, analysts warn
Since many Republicans are standing with the judge of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh and defend him on several allegations of sexual abuse, analysts warn that this will lead to negative reactions during the upcoming mid-term elections, especially among women.
The emotions surrounding this event have been quite exasperated, and most Republicans have already shown that they still want to vote.
Such things can't be returned," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Maxwell University College in Syracuse, for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher expressed doubt that the last insistence of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to conduct an FBI investigation would be sufficient to silence angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, will not forget it tomorrow, nor in the cold," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesman for the Progressive Group MoveOn, quoted the newspaper in Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, the protestors sang: "Come cold!", protesting in the Senate hall while Republicans controlling the Judicial Committee were preparing to continue with the Kavanaugh nomination despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, Mic reports.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the democrats will be beyond all expectations," said Stu Rothenberg, a non-foreign political analyst, for the news.
"People say they are already on a high level, which is true.
But they could be taller, especially among women in suburbs and younger voters, from 18 to 29 years of age, who, although they don't like the president, often don't go out for election."
Even prior to Ford's public testimony, in which her allegations of sexual assault were detailed by the Supreme Court's judge, analysts suggest that a negative reaction could occur if Republicans continue to confirm.
"It's a real mess for the Big Old Party," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, beginning last week, NBC News.
"It is not only about voting in committee or final vote, nor about whether Kavanaugh has been sent to a security club, but also about how the Republicans have access to all of this and how they have treated it," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group helping in the election of Democrats.
However, it seems that the Americans have been somewhat divided about whom they will trust after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a little more inclined to him.
A new survey published by YouGov shows that 41% of respondents definitely or probably believe in the truth of Ford's testimony, while 35% said that they certainly or probably believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that he thought Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent claimed the same for Ford.
After Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the statements Ford made, along with at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Fordova testified before the Senate Justice Board on the oath last week that Kavanaugh attacked her in a drunken state when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that her candidate for the Supreme Court's trial showed her genitals at a party during a study at Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventor plans to start a new web download for Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new company aimed at becoming a competition for Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this legendary technology, Inrupt, is a company that is developing on the basis of Berners-Lee's open solid platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and people to access certain information.
In an exclusive interview for Fast Company, Berners-Lee was concerned about the purpose behind the Inrupt "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said thinking on startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid's technology to enable people to create their own "personal network storage" or POD.
It can contain contact descriptions, binding descriptions, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drives, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one screen at a time.
What is unique when it comes to personal online data storage is that it is a decision about who can access any information fully by users.
The company refers to this as ‘personal data enhancement’.
The idea for Inrupt, according to John Bruce's CEO, is that the company provides resources, processes and skills to help Solid be available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, security platforms purchased by IBM, several engineers who signed a project work contract, as well as voluntary programmers' community.
Since this week, development engineers from around the world have been able to build their own decentralised applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team don't talk to Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change in which all their business models would be completely reversed overnight.
"We're not asking for their permission."
In a media release released on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that the Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy and the ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid."
In 1994 Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded a World Wide Web consortium at the Massachusetts State Institute of Technology (MIT).
In recent months, Berners-Lee has had an influential voice in the debate on network neutrality.
Even as he starts Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundations and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about the next era of the network," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebrating the High Priests of World War I by the Victorian Cross
Celebrates in honor of the only Anglican Church priest who was distinguished by the Victorian Cross as a fighter in World War I was relatively prominent in his hometown 100 years later .
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 in an attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper and never found out that he had received the greatest British military honor.
The memorial stone discovered two of his grandchildren at the Rushden parade in Northamptonshire on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said that it was "incredibly symbolic" that the stone would be discovered exactly 100 years after the capture of his grandfather for whom he received this recognition.
According to the London Gazette official's report, on 29 September 1918, Colonel Vann led his battalion through St. Quentin's canal "through a very dense fog and under a heavy fire that came from the direction of the battlefield and the machinery".
He later rushed into the first row and with "incredibly bravery" led the team forward before he ran without any help at the Polish top and smashed three of the military squad.
Colonel Vanna killed a German sniper on October 4, 1918. . . something more than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann (72) said that his grandfather's actions were "something I know I could never achieve, and that it stimulates humility".
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also placed the winery after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he "felt very honored to participate in the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is shown through the support that many people will give."
The lovers of mixed martial arts stayed awake all night to watch Bellator 206, and instead they got Prussian Peppu
Imagine this . . staying up all night to watch a series of Bellator 206 matches in order to finally make it impossible to track the main event.
The San Jose program contained 13 fights, including six on the main list, and in the United Kingdom they were shown live on Channel 5 at night.
At six o'clock in the morning, just when Gegard Mousesi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for each other's match, viewers in Great Britain were shocked when the transfer ended Prastic Peppa.
Many were not impressed by the fact that only due to the fight did they stay awake until early morning hours.
A fan of the interruption of the transmission of children's cartoons on Twitter described it as "some kind of sick joke".
"According to state regulations, this content is not suitable for broadcast at 6am, so they had to transfer to the children's programme," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president for marketing and communication Bellator, when asked about the transfer.
"Jupi, "Pashtic Peppa."
Belator's president, Scott Coker, said he would coordinate his plans to include viewers from Britain in the future.
"When I look at the reprisal, I think we can probably fix something," Coker said.
"But the transfer is there at six in the morning on Sunday and we will not be able to accomplish anything until we have Sunday, when they will already have Monday.
But we're working on it.
Trust me, when the transmission was interrupted, there were many scriptures that were not even friendly.
We tried to fix it. We thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't. lt's a state-of-the-art problem.
I can promise you that next time it won't come.
We're gonna keep five fights instead of six.
They're about unfortunate circumstances."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "inferior" about sexuality
The Olympic jumper in the water Tom Daley says he grew up with a sense of inferiority compared to others because of his sexuality, but it gave him motivation to become successful.
Twenty-four-year-old said that until he went to high school he wasn't aware that "all are not like me".
In his statement on Radio 4 Desert Island Disks, led by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about the rights of homosexuals to give others "hope".
He also said his victory at the Olympics was less important since he became his father.
The regular director of the long-term show, Kirsty Young, took a few months to rest because of the disease.
As he appeared as a waster at Laverna's first show, Daley said that during his growing up he felt "less valuable" to others because "it was not socially acceptable to love both boys and girls".
He said: “To this day, your feelings of inferiority and diversity in relation to others have been the real things that have given me power and strength to succeed. ”
He said he wanted to prove "someone and something" so he wouldn't disappoint anyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The double winner of the bronze Olympic medal became a prominent person who is committed to LGBT and used his performance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to several countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he spoke publicly because he felt that he was happy that he could live openly without consequences and that he wanted to give others “a hope. ”
The triple world champion said it was surprising that he fell in love with a man named Dustin Lance Black, who met him in 2013.
Daley married an Oscar, who was 20 years older than he was last year, but he said that the difference in years never presented him with a problem.
"When you're so young you're going through so much," he turned to his first Olympic game when he was 14 years old, and his father died three years later.
In June they became the parents of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "whole perspective" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, all the stories would be about 'getting a gold medal'," he said.
"You know what, there are bigger things than gold Olympic medals.
Robbie is my golden Olympic medal."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 years after his brain tumor was diagnosed.
Daley said his father didn't accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was whether they got tickets to London in 2012. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
"I couldn't tell him, 'Dad, you won't be here long enough to be in the first line'," he said.
"I held him by the hand while he was breathing, and only when he stopped breathing and died did I finally become aware that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
"I only knew it was what I had dreamed of my whole life to jump in front of the home audience at the Olympic Games, it was not a better feeling," he said.
It was also an inspiration to choose the first song . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Mickelson out of shape at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to completely recover the form in order to avoid an awkward shift.
Mickelson, who played a record 12th time in this two-year competition, sent Captain Jim Furyk to the club in four-ball and four-ball games on Saturday.
Instead of being at the centre of the action, as it has often been for the United States, a four-time winner spent a day cheering and diluting his games at a gym hoping to correct what was bothering him.
Never the most accurate player, not even at the top of his career, this 48-year-old is not ready for the demanding Le Golf National field, where long nervous terrain routine punishments inaccurate blows.
And if the field itself is not scary enough, Mickelson is facing the British Open Francesc Molinarie precise winner of the ninth match on Sunday, who won every four matches this week with the latest Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans, who start the 12 individual games with four points less, get to the hot start, the Mickelson game could prove absolutely crucial.
Fury said he had confidence in his man more than that and he couldn't say.
"He fully understood the role he had today, stabbed me behind his back, hugged me and said he'd be ready tomorrow," Fury said.
"There's a lot of self-confidence."
He's famous and has contributed a lot to the teams in the past, and this week.
I'm sure I didn't imagine playing two games.
I figured there'd be more of them, but that's how it turned out and we thought we should do it.
He wants to be on the field, just like everyone else."
Nick Fald's record on Sunday will be the number of Ryder Cup matches played.
That could mark the end of his career in a Ryder Cup that never really reached the level of his personal achievements.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven half-times, although Fury said his presence brought certain intangible values on the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, funny, he likes to joke with people and he's a great guy for it," he explained.
"I think younger players had fun with him and this week, which was fun to watch.
He gives a lot more than the game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great advantage can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a great advantage in the last day of Ryder's single match can easily be turned into an uncomfortable race.
Danac debuted in the game in Valderram in 1997, where the team of Captain Svea Ballesterosa had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but the game ended with their victory with a narrow difference of 141⁄2 1⁄2 1⁄2.
"You always remember that we had a great advantage in Valderram; we had a great advantage in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderram, where we won, but with a sharp difference," said Bjorn, in a picture, after watching the 2018 team that won the 5th score on Friday and yesterday led the 10th score on the Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone on the team that this isn't over.
Tomorrow you will play full power.
Get out of the field and do whatever's right.
Nothing's over until the floor's on the board.
We have a goal, and that's trying to win this trophy, and it stays focused on it.
I've been talking all the time, focusing on 12 players that are on our side, but we're quite aware who's standing up against us, the biggest players in the world."
Enthralled by the performance of his players on the hard golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never run in this direction before the mine.
Tomorrow she's worth dealing with a different beast.
Tomorrow is the main individual performances, and that's something else.
It's great to play with your partner when everything goes well, but when you're there as an individual, at the end of your golfer's ability exam.
It's a message you have to pass on to players, and she's got to give her best of herself tomorrow.
Now leave your player because he has to give the best of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his colleague on the opposite side, Jim Furyk, will ask his players to play better individually than they played with the players, excluding Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who picked up three points from four.
Furyk himself was both at the end of those big turns of the last day, since he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn before he ended up as a loser after Europe performed "a miracle in Medina".
"I remember every damn word," he said in answer to the question how Ben Crenshaw, captain of 1999, encouraged his players before the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but you should strive to achieve excellent results at the very beginning of what you saw in Brooklyn, as you saw in Medina.
When that takeoff goes in a certain direction, it puts great pressure on the middle swords.
According to that, we organized our character and arranged the boys as if we were trying to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned to try to launch a counterattack and face Rory McIlroy in the main match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahma, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter to face the other Europeans in the upper half.
I decided this group of guys is going in this order because I think it's covering everything," Bjorn said about the selected players for the individual matches.
German new warship reset to wait
The latest German Navy frigate was due to be launched in 2014 to replace the old warships since the Cold War, but will not be ready at least until next year due to incorrect systems and increased costs, local media reported.
The launch of the ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’ ship, a leading ship of completely new baden-Wuerttemberg class, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, reports the Die Zeit report by military spokesman.
The ship was to join the Navy in 2014, but worrying problems after delivery hit the fate of an ambitious project.
Four Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships, ordered by the Navy in 2007, will replace the old Bremen class frigates.
As well as some invisibility technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Constant delays, however, mean that the most modern warships that are said to allow Germany to show power abroad will already become obsolete until the moment of entry into service, says Die Zeit.
Unlucky F125 frigates came to all headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to release the ship and returned it to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time a sailor returned the ship to the shipbuilder after delivery.
There was little information about the reasons for the return, but the German media cited a number of key "software and hardware deficiencies" that would render the warship useless if sent to a combat mission.
The software deficiencies were particularly important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships will run a crew of about 120 sailors . . . half less than on the older Bremen class frigates.
It has also proved that the ship is a dramatic overload that reduces its efficiency and restricts the ability of the Navy to add future upgrades.
It is believed that the Rhineland-Pfalz is worth 7,000 tonnes twice as much as the ships of the similar class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the wrong hardware, the cost of the whole project, including crew training, is also becoming a problem.
The price is said to have reached a staggering 3.1 billion euros (US$ 3.6 billion) compared to the initial 2.2 billion euros.
The problems associated with the latest frigates become particularly important in the light of recent warnings that the German maritime force is being reduced.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Defence Parliament Committee, admitted that sailors are actually "missing ships capable of deploying".
The officer said that this problem had increased over time because old ships were out of power, and there were no replacement ships.
He expressed regret that none of the bada classes of Baden-Württemberg could join the Navy.
The National Foundation Listens to the Secret Life of the bat
The aim of the new research carried out on property in Scotland's highest is to discover how bats use landfills in food hunting.
There is hope that the results will clarify the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help to conduct future conservation activities.
A study carried out by scientists at the National Fund for Scotland (NTS) will follow ordinary and wet bat bats, as well as brown long-haired and river bats in the gardens of Inverewe in Western Ross.
Special recorders will be set at key locations around the property to monitor bat activity throughout the season.
NTS personnel and volunteers will also carry out mobile checks using manual detectors.
The expert analysis of the sound of all the recordings will determine the frequency of the vote of the bat and what kind it does.
Then there will be a map and a report to create a detailed picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS Nature Protection Advisor, hopes the results will discover which areas are most important for bats and how each species benefits them.
This information will help to determine the benefits of work on housing management, such as creating meadows and how best to maintain forest surfaces for bats and other related species.
The bat populations in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have decreased significantly during the last century.
They are threatened by construction and work on an arrangement that affects shelters and housing losses.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a danger, as well as mussels and certain chemical treatments of building material, and attacks of pet cats.
The bats aren't really blind.
However, because of their nighttime hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated echolocation techniques to find bugs and obstacles on their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, is taking the bats very seriously.
There are ten trained experts who regularly carry out research, hideout inspections and sometimes save.
The organization even set up the first and only bat reserve in Scotland on the property of Thrave in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of the ten species of bats that live in Scotland live.
The manager, David Thompson, says property is an ideal area for them.
"Here in Thrave we have a huge space for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all good dwellings.
However, there is still much we don't know about bats, so the work we do here and at other facilities will help us to better understand what they need to make progress."
Stresses the importance of checking the presence of bats before starting work on maintenance inside the building, since accidental destruction of a bed can kill up to 400 women and young people, thus probably destroying the entire local population.
The bats are protected and unlawfully killed, tortured or disturbed or destroyed their shelters.
Elizabeth Ferrell, the representative of the Scottish Association for the Protection of Shishaks, encouraged the public to help.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we simply don’t know how their population is moving.”
Ronaldo rejects allegations of rape while lawyers are preparing to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo is accused of rape that has been reported against him as "false news", saying that people "want to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel, who published those charges.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus was accused of raping an American named Kathryn Mayorg in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Apparently, he then paid her $375 000 to keep quiet about the incident, reported on Friday Der Spiegel.
In a live video that he posted on Instagram for his 142 million followers a few hours after the indictment, Ronaldo, 33, criticised the statements as "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false news," says a four-time gold ball winner in the camera.
"They want to promote themselves using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous for saying my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," the footballer added with a smile.
Ronald's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for allegations that they have called "an unacceptable report on privacy concerns," Reuters writes.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the footballer would seek compensation for "moral damage to the amount corresponding to the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in the last few years."
It is mentioned how the alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in the apartment in the hotel and casino Palms in Las Vegas.
After a meeting at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorg were reportedly returned to the football room, where he reportedly raped her, it is mentioned in documents filed at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told her that "99%" was "good guy" who failed that "one percent".
The documents say Ronaldo confirmed that a couple had sexual relations, but that he was in agreement.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that she had been photographed of injuries in the hospital, but that she later agreed to an extrajudicial agreement because she was "fearing revenge" and worried that she would be "publicly humiliated".
Thirty-four-year-old says she wants to cancel the deal now because she's still traumatized by an alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the edge of the transition to Real Madrid from Manchester United during the alleged attack, and this summer he moved to the Italian wild Juve as part of a transition worth 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK "will suffer forever" because car manufacturers have lost
The UK will "suffer forever" if after Brexit loses world leader status in car production, business secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that "anxious" was what Toyota UK told the BBC that, in the event that Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of waiting on the borders in the Brexit case without an agreement could cause job losses.
The Burnaston drive that produced Toyota Auris and Avensis last year produced almost 150 000 cars, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My position is that, if Britain comes out of the EU by the end of March without agreement, we will experience a stop production in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Director General of Toyotin in Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in the UK expressed fears about leaving the EU without an agreement on the possible consequences of cross-border trade, including Hondu, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its factory Minia in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of the car manufacturer relate to the risks in the supply chain in the case of Brexit without an agreement reached.
Toyota's production line works according to the "just on time" principle, where the parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU for cars operating on orders.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, it could break down on the border for which industry says it could lead to delays and lack of parts.
Toyota in her factory in Derbyshire couldn't keep more supplies than they needed for one day, they said from that company, so production would be stopped.
Mr Clark said the "Checkers" plan that offers Theresa May for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid these checks at the border".
"We need to agree. We want to reach the best possible agreement that will enable, as I say, not only to maintain the present success, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," said BBC Radio 4 today's programme.
"The evidence not only toyote, but also other manufacturers show that we must be absolutely able to continue this very successful supply chain."
In Toyota, they could not say how long production could be stopped, but they warned that long-term prospects, additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and who is a member of the Union's trade union, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "According to my experience, after your work has gone, they will never come back."
The government spokesman says: "We have made a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, says the White House
An important meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy State Attorney Rod Rosenstein could "be delayed for another week" as the fight continues about the judge of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh, the White House said.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who investigates Russia's involvement in the elections, links between Trump's associates and Russia, and possible interference with justice by the president.
The question is whether Trump will fire a deputy state attorney, thereby endangering Mueller's independence, but for months he's been fighting rumors in Washington.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing wearing a wire to record talks with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein rejected these statements.
But last Monday he went to the White House in the middle of an announcement that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced Thursday, which was then in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he "would not like" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to avoid interrupting with the hearing of the Senate Judicial Committee in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into charges against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the Senate's vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, showed up on Fox News on Sunday.
Regarding the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “The date is not set, it could be this week; and it could be postponed for another week, considering everything else that is happening with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always like to inform the press."
Some journalists would argue that claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
Chief Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said the lack of a press conference was not a consequence of the "theatrical behavior" of television reporters, although she said: "I will not resist the facts to dissipate."
She then advised that direct contacts between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president organizes more meetings for answers to questions than any president before him," she added without mentioning the evidence: "We have analyzed the numbers."
A short talk will continue, Sanders said, but "if journalists have the opportunity to ask the US president directly, it is infinitely better than talking to me.
We are trying to make it possible often, and you have seen it in the last few weeks, and that's exactly what you can talk to the president of the United States will replace short talks with journalists."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Lonely press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may even have shown why, free and sometimes bizarre performance in front of assembled journalists.
Ministry of Health writes to EU workers employed in the National Health Service (NHS) in Scotland for fear of Brexit
The Minister of Health sent a letter to EU staff employed in the Scottish NHS to express their gratitude and desire to stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter six months before the UK withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish government has already pledged to offset the costs of applying for EU citizens living in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: “In the summer negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on withdrawal have been held, moving according to the expected decisions of this fall.
But the United Kingdom government is also strengthening preparations for a possible scenario without an agreement.
I know this must be a very difficult time for all of you.
That is why I would now like to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
EU-wide colleagues, and more widely, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and help patients and communities to whom we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we want you to stay here."
Christian Abercrombie underwent an emergency operation after head injury
The leading player of the Tennessee State Tigers team, Christian Abercrombie, was subjected to an emergency operation after he suffered head injury in a Saturday's defeat by the Vanderbilt Commodores club with a result of 31 August 27, reports Mike Organ from Tennessee.
Major Coach Tennessee, Rod Reed, told reporters that the injury occurred immediately before half-time.
"He came to the playground line and just collapsed," Reed said.
Coaches and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the edge of the field before they put it on the carrier and sent it to further search.
State University representative Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had left the operation in Vanderbilt hospital.
Harris added that there was "no kind of injury detail" and that Tennessee State was trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a third-year student with two years of playing intern, plays the first season for Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
On Saturday he had a total of five rounds before leaving the game, reaching a total of 18 rounds in the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher tax on the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom
According to new conservative plans, foreign buyers will be charged a higher charge on the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom, and additional money will be used to help homeless people
That step will neutralize Corby's efforts to attract young voters
The increase in taxation will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
Risnica expects to raise up to 120 million pounds a year to help homeless people
Theresa May will announce today that foreign customers will be charged higher taxes on the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom and additional money will be used to help homeless people.
This move will be taken as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corby's efforts to attract young voters to promises to ensure more favourable housing solutions and focus on those with high wages.
The tax increase will be charged by individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and additional money will contribute to government efforts to combat homeless people.

Risnica expects this move to raise 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of newly built properties in London are bought by residents who do not have a place in the UK, which increases prices and makes it difficult for buyers who buy the first property to join the company of those who have their own home.

The new policy followed only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a tax reduction to help a larger number of young people get to their first home.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high real estate prices by taking up but not using the country, and called on Mrs. May to give up the quota on affordable properties in order to correct "the shame of the housing situation" in Britain.
Corbyn announced a number of attractive housing reforms, including housing controls and the end of the chain of unresolved investments.
He also wants to give councils greater authority to build new homes.
Mrs. May said: “Last year, I said that I would devote my mandate to restoring the British dream that every new generation’s life should be better.
And that means repairing our failed residential market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build life here.
However, it cannot be true that individuals who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as companies with foreign residence, can easily buy homes as well as valuable British people.
The dream of home ownership has become too far away for a large number of people, and the shame of homelessness is still quite real."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to manage Scotland"
Chief Sunderland Jack Ross says his "final ambition" was one day to become Scotland's manager.
Scotland (42) enjoys the challenge of reinvigorating the northeast club, which currently takes third place in the First League, with three points less than the leading.
This summer he moved to the Light Stadium after last season led St. Mirren again at the Scottish Football Championship.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B cap and that was it," Ross told BBC Scotland.
"But I grew up looking at Scotland in Hampden with my father as a child, and it always dragged me back.
But this opportunity could still be realized only if I was successful in managing the club."
Ross' predecessors at Sunderland's office include Dick Lawyer, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neilla, Roy Keane, Gus Poyette and Paul Di Cania.
Former Chief Alloa Athletica says he didn't feel afraid because he inherited so famous names in such a big club after he had previously declined calls to Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"The success for me at this moment will be measured according to whether I can get this club back to the Premier League.
Because of its structure and content, this club undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get there, but I'd probably consider myself successful only if I could take the club back there."
Ross completes only the third year of his managerial career, after a period during which he was the assistant chief of Dumbarton and 15-month experience as part of Hearts' training staff.
Then he helped Alloi recover from falling into the third category and took St. Mirren from the edge of falling to the winner of the next season's championship.
And Ross says he now feels more comfortable than ever during his toy career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirrena and Hamilton Academy.
"It was probably a real crossroads," recalled Alloe's takeover.
"I really believed that management was what suits me, more than playing.
It sounds unusual because I managed well, worked hard, and enjoyed quite successful moments.
But the game can be tough.
There's a lot of things you have to go through every week.
I'm still going through it in terms of stress and stress, but management seems like the right thing.
I've always wanted to manage, and now I'm doing it. I feel more comfortable in my own skin than I ever felt in my life."

The perfect time for painting is at 17:30 on Saturday, as the research shows
The summer heat wave increased revenues for British pubs who were struggling with finances, but increased pressure on the restaurant launches.
The data show that pubs and bars have made an increase in income in July by 2.7%, but revenues in restaurants have been reduced by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, from the business consulting of the Office of the Chief Controller of Business Books, who collected the data, said: “The continuation of the good time and participation of England in the World Cup that lasted longer than expected, meant that July would be similar to the previous month of June, when public revenues increased by 2.8 percent, with restaurants now being more hit.
The fall of 1.8 percent in restaurant revenues in June only got worse in July.
Pubs and bars where mostly drinking services have been achieved have achieved much greater gains under equal conditions in relation to losses suffered by restaurants.
Pubs where food is served mainly also suffered from heat, although not as dramatic as restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In managed beer and drink bars, sales increased by 6.6 per cent over the month, and food sales dropped by three per cent."
Paul Newman, RSM analyst for vacation and hospitality, said: "These results continue the trend we see since the end of April.
The time and impact of major social or sporting events are still the biggest factors when it comes to sales on the foreign market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to face difficulties, although the drop in sales of 4.8 per cent per annum will be particularly painful due to constant cost pressures.
Long hot summer couldn't come up in time for local leaders serving food, and time will show whether the temperatures we experienced in August would provide the necessary transition."
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, amounted to 2.7% in July, reflecting a slowdown in labour market shares.
The system for monitoring sales in the Coffer Peach Tracker industry for the British pubs, bars and restaurants collects and analyzes data on the efficiency of 47 operational groups, with a total traffic of more than 9 billion pounds, and an industrial reference value has been established.
One of the five children has secret accounts on social networks that hide from their parents
Research reveals that one of the five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, have secret accounts on social networks that hide from their parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of "false Insta" pages
The News Strengthened the Fear of Posting Sexual Content
Twenty percent of students said they have a "main" account showing their parents
One of the five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, open secret accounts on social networks that they hide from adults.
The survey covering 20,000 high school students showed a rapid increase in the number of "false Insta" accounts .
The news increased the fear of the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they use a clean "main" account to show their parents, while at the same time having private accounts.
One mother who came to the secret website of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who encouraged in other words "strengthen me".
The research carried out by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Directors and Directors of Independent Schools (HMC) showed that 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, half of which admit to own private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It is worrying that many teenagers are trying to create online places where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Elid Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" in the Scottish Athletics Committee
Elid Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as a non-executive director at the annual board of directors.
Doyle is the most prominent Scottish athlete, and President Ian Beattie described this move as a great opportunity for those leading sports to take advantage of its wide-ranging international experience over the past decade.
"Eildh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and World Athletic Community and we are sure that athletes in Scotland will benefit greatly by being a member of the committee," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I want to be the voice of athletes and I hope I can really contribute to sport in Scotland."
The American, who won a 200-400-metre game in 1996 in Atlanta, of his total four Olympic gold, and now a regular BBC expert, after a transient ischemic attack, was no longer able to walk.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said it would only be time to show me if I would recover to what extent.
It was hard, but he recovered completely, learned to walk again and today for the sake of agility!
Thank you for your encouraging messages."
Shared views on the internet on advertising for a publisher comparing mothers with cows
The company for producing betrayers by its advertising that mothers who breast-feed their children compare to cows that the husband has aroused shared online opinions.
In order to mark the launch of a product that is claimed to be "the first silent publisher in the world", Elvie announced on consumer technology advertising inspired by an ironic music video to show the freedom that the new publisher gives to mothers.
Four mothers dance in a stable full of shadows and cows with music whose text says, "Yes, husband myself, but you don't see any tail" and "In case you haven't noticed, this isn't a wim, it's my chest."
Then follow the cold: “Expure, pump, feed the baby, pump, pump, husband your ladies. ”
However, advertising, which was published on the company's Facebook site, caused a controversy over the Internet.
With 77,000 reviews and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed viewer reactions, and many say it illuminates the "horrible" dairy industry.
"It is a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their children steal a few days after they were born," wrote one person.
The betrayer Elvie discreetly fits into the breast-feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another comments: “Intellectually traumatic for the mother and the child.
But, yes, why don't you use them to advertise traitors to mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone added: "Fullly wireless advertising."
Others defended the advertising, with one woman confessing that her song was "receiving".
"I think this is a brilliant idea.
If I could still get one, I'd buy one.
The delivery of milk made me feel just like a cow.
The commercial's a little crazy, but I figured it out the way it is.
This is a brilliant product," she said.
Another commented: “This entertainment advertising is directed at mothers who issue milk (often at their workplaces or in their toilets) and feel like ‘the cows’.
This is not advertising that praises or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women discovered that they were all dancing with discreet traitors located in the bra.
The concept of campaign is based on the knowledge that many women who betray milk say they feel like cows.
The traitor Elvie, however, is completely silent, no wire or pipe and discreetly fits into the breast-feeding ring, allowing women to move freely, hold their babies, and even go out during the extradition.
Ana Balarin, partner and executive creative director of Mother’s agency, commented: “Elvie’s publisher is so revolutionary a product that he deserves bold and provocative launch.
By making a parallel between showing women and cows, we wanted to focus on publishing and all its challenges, while at the same time in a fun and understandable way demonstrating the incredible feeling of freedom that the new traitor will bring.
This is not the first time that the traitor Elvie has reached the headlines.
During London’s weekly fashion, the mother of two children appeared on the fashion track for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly transferred to a tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of children detained has increased, although the number of monthly crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because of the severe rhetoric and policies introduced by Trump's administration have made it difficult to accommodate children under sponsorship.
Traditionally, most of the sponsors were themselves immigrants without documents and were afraid to jeopardize their own possibility of remaining in the country by appearing and taking responsibility for the child.
The risk increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to give fingerprints and that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs officer, testified before the congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who applied for sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
The Agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested were previously not recorded in criminal records.
"Almost 80% of individuals who are either sponsors or members of the sponsor's home in the country are illegal, and most of them are criminals.
So we continue our search for those individuals," said Mr. Albence.
According to workers at the shelter, with a view to speeding up the procedure for children, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of detention, not after 60 days, which was earlier a standard.
Many will appear through a videoconferencing call, not personally, in order to bring their case to legal status before the immigration court.
Those who do not meet the eligibility criteria will be quickly deported.
According to workers in shelter and reports that have emerged from the last few months' systems, the longer the children remain in custody, the more likely they will become anxious or depressed, which may lead to violent results or attempts to flee.
Protesters said that these concerns were expressed in larger objects such as Tornillo, where, because of its size, it is very likely that signs of child suffering will be overlooked.
They added that moving children to a tent city without enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say good - bye to friends can cause the trauma that many children are already struggling with.
Syria orders US, French and Turkish "occupational forces" to withdraw immediately
In his address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mouale, he also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the country's war has lasted for eight years.
Moualem, who is also a deputy prime minister, said that the parties of the forces were on the Syrian soil illegally, in the form of a fight against terrorism, and that they would "be treated accordingly".
"They have to withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that "war against terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have died since 2011, while millions have lost their homes.
He said Damascus will continue "fighting in this holy battle until all Syrian territories are cleansed" of terrorist groups and "any illegal presence of foreigners".
The United States has about 2000 troops in Syria, mainly practicing and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arab opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in a war-torn country.
As for refugees, Moualem said that the conditions for their return were met and he blamed "some Western countries" for "spreading irrational fears" that encouraged refugees not to return.
"We have invited the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They politicise what should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no help in rebuilding Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the end of the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a zone buffer in the last major rebel rebellion Idlib created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has prevented a massive attack by the Syrian forces with Russia's support for a province in which three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that the military action would be directed towards the jihadists, including Nusra front fighters associated with Al-Qaeda, "to be used".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes that he will soon convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to form a post-war constitution for Syria and open the way for elections.
Moualem laid down the conditions for the Syrian government to participate in the committee, saying that the work of trust should be limited to "the revision of the members of the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win another mandate
According to that logic, Mr. Trump should win the re-elections in 2020 unless, as many liberal observers are likely to hope, the resurgence and scandal will soon end his presidency.
In what would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic final of the presidency ever!"
There's no sign of the viewer's murder at the moment.
Since 2014, visibility in the impact period has doubled to more than 1.05 million at CNN and has almost tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in time of impact, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has surpassed the audience with even 3.5 million viewers for the evenings of major news.
"It's a fire that attracts people because it's about something we don't understand," said Neal Baer producer of ABC's "Designated Survivor" drama, about a government secretary who becomes president after the attack that destroys Capitol.
Nell Scovell, author of the Comedy and author of the book "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has a different theory.
He remembers driving by taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he'd vote for Mr. Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
He said, "Because we're smiling," Mrs. Scowell told me.
There's a fun value in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, stories coming from Washington can determine the future of the law on the removal of origin from the Roe v. Wade procedure, whether immigrant families can reunite themselves and the health of the global economy.
Exclusion is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
However, you go beyond the level of an informed citizen when you catch yourself looking at a group of experts for six hours discussing how Bob Woodward used the sources of "deep backgrounds" for his book Fair, about Paul Manafort's jacket from the noves of skin worth $15,000 ("the obvious object of full vanity", writes Washington Post) and the implications of intimate descriptions, this, Mr. Trump's anatomy given by Stormy Daniels.
I, for example, Super Maria will never look with the same eyes again.
"Part of what he makes you experience as a reality show is that something feeds you every night," said Brent Montgomery, executive director of the Wheelhouse Entertainment and producer of the show "Zalgaonica", about the rotating actor's performance and the daily complications of Trump's show (fighting with N.F.L., praise Kim Jong-una).
You can't afford to miss an episode because you're gonna stay.
When I arrived at Mr. Fless this week, in front of his house on the northern coast of the island of Kauai, it was sunny at a temperature of 80 degrees (about 27 °C), but he was inside and watching MSNBC and filming CNN at the same time.
He couldn't separate himself from the TV, not while Brett Kavanaugh was face-to-face with the Senate Judicial Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court hung about the end.
"I remember when we were doing all these crazy shows in the past, and people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right."

Outside money goes left in the most uncertain mid-term election race for congress
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania is experiencing a flood of money, thanks to the reorganisation of congressional districts resulting in two candidates in the race for the same place.
This recently refurbished district of Pittsburgh's suburban district highlights Democratic Conor Lamba who won a place last spring in another county in special elections.
Lamb is competing against another current representative, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is becoming much confused with the new 17th district.
The maps were re-drawed after the Supreme Court in Pennsylvania in January decided that the old districts were permanently restricted to the benefit of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district launched a campaign to fund the main party funders, the Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Republican National Congress Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a tight victory in the widely followed special march elections for the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania.
This position has been held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump has won a county with a priority of 20 points.
Political analysts have given little priority to democracies.
The U.S. is worth punishing El Salvador for providing support to China and then withdrawing
The diplomats have noticed that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little resistance to Washington.
In June 2017, Mr. Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varel from Panama and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the management team of the Trump organisation.
State Department officials have decided to invite US heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for "the recent decisions to no longer recognise Taiwan," said spokesperson Heather Nauert.
However, the penalties were considered only against El Salvador, which received estimated US$ 140 million in 2017 for drug control, development and economic support.
The penalties proposed, including the reduction of financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country and high levels of unemployment and homicide.
As internal meetings progressed, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference aimed at security and economic prosperity to continue a similar gathering last year, which was seen as progress in preventing migrants from moving to the United States.
However, by mid-September, senior officials of the administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to be held and that they had actually interrupted any consideration of El Salvador's punishment.
Vice-President Mike Pence should address the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, the diplomats said.
And the three American envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new heavy messages or punishment from Washington.
The spokesperson for the White House, on behalf of Mr Bolton, refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal debates on an anonymous basis.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst near the administration who also wanted to remain anonymous.
History
The next item is the report by Special Investigator Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of the judiciary of Trump, which is now very significant evidence available.
Mr. Mueller, as reported, also focused his investigation on whether Mr. Trump's campaign was secretly agreed with Russia as part of her attack on our elections.
If the majority is changed in Congress, Mr. Trump will face responsibility in that body, just as he is prepared to appear before the electorate again, and perhaps in the end and with his jury level.
There is a lot of these "if" and I do not want to suggest that Mr Truma's inevitable fall is neither those that are similar to him in Europe.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officials were ready to launch a coup against Hitler, only if the West opposed and supported the Czechoslovakian people in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
History revolves around such inflexible points, and an incessant march of democracy is accelerating or late.
Americans are now facing a few of these inflexible points.
What will we do if Mr. Trump fires a deputy state attorney, Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mr. Mueller's fate?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since this paper reported that last year he secretly proposed the filming of the president and suspected his inability to work.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times report is incorrect.
"How will we respond if the recently ordered FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair " or if it has been confirmed to the Supreme Court despite convincing allegations of sexual assault and unfair testimony?"
And above all, will we vote in the mid-term elections for Congress which Mr. Trump will call for responsibility?
If we fall into these tests, democracy will sleep a long winter dream.
But I believe we're not going to fall for the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once sat in my embassy home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and, 60 years later, sent me to light candles for a sabbatical on that table with a chicken cross.
With such an inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans from Rangers optimistic before facing Rapid from Vienna
On Thursday, the Rangers hosted Rapid from Vienna, knowing that they would win over the Austrians, after an impressive show in Spain against Villarrela at the beginning of this month, put them in a strong position to qualify from the Group of the G European League.
The knee injury prevented Graham Dorrans from showing up for the first time in the season until the 2nd season with Villarreola, but he believes that Rangers can use this result as a jumpboard for bigger things.
"It was a good result for us because Villareal is a good opponent," the 31-year-old said.
"We entered the game believing that we could achieve something and we drew a point.
Maybe we could finally steal the game, but, generally speaking, the unresolved result is probably fair.
They were probably better at the first half, but we were better at the second.
There's another big European night on Thursday.
Let's hope we can win three points, but it'll be a tough game because they had a good result in the last game, but with the support of the cheerleader, I'm sure we can attack and achieve a positive result.
Last year was definitely hard, among all that happened to my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now there's a good feeling.
The team is good and the guys really enjoy it; training is good.
Let's hope we can continue now, leave the past season behind and be successful."
Women can't sleep because of fear of retirement savings
Despite the fact that research participants had a clear assumption of what concerns they wanted, few people talked about it to their family members.
About half of the nationwide study respondents said they talked to their husbands about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10% said they talked to their children about it.
"People want family members to take care of them, but they don't take steps to start a conversation," said Holly Snyder, Vice-President of National Life Insurance.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family for care unless you express your wishes in advance.
Work with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how to take care of them, because your choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Include your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you figure out how to pay these costs.
Your choice of long-term care funding can include traditional long-term care insurance, a hybrid life insurance policy with a monetary value that will help you to cover these costs or self-insurance with your own wealth while you have money.
Find your legal documents: Prevent legal battles in the root.
Engage health agents to identify a trusted person who will monitor your medical care and ensure that professionals satisfy your wishes if you cannot communicate.
Also consider giving powers to manage your finances.
You want to select a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure payment of your accounts if you are not in a position.
Do not forget small details: Imagine that your elderly parent is in a situation that requires urgent medical intervention and is on the way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Enter the details in the schedule to be ready.
"It's not just about finances, it's about who the doctors are, too?" asked Martin.
"What are the medications?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Hold that plan by the hand."
A man shot several times from an air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times from the air rifle when he came home after the night out.
The victim, in her 40s, was located in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, belly and arm.
Policemen described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as "a random act".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
His injuries aren't life-threatening, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Tsunami and earthquakes in Indonesia
At least 384 people died in a strong earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Pala on Friday, reported officials, and is expected to increase the number of deaths.
Since the communications were interrupted, the relief officers could not obtain any information from Dongala province, a region north of Palu, which is close to the epicenter of the 7.5-degree earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palau after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palau and Dongali, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Sulawesi, located at the end of the narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379 800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by earthquakes and tsunamis.
She reached a county that extends more than 300 km north-west coast of the island of Sulawesi.
The county, the administrative region below the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the basis of the economy of the province of Sulawesi, especially the coastal region of Dongal.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but mostly concentrated in Morowalia, on the opposite coast of Sulawesia.
Paul and Dongal were hit by tsunami several times over the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency.
In 1938, he killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongali.
Tsunami also hit West Dongal in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Seismic Pacific Fire Circle and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on 26 December caused tsunamis that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of which in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra by the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, along the coast of Sumatra.
2006: 6.8 degrees hit south of Java, the most populated island in Indonesia, causing the tsunamis that hit the southern coast, killing almost 700 people.
2009: The 7.6-degree earthquake hit the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake hit one of the island of Mentawai, near Sumatre, causing tsunamis up to 10 meters that destroyed tens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: Plitki earthquake hit the Pide Jaya region in Aceh, causing destruction and panic because it reminded people of the destruction of the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died as a result of the fall of the building.
2018: Great earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily blocked thousands of tourists.
Sare Palin's oldest son arrested for charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of former governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice-President Sara Palin, was arrested for charges of assault.
Palin (29), from the city of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspicion of family violence, interference with the application of family violence and detention, reports published on Saturday by the state police officer in Alaska.
According to the police report, when the acquaintance tried to call the police to report alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is in Mat-su detention and is held on an unsecured bond of $500, reports KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where on the question of explanation of guilt he explained "innocent, of course," the network reported.
Fuel is charged for three Class A violations, which means you could be in prison for up to a year and punished with a fine of $250,000.
He is also charged with Class B violation, which is punishable by one day of imprisonment and a fine of $2000.
It's not the first time Palina's criminal records have been filed.
In December 2017 he was charged with assault on his father, Todd Palina.
His mother, Sarah Palin, invited the police to report an alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Veteran Court in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with family violence, with disturbing the application of family violence and with possession of weapons in an alcoholised state linked to the incident.
His girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
Sara Palin criticised the Veterans in 2016 after linking her son's violent behavior with the PTSP after his service in Iraq.
tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after the earthquake that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-degree earthquake caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity and communications networks have been broken down, and in the next few days, the number of deaths is expected to rise.
The earthquake hit the immediate vicinity of Central Sulawesi, northeast of the capital of Indonesia Jakarta.
There's video footage on social networks showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palou when the tsunamis hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are looking for a rare death penalty for a terrorist attack suspect in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York are looking for a death penalty for Sayfull Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York, where eight people died -- a rare penalty that has not been committed to a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov (30) reportedly used a truck to rent a shop Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bicycle track along the West Side road in Lower Manhattan, where he broke down the pedestrians and bikers who were on his way in October
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intendedly" killed eight victims and "intendedly" caused serious bodily injury, according to a notice of intention to seek a death penalty, which was submitted in the South District of New York.
Both of these points lead to the possible death penalty, in accordance with the judicial document.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal grand jury Saipova struck a 22-point charge involving eight charges of murder and extortion, which federal prosecutors usually use in cases of organised crime, and charges of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack demanded "significant planning and preconceived," the prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov carried it out as "disgusting, cruel and corrupt".
"Sayful Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelinija, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erly, Hernan Ferruchija, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damiana Pagnucca", the intention was announced.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the South New York County last processed the death penalty case.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was the last in a federal case in New York, 1953, when the couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were killed after they were sentenced to a conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were killed on 19 June 1953 in an electric chair.
According to court documents, Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed a lack of repentance in days and months after the attack.
He told the investigators that he felt good about what he did, the police reported.
Saipov told the authorities that after watching the ISIS video on his phone he was inspired to carry out an attack, he was charged.
He also asked to report the ISIS flag in his hospital room, the police reported.
He made it clear he wasn't guilty of 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "evidently disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek a death penalty, not to accept the confession of guilt for life in prison without the possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team has previously asked the prosecutor not to seek a death penalty.
Conservative Member of Parliament says NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for Brexit's negotiations
Nigel Farage pledged today to "mobilize the National Army" during a protest at the conservative conference.
Former Head of the UK Independence Party said politicians had to "sympathise with the pressure" of the Eurosceptics because one of Parliament's members, Theresa May, suggested that he should be responsible for negotiations with the European Union.
Conservative representative Peter Bone said in Birmingham that by now the United Kingdom had "out" that Mr. Farage was a secretary for Brexit.
But the challenge faced by Mrs. May in calming their deeply divided lines underscores the remnant of thorists joining a special protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to maintain his compromise plan "Checkers" in the midst of the attacks of the Brexit, the EU's remaining ones.
The Allies insisted that it would continue with the attempts to conclude an agreement with Brussels despite the reaction and force Eurosceptics and Laborists to choose between its package and "caustics".
Mr. Bone said on a joint "Leave Means Leave" campaign in Solihulu that he wanted to "reject the Chequers".
He proposed that Mr Farage should be given the title and be responsible for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were in charge, we'd be out by now," he said.
A member of Parliament from Wellingborough added: "I will fight for Brexit, but we must expel Chequers."
In spite of his opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight in world wars to be subordinated.
We want to bring our own laws into our country."
Mr. Bone has rejected the statement that the public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their opinion and that they want to remain completely inaccurate."
The Conservative and Brexitian Andrea Jenkins was also in charge, addressing journalists with the words: “I’m just saying: Prime Minister, listen to people.
The Chequers plan is not popular in the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, is not popular in our stranger and among our activists who were actually those who came out on the streets and chose us.
Please reject the Chequers and start listening."
In a clear message, Mrs. May added: "The prime ministers keep their jobs when they fulfill their promises."
Farage told the gathered that politicians must be forced to "taste pressure" if they are going to fail the decision made at the 2016 referendum.
"It is now about trust between us and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell 'it won't pass you."
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: “I want our political class, which is on the edge of Brexit’s issue, to feel pressure.
We mobilize the national army of this country that gave us the victory in Brexit and we will not settle until we become independent, self-government, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the remaining docks marched through Birmingham before holding a two-way assembly in the city center.
The number of activists has waned with the transparency of "Torians against Brexit" after the launch of this weekend's group.
Laburist Lord Adonis joked at the conservatives about the security problems they faced with the party's application during the opening of the conference.
"It is people who tell us that they can have IT systems and all the technology for the Canada Plus Plan, for the smooth state of the border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"That's all a farce.
There's no good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to "consider seriously" to run for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said he would "really consider running for president" after the cold election.
Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future on Saturday at a direct association with citizens in Western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for a scholarship in November 2016 against Republican Geoffa Diehl, who was the vice president of the Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
It has been in the centre of speculation for some time now to be able to resist the Trump in 2020.
A meeting Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with the citizens since Trump took over duty.
The participant asked her if she was planning to run for the president.
Warren replied that it's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, which means a woman on the forehead."
Arrested for the murder of LSU Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced on Saturday that she arrested a suspect in a shooting with a fatal outcome of the State University basketball in Louisiana (LSU) Wayde Sims that took place on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police published information on the arrest of Dieteon Simpson (20), at 11 a.m., at an ET press conference.
They released a murder video Friday, asking for help in identifying the man from the footage.
Sims (20) was killed early Friday near the University of Southern campus.
"Wayde Sims won a bullet wound in his head and eventually died as a result," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday at 247 sports.
Wayde got involved to defend his friend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being at a crime scene and owned a gun and killed Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without an incident and taken to a county police station in East Baton Rouge.
Sims, a third-year student who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games in the first 10 positions last season and on average 17.4 minutes and made 5.6 points and 2.9 jumps per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the title of the world champion after the order assures him of victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment that Valteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the team's order would "play a great role in the race".
From the start position, Bottas had a good start and almost left Hamilton behind while defending his position in the first two circles and calling on Vettel to attack his team.
Vettel first went to the boxing and left Hamilton on the market at the start, something that had to be decisive.
Mercedes entered the box one round later and went out behind the Wettel, but Hamilton went forward after the action of the wheel on the wheel which caused the Ferrari driver to leave the free interior in danger of delaying after a double move in defence of the third guilt.
Max Verstappen left last row and was the seventh to the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
Then he ran a large part of the race as he gave up his tires to reach a quick finish and ran Kimie Raikkonen for the fourth place.
He finally got into the boxing in the 44th round, but failed to speed up his pace in the remaining eight rounds while Raikkonen took fourth place.
The day was hard because Valtery had been doing a fantastic job all weekend and the real gentleman let me pass.
The team did a really great job to achieve a formation finish," Hamilton said.
It was a very bad speech of the body
President Donald Trump laughed at Senator Diana Feinstein's meeting on Saturday because of her insistence that she did not release Christine Blasey Ford's letter in which she accuses a candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
Turning to a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly take Ford's testimony before the Senate Justice Committee, but commented that what happened in the Senate showed that people were "bad and ugly and dishonest".
"The only thing that can happen and the nice thing that has happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and angry, mean and dishonest," he said.
"When you look at publishing and leaking information in the public, and then they say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Diana Feinstein, did you drop the information?
Remember her answer... did you leave the document to the public?
Oh, no.
I'm not.'
Wait a minute.
Did we let... no, we didn't," he added imitating the senator.
Senator Feinstein was sent in July with a letter detailing Ford's instructions against Kavanaugh, and it leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein demented that information came from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's instructions, I didn't let her story go public," Feinstein told the board, reports The Hill.
"She asked me to keep her in secret and I kept her in secret, what she was looking for."
However, her denial did not come to the president’s approval, who said on Saturday evening: “Let me tell you something — it was a very bad speech by the body.
Maybe it's not, but I've never seen a worse body speech in my life."
Continuing his defence of the candidate for the Supreme Court, which three women were accused of sexual abuse, the president suggested that democracy use these charges for its own purposes.
"They are determined to return power at any price.
You see, wickedness, filth, no interest in who they'll hurt, who they'll have to beat to get to power and control," the president said.
Elite league: Dundee Stars 5 3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars were paid off to defeat Belfast Giants in the Elite League on Friday by winning in Dundee on Saturday with a result of 5 1⁄2 3.
In the early minutes, the giants took advantage of two naked hits by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvilleer.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought home to equality, and then Dwyer brought the Giants back into the leadership.
Francois Bouchard evened for Dundee before two naked Lucas Lundvald Nielsen secured a victory.
It was the third defeat in the Elite League season for Adam Keefe's team, who came from the background and won Dundee with the result of 2 1⁄2 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth season meeting of two teams, and the Giants won the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening game arrived in the fourth minute, exactly at 3:35, with Kendall McFaull's assistance, with David Rutherford's assistance to double the lead by meeting Beauvilier four minutes later.
In the immediate opening of the game, Sullivan returned home team to the game at 13:10 minutes before Matt Marquardt allowed Cownie's equation at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants completed the first third with leadership when he gave his second goal that night at the end of the first third.
The natives regrouped and Bouchard once again led them to equation in measuring force naked at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran together helped Nielsen to lead Dundee first at the end of the second third, and he took care of the victory when his team had already been half way to win in the last third of the game.
Giants, who lost four of the last five games, hostess from Milton Keynes in the next match on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies to ensure that hundreds of passengers in the aircraft avoid earthquakes
The air traffic controller in Indonesia was declared a hero after he died while securing safe flying flights with hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people died, and many water disappear after a great earthquake that hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday and caused tsunamis.
Strong earthquakes continue to strike the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palau.
However, despite his colleagues fleeing to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonio Gunavan Agg refused to leave his job in the control tower of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport, which was drifting heavily.
It was left to ensure the safe flight of the Batik Air aircraft on flight number 6321, which was then on the runway.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought he was falling apart.
He went to the hospital later.
Yohannes Sirat, spokesperson for Air Navigation Indonesia, said his decision might have saved hundreds of lives, reports Australian ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to transfer him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter got to Palu.
"Our hearts are broken because of it," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities are afraid that the number of dead could reach thousands, and the state disaster relief agency says that access to the cities of Dongali, Sigia and Boutong is limited.
"It is believed that the number of deaths continues to increase, as many bodies are still under the ruins, and many could not even be reached," Sotopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency's spokesman, said.
The waves that reached the height and up to six meters broke Paul in which a mass burial would be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring help and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "She drove emergency aid every minute of the body's import.
The government is depleting clean water.
There's little shops all over the place."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is running to help its survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it could get a lot worse."
Indonesian President Yoko Widodo traveled to Paul on Sunday and told the country’s army: “Please all of you work day and night to complete all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" reports CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Flying in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says that one man runs like a missing man after an airplane crash in the lagoon
The aircraft company that owns the aircraft that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now claims that one man runs as missing, after it has been said earlier that all 47 passengers and crew members are safely evacuated from the aircraft he has ton.
In his statement, Air Niugini said that from Saturday afternoon I cannot follow one of the passengers.
The airline reported that they cooperated with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in an attempt to find the person concerned.
The air carrier did not respond immediately to requests for additional information on the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local ships helped save the rest of the passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
On Friday, officials said seven people were transferred to the hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers were detained in the hospital on Saturday, and that they were all in stable condition.
Which led to a fall and the exact outcome of the events remained unknown.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in a lagoon near the runway.
Some fathers thought the plane was missing the runway.
Bill Jaynes, a passenger from America, said the plane was flying very low.
"That's very good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and the others managed to get through the water that cut them to the point of exit in the event of the danger of the planes that he was sinking.
He said the stewards panicked and yelled, and he suffered less head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors working near the port repair also helped to save using a boat to breathe people to land before the aircraft sank into about 30 meters of water.
Data from the Air Safety Network indicate that in the accidents of air carriers registered in PNG in the last two decades, 111 people have died, but neither Air Niugini has been included in any of them.
Analyst exhibits a time review of the night when a woman is burned alive
The prosecution concluded a case on Saturday in the retrial of a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Ministry of Justice, witnessed for hours as an expert in intelligence data analysis.
The jury described how he used cell phone data to put together a puzzle about the movement of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victims, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said that he got location data from several phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night she was killed, which is contrary to his previous claims, transmits The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was in the same location as Chambersin at the time he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to question Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he "had a lie, because his truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he met Chambers about two weeks before her death.
The cell data indicated that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that Tellis, some time after Chamber's death, deleted her messages, phone calls and contact information.
"He erased it from his life," Hale said.
The defense should start the final word on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be sent to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What's the enlightened hip-hop?
Hip-hop trio wants to cause a negative attitude toward the genre by filling his music with positive messages.
The song group "The High Breed" from Bristol claims that hip-hop music has distanced itself from its beginnings filled with political messages and by looking at social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make hip-hop again popular.
Artists like Fugees and Commons are reborn in Great Britain through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black woman?
The New York Grandfather sues a couple for dismissal after a "racist" message
The New York nanny sues a couple for discriminatory dismissal after having received a misdirected message from a mother in which she is called "one more black".
A couple deny that they are racists, comparing the charge to "suffering".
Lynsey Plasco-Faxman, the mother of two children, expressed dissatisfaction when she found out after her first working day in 2016 that she was the new babysitter of her children, Giselle Maurice, a black woman.
"No. Another black woman," Mrs. Plasco-Faxman wrote in her wife's message.
However, instead of sending her to her wife, she sent her to Ms. Maurice twice.
After she realized her mistake, Mrs. Plasco-Faxman found herself in an "accident" situation, and fired Mrs. Maurice, because, she claims, because their former nanny, who was an African American, had been doing her job badly, and that instead of expecting her, she was carrying New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice got paid for one day's work, and then she went home.
Now Maurice is suing a couple for a notice fee and asking for a reward of $350 per day for a period of six months for which she was initially engaged, even without a contract.
"I want to show them that I can't do such things," she told Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
A couple replied that they were racists, saying that the end of Mauritian employment was reasonable, because of the fear that she would not be able to believe because of the insults later.
"My wife didn't mean what she sent in her message.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist," said Joel Plasco's husband to Post.
"Would you trust your children in the person you were rude to, even if it was a mistake?
Your baby?
Come on."
Plasco said his wife had only two months of maternity leave after her child was born and that she was in a "very difficult situation".
"You'll sue someone who's in such a situation
"That's not very nice," the investment bank added.
Although the trial is still ongoing, the court of public opinion quickly condemned a couple on social networks, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington's publishers were afraid that readers would not confess to a bear who spoke, revealed in a new letter
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, says in a letter: “It’s hard to put someone in the skin of someone who will read the book for the first time before the publication.
It's very fun what we now know about Paddington's huge success."
By saying that her father, who worked as a BBC recorder before the little spitted bear inspired him to write his children's book, was optimistic when his work was rejected, added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book was filled with happiness and sorrow after his death last year.
About Paddington, described as "very important family member", she added that her father was quietly proud of his final success.
"He was quite these men and he wasn't a braggart," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, everything was like someone reaching his own child: you're proud of him even though none of this is really your job.
I think Paddington's success was watching it that way.
Although it was his work and his imagination, he always attributed credit to Paddington alone."
My daughter died and we had to say goodbye on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was urgently transferred to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors were vainly trying to save her life.
"The hope has been regularly called to say that it is really bad and that they believe it won't get away," said Ednan-Laperous.
"Then Nad invited me to tell me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
What did I do?
I said: “Tashi, honey, I love you so much.
I'll join you soon.
I'll join you.
The medications that doctors gave her to maintain heart work slowly lost effect and left her body system.
She died a little while before boarding and then everything went off.
I just had to sit down and wait knowing what was going to happen.
I couldn't scream, scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to keep everything in me."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperous, who was already in mourning for the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane along with the other passengers - who were not aware of the experiences she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I put my head down, and my tears all the time slipped down my face.
It's hard to explain, but on the flight I felt a strong sense of compassion for Nada.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Women's messages in mourning on a bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who have lost loved ones for suicide work to prevent others from doing the same.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys put cards on the big bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Tyler, Mrs. Davis' son, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression, and at the age of 18, he committed suicide.
"I don't want no parent to feel what I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis (45), who lives in Lydney, said that her son was a cook with a contagious smile waiting for the shine of her career.
"Everyone remembered him for his smile.
They always said that his smile could fill every room with joy."
However, before his death, he left his job because he was in "a really dark state".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, then 11 years old, found his brother after he took his life.
Mrs Davis said, "I constantly worry that this will have a negative effect."
Mrs. Davis came up with the idea of cards “how would people know there was someone you could go and talk to, even if she was a friend?
Don't sit still. You need to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, Mrs. Davies' long-term friend, lost Mark, her partner with whom she was 15 years old, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say he felt sad, depressed or anything like that," he said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He was at the bottom of Christmas when the children opened the presents, he didn't look them in the eye, nor did he want anything else."
She said that his death was a major trauma to them, but that they had to cope with it: “It all leaves a big hole in the family.
He's leaving us.
But we will continue and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh depends on the end while the FBI starts the investigation
"I thought we might be able to enter a little unity if we really managed to get something like what he was looking for," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee would "disappear" in the midst of the rooted party blockade.
Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their unrest was fueled by the choice of the moment.
The mid-term elections arrive in just five weeks, November 6th, if, as expected, Republicans do not pass well, then they will be seriously weakened in attempts to bring the desired man to the highest court election in the country.
George W. Bush keeps calling the senators, lobbying them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI makes his report?
They will vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would enable Mike Pence, the vice president, to break his decision-making vote and confirm his seat in the Supreme Court.
Number of escapes from North Korea 'fall' under Kim's leadership
The number of refugees from North Korea fell after Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, the South Korean legislator said.
Calling for information from the U.S. ministry, Park Byeong-seug said that last year there were 1127 refugees in comparison to 2706 during 2011.
Mr. Park said that the key factors are more stringent controls at the border crossing between North Korea and China and more charges that smugglers charge people.
Pyongyang didn't comment publicly.
A large majority of North Korean refugees eventually gained South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most run across China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the highly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China sees refugees as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often returns them violently.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have significantly improved over the last few months.
Earlier this month, leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang at talks that focused on ongoing negotiations on denuclearisation.
This was followed by a historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in a broad sense to work to free the Korean peninsula from nuclear weapons.
However, on Saturday, Ri Yong-ho, North Korean Foreign Minister, blamed the US sanctions for not making any progress ever since.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and it will not be taken into account that we are first disarmed under such circumstances," Mr. Ri said in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical", says he is unable to serve at the Supreme Court
The leader of the opposition, Nancy Pelosi, called the judge of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical", and said that because of his temperament, he was unable to serve at the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented on a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't think of a woman, if she ever acted that way, as a "hysterical"," Pelosi described her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally demutated the claim that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During the opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, occasionally almost shouting and suffocating as he discussed his family and high school years.
He also strongly condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling charges against him by "grossful and coordinated turning" that they organised to free the angry that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said he believed that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not participate in the work of the Supreme Court, because he showed that he had prejudiced against the Democrats.
"I think he is disqualifying himself with such statements and the way he attacks Mrs Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
The question is whether he will try to revoke the Kavanaugha if it is confirmed, and if the democracy gets most of it in the House of Representatives, Pelosi has come down.
"I'll tell you next if he doesn't tell Congress or the FBI the truth, then he's not only capable of being in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he is now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Federal Court of Appeal in the District of Colombia.
Pelosi added that as a democrat, she was concerned about the potential Kavanaugh decisions against the Act on Accessary Care or the Law on the Disposal of Origins from Roe's Procedure against Wade, because she is considered a conservative judge.
In his hearings for confirmation, Kavanaugh ignored questions about whether he would change some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
"It is not the time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, 'Isn't that wonderful?'," Pelosi said.
Women have to deal with it.
Reasoned criticism, anger that has accumulated for months and years, all of this cannot be solved without pay.
"We cry when we get angry," Mrs. Steine told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual.
She continues: “She helped me a lot when she was an executive director and said that she was crying when she got angry, but she developed the technique that when she got angry and started to cry, the person she was talking to said: ‘ Maybe I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she went on.
And I thought it was great."
Tears are allowed as a way out of anger, partly because they are basically misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories of one of the first jobs, in the office where men dominated, is how, on one occasion when I was crying because of unspoken anger, an older woman who was a cold manager who was always a little scared, dragged me to the stairs.
"Don't ever let them see you crying," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad, so they'll be happy because they think they've hit you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic Congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an out-of-court affair on the Monkey Business ship and retired from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, concluded that there was no reason why she would not consider running for the president.
"That wasn't a well-designed decision," she told me through the laugh 30 years later.
"There were already seven candidates in the race and they certainly didn't need another one.
Someone called them "Snow and seven puppies".
Since the campaign had already slowed down, she was late for the fundraising, and she said she wouldn't be in the race if she hadn't collected $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who gave her $1,000 to men, gave her only $250.
"Do they think I have a discount?" she wondered.
While she was saying that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was so obsessed with emotion . . . gratitude for the people who supported her, frustration over the system that made it difficult to raise money and target voters instead of delegates . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
"You would think I had a nervous breakdown," recalled Mrs. Schroeder's reaction to the media.
"You'd think Kleinex was my corporate sponsor."
I remember thinking about what they'd put on my tombstone.
"She cried."
How a trade war between the United States and China can be good for Beijing
The beginning of a trade war between the United States and China was loud and, while the battle is far from over, the gap between countries can be from the use of Beijing in the long term, experts say.
Donald Trump, U.S. President, issued the first warning earlier this year, condemning key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation this week has emerged with new customs duties that have affected products worth $200 billion (150 billion pounds), effectively reducing half of all goods coming to the United States of China.
Beijing has returned in some way each time, and recently a five to ten percent customs duty was imposed on $60 billion of U.S. goods.
China has promised that the US will respond to the impact, and the second largest world economy will certainly not surrender soon.
The withdrawal of Washington could be achieved by a waiver of the demands, but public obedience to the United States would be too uncomfortable for Xi Jinping, President of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressure of the US trade war can provide positive support to China in the long term by reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for the launch of economic overcrowding in both countries is actually much more dangerous than observers believed," said Abigail Grace, a scientific think-tanker who focused on Asia in the Centre for New American Security.
Syria is "ready" to return refugees," Foreign Minister says
Syria says it is ready for a voluntary return of refugees and appeals for help in rebuilding the country that has destroyed a war that lasts more than seven years.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country are improving.
"Today the situation in the field is more stable and secure, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorist attacks in order to establish a normal situation.
Now all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that were focused on their daily life and existence have been met.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the 2011 war.
Six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or help from countries sponsoring the rebellion.

"I don't usually cry, but today I can't stop tears.
It's been a tough year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy I won the cup again.
I'm happy to be able to help," said Garcia, full of emotion after a European victory.
He's handing over his nephew John Rama, who won a legendary American golfer, Tiger Woods, 2+1 in a single game on Sunday.
"I feel incredible pride over the victory over Tiger Woods; I grew up watching him play," 23-year-old Rahm said.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a 13-21-3 record in Ryder Cup.

The U.S. team has been fighting all weekend to find a way out, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who have been playing top golf during the entire tournament.
After the disappointing performance of his team, US captain Jim Furyk said: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought."
At certain times, we have provided resistance to Europe.
We didn't make it.
I'm taking off Thomas' hat.
He's an excellent captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're gonna get ahead of ourselves, I'm gonna work with PGA America and our Ryder Cup Board, so we're gonna move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to take off the hat of the people.
We're on the rise."
