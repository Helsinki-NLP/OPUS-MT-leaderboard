Members of the Wells Assembly don't want to "come on maps"
Among some members of the National Assembly is the discontent with the proposal to adopt an abbreviation of the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, member of the Wells Parliament).
The problematic solution is to change the name of the Assembly to Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Assembly from different political parties are concerned about possible jokes about this abbreviation.
One of the Leborists expressed concern that the new abbreviation “refuses Twp and Pwp”.
For our readers not from Wales: in the Wallian twp it means "tupica", and in the pwp it means "cuckoo".
According to a member of the Wells Party, his organization as a whole remained “satisfied” and offered other options.
The representatives of the Conservative Party “do not object” to the new abbreviation, but note that MWP is close to writing to Muppet (map).
In this context, the letter w in Valais is spoken approximately as the letter u in the Yorkshire dialect of English.
The Committee of the Assembly, currently drafting a bill for a change of name, made the following statement: “The final decision on how to be appointed members of the Assembly will certainly remain behind them”.
The Wells Management Act 2017 authorizes the National Assembly of Wales to change its name.
In June, the Committee published the results of the public opinion poll on the proposed options that the Parliament of Wales instead of the Assembly found broad support among the local population.
With regard to the appointment of members of the Assembly, the Committee preferred the option “Members of Parliament of Wales” (Welsh Parliament Members, or WMP), while MWP had received the largest public support.
It is clear that the members of the Assembly are proposing other options, but the chairman, Elina Jones, will find it difficult to find a solution that will be able to establish all decisions, bearing in mind that the draft law on amendments should be submitted a few weeks later.
Reform laws would also include other modifications to the working process of the Assembly, including new rules on the disqualification of members of the Assembly and the system of the Committee.
Members of the Assembly voted in favour of the final version of their appointment during the legislative debate.
Macedonians voted in the referendum on changing the name of their country
On Sunday, Macedonians declared their country to be “North Macedonia”.
The international vote is intended to resolve a multi-year dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its province of Macedonia.
The Government of Greece has long insisted that the name “Republic of Macedonia” implies territorial claims to the Greek province, and has repeatedly opposed the entry of its northern neighbours into the Euro Union and NATO.
Macedonian President George Ivanov, opponent of the referendum on change of name, said that he was not going to recognize the results.
However, the supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, note that changing the country's name is the most recent price of EU and NATO accession.
The Harlem Crisis: Always Silenced St. Martin's Circle
“The elders of the area with which I was associated said that before each corner there was a bar and a church,” says Adams.
"There is no other than this."
The disappearance of bars can still be understood as follows:
The format of communication has changed.
“Bar has ceased to be a kind of guest of the entire area where they came regularly.”
But with regard to churches, there is concern that the funds received from the sale of assets will not be enough for their leaders to trust them.
At the church site, he added, there would be a multi-quartered house whose residents would hardly support those who remained in the area.
“Most of the buyers of these apartments will be white,” says Adams. “And this will be about the day when such churches will be finally closed, because new neighbors will never become members of them.”
Both churches were built by white congregations even before Harlem became a black area: the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin’s Church 10 years later.
The first members of the Methodist Church left the income in the 1930s last century.
Their building was purchased by the black people in the neighbourhood.
When St. Martin's church went into the hands of a black community, it was headed by the so-called John Howard Johnson, who organized a bunch of shops on 125th Street, the main trade artery of Harlem, where they refused to take up work or raise in the service of the black people.
In 1939, as a result of the fire, the building suffered significant damage, and during the restoration work, Father Johnson was ordered to install a carilon.
The beloved David Johnson, the son of Johnson’s father, who changed him into the head of St. Martin’s church, proudly called the Carolon “the Colocols for the Poor. ”
But the expert who tested the carilon in July called it a “cultural heritage” and a “unique historical instrument”.
An expert at the University of Michigan Tiffany Ng also noted that St. Martin's carilion was the first instrument in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionysius A. Lind. 18 years ago he was invited to play at the largest carilion in the Riverside Church.
According to Merrieuezer, St. Martin's church has not yet been replaced.
In the last few months around St. Martin’s Church, a difficult situation arose with architects and contractors, some of whom were invited by the world’s leaders, others by the Episcopal Church.
The assembly of delegates, the governing body of the coming of world leaders, in July, addressed the parish, expressing concern that the parish “trying to transfer the value of work” to the assembly of the delegates, although the latter had no relation to the choice of architects and contractors sent by the parish.
Some of the descendants expressed dissatisfaction with the lack of transparency on the part of the eparchy.
In California, the shark injured a 13-year-old lunatic who was manufacturing lobsters
According to official sources, on Saturday, the first day of the lobbying season, a 13-year-old in California was attacked by a shark and injured.
The attack took place about 7 a.m. near Bikon Beach Beach in Ensinitas.
As Chad Hammel said in an interview with KSWB-TV (San Diego), on Saturday morning, he snored with his friends and about half an hour later heard the boy screaming for help.
According to Hammela, he first decided that the boy was very happy with the Lobster’s name, but he quickly realized that he was shouting, “I have been bitten!
I've been tasted!"
After swimming to a dive, Hammel noticed that “he had completely destroyed the skin around the key”.
“I called out to get everyone out of the water, saying, ‘Here is the shark!’” Hammel said.
The boy was delivered by helicopter to the Redi Hospital, San Diego, and his condition was assessed as critical.
The species of shark that attacked a teenager is unknown.
Captain Larry Giles reported that a few weeks ago, a shark had been spotted in the area, but it was not considered dangerous.
Giles also added that the attack victim was injured in the upper part of the tunnel.
The authorities closed the area from the Ponto Beach in Casablanca to the Swami Beach in Ensinitas for 48 hours to conduct an investigation and to ensure the safety of the population.
Giles noted that there were 135 shark species in the area, but most of them were not considered dangerous.
Sinesbury plans to submit to the British perfume and cosmetic market
Seinsbury is going to set up cosmetic and perfume divisions in Butts, Superdrag and Debenhams stores with cosmetic consultants, on the model of luxury universities.
The British perfume and cosmetic market is estimated at 2.8 billion pounds of sterling and continues to expand, while fashion and household goods are falling. To capture the large share of this desired market as an experiment in 11 shops across the country, space spaces for cosmetics and perfumes will be presented and should be expected in many other shops next year.
Supermarket owners are looking for more than just filling the pools previously under television, microwave ovens, household goods, and investments in the perfume and cosmetic market are a good solution.
According to the representatives of Sansbury, the dual range of cosmetic products is planned to increase to 3,000 names, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing range of L'Oreal, Maybellline and Burt's Bees will be presented to a greater extent, in specially designated places, according to the type of organization of goods in Butts stores.
In addition, the company line of the Shop of Cosmetics products will be reorganized with the transition to vegane products to meet the demands of young buyers.
The two Seinsbury shops will be presented by Fragrance Shop’s perfumery producers: the first one has already opened in Croydon South London last week, and the second one is expected to open in Sally Oak, Birmingham this year.
Internet commerce and the tendency to buy a small amount of products per day in small beds near the home have forced supermarkets to attract buyers in other ways.
Mike Cooper, President of Seinsbury, says that tickets are gradually becoming a university, and the network of its supermarkets is fighting for buyers in a competitive fight against cheap shops, such as Aldi and Lidl, offering more services and non-food.
Hundreds of Sansbury supermarkets are located in Argos, and some of them can now be found at Habitats since the network acquired both brands two years ago, which has led to the increase in food sales and the cost of these acquisitions.
The past attempts by the supermarket to give a new life to their cosmetic and pharmaceutical divisions have not been successful.
In the early 2000s, a joint venture was organized between Seinsbury and Butts, but further disagreements arose between the parties on the income section from the sale of pharmaceuticals in supermarkets.
The new strategy was developed after the sale of the pharmaceutical business of Seinsbury (a total of 281 stores) by Selesio, owner of the Lloyds Farmasi network, for 125 million pounds of sterling three years earlier.
Lloyds is expected to support the plan by adding a wide range of luxury care facilities for La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hex, commercial director of Seinsbury, says: “We have completely transformed the appearance and atmosphere of our perfume and cosmetics divisions to create a more favourable environment for our customers.
We have also invited trained consultants, who will always be ready to help by the Council.
Our range of brands for any taste, pleasant design and comfortable location of shops will attract many visitors in the search for cosmetics and perfumes. This will be a completely new concept of the origin of shops.”
Peter Jones "whispered" responded to Holly Willowby's exit from a deal of 11 million pounds of sterling
The star show "The Dragon League" Peter Jones "deranged" by the TV show Holly Willowby from a deal of 11 million pounds of sterling, which she intended to conclude with Peter's Lifestyle Brand, but instead preferred new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willowby doesn't have time for their joint brand of Truly homewear and accessories.
This couple's business was compared to Goop's actress Gunet Peltrow.
The 37-year-old Etim morning lead programme announced its decision in Instagram.
Holly Willowby's decision to leave their profitable lifestyle brand to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV led to Peter Jones' anger, the Dragon League star.
According to our sources, Jones was “disturbed” when the television viewers’ favorites at a busy meeting held in his business headquarters in Marlowa, Bakingamshire, on Tuesday, admitted that after concluding new contracts worth up to 1.5 million, there would not be enough time for their common brand of household clothing and accessories True.
Their brand was compared to that of an actress named Guinet Peltrou by Goop, and it was expected that her sales would double the Willowi status, estimated at 11 million pounds of sterling.
The 37-year-old leader announced his departure to Instagram, but Jones left Britain on a private plane in the direction of one of his villas.
According to one source, “Truly’s brand was Holly’s top priority.
It was a long-term investment that would ensure that she had been unemployed for the next few decades.
Its decision led to all parties to the transaction.
They were all beaten up on Tuesday, as the weeks before the brand was launched were considered.
In Marlowa headquarters, there was an entire warehouse filled with goods ready for sale.”
Experts believe that the care of the leading Etim morning, one of Britain's most popular stars, can cover the company in millions of pounds of sterling because of significant investments in goods: from pillows and candles to clothing, as well as the potential delay in starting the line.
Furthermore, it is the breakup of old friendships.
The raising three Willowby children and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been friends with Jones and his wife, Taroy Kapp, for 10 years.
Willowby created Truly's brand together with Tara Kapp in 2016, and Tara's husband, 52-year-old Peter Jones, led the company in March.
Both couples are often on vacation together, and Johns also owns 40% of Dan Baldwin's television company.
Willowby will become an M&S ambassador and replace Anthony McPartlin as the leading ITV broadcast “I’m Famous”.
A source from the nearby Johns neighborhood said last night, "We can't comment on his business."
Complex negotiations, "and then we're in love with each other"
He was concerned about the criticism of the media due to the “undeserved president” comment and positive assessment of North Korea's leader.
Why did President Trump give up so many claims?
He said, "Tramp, assembling the leading news vote."
“I didn’t give up on anything.”
He noted that Kim Chen Yn was interested in the re-meeting, after Trump called their first summit in Singapore in June, a significant step towards reducing nuclear weapons stocks in North Korea.
But the negotiations on denuclearization have come to an end.
Three months after the June summit in Singapore, the high-ranking North Korean diplomat Li Yon Ho made a statement to the world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea was still awaiting “responsive actions” from the United States following the initial disarmament measures of the CNDR.
Instead, the U.S. diplomat noted that sanctions continue to be used as a pressure stream.
During the meeting of his supporters, President Trump expressed a much more optimistic assessment.
He said, “The affairs of North Korea are very interesting.”
“We were at the edge of the North Korean war.
Millions of people could have been killed.
And now we have a wonderful relationship."
According to Trampa, his efforts to establish relations with Kim Chen Yin brought fruit: he was put to the test, hostages were released, and the remaining U.S. soldiers also returned to their homeland.
Speaking about his relationship with Kim Chen Yin, Tramp stressed that his unusual approach to diplomacy was nothing strange.
“To be nice to the president is so simple, but then instead of 10,000 people on the street who are going to this completely killed room, there would be only 200 people here,” said Trump, pointing to the crowd that had gathered before him.
Tuna and earthquake in Indonesia: Disaster destruction recorded, victims estimated by hundreds
The first days after the earthquake that hit Lombok, foreign NGOs said that they did not need assistance.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population of Lomboka had been left to cover their heads, the Government did not consider it necessary to declare the national natural disaster, which was a prerequisite for international assistance.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they made it clear that international support was not needed, so it was not easy,” says Selina Sambung.
The Children's Rescue Organization is preparing a mission to Palau, but we still do not know if a foreign group will be able to work on the spot.
According to Mr. Sotopo, official representative of the National Office for the Elimination of Natural Disasters, Indonesia ' s management conducted an assessment of the situation in Palau in order to determine whether international organizations should be involved.
In view of the continuing seismic instability in Indonesia, the country continues to be badly prepared for natural disasters.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceha, they can rarely be found on other shorelines.
Despite the warning of the threat of tsunamis, there was no siren in Palau to warn the population, which probably led to so many casualties.
Transport communication between many Indonesian islands is quite problematic even in good weather.
Storms make logistics even more difficult.
A navigational hospital previously used in Lombok to assist the victims of the earthquake is sent to Pala, but the road to a new disaster will take at least three days.
President Joco Vidodo strengthened Indonesia ' s rolling infrastructure by the main item of his pre-election campaign and spent countless funds to improve roads and railways.
However, President Joco's administration, which was moving on for a new term next year, was in the process of financing.
The President also criticised the deepening of interfaith enmity between the conservative Muslim majority of Indonesia and the rest of the population.
More than a thousand people were killed, and tens of thousands of others were killed as a result of clashes between Christians and Muslims, armed machetes, archers and other self - gunners.

The number of Indonesian tsunami victims increased to 832
The number of earthquake victims followed by tsunamis in Indonesia reached 832, reported the National Management for Natural Disasters on Sunday morning.
According to reports, under the ruins of buildings destroyed by an earthquake of 7.5 balloons on the Richter scale, a number of people remain. The earthquake occurred on Friday and triggered tsunamis up to 6 metres high, reported Sotopo Purvo Nugroho, official representative of the Office during the press conference.
The city of Palu, with its population of over 380 thousand, was surrounded by the ruins of ruined houses.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of having a fatal stab wound to a woman
This morning a woman's body was found in Birkenheid County, Merciside, and a murder investigation is being conducted.
A 44-year-old female with knee wounds was found at 7:55 in a Grayson Mouse complex on John Street, suspected of murdering a 32-year-old man.
The police are looking for possible witnesses to the murder of locals.
The Inspector of the O'Heagen Criminal Police says: “The investigation is at an early stage, but I am sure that I have asked all those in the John Street area in Birkenheid who could observe or hear anything suspicious to contact us.
I am also addressing all, especially the taxi drivers, who could print something on the video recorder, please contact us with any information that can help the investigation.”
The official representative of the police confirmed that the killer had lived in Birkenheid and her body had been found on the territory of the complex.
Today, well-known victims have arrived at the scene to ask their questions about where they were found this morning.
The investigation is under way and the police are prepared to report on the tragedy of the nearest relatives of the victim.
A taxi driver living in the Grayson Mouse complex tried to get into his apartment, but the police told him that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
When he found out what had happened, he lost his gift of speech.
The householders were told that they would not be able to stay home for at least a few hours.
One of the policemen told the resident that the entire territory was considered a crime scene.
One woman cried.
"What a terrible thing!" she said.
Two police buses arrived at the scene at 2 p.m. and another one remained outside the fenced area.
Several policemen were put inside the fence to watch the apartment complex.
Everyone who has any information is requested to send a personal message to @MerPolCC on Twitter, call 101 or call Crimestoppers anonymously on the phone 0800 555 111 (Case 247 of 30 September).
The monument to Cromwell before Parliament's building sparked a heated debate on “historic rewriting”
Cromwell's expulsion would be a reward for the barbaric destruction of many of England's cultural and religious artifacts by his followers, Puritan fanatics.
However, the Cromwell Memorial Society called Mr. Crick’s proposal “successful” and “an attempt to rewrite history”.
John Goldsmith, President of the Cromwell Memorial Society, said: “The issue of the statue of Oliver Cromwell to the Westminster Palace has inevitably arisen as part of the ongoing debate on the resonance of historical monuments.
Cromwell had nothing to do with the economic movement during the English civil war.
Oliver Cromwell is probably suffering from the sins of his ancestors, Thomas, who lived centuries ago.
The magnificent statue of the authorship of Sir William Hamo Thornichrod reflects the views of his contemporaries in the 19th century and the historical achievements of man, which many still consider to be worthy of respect.
In an interview with The Sunday Telegraph John Goldsmith, he said: “Many people, especially at the end of the 19th century, considered Cromwell to be Parliament’s protector against external pressure, in his case, monarchy.
Whether such an opinion can be considered historically accurate remains the subject of expert debates.
But we can be sure that the conflict that occurred in the middle of the 17th century had an impact on our country ' s subsequent development, and Romwell was a significant historical person representing one side of this section.
Its achievements as a Lord Protector are also highly valued and respected.”
The Chinese Farmer's Death Threatened the Killer
In one of the markets in South-West China, a farmer has become a victim of pigs, local media reported.
The body of the victim (only his name is mentioned in the media, Yuan) with a broken artery, was found near the snow on the market in the district of Lupanju province of Guycheau in southern China, reported by Morning Post on Friday.
The piglets are prepared to enter the pig farms, on 30 May 2005, in the Chinese province of Zinhai.
Yuan and his twin brother came from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday and brought 15 pigs for sale.
The next morning, a twin brother found the unsanitary body of Yuan, opening the door to the neighboring pighouse.
There was a huge drop of blood on the rail.
During the trial, it was found that the pig weighing 250 kilograms threatened the farmer to die.
“My brother’s feet were torn and thrown away,” said the newspaper Guiyang Evening News Wu, a relative of the murdered.
The video from the surveillance camera showed that John came to the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed his animals.
The body was found about an hour later.
The killer pig didn't belong to the brothers.
The market manager told the newspaper Evening News that the pig was isolated in a separate run at the time of the investigation in order to avoid repeated attacks.
The Yuan family is reported to be negotiating with the market administration for compensation for the farmer ' s death.
Cases of pigs ’ attack on humans have often occurred.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts, U.S.A., and severely injured a man.
Ten years ago, a 300-kilogram animal brought a Wallian Christian to the tractor and let her go, just in fear of her successful wife.
In 2012, there was a case where a farmer from Oregon, U.S.A., was eaten by his own pigs. As told by CBC News, a Canadian farmer, pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood may affect their hidden aggression as a “drop-off mechanism”.
“The pigs are playing,
They're biting and very curious, but they don't want to offend you.
You should simply convey your animal sense of measure and respect," he explained.
Hurricane Rosa brings the river to a large part of the southwest US
It is estimated that Hurricane Rosa is losing its power as it moves through a cooler area on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the next few days, it will bring floods and floods to the territory of North Mexico and the South West.
As of Saturday, 5 hours early in New York, the cyclone reached 1st category with winds up to 135 km/h, 360 km south-west of the city of Punta-Euhania (Mexico).
The hurricane is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, over the Pacific, there is a low-pressure zone that will move east to the west coast of the United States. As the country nears the coast of Lower California, the storm will bring tropical moisture north of Mexico, to the south-west US territory.
More than 25 cm of sediment is expected in Mexico on Monday.
Under the influence of tropical humidity falling into the emerging low-pressure zone, strong floods are expected in the coming days of the South West.
The sediments from 2.5 to 10 cm will cause dangerous floodwaters, dirty streams and possible wastes in the desert.
In some areas, especially in the southern states of Nevada and Arizona, due to high tropical humidity, the rate of precipitation can be between 5 and 8 cm per hour.
In certain South-West areas, mainly in most of the Arizona territory, up to 5 to 10 cm of sediment is expected.
The risk of sudden rapid fluctuations is not excluded due to the uneven distribution of tropical rains.
In the case of an existing tropical river, walking in the desert is a serious consequence.
Lions can turn canyons into stormy rivers, and thunder can cause broken winds to rise up and up the clouds of dust.
The low-pressure zone on the coast of southern California will collapse.
It is possible to drop up to 1.5 cm of sediment, which can cause small dirty streams and create rocky surfaces on the roads.
These are the first landings since the beginning of the rainy season in the region.
On Friday evenings and mornings in Arizona, tropical rains will spread to other territories until Monday evenings and Tuesday mornings.
On Tuesday, the river will pass through the four corners of the area and extend until noon.
In October, there will be a sharp drop in temperatures throughout the United States, due to low temperatures of the Arctic air at high temperatures in the tropics.
Sometimes such a combination results in severe temperature fluctuations in a small area.
Such severe temperatures will be particularly observed in the central United States on Thursday.
Between the temperature in Kansas City (Missuri State) and Omaha (Nebraska State), as well as between St. Louis and De-Moonz (Ayova State), there is a difference of almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, summer heat will accumulate and spread to other territories.
Most central and eastern U.S. territories were expected to be warm in early October, with temperatures reaching 27 degrees in space from the South Plains to the North-East.
In New York on Tuesday, the air temperature may rise to 27 degrees, which is 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term weather forecast promises an unusually high temperature on the east coast of the United States before mid-October.
Senate hearings on Judge Brett Kavano saw more than 20 million viewers
The testimony of Brett Cavano and Christina Blazi Ford, who accused Cavano of attempted rape in the 1980s, attracted more than 20 million viewers to six television channels on Thursday.
The political opposition to Qavano's candidacy was unanticipated, and an urgent message was received in the media on Friday: Republican Jeff Flake expressed the condition that charges against a lawyer were investigated by the FBI within one week.
As Ford said in his hearings before the Senate Legal Committee, she was 100 per cent confident that Kavano had attacked her in a state of drunkenness and tried to separate her at a school party.
Cavano gave emotional testimony, claiming that 100 per cent was convinced that it was not.
According to the Nielsen Research Agency, the Friday debate saw more than 20.4 million viewers.
The Agency took into account average statistics from channels CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Data on the number of other channels, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, are not available.
In addition, Nielsen's rating does not always take into account viewers watching television at work.
For comparison: this is the middle audience following the American football player in the playoff or Oscar hand ceremony.
The largest audience was in Fox News Channel, whose leaders warmly supported the appointment of Cavano: Senate hearings that lasted all day saw on average 5.69 million viewers, Nielsen reported.
Secondly, ABC has 3.26 million viewers.
The CBS audience was 3.1 million, NBC - 2.94 million, MSNBC looked at 2.89 million viewers, while CNN had 2.52 million reviews, Nielsen reported.
After hearing the case, there was no weakening of interest.
On Friday, the present drama was played with Jeff Flake.
After the senator from Arizona, who was considered a moderate Republican, reported his intention to support the candidacy of Kavana, CNN and CBS, he was able to print on the camera on Friday morning on his way to the Legal Committee meeting, as he met with a group of activists who had violated the Senate ' s criticism.
The whole world has seen how he, with his eyes down, receives a blast from angry women in the direct air at CNN.
"I am standing before you," said one of them.
"Do you think he is telling the truth?"
“The strength behind you, while so many women are powerless”, tried to explain their position to the woman.
Fleke replied to activists that his office had already prepared a statement and would speak on this subject at the committee meeting.
When a few hours later, the Legal Committee was prepared to approve the candidacy of Cavano as a judge and send it to the Senate for a general vote, all channels broadcast the meeting in direct air.
However, Flake made one condition for the FBI to investigate these charges against the candidate by the following week, as the democratic minority had done.
Flake argues that he has changed his mind thanks to the intervention of another Senator of the Democrats, Chris Kuns.
He made a final decision, speaking to Kuns and several other senators.
Fleika ' s decision was effective, as it was clear that the Republicans did not have enough votes to approve the Kavano without an investigation.
By order of President Trampa F.B., the investigation of charges against Kavano has been initiated.
British Prime Minister Teresa May accuses his critics of "political games" about the Brexit situation
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Teresa May accused politicians criticizing her plan to leave the Euro Union, that they put uncooperative interests above the interests of society.
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom attends the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, published in one May interview, former head of MIDI Boris Johnson criticized her so-called Shaški Plan under Brexit, saying that the introduction of customs duties between Britain and the EU is considered to be “absolute”.
Death of Wade Sims in shooting: Police arrested Daieyon Simpson for suspected murder of Forford University of Louisiana State
The police arrested a man suspected of murder as a result of the shooting of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at the University of Louisiana.
As reported by the Baton-Ruja police, 20-year-old Daithion Simpson was arrested and detained for murder.
The police published a video of the dragon with Sims and Simpson, in which Sims lost his eyes.
According to WAFB, the CBS regional channel, the police found Simpson DNA in the eyes of the crime scene.
During the investigation, Simpson acknowledged that Wade had been wounded by death.
For Simpson, a deposit of $350.000 was made for Advocate.
Baton-Russia Eastern District coroner issued a preliminary ruling on Friday: death was caused by a cross-linked gunshot wound to the neck and head.
The Division is grateful to the Louisian State Police Criminal Investigation Division, the State Police Criminalist Laboratory, the South University Police and local residents who have helped with the conduct of the operational and operational activities that have led to detention.
Joe Alleva, director of sports at the University of Louisiana, thanked the law enforcement forces for their “good work on the appointment of a criminal”.
Sims was only 20 years old.
The two-metre foreguard was the native of Baton-Ruz; his father Wayne also played at the University of Louisiana.
In the last season, Sims took 5.6 points and made 2.6 choices on average for the match.
The coach of Will Wade's team made a statement on Friday morning, saying that Wade Sims' tragic death caused “shock” and “present woe” to all players.
“That’s what I’ve always been afraid of,” the coach added.
Vulcan covered the ashes of Mexico
Volcano Popocatepetl fell asleep in the ashes of the southern surroundings of the Mexican capital.
On Saturday, Mexico ' s National Centre for Natural Disaster Prevention recommended that the population not get close to the volcano: its crater had an activity registered and 183 paragas emissions were produced during the day.
In the Centre’s observation, the volcano was often torn apart by thunder and felt irritable.
In some areas of Mexico, such as Sochimilko, social media users published photographs of lobe glass cars covered with thin layers of ash.
Following the earthquake of 7.1 MW, which shook the central part of Mexico in September 2017, geophysics recorded participating volcanic activity in 72 km south-east of the capital.
Volcano Popocatepetl (or, for its part, Don Goyo) has been the active volcano since 1994.
Police clashes with Catalan separatists prior to the first anniversary of the independence referendum
On Saturday, Barcelona held a millennium meeting on the first anniversary of the referendum on the departure of Catalonia from Spain, which broke the country into two camps; there were no clashes between independence supporters of autonomy and police; six participants were detained.
Police officers were pressuring the protesting supporters of independence, while the latter, dressed in black masks, were keeping their eggs and powdered paints, raising the cloud of dust in the center of Barcelona.
After the police had let the crowd down, the riots resumed with the new force.
For a number of hours, the leaders of independence said: "Let us not forget, nor forgive." And their opponents said to them: "Peace be on Spain."
According to local press reports, fourteen participants entered the hospital with minor injuries.
On 1 October last year, a referendum was held on Catalonia ' s withdrawal from Spain, which was recognized by the illegal Spanish Government, but was an important milestone for separatists.
Catalonia, with a huge surplus, voted for an exit from Spain, but the phenomenon was low because the opponents of the exit had predominantly boycotted the referendum.
According to Catalan official sources, last year, in police attempts to block the holding of a referendum at the country ' s polling stations, almost 1,000 people were injured.
On Friday, separatists set out on the claimed path to follow the demonstration in support of the Spanish police to prevent its execution.
The demonstration still took place, but it went on another route.
The 68-year-old Narcissus Termes, who visited a separatist meeting in his wife's company, believes that the hope of Catalonia's acquisition of sovereignty is becoming more and more fragile.
“Last year, one of the most important events happened in our lives.
My parents cried happily when they were given the opportunity to vote in the referendum, and today we are in suspended state," he says.
In the recent December elections in the local authorities, the Catalan parties, which are in favour of the Spanish office, have won an important victory, even with a slight break, but this year their movement is losing supporters, as many of the well-known leaders of the movement are either running away or in custody, waiting for the court to play their role in the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Hoan Puch, a 42-year-old telephone recorder for police support, said the conflict was being heated by both sides of the political spectrum.
He added, “Treaty tension.”
On Saturday, Oriol Junkeras, one of the nine leaders of Catalan separatists, announced his intention to fight in the European Parliament next year.
“Participating in the ordinary elections in the European Parliament as a candidate is the best way to condemn the loss of democratic values and repression by the Spanish Government”, he says.
Londonderry: The car broke into the house, all three partners were arrested
One of the houses in Londonberry had been bombed several times by a car; the men in London were arrested at the age of 33, 34 and 39.
The meeting was held on Thursday about 19:30 local time in the Ballinagard Krescent area.
As a result, the door and the building were damaged, reports the Inspector of Criminal Police Bob Blemmings.
There are reports that the car could have been fired from the bow.
"Livingstone" victory over "Randers" thanks to Mengie's bulletproof goal
Dolly Mengie's first goal was to win the Livingstone team.
Thanks to the death of the Livingstone ball, he won an unexpected victory over Rangers. For the leading coach of the Scottish club, Steven Gerard, this is only a second defeat for 18 games.
The exact hit by Dolly Mengy compared Gary Holt's team with the Hibernian club in the rowing table where they divide the second place.
The Gerard Club remained unbeatable for a trip to the Premier League season. On Sunday, they will meet with the leaders of the Harts group, from which the Rangers stand at eight points.
On Thursday, Rangers will take part in a European League match with the Austrian Rapid Club (Venna).
The Livingstone Club continues its unscrupulous series in the division, has won six matches and has not received any defeat since Holt changed Kenny Miller to the lead team coach.
Missing moments for Livingstone in the wake of intense guests
Holt's coaches were supposed to account from the very beginning — the Rangers obviously did not deal with their effort.
Scott Robinson was able to break through the line of defense, but the goal of his weak attempt did not go away, and then the defenseman Alan Litgou, too wide, couldn't prevent Caegue Halkett's ball from falling into the net.
The host allowed Rangers to play in front of their line of defense, waiting for dangerous moments when the game was resumed.
That's how they missed this important goal.
Rangers were released, and Livingstone took advantage of the opportunity: Declan Gallagher and Robinson made a transfer to Menge, who was killed from the centre.
By then, Rangers had been superior to the ball, but the host team was unbreakable, so the doorman Liam Kelly was not concerned.
The second team continued on the same schedule, although Kelly had to strike Alfred Morelos.
The Rangers doorman Allan McGregor took the ball off Scott Pittman's foot, and Litgou made a large donation from the standard.
The balls were constantly hit by the Livingstone fine, but all the attacks were reflected, and two penalty demands — one for provocation of the spare player Glenn Midlton Halkett and the other for the game — were not satisfied.
"Fineminal" game "Livington" is an analysis
By BBC Scotland — Alasder Lamont, Report by Tony Macaroni Arena
The phenomenal game and excellent result for the Livingstone team.
All the players were absolutely magnificent, and at the same time they exceeded all expectations, continuing their descent to the Olympics.
Their game style and composition have not changed since they came up to the top lines of the rating, and the great merit of Coach Holt was that he had mobilized this team from the very beginning.
There were a lot of heroes in his team.
Captain Halkett led an excellently organized defense, and Menga did not let Connor Goldson and Joe Warall relax.
But the Rangers couldn't get into the rhythm.
Although they had good playtimes with Coach Gerard, this time they didn't justify our expectations.
In the last few minutes, they did not get the ball, but they only managed to protect the host team once. The Rangers, who are down in the middle of the table, have something to think about.
Cold reception of Erdogan during a visit to Keln
On Saturday, 29 September, when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in the morning, there was a wonderful weather, and both of the seniors were in a good mood.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's visit to Germany to establish relations between the two NATO parties, the visit, and without any conflict.
The heads of countries could not understand such issues as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's EU accession.
After Erdogan was sent to Cologne to participate in the opening ceremony of a huge new mosque.
The largest Turkish diaspora is located outside Turkey.
For security reasons, the police did not allow a 25-thousand crowd to enter the mosque, but many Erdogan supporters were located nearby to see their president.
At the same time, opposers of the Erdogan regime, including Kurds, gathered to condemn both Erdogan ' s policy and the German Government ' s decision to invite him with a visit to Germany.
The presence of radically opposite views at the meeting reflects the diversity of the figure: many Germans with Turkish roots carry Erdogan, while others consider him a tyrant.
Deptforda Road Accident: Car collision caused the death of a biker
In London, the car was hit by a bicycle driver who ended up at the scene.
The accident took place close to Besioud Street and Evelyn Street, a revitalized crossroads in the south-east part of the town of Depfort, about 10:15 local time.
The driver and the men who came to the scene tried to help the biker, but the man ended up unconscious.
This is not the only accident with a fatal outcome in the area: only half a mile from the scene, on Childers Street Street, another biker was hit by a car whose driver was hiding.
The London Police report that work is currently under way to identify the deceased and notify his closest relatives.
And so far, roads have been overcrowded and bus routes have been changed: drivers are asked not to go to the area.
Indiscriminate in Long Lartin Prison: wounded six police officers
Six police officers were wounded during the riots in the men ' s prison, reported by the Long Lartin Administration.
In the men ' s prison of the Long Lartin (Wusstershire) strict regime, riots between around 09:30 and local time continue on Sunday.
To suppress the riots involving eight prisoners from one wing, the Tornado Opera Group was called.
The police had suffered minor damage to soft tissue; they had received medical attention on the spot.
According to the official representative of the prison, “specially trained staff were recruited to permit the incident in the Long Lartin Correctional Office.
Six of them were injured.
We categorically deny the use of physical force in our institution, and it is clear that the perpetrators will be handed over to the police and their measure of repression may be altered for a longer time.”
Long Lartin currently has more than 500 prisoners, including one of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, the media reported that the prison manager had fallen into a hospital under attack by one of the prisoners.
In October last year, the prison management was forced to bring in a special mission unit to calm those who had thrown billiards into the overseers.
Hurricane Rosa can drown Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (which will benefit dry territories)
Arizona rarely falls into the area of intense tropical cyclone, but this time it was “lucky”: the first week of the hurricane of Rosa, after making the last crack, must pass over the desert part of the South-West and bring with it the risk of flooding.
The National Meteorological Service had already warned of the threat of flooding on Monday and Tuesday in West Arizona and on the south and east of Nevada, in southeastern California and Utah, including in cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Hurricane Rosa will cross the line over Phoenix on Tuesday and flow through the river on Monday evening.
The Office of the National Meteorological Service in Phoenix reported in Twitter that “all ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storm or depression within a radius of 320 km from Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (in 1967) passed 65 km from the Arizona border.”
According to the latest forecasts of the National Meteorological Service, there are between 5 and 10 cm of sediments, reaching 15 cm in the Arizona plateau of Mogolon-Rim.
In other desert regions of the South-West, such as the Central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, it is possible that up to 2.5 to 5 cm of sediments can be reached by 10 cm.
For areas that will be affected by floodwaters, the rain brought by Hurricane Rosa can be a real blessing because the region has long suffered from drought.
Although floodwaters may present a danger, abundant rains can facilitate a dry season that is not in South-West America.
According to U.S. Drought Monitor maps, over 40 per cent of Arizona's territory is affected by at least severe drought (second by category gravity),” reports the weather.com website.
At first, Hurricane Rosa falls into the Mexican state of Lower California.
As early as the morning, the hurricane, the maximum speed of which is 137 km/h, is 360 km south of the city of Punta-Euchenia, Mexico, and is moving north at a speed of 19 km/h.
Hurricane has been found to be in a cooler area on the Pacific coast and thus loses its power.
On the second afternoon, the hurricane will reach Mexico in the category “tropical storm”.
In certain areas of Mexico, it is expected that flood floodwaters will pass.
“In the territory of Lower California to the northwest of Sonora, up to 7 to 10 cm of sediments can fall to 25 cm”, reports the weather.com website.
Furthermore, Hurricane Rosa is heading north through the territory of Mexico, and early in the morning it will reach the border with Arizona in the tropical cyclone category. From Arizona it will reach the southern part of the state of Uta to the evening of Tuesday.
“The main potential risk associated with Hurricane Rosa and its remains is the strong floods in Lower California, the north-west Sonora and the south-west desert areas of the United States,” the National Meteorological Service reports.
The sediments are expected to cause dangerous floodwaters, muddy streams in the desert and possible rainfall in mountain areas.
Attack at Midsomer Norton: four suspects are detained for attempted murder
A 16-year-old in Somerset had severe stab wounds, and three adolescents and 20-year-olds were arrested for attempted murder.
The victim of severe injuries was found in the district of Excelsior Terras, in the city of Midsomer Norton, about 4 a.m. on Saturday.
After hospitalization, his condition is assessed as “stable”.
On the same night, four suspects aged 17, 18 and 20 were arrested in the Radstock area, reports Awon and Somerset County Police.
The police are looking for possible witnesses of a crime with any video on the mobile phone.
Donald Trump: "All hatred, all the anger" of the Democrats has broken into Kavano
“A voice behind Judge Kavano is a voice against the ruthless and disturbing tactics applied by democracies,” said Trump at a meeting of his associates in Willinga, West Virginia.
Trampa believes that in the process of approving the nomination of Kavano to the candidate, “all hatred, all evil” of the Democratic Party has been broken.
On Thursday, Kavano gave his testimony at the U.S. Congress, categorically rejecting the charge by Christine Blaise Ford that he was sexually charged with her more than 30 years ago when both were teenagers.
Dr. Ford also gave evidence during her prosecution.
On Saturday, the president of the United States said that on that day “the American people saw the brilliant mind, class and courage” of Kavana.
“The vote for the approval of Judge Kavano is the vote for the approval of one of the most outstanding lawyers of our time, with an unrestricted public service list,” the president announced to a crowd of his fellowmen in West Virginia.
In his speech, the President addressed the question of the nomination of Kavano, which was about the importance of the election of Republicans in Congress and the House of Representatives.
“To the most important elections in our lives remains only five weeks.
I do not participate in them, but I participate in the race in another sense," he said.
“I am wearing like a tantrum and fighting for our excellent candidates.”
Trump believes that the Democrats have put themselves in the task of “defending us with all their strength”.
Under the regulation, the first key vote in the Senate to approve the candidacy of Kavano should be held no later than Friday, the Assistant High Representative of the Republican Party reported.
The earthquake in Indonesia has killed hundreds of lives, and the total number of victims continues to rise
On Saturday, the Indonesian authorities announced that at least 384 people had died, many had been struck by giant waves that had taken over the beaches of the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, which had been hit by an incredible force of tsunamis and earthquakes.
The first victims were hundreds of visitors to the beach festival in Palo. On Friday, the coast was nearly six meters high, and they were all braved on their way and killed many of the people present.
Cunami followed the magnitude 7.5 earthquake on the Richter scale.
“When a storm warning was announced yesterday, people continued their beach rest instead of running away and lost their lives,” said Sotopo Purvo Nugroho, official representative of the Indonesian National Office for the Elimination of Natural Disasters at a press conference held in Jakarta.
“The tsunamis didn’t come one, there were machines in the water, and the mud, the whole houses, the nature destroyed everything on its way,” Nugroho explained, adding that the tsunamis crossed the ocean at a speed of 497 km/h and that it went off the coast.
Some of those present were taken to the trees, which saved their lives.
About 16,700 local residents were evacuated to 24 shelters in Pala.
There are destroyed houses, shops, broken bridges and drowned swords in the aerophotos to address the effects of natural disasters.
On Saturday, the coastal city still shook underground.
A series of earthquakes occurred in the territory of 2.4 million people.
The statement by the Agency for the Evaluation and Use of the Technology of the Republic of Indonesia (BPPT) indicates that the earthquake caused by energy emissions was about 200 times more than the explosion of an atomic bomb that destroyed Hiroshima.
The tsunamis may have proved to be stronger than expected by the geographical location of the city at the end of the long narrow bay.
Nugroho called the damage “massable”, adding that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels were destroyed.
The bodies of the dead were found under the ruins of the damaged buildings, with 540 injured and 29 still missing.
Nugroho added that victims and destructions could be even more significant along the coast to 300 km from Pala, in Dungala, which was close to the earthquake.
Communication with Dungal was “completely destroyed, no information was received”.
“There are more than 300 thousand people living in the Dungala area,” reports the International Committee of the Red Cross, whose staff and volunteers have already been sent to the disaster zone.
“A tragedy has occurred, but it has not yet occurred, ” the report says.
On Saturday, the Office was severely criticized because it did not report on the arrival of the tsunamis in Palau. However, authorities believe that waves reached the coast at a time when the initial warning was still in force.
There was a loving video on social networks, where a man on the top floor of the building was shouting about the overcrowding tsunamis, desperately trying to draw people's attention to the street.
A few minutes later, the water wall is broken down on the beach, bringing in whole houses and machines.
The Reuters Agency has not yet been able to confirm the authorship of this role.
Earthquake and tsunamis have led to major electrolytes decommissioning, resulting in the loss of connection in Palau, which has made rescue operations very difficult.
Military transport aircraft were sent from Jakarta and other cities with humanitarian assistance, but the evacuated population still lacks food and items of the first need, reports government sources.
The city ' s airport was opened only for humanitarian assistance; it would be closed for other flights by October.
On Sunday, President Joco Vidodo will visit the evacuation centres in Palo.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia exceeds 800.
It's a very bad situation.
The volunteers of the World Vision charity came from Dungala to Pala, where they found shelters in bristles in the yard of their office building. According to Dosebá Sinai, a terrible picture of complete destruction appeared on their way.
“They saw a great multitude of ruined houses,” he says.
It's a very bad situation.
The humanitarian assistance mechanisms began to be implemented by charitable organizations, but many complained that international NGOs had failed to reach Pala.
Indonesian legislation allows for funding, humanitarian assistance and foreign organizations only after the announcement of a natural disaster zone.
This hasn't happened yet.
“It is believed that this is a local disaster, ” says Aulia Ariani, a Indonesian Red Cross press secretary.
“As soon as the Government announces a natural disaster to the national population, we will be able to receive foreign assistance, but the status remains unchanged.”
On the second day after the natural disaster that struck Paul, friends and relatives of those who were missing still look forward to their wonderful salvation, which will bring the people back to their faith in the best.
On Saturday, a little boy fell into a sewer hole was saved.
On Sunday, the rescuers pulled out of the building a woman who had spent two days there with her mother's lifeless body.
Gendon Subandono, a national paraplanner for collecting Indonesia, prepared two missing pilots for the Asian Games recently held in Indonesia.
Among the other people who fell into the hunt at Roa Roa Hotel were his students, including Mandaga.
“I’m not the last person in this sport, and it’s emotionally difficult to survive,” he said.
Hendon recalls, as he learned about the collapse of Roa Roa from other paraplanners, he desperately tried to contact whatsApp with his colleagues from Pala who were resting at the beach festival over the next few hours.
However, his messages were represented by a series of puzzles, not two pigeons.
“This means that messages have not been delivered”, he thinks.
Steady theft of $26,750 during the service of the ATM in Newport-on-Libya
On Friday morning, abusers kidnapped $26,750 from Incassator Brink's, who managed one of the ATMs in Newport-on-Levia, reportedly reportedly in the news release of the Newport Police.
According to investigator Dennis McCarty, the driver of the armored microbus took the money from the ATM in the entertaining complex and was about to run it with new banknotes.
At that time, “Brink’s officer escaped from his back” and stole a banknote bag to repair the ATM.
According to witnesses of the incident, there were several suspects fleeing the scene, but the police did not indicate the number of potential participants.
Citizens who have any information about these persons are requested to contact the Newport Police Office at number 859-292-3680.
Queen West: the rapper has changed its name to her
Rapper Kane West thought of himself as a new name: Yes.
He announced this on Saturday in Twitter: "The identity known as Cany West."
The 41-year-old West has been wearing this pseudonym for a long time and has even put it on his eighth album in June.
News of this appeared in advance of the appearance of Kanya in the broadcast of Saturday Night Live, where he plans to present his new album to Yandhi.
Kanya West will address the well-known Aryan singer, who has cancelled her participation because of “emotional experiences”, reports the author of the report.
West had previously stated that pseudonyms were not only a shortcut to his name but also a religious one.
"Ye is the most common word in the Bible, it means "you," so West explained the name of his album in a recent interview with Big Boy.
"It's me, it's you, it's us.
At first it was Kanye, which means "unique," and now I'm the only one, that is, a reflection of all the good, bad, impossible in us, all at once.
And the album is trying to figure out who we are."
Cany's not the first known rapper to change his name.
Sean Combs, formerly known as Puff Daddy, Pi Diddy or just Diddy, asked this year to call himself Love or Braza Love or Brother Love.
The West rapper Jay-Zy also changed his name several times: with a definition and without letters or strings.
The President of Mexico solemnly promises not to use military forces against the civilian population
President Andrés Lopes Obrador of Mexico vowed never to resort to military force against the civilian population during the 50th anniversary of the student demonstration, which ended with a bloodbath.
Speaking on Saturday at Tlatelolko Square, President Lopes Obrador promised that he would “never resort to the help of the army to oppress the Mexican people”.
At this site, on 2 October 1968, during the peaceful demonstration of students, the first shots were fired on the crowd and 300 people were cut off, which took place in the background of the strengthening of the left-wing student movements in Latin America.
Lopes Obrador also pledged support for Mexican youth in the form of a monthly scholarship for the learning and opening of more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and the lack of prospects for learning led young people directly into the criminal world.
The need to double the financing of the development of the JI
China should not be underestimated and its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence (II) — the United States should double investment in its scientific development, Li Caiaphas, investor and entrepreneur in the field of II development with experience in Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Earlier, several American ministries had made statements about II work, although the United States as a whole did not have a clear II development strategy.
At the same time, China presented its own plan last year: its goal is to become the first in the innovations of II by 2030.
“The increase in the II research budget twice would be a good start, given that all other countries are far away from the United States, and we expect the next II breakthrough,” Li says.
The double increase in funding could double the chances that the next major achievement of II would be made in the United States, Li CNBC said in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “The Superstates of Artificial Intelligence: China, the Crimean Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the general director of Sinovation Ventures, who invested in one of the most outstanding companies in China, Face ++.
In the 1980s, he worked on an art intelligence system at the University of Carnegie-Mello, which was the highest player in the U.S.O., and was then the leader of Microsoft Research and the president of the Chinese Google branch.
He mentioned previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Robotics Challenge Agency's Defence Advanced Research Projects, and wondered when the next competition would take place to help people find non-traditional ideas.
According to Lee, researchers in the United States often have to work hard to obtain government grants.
“Not China embraces academic leaders, but corporations,” says Lee.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been employing light from universities to work on artificial intelligence.
If you are convinced that changes in immigration policy can also help the United States to develop artificial intelligence.
“I think that green cards should be automatically offered to applicants in the field of artificial intelligence,” he says.
In July 2017, the State Council of China published a plan for the development of the next generation ' s artificial intelligence.
The Chinese National Fund for Natural Sciences allocates funding to scientists in the same way as the National Research Fund and other government organizations allocate money to American researchers, but the quality of the research work in China is confirmed by Lee below.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Ministry of Defence established a Joint Intelligence Centre to involve industrial and scientific partners, and the White House announced the establishment of a Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in the AI Next programme.
As for NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in II.
However, U.S. legislation, which sought to establish the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, has not taken any action in this regard for several months.
Macedonians vote on the referendum on whether to change the name of the country
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether to change the name of their country to “The Republic of North Macedonia”, which would allow for a multi-year dispute with Greece, which blocked its applications for accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, composed of the province of Macedonia, claims that its northern neighbour's name is a claim to its territory and has cast a vote on its accession to NATO and the EU.
In June, both Governments concluded an agreement based on a proposal for a new name, but nationalists argue that this change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of the Macedonian population.
President George Ivanov said that he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign questioned whether voters would meet the minimum of 50 per cent required for the referendum.
The question raised at the referendum was as follows: “Do you support NATO and EU membership on the condition that the treaty be adopted with Greece?”
The parties to the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the break-up of Yugoslavia, should pay this price for joining organizations such as the EU and NATO.
“I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for the young Macedonians, so that she could live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” says 79-year-old Oliver Georgievski, who lives in Skopje.
A sufficient number of members of Parliament said that they would respect the outcome of the vote to make it a decision, although it did not have the legal force.
The name would require a two-thirds majority of the members of Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission stated that no violations had been reported by 13:00.
However, the figure was only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
“I came to vote for my children, our place in Europe,” says 62-year-old Jose Tanevski, an elector from Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted for a referendum in Macedonia on the change of name of the country, which will pave the way for its entry into NATO and the European Union in Strumice, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament building in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small scene, disposing of chairs to tents established by those citizens who are going to boycott the referendum.
“We want to join NATO and the EU, but we want to join with a high-level head, not in the hands of officials,” Kavardak says.
“Yes, we are citizens of a poor country, but we also have a sense of dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can contact other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of Euro-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership would bring investment in Macedonia, which was so necessary in that country, where the unemployment rate was more than 20 per cent.
“I believe the overwhelming majority will be because more than 80 per cent of our citizens support the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after the vote.
He believes that a positive response will be “a reward for our good future”.
The poll published last Monday by the Institute of Political Research of Macedonia showed that between 30 and 43 per cent of voters would participate in the referendum, but this was the required outcome.
Another survey conducted by the Macedonian channel Telecom-TV revealed that 57 per cent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
70 per cent of these figures claim to be positive.
In order for the referendum to take place, the vote should be 50 per cent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum will be the first major blow to the policy of the Western Government since it came to power last May.
Look, Sergio Aguaero from Manchester City is protecting Briton to kill the target.
Sergio Aguaero and Rahim Sterling fought against Briton's defense, bringing Manchester City to victory at 2:0 on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
When Aguaero hit the target for 65th minute, it seemed like it wasn't his job.
At the beginning of the episode, the Argentine attacker received a passport at the center of the field.
He went between the three Briton defenders before breaking into open space.
Aguaero was surrounded by four competitors in green football.
He walked through one of the defenders and covered several more on the edge of the Briton criminal zone.
He then handed over Sterling's ball to the left.
An English attacker in the criminal zone, in one case, returned the ball of Aguaero, who right-handedly smashed the door of Bryton's Matthew Ryan into the right corner of the door.
“Aguero is experiencing some problems with his feet,” journalist Coach Manchester City, Pep Gardiola told reporters.
“We agreed that he would play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he hit the target at the time."
But it was Sterling that gave the Blue Sky an initial advantage in fighting the Premier League.
That target was killed in 29 minutes.
In this game, Aguero won the ball, being deep in Briton's territory
He gave a great cut off on the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane did a few things before giving Sterling a transfer to a remote stand.
The attacker of the Blue Sky shot the ball in the door just before he flew out of the field.
Manchester City fought Hoffenheim at the League of Champions on Tuesday at 12:55 at Raine-Nekkar-Arene in Zinsheim, Germany.
Sherzer's going to pick the eyes at Colorado Rocky.
After Washington Nationals got out of the playoff battle, there was no special reason to force events.
But the insatiable Sherzer hopes to take the lead in fighting Colorado Rocky on Sunday, but only if the Rocky one-game Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western Division has problems in playoffs.
Winning 5-2 over the Nationals on Friday evening Rociz has already won at least 7 or 8 seats, but they still hope to win the title in the first division.
“And although we play just like that, but at least we can keep our positions, knowing the enormous importance of the atmosphere in Denver in the presence of spectators and other teams, probably unprecedented this year.
How can I miss it?"
The Nationals have not yet announced the drinker on Sunday, but, according to recent data, they are willing to expose Sherzer to this role.
Sherzer, who's going to go out on Thursday at 34th, was throwing a ball on the pier square, and on Sunday, at his exit, he was going to be a pier.

The Trump is running a pre-election race in West Virginia.
Referring to the importance of the emergence of Republicans in the interim elections, the President made direct reference to the situation around Brett Kavano, a presidential candidate in the Supreme Court.
“All we did was put on the map in November.
Five weeks have passed before one of the most important elections in our lives.
It's very, very important, I'm not running, although I'm really running, fighting for good candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump continued: "You see this terrible, terrible radical group of democrats, you see what's happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power, using whatever means are needed, and we observe humility and hypocrisy.
It is the same for whom they are going to test, and by whom they must pass through, in order that they may gain power and control, and that is what they desire – power and control, but we are not going to give it to them.”
The Democrats, he claims, have set the goal of “resistance and obstruction”.
“And you will observe it in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “evil, false, false and false.”
He referred to the Senate's Legal Committee, referring to Senator-Democrat Diane Finstein, which sparked a loud voice from the hall.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you allow the contents of the document to leak?
Mmm... mm... what document?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
The Labour Party is no longer an organization that has different views.
It does not show tolerance for those who express their opinion
When Momentum activists in my local party offered a vote of distrust to me, it was not a surprise.
Finally, I am the last in a number of Members of Parliament from the Laborist party who have not yet been expressed that we are not welcomed by what we are saying.
The same attitude towards my colleague in Joan Ryan's Parliament, because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbin.
The importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, on the irony of fate are issues for which Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
On Friday, the Nottingham East Laborist Assembly announced that “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive”.
Most of the time from eight years of my stay as a local member of parliament from the Laborist party, the evening Friday meetings of the GC were the same.
Unfortunately, today's tone does not correspond to those many meetings, and the promise of “more human and soft” policy has long been forgotten if it was at all.
The fact that there are no differences in views in the Laborist party is becoming more and more evident, and each opinion is assessed as to whether it is acceptable for the party to run.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader; colleagues, whose political perspective I had previously considered to be similar to my own, had begun to expect me to change my views and take a position that I would never agree with — whether national security or a single EU market.
Every time after my public speech — and it is not important that I say it — social networks should have a variety of insults that call for the abolition of the elections that condemn the centre's policy or that I should not be a member of the Laborist party.
And that's not all that happens to me.
Indeed, I know that I have more luck than some of my colleagues because the comments in my address still tend to be political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my colleagues, who face a flow of sexual or racist attacks every day, but never give up.
Most of all, this policy is disappointing that such a number of abuses have become a norm.
Last week, Jeremy Corbin said the Laborist party should develop a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer the “wide church”, and with every vote of mistrust or change of party rules, we are already becoming.
In the last two years, I have received many recommendations calling for me to sit still and not to speak, and then everything will be fine with me.
But that's not why I came into politics.
Since I joined the Laborists 32 years ago, as a school student who was upset by the neglect of the Tetcher Government, which had literally broken my school class, I have tried to uphold the highest standard of public services for those who needed them most — whether the work of a local deputy or the Minister of Government.
I have never concealed my political views, I have not done so in the past elections.
No one in Nottinga East could misinterpret my political positions and spheres in which I disagree with the current leadership.
To those who supported this vote on Friday, I would like to say that our country is moving to Brexit, which is guaranteed to be an agricultural, industrial and state-run, and I do not understand the desire of some to spend their time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Laborist Party.
But in fact, the only audience I would like to address is not Nottingham Momentum, but my voters, whether they are laborists or not: I am proud of what I am serving you, and I promise that no threat to the abolition of election results or political usefulness will prevent me from acting as I consider necessary for your sake.
Chris Leslie, member of Parliament from Nottingham East
Er 38 - 17 Melrose: The Invincible “Er” Comes First
Two late attempts may have led to a number of disastrous results, but no doubt “Er” earned a triumph in this amazingly interesting tenent prime team match.
They are now headed by a table, the only invincible team of ten.
In the end, all thanks to their superior protection, as well as the ability to choose the right moment, which gave the host team and coach Peter Merci the full right to be satisfied.
“All this time we have been tested for strength, and we are still invincible, so I have no reason to grieve,” Peter Mercie commented.
Robin Christie, Melrose: "It's worth honoring "Er," they've done their best to us."
Grant Anderson's 14-minute experiment, carried out by Fraser Klimo, took the Air out, but the Yellow Card released for the "Warors" game by the Scottish player Rory Husse allowed Melrose to proceed, and Jason Baggot caught up with an unrealized attempt.
Klimo increased the "Er" from the criminal before, directly in the middle of the game, earned a point and then made a single attempt at the break, making an account of 17-5 in favour of "Er".
But Melrose began the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which was made by Baggot, reduced the poisoning to five points.
Then there was a long interruption due to the serious trauma of Ruarid Knott, which had been resolved, and after the re-emergence, "Er" was further moved by the attempts of Stafford Mcdawell, realized by Klimo.
The current captain, Er, Blair Mcferson, then received a yellow card, and once again Melrose, forced the competitors to pay a regular player for Bruce Colvin's unrealized attempt at the end of the period of intense pressure.
However, the landlords returned, and when Straan Hatchinson received a yellow card for the arrest of Klimo without a ball with a fine line, Makferson made a tachdown behind the coming Er.
Klimo realized the advantage, leaving virtually no more than once again, after Kyle Row got hit by David Armstrong and sent the ultimate attacker Gregor Henry to the fifth attempt of the field owners.
Still Game Star is about to start a new career in a restaurant business
The Still Game Ford Kiran star is about to start working in the hotel industry: it became known that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC show, the script he is writing about, and is filmed with a former comedy partner, Greg Hemfil.
Duet announced that the upcoming ninth show would be the last show, and it seems that Kirnan is planning his life after Kreiglang.
According to official information, he is Director Aragingmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this information, although the source of the Scottish Sun suggested that Kirnan was planning to participate in a thriving restaurant business in Glasgow.
“Our sea”: there is no exit to the Bolivian sea, hoping that the court will reopen its way to the Pacific Ocean
Marines are patrolling the military headquarters in La Pase.
Blue flags are displayed on public buildings.
The military bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are described by the slogan: "The sea is our right.
It is our duty to bring him back."
Throughout Bolivia, landlocked people are still living on the shoreline lost in favour of Chile as a result of the 19th century bloody conflict because of its resources; it is alive and eager to swim again on the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may have become boldest in recent decades, as Bolivia is awaiting decisions by the international court that will take place on 1 October as a result of the five-year debate.
“Bolivia has energy, a spirit of unity and a mental balance and, of course, there is a positive result here,” said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Caldzilia.
Many Bolivians will be following the decision-making process at the International Court of Justice on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will be able to support Bolivia ' s statement that, after decades of intense negotiations, Chile is obliged to negotiate Bolivia ' s sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic president of the indigenous peoples of Bolivia, who is leading an uneasy re-election struggle next year, is also excited about the decision to be taken on Monday.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he said at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court would hardly take a decision in favour of Bolivia, and if so, it would change little.
The United Nations body in the Netherlands has no authority to own the Chilean territory and has already stated that it will have no effect on the basis of possible negotiations.
The decision of the International Court of Justice was delivered only six months after the last arguments were heard, says that the case “was not difficult”, says Pas Zarate, Chilean expert on international law.
And for the past four years, Bolivia has not been moving forward, but it has been postponed all the time.
“The current Bolivian administration has taken advantage of the problem of access to the sea for criminal purposes”, Zarate says.
According to her, the military rhetoric of Morales destroyed Chile’s last goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at some point, but then it will be extremely difficult to discuss.
These two countries have no diplomatic relationship since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Velce, representative of Bolivia in The Hague, disagrees that the court ' s decision was made too quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia will be “an exceptional opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile” and the chance to “end 139 years of conflict with mutual benefit”, he claims.
Kalsidilla also disagrees with the fact that Morales, still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, is using the military-sea problem as a political goat.
“Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific,” he says.
“The court’s decision is an opportunity to see to it that we have to overcome our past.”
North Korea claims that nuclear disarmament will not be until it can trust the United States
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea Ri Yon Ho claims that his country will never go to the destruction of its nuclear weapons unless it is able to trust Washington.
On Saturday, Ri took part in a meeting of the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to fulfil the promises made at the Singapore Summit among the leaders of its countries.
His comments were made as US Secretary-General Mike Pompeo gradually returned to the path of revitalizing the dead nuclear diplomacy more than three months after a meeting with North Korean leader Kim Chen Yin in Singapore.
Ri argues: The dream that long-standing sanctions and the US opposition to the declaration of the end of the Korean War will ever put the North on its knees is a utopia.
Washington is afraid to adopt this declaration if the Pyrenees do not take significant steps to disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want to hold the second summit.
But skepticism that Phinean seriously refers to the rejection of the arsenal, which the country probably considers as the only way to guarantee its safety, is widespread.
Pompeo plans to visit Phenyan next month to prepare a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris' fashion shows demonstrate the newest line of mass main clothing that promises to appear in the mass sales, and they will be carried right next to you.
If you want to add a pencil to your collection or completely protect yourself from sunlight, you don't have to look for anything else.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented the mass of unusual main clothes that are part of their SS19 collection and blind visitors to the Fashion Week in Paris.
This summer, highly unpractice traps won the popularity of Instagram’s signatories, and designers decided to send their snowflakes to the stage.
The excellent specimen of Valentino: the main escape dress decorated with wide-ranging, periphery-like fields was decorated on the heads of models.
Other massive accessories included decorated with precious stones of arbusha, a wolf's hat, and even pineapple, but all these main clothes were not designed to warm the head in cold weather.
Tom Brown also appeared to the world as a collection of amazing masks, which had to become very early in Halloween.
Many of these cave masks were protected by the mouth, and they reminded more of the portrait of Gannibal Lecturer than the creation of a corner.
One of the specimens reminded of the equipment for underwater navigation with a tube and protective eyes, and the other was a growing frozen.
If you are a high-moderate worshiper, you are lucky.
Modern critics predict that these huge traps have every chance of entering mass sales — directly to you.
The pens of a huge size follow the five La Bomba, a striped straw with a width of two feet, from Rianna to Emily Ratakovski.
The cult label that issued this extremely impractical slogan, which won such a wide popularity in social networks, gave birth and sent another huge accessory to the stage — a broken beach bag, almost as large as the one dressed in a bathroom model carrying that bag.
The orange bag from the popular rafia with a white leather handle and rafia scarf became a clear copy of the Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 collection on the Fashion Week in Paris.
Celebrity-Stylistic Luke Armitage tells FEMAIL: “I think that large locks and beach bags will appear in the mass sales next summer, and since the designer has produced this furor with his products, it would be extremely difficult to ignore the demand for huge accessories.”
John Edward: Knowledge of languages is of great importance to citizens of the world
The independent schools of Scotland continue the tradition of brilliant education, which was once again confirmed in 2018: the results of the exams demonstrated individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other public-significant disciplines.
These schools are part of the Scottish Board of Independent Schools (SCIS), where more than 30,000 students are trained throughout Scotland, where they seek to ensure a higher level of service for students and their parents.
Independent schools seek to prepare their students for further higher education, their chosen careers and the status of citizens of the world.
As part of the education sector, which is responsible for the development and implementation of an individual school programme, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to a man in the language he understands, you call him to mind.
If you speak with him in his native tongue, he will come to your heart.
This is a convincing evidence that we cannot rely only on English if we want to build relations with and trust the citizens of other countries.
As a result of this year's recent exams, we see that languages occupy leading positions in the league tables and have the highest score in independent schools.
A total of 68 per cent of students who studied foreign languages received the highest “A”.
Data from 74 SCIS schools showed that 72 per cent of students received “A” in Mandarin (Chinese) while 72 per cent of German students, 69 per cent of French students and 63 per cent of Spanish students also received “A”.
This proves that, in Scotland ' s independent schools, foreign languages are clearly considered to be vital for children and young people in the future.
At present, language subjects have the same demand as natural sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics in independent schools and other educational institutions.
The survey carried out by the British Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 showed that 17 per cent of the reasons for the difficulties faced by employers in filling vacancies were language skills.
Thus, language skills are increasingly becoming the cornerstone of a successful future career for young people.
Given that more promising jobs require language skills, these skills are needed in a globalized world.
Regardless of what profession the student will choose, if he learns the second language, he will gain real benefit in the future by developing another additional skill that will suit him throughout his life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives competitive advantages to a person who knows several foreign languages.
According to a survey by YouGov, involving more than 4,000 adult British people in 2013, 75 per cent did not speak well enough in a foreign language to support the conversation, and the French language was the only language with a dual percentage — 15 per cent of respondents.
That is why investing in language education is so important now.
Knowledge of several languages, especially languages in developing economies, will give children more opportunities to find a good job.
In schools in Scotland, there is a wide range of languages that are taught — each school has its own language set.
A number of schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered most important for Britain in the light of the future development of the country by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child ' s interests, independent schools will always have a choice from several teaching languages whose members are specialists in these languages.
The independent schools of Scotland seek to create an environment of education that will prepare children and equip them with the skills necessary to achieve success, no matter what future awaits them.
At present, it cannot be denied that the global business environment continues to play a vital role in the development of the country ' s future and should therefore be adequately reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages really need to be viewed as “the skills of international communication”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, which ensures diversity and benefits for young people in Scotland.
It's a good thing to do.
John Edwards, Director of the Independent Schools Council of Scotland
Lebron begins with Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The ambitious expectation of fans to see Lebron James speak for the first time in Los Angeles Lakers, has almost come to an end.
Coach Lakers Luke Walton announced that James was playing a pre-season resurrected match against Denver Naggets in San Diego.
But he still has to figure out how much time he has to win.
“More than one and less than forty-eight,” Walton replied to the Lakers official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell wrote on Twitter that James is probably playing a limited time.
After training early this week, James was asked about his plans for six pre-season games on Lakers.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need pre-season games to prepare for the season,” says the game.
Trampa's West Virginia pre-election race, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting to open his pre-election meeting tonight in Willinga, West Virginia.
This is the first of the five planned meetings of Trump next week, including a friendly visit to Tennessee and Mississippi.
Since the vote on the candidacy proposed by him to the Supreme Judge was postponed, Trump sought support in the forthcoming interim elections, as the Republicans risk losing control of the Congress if the vote was to take place in November.
How long will the Trump meeting be in West Virginia tonight, and how can you view it online?
The meeting with Trump in Willinga, West Virginia, will take place at 7:00 a.m. to the east today, on Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can see the Trump meeting with West Virginia voters online on direct broadcast on YouTube.
The tramp will probably be held at hearings this week for the appointment of its candidate Brett Kavano as the Supreme Judge. The proposal of the trampom has led to a mass of negative responses, as Kavano has been accused of sexual harassment and the vote to be held in the Senate will be postponed until the week before the FBI investigates.
But the main objective of this action is to help the Republicans in the November elections to increase their pre-election rate.
Thus, President Trampa's campaign is aimed at helping these five meetings to be held next week to “invigorate volunteers and supporters, as Republicans are trying to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives,” Reuters writes.
“Congress control is so important to his agenda that the President must visit as many states as possible, because we are entering the tense pre-election campaign season,” reports Reuters, the pre-election campaign secretary.
The action planned today at Wesbanco Arena in Willing can attract supporters from “...Ogayo and Pennsylvania, and attract the attention of the Pittsburgh media, ” reports West Virginia Metro News.
The trip to West Virginia this Saturday is already the second visit of the state in the last month, because it has benefited here more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
The tramp is trying to help a candidate in the Senate from West Virginia, Patrick Morrisi, who is staying behind as a result of interviews.
“The fact that Morrisi has to come to the president for questioning is a bad sign for Morris,” says Simon Heather, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia (Quoted from Reuters).
Cube Ryder 2018: The United States Assembly demonstrates its willingness to fight and gives hope by sending for couples on Sunday
After three unilateral sessions, the Saturday game two per two might have been exactly what Kubok Ryder needed.
The initiative is an extremely intelligent sport concept, but it is believed to be a game, and it is particularly clear at such competitions.
So who has the initiative?
"They had a six-point advantage, and now four, so I think it's a small initiative for us," Jordan Spit said leaving.
Of course, Europe has a four-point advantage, and another twelve per horse.
In the opinion of the Americans, Spyta, they feel “wind in the wigs”, and they have reason to keep their spirits up, not least thanks to the shape of Spyta and Justin Thomas, who have been playing together all day, and each one can boast three eyes out of four.
The spat was undiminished from you to the branch, as a personal example.
The winner’s bells became louder as his round continued, he pushed the decisive ball into the hole, closing the match when he and Thomas got two by two.
His blow, which won him a victory in the 15th hole, was met with a similar ad, one of those who are talking about his faith in a chance for the American team.
“We need to get together with all the forces and focus only on our games,” Spit commented.
That's all that's left of the game.
Go through 18 holes and become winners.
The only players who have earned more than two days in the last two days than Spyt and Thomas are French Molinari and Tommy Flitwood, undoubtedly in the history of Cube Ryder.
A strange but charming couple from Europe beat four out of four, and they don't seem to know the mistake.
Molivud was the only couple who did not worship a god on Saturday, but they also avoided the gods on Saturday morning, Friday and again on Friday morning.
Such a series and, as their energy seems to be circulating between them and non-stop sufferers, reinforces the faith that they will not be defeated on the Day of Resurrection, and when the sun is hidden behind the Le Golf National field, there will be no more famous player that will strengthen Europe's potential victory than Flitwood or Molinari.
It would be nice if both were in different holes at the same time.
However, we are talking about the glory of Europe so far.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson had a quick fight with Sergio Garcia, the morning hero of the four balls when he was with Alex Norren.
The gods and two double gods on the first nine lunatics pulled out a Spanish and a Swedish man from whom they could not get out.
So no one will help you get out of your grave on the resurrection day.
It is so attractive to watch four balls and four players because of the interaction between the couples, the advice they exchange, which they deliberately reduce, and how the strategy can change into a single moment.
So far, Europe has played a better role as a team, and it has been well on the last day, but this Thursday session has also shown that the United States has all the power to fight, in which some, especially in America, have doubted.
At the end of the day, Cuba Ryder Europe is led by account 10-6
Europe will have a tangible advantage on the final day of Kubka Ryder after the completion of Saturday matches in four balls and squares with 10-6 over the United States.
The inspired duo Tommy Flitwood and Francesco Molinari led the fight against two victories over the fighting Tiger Woods to bring the account to Le Golf National.
The European team Thomas Bjorn, who wanted to return lost in Hazeltin two years ago, dominated the American team's error in the morning in four balls, winning account 3-1.
There was more resistance in Thursdays, won two matches, but they were unable to reduce the gap in the account.
Commander Jim Ferrik needs eight points from the 12th-resurrection match to keep the trophy.
Flitwood is the first European novelist to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, who received the name Molliwood after the sensational outputs, became only the second pair to win four points in the first four matches in the history of Cube Ryder.
When Woods and Patrick Reed broke up into four balls, they then brought together for victory over the fallen spirit of Woods and American novelty Brison Decebmo with even more determined 5/4.
Woods, who played two Saturday matches, showed periodic problems, but now he lost 19 out of 29 players in four balls and four in seven.
Justin Rose, retired before the four-ball morning, returned to partner Henrik Stanson on Thursday, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kepka with account 2/1 taking the first and third places in the world.
For Europe, the game did not become an easy and pleasant stroll on the day of the freshening south-west of Paris.
The three-time champion Jordan Spitt and Justin Thomas made two eyes for the Americans on Saturday.
They won a 2/1 victory over the Spaniards John Ram and Ayan Polter in four balls and returned later to win Polter and Rory McKilrow with 4/3 on Thursday, losing the first two slots.
Only twice in the history of Cube Ryder did the team travel from four-point retreats alone, given that the team of Ferrica, as I own, had to play an escape to keep the trophy.
However, after two days of holding the second place, the counterattack on Sunday looks as if it is beyond their capabilities.
North Korea says that “categories” will not be unilaterally disarmed without confidence
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea stated to the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions were increasing mistrust in the United States and that his country would not, under any circumstances, give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Yon Ho stated to the annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken “substantial measures of good will” last year, such as the cessation of nuclear and missile tests, the dismantling of the nuclear site and the commitment not to increase nuclear weapons stocks and develop nuclear technology.
“We don’t see a symmetrical reaction from the United States,” he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances we will not be able to act unilaterally first.”
While Ri reiterated the already-sounding North Korean complaints against Washington ' s “step-by” approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded for its gradual steps, his statement was important in the sense that it did not reject unilateral denuclearization without control, as Phenyan did in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement made by Kim Chen In and Donald Tramp at the first in history of the summit between the US President-in-Office and the North Korean leader, which took place in Singapore on 12 June; then Kim promised to start a movement towards the “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula”, and Tramp promised North Korea security assurance.
North Korea is seeking to formally end the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States states that the Phenyan must first renounce its nuclear weapons.
Washington is also opposed to the call to weaken the severe international sanctions against North Korea.
“The U.S. insists that “denuclearization must first be carried out”, and that sanctions should be imposed to enforce their purpose and even oppose “an announcement of the end of the war”, says R.
“The idea that sanctions can put us on our knees is a utopian dream of people who don’t know us.
But this problem is that the continued sanctions strengthen our confidence.”
Ri did not mention the plans of the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the United States leader mentioned in the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the Minister drew attention to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jee In, which took place in the past five months, and added: “If the issue of denuclearization were South Korea, and not the United States, denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be such a dead end”.
However, the tone of Ri's speech was markedly different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that the targeting of North Korea's missiles to the United States mother was inevitable after “Mr. President of Evil” Tramp called Kim “a suicide missile”.
This year in UN Trump, which threatened to “completely destroy” North Korea, commended Kim for his courage to take disarmament measures, but said there was still much to be done, and sanctions should remain in force until North Korea was disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he did not indicate any time frame for the process: “If it takes two years, three years or five months, it does not matter”.
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should encourage the steps taken by the Pyrenees.
However, US Secretary-General Mike Pompeo said in the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The introduction of sanctions by the Security Council should continue actively and necessarily until we see complete, final and confirmed denuclearization”.
The Security Council has consistently increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006, with the aim of overcoming the financing of the Phenyan nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri at the summit of the United Nations General Assembly and reported after that meeting that he would visit Phenyan again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit failed.
In July he left Phenyan, said he had made progress, but for several hours after that visit North Korea condemned him for “banditary demands”.
North Korea promised to dismantle the missile complex as well as the nuclear complex if the United States took “relevant measures” at the meeting held with Muna this month.
According to him, Kim told him that the “appropriate measures” he was talking about were security guarantees that Trump had promised in Singapore, as well as actions aimed at normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn to rest at special courses
The new course that was introduced this year at Harvard University helped all students to learn to sleep more and to fight the chauvinist culture of continuous consumption of caffeine in order to stir up “the night of spring”.
One of the academics found that the most successful students in the world often have no idea how to care for themselves.
Charles Chester, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed a course that he believed was the first in the United States.
After it was opened, it was the idea to introduce such a course by speaking in advance with a report on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning processes.
“At the end of my report, the girl came to me and said, ‘I’m sorry that I’ve only learned about this when I’m almost done learning.’
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep — it surprised me, ” he told The Telegraph.
The course, for the first time proposed to the students this year, describes how healthy sleep habits contribute to academic and sports success and how it improves the overall sense of human self-esteem.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatry of Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of the University Health Service, said that the university decided to introduce this course after it was found that students experienced severe sleep deprivation during the week of study.
The job takes one hour, students perform a number of interactive tasks.
A section of the workshop offers a picture of a room in a community where students are impressed by coffee cups, dishes, coaches and books, and are informed about how each of these actions and substances — coffee, light, which cause a lack of sleep — affects sports results and how important it is to get sufficient daily sleep.
In another section, participants learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
An interactive map of the campus encourages participants to think about their daily lives.
“We understand that these classes will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know as any other person has the right to know about, for example, how smoking affects his health," added Professor Chesler.
According to him, the false feeling of pride that a person can “taste all night” is still widespread, and modern technologies, just as increasing pressure on students, mean that sleep deprivation is becoming a problem.
He said that sufficient sleep quality was the “secret weapon” of a student to fight stress, nervous exhaustion and anxiety, and even to fight overweight, as malnutrition led the brain to hunger, causing him to experience a constant sense of hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chester to develop a course, visiting one of the classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to spread this information throughout the campus.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all graduates to have a similar training program before entering a competitive training institution.
Professor Chesler recommends that students establish a building warning that they should lie down and sleep, as well as remember the harmful effects of “blue light” released by electronic screens and light-emitting lamps, which violates human biorithm and leads to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Gol Menga wins over Gerard's team
Rangers have survived a tragic meeting since Dolly Menga's goal has led the uncollected team of Steven Gerard to lose account 1:0 in Livingston.
The Ibrox team was hoping to win its first victory after winning a 4-1 match in St. Johnstone in February, but the Gary Holt team only won the second defeat of Gerard from 18 games as a manager, leaving his team at eight points behind, giving the Harts team an easy victory to the leaders of the Scottish Prime Minister League.
Manga was killed seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers, who had lost their spirit, seemed not going to balance the account.
While Rangers now dropped to sixth place, Livingstone rose to third place, and only Hibernian joined in relation to the heads killed.
And Rangers may have additional problems after Judge Kalum Spence's line had to heal the wound on his head after an object was thrown out of the guest sector.
Gerard made eight replacements in the team that went through "Er" in the semifinal for the Scottish League.
In turn, Holt went with the same Libya 11 strategy, which led to an increase in the Harts gap last week, and he would be pleased to see how his well-exposed composition tested the opponents at every step.
Rangers may have been led by a sword, but Livingstone survived more when the ball came to him.
They were supposed to kill naked in just two minutes when the first Meng Scott Pittman transmission stopped Allan McGregor, but the defendant took advantage of the opportunity.
Kigan Jakobs made a criminal attack on Captain Craig Halkett, but his defence partner, Alan Litgou, was only able to send a ball to the side of a further stand.
Rangers have taken control, but in the latter third, there seems to be more hope than faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos was convinced that he had to be a criminal strike for forty-five minutes when he and Steven Loules met, but Judge Steven Thompson did not agree with the Colombian statement.
The Rangers made only two hits in the first time, but the former doorkeeper of Ibrox, Liam Kelly, was hardly concerned about the hit by Lassan Kulibali's head, and the weak hit by Ovi Ejaria.
Although Libya's first goal, which was killed at the 34th minute, may or may not correspond to the game, no one can deny that they deserved it solely by their own efforts.
But again, Rangers failed to deal with Jacobs' game with the standard.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher gave the ball to Scott Robinson, who tried hard to transfer the ball to Meng to finish.
Gerard began to act on the break when he switched Kulibali to Ryan Kent, and such a replacement almost immediately resulted in an extreme semi-protector giving Morelos a passport, but the impressive Kelly remembered his line of arrest.
But Livingstone continued to attract guests into their imaginary game with Litgou and Halkett, constantly making long transfers.
The Holta team was trying to increase the gap in the final stages, but McGregor was able to block Jacobs before Litgou was transferred from the corner of the field.
Rangers, Glenn Midlton, once again needed a fine after he met Jacobs, but Thompson refused again.
Germans: Geiger's inventor
And now the page of our Awakening morning almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Hans Geiger was born in Germany that day.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity — an invention that eventually led to the creation of a device known as the Geiger accountant.
As one of the basics of science, Geiger also became one of the basics of popular culture, and this was reflected in the 1950s in the film "Colocola Kornodo", with the likes of Roman Rogers and Dale Evans — such as non-scientists — in the main roles:
The man said, "What is this thing?"
Rogers: “This Geiger counter is used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put in these earphones, you can really hear the influence of atoms produced by radioactivity in minerals.”
Evans: "That's right now!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, not only a few days before he was 63.
But his invention, called in honor of his author, is still widely used.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see anonymous cells
A new anticoagulant vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” anonymously growing cells and kill them
Part of the treatment of the vaccine is to teach the immune system to recognize anomalous cells
The method is to extract immune cells from the patient and change them in laboratory conditions
As a result of this change, cells are able to “see” the type of protein that is typical of many types of cancer, and then cells must be re-administered
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
In one patient who has been exposed to this vaccine and whose immune system has learned to recognize anomalous cells, ovarian cancer has been in remission for more than 18 months.
The method is to extract the immune cells in the patient and change them in laboratory conditions, after which the modified cells can “see” HER2 proteins, which are typical of many cancers, then the modified cells are reintroduced to the patient.
Professor J. Berzofski, U.S. National Institute for Cancer Research, Vifesda, Maryland State, claims: “The results we receive are not valid, we have a very promising vaccine”
Professor Berzofski explains: HER2 “stimulates the growth of several types of cancer”, including cancer of milk, eggs, light and colorectal cancer.
A similar method has been successful in treating leukemia. It has been used to collect immune cells in patients and their “learning” how cancer cells should be affected.
Kanya West took part in the defense of Trump in the MAGA depot after his appearance in SNL.
Everything went wrong.
Kanya West was enrolled in a studio during a Saturday concert at which he spoke for the protection of US President Donald Tramp, claiming that he would resume this post in 2020.
After the performance of his third song, entitled “The City of Pryce”, he performed, which he gave the title “Make America a Great Again”, the executive spoke out against the Democrats and supported the Trump.
“I often talk to white people, and they ask me, ‘How can you support Trump, he’s a racist?’
Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have gone away from America for a long time," said the executive.
Channel SNL made a parade with Matt Damon in the main role in which the Hollywood star ridiculed Brett Kawano's testimony to the Senate's Judicial Committee on the statements by Christine Blaise Ford about sexual harassment.
On television, they did not show how the crowd was upset by West’s speech, but this video was uploaded into social media by comics Chris Rock.
Now it's not clear if Rock has tried this step to make West laugh.
In addition, West appealed to the public about the fact that he was being ridiculed outside the scenes.
"They were kneeling down on me behind the wall.
They say don't get out of this trap.
They were really yelling at me!
Washington Examiner quotes him as saying, “And they still said that my position is not cool.”
West continues: "Do you want to know what's not cool?
Then you need love."
His comments, at least twice, drew the attention of the audience, members of the SNL actress seemed to be lost, and one man said to the publication: “All the study was closed.”
The West has been invited to replace the song by Ariane Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, the rapper McMiller, died a few days earlier.
Many have succeeded in playing Westom the song “I Love It” in the Perrier bottle suit.
West received support from the captain of the conservative group TPUSA Candis Turner, who wrote on Twitter: “One of the bravest people: SUPPORT FOR MANY”.
The leading show show Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West was just “who he is, and it’s absolutely amazing”.
“At the same time, I do not want to support anyone (by buying his music, clothing or otherwise by supporting his creativity) who, in my opinion, shares and distributes an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's a free man.
Like us," she said.
Prior to the start of the show, the rapper announced in Twitter that he had changed his name, stating that he was now “formally known as Cany West”.
He's not the first artist to change his name and walk on Diddy's feet, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and Pi Diddy.
His colleague, Snoop Dog's rapper, originally had the name Snoop Lyon, and as another example, of course, it is possible to bring an executive who recently became a legend, the Prince, who changed his name to a symbol, and then to the name of an artist known as Prince.
Attempts to charge murder for foot-and-mouth disease at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after one of his visitors had been killed in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Balihakamora, as reported by the police.
The respondent is expected to appear before the Belfast World Court on Monday.
The indictments will be considered by the Public Prosecutor ' s Office.
Kite Harrington's Tablet Game Star attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harrington is known for his role as a swinging sword by John Snow in the brutal medieval fantasy HBO "Game of thrones" series.
However, a 31-year-old actor has been hotly criticizing the stereotype of a macho, saying that such characters often inspire young people to think that in order to respect you, they must be cruel.
In his interview The Sunday Times Culture Kit said he felt that “something went wrong”, and asked how to solve the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently got married in his colleague on the film "Game of thrones", Rose Leslie, her rival, admitted that he was “very unbalanced” about the problem.
“I personally take this question quite seriously: where did we go wrong with the perception of courage?” asks the actor.
"Why do we teach teenagers that we have such a problem today?"
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for this sudden toxic courage due to too many muscle characters.
Actor continues: “What is born, and what is acquired?
What are they learning on television and on the streets, making young men feel that they should show only one particular side of courage?
I think it's really one of the biggest problems in our time, and the question is, how can we change it?
Because today with young people, there's something wrong.
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in any of the “Game of thrones”, after the series ended next summer, saying that he “ended with battalions and horses”.
Since November, Kit has been playing a leading role in the re-shooting True West Sam Shepard, who tells about the film's producer and his brother, the kidnapper.
Actor recently announced that he believes that meeting Rose's wife is the best game of thrones for him.
“I met my wife on this show, so he gave me my family and my next life,” says the actor.
Rose played the game, the subject of the passion for the character of Kita John Snow, in a fantasy series worthy of Emmy’s prize.
The couple celebrated the wedding in June 2018 at the home of Leslie in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14 per cent increase in new cases
China reported a 14 per cent increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
According to health officials, over 820,000 people are suffering from these diseases in the country.
Only around 40,000 new cases were registered in the second quarter of 2018.
In the vast majority of new cases, the disease was transmitted by sex, which indicates a change in past trends.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some areas of China as a result of the transfusion of contaminated blood.
However, the number of HIV infections was practically zero, Chinese health representatives said at a conference in the province of Yunnan.
Every year, the number of people with HIV and AIDS in China is increasing by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sex is a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexualism was decriminalized in China in 1997, but the discrimination of LGBT is still widespread.
Studies confirm that, due to the conservative values of the country, 70-90 per cent of men who have sexual relations with men are eventually married to women.
In many cases, transmission of diseases is due to insufficient protection of these sexual minorities.
Since 2003, the Government of China has promised universal access to anti-HIV drugs as part of its efforts to address this problem.
Maxine Waters objected to information on the leak of information on the guilt of the senators of the Republican Party, complaining about “dangerous lie” and “the conspiracy theory”
A member of the U.S. Parliament, Maxine Waters, denied on Saturday that one of her staff had posted personal information to three U.S. senators on the Wikipedia page of the legislators.
The Democrat from Los Angeles claims that the claims were filed by “ultra-law” experts and websites.
“A lie, a lie, and an even more deceptive lie, ” says Waters on his Twitter.
It is reported that the published information includes the address and phone numbers of the United States senators, Lindsey Graham, Southern California, Mike Lee and Orrin Hetch, Uta.
This information appeared on the Internet on Thursday and was published by an unknown person at the Capitol Hill during hearings in the Senate Commission on Indictments for Sexual Harassment against the candidate in the Brett Kavano Supreme Court.
The escape took place some time after three senators questioned Cavano.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of the communications was linked to the Waters office and provided information on the Waters staff, says Hill.
“This unwarranted claim is absolutely false,” Waters assures.
“My staff member, whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these frauds, was in no way responsible for the escape of this information.
This is an unwarranted lie.”
The Waters statement immediately criticised the Internet, including by former White House Secretary Ari Fleischer.
“It’s an angry denial, ” says Flasher.
“This means that the author has a temperament that is not suitable for work at Congress.
When you're accused of something you didn't do, why are you angry?
And you don't have to justify yourself.
Nor should we be buried in the motives of the prosecutors.
"Be cool and cool."
Flasher seemed to compare the Waters' reaction to the democratic criticism of Judge Kavano, whose critics accused him of being too angry during Thursday's hearings.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate for the Waters place in the interim elections, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
“ If this is true, it is very important, ” he writes.
In his statement, Waters wrote that her office had warned “the relevant authorities and law enforcement authorities about these frauds.
“We will make sure that the criminals are found,” she writes, “and that they bear legal responsibility for all their actions that may be destructive and dangerous to all and every one of my staff.”
Johnny English hits again — a weak parody on spy Rowen Atkinson
Today it has become a tradition to search for the meaning of Brexit in any new film in which the British is in some other way; it is also part of the new paradise Spanish Frenchman "Agent Johnny English", whose production began in 2003 and continued in 2011 with "Agent Johnny English: Recharge".
Will a self-reliance picture with the motto “evident that we are all shit” become a new attempt on national exports?
In any case, Johnny England’s rediscovery professor had his right to chaos for the second time — his name clearly implies that he is a wide-screen comic book designed for the English cinematographic audience.
Hero, of course, is a stupid secret agent who, despite his remarkable claims on the glamorous band, received a little Clouseau, Mr. Bin's drawings and a portion of this guy who put one note into the Chariots of Fire song in London in 2012 at the opening ceremony of the Olympics.
Originally, this character was created on the basis of the identity of the traveler and the mysterious “international” Atkinson, who once played in the now forgotten TV commercial Barclaycard, in which the hero left all chaos behind.
In this latest edition, JJ has one or two pleasant moments.
I liked the scene when Johnny England approached a helicopter dressed in mid - age success and the shovels were lying on his helmet.
Yes, it demonstrates the gift of Atkinson for the physical performance of comedy scenes, but the humor itself seems rather weak and strangely excessive, especially because such “serious” cinemas, such as Agent 007 and “Mission non-fulfillable”, now certainly offer comedy as an element.
The feeling that humor is for children, not adults, and for me, Johnny English crimes are not as inventive and appropriate as those of Atkinson in movies about Mr. Bine.
The constant message now is that Britain is in serious trouble.
Cyber hacker penetrated the top secret British spy network, revealing the identity of all British agents on the ground, to the horror of agent Kevin Eldon here, unfortunately, had an episodic role.
This is the last chapter for the Prime Minister, a full-blown and insistent figure already suffering from enormous political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing everything possible for the personage of Quazi Teresa May, but in the scenario there is nothing to work with.
Her intelligence advisers told her that since each active spy was compromised, she would have to withdraw from retirement.
And here on the stage is Johnny English himself, who now works as a school teacher in a post office, but also gives informal lessons in secret operational work: there are some good jokes here because English offers the skills of a rock-style spy academy.
English returns to Whitehall for emergency instruction and reunites with his former unsuccessful friend Baff, who is playing Ben Miller this time.
Buff is now a married man who is subject to the commandant of the submarine, the role of “happy hockey knicks”, in which Vicki Pepperdin is a little lost.
So Batman and Robin are back in the game because her Majesty's secret service made terrible mistakes, and they are confronted by a beautiful rock woman by Ophelia Balletov in the performance of Olga Kurilenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is dangerously under the influence of a charismatic technological billionaire who claims that he can solve British computer problems, the catcher Jason Walt, who plays Jake Lacey.
English and Buff begin their jokes with furry jokes: masked under officers, they burn a French restaurant; they create chaos, smuggling themselves on Volta's pink yacht; English produces a common anarchy, trying to use the virtual reality garniture to get to know the interior of Walt's house.
All these scenes, of course, are a nice and boring idea, but there's something very childish about it.
Very moderate things.
And, like in the case of other films by Johnny Inglesh, I couldn't help but wonder if the British cinema industry couldn't give Rouen Atkinson the role that he really is proportional to his talent?
Laborists deny that they are developing a plan to reduce the British working week to four days for a five-day salary
The Leborist Party of Jeremy Corbin is going to consider a radical plan that says that British will work four days a week, but will receive a five-day salary.
The party reportedly wants the company ' s managers to provide rescue workers from the artificial intelligence revolution with additional output.
This would allow staff members to enjoy three-day leave for the same salary.
The sources reported that the idea of “integrated” into the economic agenda of the party and would help the country ' s population to be on the side of the workers.
The Congress of Trade Unions approved a four-day working week to allow workers to benefit from the benefits of the changing economy.
A high-level source of the Laborist Party said The Sunday Times: Policy revision is expected to be announced by the end of the year.
“This will not happen at the same time, but the four-day working week is our goal, which is consistent with the Party’s approach to changing the balance in the economy for the benefit of workers, as well as the overall industrial strategy of the Party”.
The Labour Party is not the first to support this idea, since the Green Party promised a four-day working week during its 2017 pre-election campaign.
However, this desire is currently not endorsed by the majority of the Laborist party.
The representative of the Leborist Party said: “Four-day working week is not a party policy and is not considered a party”.
Tenth Chancellor John McDonnell used the Laborist conference last week to specify his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said that he was committed to breaking the authority of “unscrupulous directors” and “speculants” of municipal companies.
The plans of the auctioneer also mean that current water channel shareholders may not get their full share back, as the Laborist Government may do “teachers” on the basis of alleged offences.
He also confirmed plans to include employees in the Boards of Directors of Companies and to create Including Ownship Funds to transfer 10 per cent of the capital of private sector firms to the workforce, which would receive annual dividends of up to 500 pounds of sterling.
Lindsey Grem and John Kennedy say “60 minutes” if the FBI's investigation into Cavano can change their opinion
The FBI's investigation of the charges against Judge Bretta Kavano held a final vote on his appointment as a Supreme Judge at least weekly and asked whether the Agency's findings could encourage any of the Republican senators to support Kavano.
In an interview shown on Thursday, the correspondent, Scott Pelley, interviewed Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Grem, whether the FBI can find anything to change their opinion.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
“I went to the meeting and said I was talking to Judge Kavano.
I called him after it happened, and I blew up this information, and I said, "Did you do this?"
His answer was firm, firm and firm."
But Grem's opinion in the vote remained unforgivable.
“I am determined about Brett Kavano, and my opinion can only be changed by arguments, by action comparable to that of a dynamite,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but one thing I know is I'm sure Brett definitely denied it all," added Graham, addressing Christine Blacy Ford.
“None of those she called as witnesses could also confirm these facts.
It's been 36 years.
I have not seen anything new in it."
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and did it do anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday will be the New York Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event attended by an impressive star with an impressive mission, the end of poverty all over the world.
As early as the seventh year of the World Citizens ' Festival, tens of thousands of people have flocked to the Central Park, but not only to accommodate performers such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but also to describe the present objective of the event: eradicating extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Civilian Festival, which was opened in 2012, is the continuation of a global project to combat poverty by an international group of human rights defenders hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (if you are not willing to pay for a VIP ticket), you had to participate in volunteering or send an e-mail to the world leader, make a telephone call or perform any other or other significant actions to help raise awareness of your goal of ending poverty.
But how successful was the 12-year-old World Citizens' Festival in achieving its goal?
Is it an idea to reward people with a free visit to the concert to convince citizens to demand action, or is it just another case of so-called “clitivism” when people believe that they are making real changes by signing an online petition or sending messages on Twitter?
Global Citizen organizers claim that more than 19 million “actions” held by its supporters have been registered at the festival since 2011.
It is recalled that these actions have resulted in a commitment by world leaders to allocate funds of over $37 billion, which should affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group raised 390 commitments and announcements made as a result of its action, at least $10 billion of which had already been paid or collected.
According to the Panel, the funds allocated provided direct assistance to almost 649 million people worldwide.
One of the most important commitments is the name The Power of Nutrition: a British partnership of investors and implementing professionals committed to “helping children fully to discover their potential”, promised to provide Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the district, which was done after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the British Government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens, such as you, we can make social injustices about the lack of food in the past history,” said Ambassador Power of Nutrition Tracy Wallman during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The Group also stated that after more than 5,000 actions had been taken to encourage Britain to improve food for mothers and children, the Government had announced funding for the Food Force project, which would cover 5 million women and children through activities aimed at improving food.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on the festival's website, "Why do you think we can end the extreme poverty?"
The organizers of the Global Citizen respond: "This will be a long and difficult path that we will meet and fall from time to time.
But as in major civil rights and apartheid struggles, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Sean Mendez, Cardie B, Jeanelle Mone are some of the artists who will take part in this year's events in New York City, and his leaders will become Deborah Lee Ferness and Heu Jackman.
The United States may use the military fleet for “blocks” to prevent Russian energy exports: Minister of the Interior
U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinke said that Washington could “if necessary” resort to its military fleet to prevent Russian energy from entering the markets, including in the Middle East.
Zinke claims that Russia ' s presence in Syria, especially where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate Government, is a proposal to explore new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they want to trade energy just as they do in Eastern Europe, in southern Europe,” he says.
And according to the officer, there are certain ways and means to address this problem.
“The United States, together with our fleet, has the opportunity to ensure the openness of the seaways and, if necessary, to block their energy from entering the market,” said the Minister.
Zinke has been invited to participate in the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-commercial group that has been designated as the “power user’s voice” in the United States.
He further compared Washington ' s approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, noting that they were actually the same.
“The economic strategy of Iran and Russia is more or less efficient use and exchange of fuels,” says the Minister, calling Russia a “one-strike pony”, whose economy depends on fossil fuel.
Statements were made that the Trampa Administration had been tasked with increasing exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia with a much cheaper option for European consumers.
For this purpose, officials of the tramp administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to exit the “inappropriate” North Stream-2 pipeline project, which, according to the tramp, Berlin has made Moscow a “slip”.
In Moscow, it was repeatedly stressed that the North Stream-2 project, worth $11 billion, which should double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, was a purely economic project.
Kremlin claims that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I stress that we share the view that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry, held in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position called for a negative reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
German industrialists in the Federation of German Industry (BDI) urged the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“When a third State interferes with our energy supply, it creates a serious problem,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industry (BDI) after a recent meeting of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Senator from Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren will carefully study the potential for presidential ballots in 2020
The Senator of the State of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that he would carefully examine the possibility of a presidential ballot after the interim elections.
At the City of Holioca, Massachusetts State meeting, Warren confirmed that she would think about participating in the pre-election race.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and “start” our broken government, and for this “upside” a woman is needed,” says Warren The Hill.
“After 6 November, I will carefully consider the possibility of embalming the Presidents.”
Warren thus appreciated President Donald Tramp’s activities during the meeting: “He is leading the county in the wrong direction”.
“I’m worried about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy,” she said.
Warren is an open critic, both Trampa and his candidate for the post of Supreme Judge Brett Kavano.
On Friday, Warren wrote on his Twitter: “At last, we need to investigate the FBI before we start voting.”
However, the poll published on Thursday showed that most of Warren's voters did not think it was supposed to get into a fight in 2020.
According to a survey by the University of Saffolka/Boston Globe, fifty-eight per cent of the “probable” voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not get involved.
Thirty-two per cent of the respondents, on the contrary, support her plans.
The survey showed that the population was more supportive of former Governor Deval Patrick: 38 per cent supported his possible participation in the elections and 48 per cent opposed.
Other well-known names of Democrats, which were discussed in connection with the 2020 perspective, include former Vice-President Joe Baiden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Byiden claims he will take an official decision by January, reports the Associated Press.
Sarah Paline told about the post-traumatic stress disorder of Trac Paline at a meeting with voters of Donald Tramp
Trak Paline, 26 years old, joined the army in September, spent a year in Iraq.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night
“My son, who has returned home, is now experiencing the same thing as other families who have been suffering the consequences of the PTSD and who have been injured, and our soldiers are coming back with the injuries,” she said at a meeting with Donald Trump in Talse, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest a "battle-to-eye" and said about his son and other war veterans: "They are now returning others who have been tortured, asking questions, and are they treated with the same respect for their companions, soldiers, airplanes and any other soldier they have brought to their country."
Trac Peylin was arrested Monday in Vasilé, Alaska, and was charged with family violence against women, interfering with the violence and possession of alcohol abuse, according to Dan Bennett, a representative of the Vasila Police Department.
18 states, the District of Colombia, support the challenges of a new asylum policy
The Eighteen States and the District of Colombia support the legal challenge of a new US policy that prohibits the provision of asylum to refugees or domestic violence.
According to NBC News, representatives of 18 states and the county provided an analytical note on Friday in Washington on the support of the asylum seeker who was in dispute with the policy.
The full name of the complainant in the application “Grace v. Sessions”, submitted by the American Union for Civil Liberties in August against federal policy, is not disclosed.
The woman claims that her civil husband “and his sons in the criminal group” have been subjected to ill-treatment, but on 20 July, US officials refused her asylum request.
She was arrested in Texas.
State counsels supporting Grace said that El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala submitted a large number of applications for asylum in the United States, such as countries facing widespread problems with criminal groups and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy had repealed the decision taken by the Immigration Appeals Council in 2014, which allowed immigrants without domestic violence-free documents to apply for asylum.
The District Attorney General, Columbia, Karl Rasin, stated in his statement on Friday that the new policy “ignores the decades of application of State, federal and international law”.
“The federal law requires that all asylum applications be examined on the basis of specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a prohibition violates this principle,” says the judicial adviser.
Lawyers also claim that the policy prohibiting immigrants from entering the United States is damaging to the economy, stressing that this is the category of citizens that is more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provides the necessary labour force”.
In June, Attorney-General Jeff Sashns ordered immigration judges no longer to provide asylum to victims of domestic or gang violence.
“The asylum will be granted to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear because of their race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political belief”, Sass said in his statement of 11 June.
This tool has never been designed to solve absolutely all the problems, even the most serious people face every day in the world.
Desperate efforts to save people in Pala: the number of deaths doubled in search of survivors
The situation became increasingly difficult for survivors.
“It’s very difficult now,” says a 35-year-old mother named Risa Kusum, comforting her sick child at the evacuation center of the devastated city of Pala.
“A quick help every minute will bring the wounded.
Clean water in great deficits."
People return to their ruined homes, dig in wet things, and try to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and patients affected by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake were overloaded.
Some of the wounded, including Two Harris, who had broken the bell and shoulder, were resting near the Pala's army hospital, where patients were treated in the open air because they had to leave the room because of the continuing strong pulls.
He cried, recalling how a terrible earthquake destroyed the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he had recorded with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time for salvation.
I think I was pushed into the wall, ” says Harris Associated Press, explaining that his family had come to the city for the wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming, asking for help, and then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and our baby.
I hope they are saved, and now they are all good."
The US Ambassador accuses China of “attacks” carried out by “propaganda”
A week after one of China ' s official newspapers published an advertisement on four pages in a daily American publication, describing the mutual benefit of trade between the United States and China, the US Ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
Last Wednesday, President of the United States, Donald Trump, referred to the payment of the Des Moines Register China Daily, the largest commercial newspaper edition of the state of Iowa, in an attempt to interfere with the US Congress, which will take place on 6 November.
Trampa ' s accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere with the US elections is a confirmation of the fact that U.S. officials have reported to the Reuters agency: a new phase is taking place in the intensifying Washington campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is the custom for foreign Governments to place advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in a state of trade war escalation, thus balancing tariffs on imports from their countries.
The Chinese tariffs responsible at the beginning of the trade war were intended to strike exporters in states such as Iowa, which supported the Republic of Trump, said Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, US Ambassador to China and former long-term Governor Ayova, a major exporter of agricultural products in China, claims that Beijing has damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, writes Branstad in an article published in the resurrection magazine Des Moines Register, “now doubles this grass by placing propaganda advertising in our own free press”.
“By spreading its propaganda, the Government of China takes advantage of our heart’s American tradition of freedom of speech and free press, paying and placing advertising at the Des Moines Register,” says Branstad.
“At the same time in newspapers here, on the streets of Beijing, you will hardly hear unconcerned voices and you will not see the true diversity of views that the Chinese could learn about China’s alarming economic policy, because local media are under the strict control of the Communist Party of China,” he writes.
He also added that one of the most well-known Chinese newspapers was “slowly rejected” from the proposal to publish its article, although it did not bring the exact name of the publication.
Analysts warn: the proportion of Kawano Republicans is reflecting women voters prior to the interim period
Many high-ranking Republicans prefer to remain on the side and defend the candidacy of Supreme Judge Brett Kavano, despite a number of allegations of sexual violence; analysts warn that there is a negative reaction, especially from women, which may affect the upcoming interim elections.
The emotions around the situation have become very intense, and most of the Republicans have officially stated that they want to continue to vote.
You can’t go back to such things later, ” writes Grant Reer, professor of political science at Maxwell’s University of Syracuse, in his article published on Saturday.
Reier doubted that Senator Jeff Fleke (R-Arizona) ' s attempts to investigate the FBI in the last minute would be sufficient to calm the angry voters.
“Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday, they won’t forget about it tomorrow or November,” said Karin Jean-Pierer, Senior Adviser and National Representative of the Progressive Group MoveOn Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, protesters challenged November forward! On the contrary, the Senate, when Republicans under the control of the Judicial Committee decided to apply for Qavano, despite Dr. Christine Blacy Ford's testimony, reports Mic.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go beyond the limits,” said unpartisan politician Stu Rottenberg on the news site.
“People say that the situation has been so bad enough, and it is true.
But everything can get worse, especially with regard to female voters in parks and young voters, from 18 to 29 years of age, who, although they don’t like the President, often do not vote.”
Even before Ford publicly protested against the candidate as a senior judge, accusing him of sexual harassment, analysts suggested that if the Republicans confirmed the movement, this step could cause a reaction.
“It’s already a mess for the Republican Party,” said Michael Steel, former president of the Republican National Committee at the beginning of last week, as NBC News reports.
“It is not only about voting in committee or final voting or whether Kavano is on the scale of the defendants, but also about how the Republicans deal with how they deal with it,” says Gai Cecil, Director of Priorities USA, a group that helps choose Democrats, a news channel.
Nevertheless, the Americans seem to have divided a few into whom to believe — Ford or Cavano — and to hear more about the latter.
The new YouTube survey shows that 41 per cent of respondents believe in Ford's statements exactly or most likely, while 35 per cent said that they believe in Kavano exactly or most.
In addition, 38 per cent believe that Kavano was more likely to lie at the time of his testimony, while only 30 per cent said the same about Ford.
According to Flemish FBI, the charges against Ford and at least another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, are currently being investigated, reports The Guardian.
Last week, Ford swore to the Senate Legal Committee that Kavano, being in a state of drunkenness, attacked her when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the post of Supreme Judge showed her her genitals at the party during her training at Yeel University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wisdom plans to launch a new Internet for Google and Facebook
Team Berners-Lei, the inventor of the World Cup, launches a startup that claims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technological legend project, Inrupt, is a company based on the open Berners-Lee Solid platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people to access what information.
In an exclusive interview, Fast Company Berners-Li joked that the goal of Inrupt was to gain “world domination”.
“We have to do this now,” he says about his start-up.
“This is a historic moment”.
The annex uses Solid technology, which enables people to create their own “personal data storage” or POD.
It may include contact lists, business lists, calendars, music library and other personal and professional tools for working with data.
The application works on the same principle as Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify — everything can be used in a browser at the same time.
The uniqueness of the personal data store is that it is fully managed by a user who can access any necessary information.
The company calls this principle “personal empowerment through data”.
According to General Director John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is that the company has provided resources, processes and skills to make Solid available to all.
Currently, Berners Lee, Bruce, the security platform purchased by IBM, several state developers with whom the project contract is concluded, and the community of volunteer programmers.
As of this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners Lee said that he and his team did not negotiate with Facebook and Google about whether his company needed to make radical changes, which would make all their business models completely different.
“We do not ask for their permission.”
In his post to the Medium, published on Saturday, Bernards Lee wrote that “Inrupt mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of a new solid-based network”.
In 1994, Berners-Li transformed the Internet, creating a World Wide Web consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Over the past months, Berners-Li's voice has been quite influential in the debate on net neutrality.
Even starting Inrupt, Berners Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Internet Fund and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about this next Internet era,” says Berners-Lei.
Bernard Vann: Church servant, awarded Victorian cross during World War I
In the history of the Anglican Church, only one warrior priest was awarded the cross of Victoria during World War I, and this event was observed in his hometown 100 years later.
Colonel Prefect Bernard Vann was rewarded with this award on 29 September 1918 for participating in the attack on Bellenglis and Luukur.
Unfortunately, he was killed by a sniper four days later, so he never realized that he had received the highest British military award.
The memorial in honor of this event was celebrated by his two grandsons at the parade in Rusden, North Hamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said that it was “significant”, that the monument was opened just 100 years after his grandfather received the award.
According to the London newspaper of 29 September 1918, Colonel Vann carried out his battalion through the San Canten Canal “in a very dense fog and under a strong fire of field weapons and rifles”.
Later, he threw himself on the fire and led the group forward with “a great deal of courage, ” and then with one hand he fired a field gun, beating three troops in the unit.
Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, more than a month before the end of the war.
72-year-old hero Michael Vann said that “he could hardly do the same heroic thing, but it calmed down”.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, were also appointed as a ward on the end of the parade led by the Imperial Youth Orchestra, Brentwood.
Michael Vann said that “it is a great honor for him to participate in the parade” and added that “the skill of the true hero is confirmed by the support that will be given to many people”.
MMA worshipers didn't sleep all night to see Bellator 206, but instead they showed them the lead of Peppu.
Imagine that you didn't sleep all night to see the full Bellator 206, but you didn't get to see the main event.
The San José Table contained 13 battles, including six main program battles, broadcast all night in the straight air on the 5 British television channels.
At six o'clock in the morning, when Gegard Musasi and Rory McDonald were ready for the meeting, British patients were shocked to see on the screens "Swink Peppa".
Some sufferers were not impressed by this; they did not sleep until morning just to see the battle.
One of the fans on Twitter called this change in the news on a child’s multifilm “some sick joke”.
“It was a state decision that this content was inappropriate for 6 hours tomorrow, so they had to switch to children’s programmes,” said Dave Schwarz, Senior Vice-President Bellator of Marketing and Communications, when asked why it happened.
"Yes, "Sweet Peppa."
The president of Bellator Scott Koker said that they are planning to make a schedule so that future battles can also be viewed by viewers from Britain.
“As for the re-display, I think we will be able to resolve this issue,” Koker says.
"But there will be a Sunday, six o'clock in the morning, and we will not be able to resolve this until a Monday, and it will be Monday for them.
But we'll do our best.
Believe it or not, when the message was changed, a bunch of text messages fell down, and all of them were far from friendly.
We were just trying to solve this problem, and we thought it was some kind of technical failure.
It turns out that it was a matter of public importance.
I promise that this will not happen the next time.
We're going to reduce the number of battles to five instead of six, as we usually do, and for fans we're trying to increase that number, but we've got a rebound.
Yes, well done."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daily experienced feelings of inadequacies due to his sexual orientation
The Olympic driver Tom Dale says he grew up feeling worse because of his sexuality, but that's what gave him the motivation to be successful.
The 24-year-old sportsman said he didn't understand that “not all are like him” until he went to high school.
Speaking in the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs program, led by Lauren Lavern, he said it was about gay rights to give hope to others.
He also said that victory at the Olympics had become less of a concern since he had a child.
The permanent leader of the multi-year show Kirsty Yang took leave for several months because of his illness.
Dale, who was the main guest of Lavern's program, said that he felt “more harmful than any of the peers” because his sexual orientation was considered unacceptable to society, both for boys and girls.
He says, “To this day, these feelings of worthlessness and worthlessness have been real, but they have given me strength, and I have succeeded.”
He wanted to prove that he was “something” so as not to disappoint everyone when they finally learned about his sexual orientation.
A double bronze Olympic medalist became a known LGBT activist and, in his speech at the Commonwealth Games in Australia, called on countries to decriminalize homosexuality this year.
He said that he expressed his opinion because he was happy that he could live an open life without consequences and wanted to give others “a hope. ”
A three-time world champion said that the feelings of the man, American director Dustin Lans Black, whom he met in 2013, “remained in his frustration”.
Last year, Dale got married at the Oscar laureate, who was 20 years older than him, but claimed that the difference in age was never a problem.
“If you have so much to do in your life,” he went to his first Olympics at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later, “it’s hard to find an equalist who would have the same heart-to-heart opposite life experience.
The couple became parents in June, and they had a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Dale said that “all his world views” had changed.
"If you asked me last year, it would be all about "I need to win a gold medal," says a sportsman.
"But you know what, there are things and more important gold Olympic medals.
My Olympic Gold Medal is Robbie."
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Dale told me that his father did not want to settle for his death, and one of his last requests was the first round of London 2012 competition tickets.
"I couldn't tell him, 'Dad, you'd never be around, and you wouldn't be able to sit there in the first row,' says Daily.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only when he actually stopped breathing did I finally realize that he was not invincible,” says a sportsman.
The following year, Dale participated in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
“I just knew that what I had dreamed of all my life was not a better feeling in front of a lot of compatriots at the Olympics, ” he says.
It also inspired him to choose the first favorite song — Proud by Heather Small — that helped him prepare for the Olympics and that he still likes it.
Desert Island Discs, BBC Radio 4, Thursday, 11:15 in English summer time.
Mikelson, not in shape, spent this Saturday on the Kubka Ryder on the rock
The American Phil Mikelson will set a record on Sunday, played his 47th Cup of Ryder match, but he will have to push the shape to avoid an unpleasant turn.
Mikelson, who played the biennale for the 12th record, was sent to the four-ball and four-quarters on Saturday by Captain Jim Furik.
Instead of being at the centre of events, as was often the case in the United States, the five-time winner divided his day between watching the game and working over his own game in the field in order to correct what was bothering him.
He never had the most direct hit, even at the top of his career, a 48-year-old athlete was not the ideal candidate for the Le Golf National hard track, where a long rap is usually punishable for inaccurate hits.
And if the course itself is not scary enough, Michaelson will meet with the British Open Francis Molinari on Sunday in the ninth match, who joined new Tommy Flitwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans who have lost four points in the 12th single match make a great start, the Mikelson match can be a decisive one.
Feric expressed confidence in his partner, although he could still say so.
“He fully understood the role he played today, hit me in the back, hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” said Ferik.
"He's pretty sure of himself.
He's a hall of praise, and he's done so much for these teams both last week and this week.
I probably didn't think he was playing two matches.
I was hoping for more, but that's how it was, and that's how we decided to go.
He wants to be there with everyone."
On Sunday, Mikelson will win Nick Foldo's record for the number of players in the Ryder Cube.
This could mark the end of a career in Cube Ryder, which never corresponded to the heights of his individual record.
Mikelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven defeats, although Feric said his presence had little benefit to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, cruel, he likes to educate people, and he’s a great guy with whom he’s interesting,” he explained.
“I think that this week the young players had fun with him, and it was interesting to see.
His game is much more than just a game.”
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great advantage can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a significant single-level leadership in the Cube Ryder can easily turn into an unfavourable side.
The Dutchman won the game in 1997 in Walderram, where the team headed by Northern Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but overcame the ultimate goal just to hear ahead with the least difference, won with a score of 141 1⁄2 to 131 1⁄2.
“You will continue to remind yourself that we have had a great advantage in Walderram; we have had a great advantage in Brooklyn where we have lost, and in Walderram where we have won, but only so far,” said Bjorn, printed on the photo, after looking at the 2018 Class, won at the Le Golf National field with an account 5-3 on Friday and yesterday, which resulted in an account 10-6.
So history will prove to me and to the whole team that it's not over yet.
Tomorrow you're going to go full.
Go and do everything right.
Until the eyes are placed on the board, nothing is finished.
We have a goal, and this is a chance to win the trophy, and that's exactly what we need to focus on.
I have not spoken in silence, focusing on the 12 games of our team, but we know so well that we are against what we are against – against the greatest games of the world.”
Glad that his toys had made a golf course for them, Bjorn added: "I would never have done it.
We're gonna have another test tomorrow.
Individual speeches are starting tomorrow, and this is quite another matter.
It's always nice to be with your partner when things go well, but when you're there alone, you experience all your professional golfer's strength.
That is exactly what it takes for the players to be put to full tomorrow.
Now the partner remains behind, and he must also make every effort.”
Unlike Bjorn, his rival, Jim Ferrik, believes that his individual games would be better than his partners, except for Jordan Spita and Justin Thomas, who took three of the four points.
Féric himself has gone through all this carousel in the last few days, becoming part of the winning team in Brooklyn before finally losing when Europe held the Wonder in Medina.
“I remember every damn word about it,” he said, in response to the question of how Ben Krenshaw, captain in 1999 had intertwined his toys before the last day.
“We have 12 important players tomorrow, but you would like to finish everything faster than in Brooklyn, like in Medina.
When the initiative moves on one side, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle of the match.
We have set up our game plan accordingly and arranged for the boys as we thought was right, you know? Tomorrow we will try to create a miracle.”
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the resistance by meeting with Rory McKilrow at the top match with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Flitwood and Ayan Polter, as well as other European games from the top of the tournament table.
“I have chosen this group of guys, and so on, because I think they will cover all possible shortcomings in this way,” said Bjorn, commenting on his selection of individual players.
Implementation of the new German military ship is delayed again
The new German fleet fleet had to be put into operation in 2014 to replace the old warships of the Cold War, but this would not happen at least in the following year due to incorrect systems and price increases, local media reported.
The launch of Rainland-Pfalz, the main ship, is completely new to the Baden-Württemberg class, now delayed until the first half of 2019, reports Die Zeit with reference to a military representative.
The vessel had to join the fleet in 2014, but the problems that arose after delivery had made the fate of an ambitious project more difficult.
The four Baden-Wurttemberg ships ordered by the military fleet in 2007 will be replaced by the old Bremen-class frigates.
They will be known to have a powerful rifle, multiple zenite and anti-corrosive missiles, as well as some “steel” technologies, such as reduced radiolocation, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer service periods — the possibility of the deployment of the new ones for up to two years away from domestic ports.
However, the continued postponement of entry into service means that the most modern warships that speak of allowing Germany to distribute its power abroad will already expire by the time they enter into arms, notes Die Zeit.
The F125 crash was reported last year when the German naval fleet officially refused to operate the ship and returned it to Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time the fleet returned to the shipyard after delivery.
There was little information about the reasons for the return, but the German media referred to a number of critical “programm and equipment defects”, which made the warship useless in the use of combat.
The lack of software was particularly critical, since the Baden-Württemberg class court would operate with a crew of about 120 sailors — only half the working force on the old Bremen class.
In addition, it was found that the ship was too heavy, which reduced its productivity and limited WFP ' s ability to introduce future updates.
It is estimated that the 7,000 tons of Rhineland-Palatinate is twice as heavy as ships of a similar class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty equipment, the cost of the whole project, including team training, is also a problem.
It is said that it has reached EUR 3.1 billion (US$ 3.6 billion) compared to the initial EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems of maintaining the anchors of the latest refrigerations have become particularly important in the light of recent warnings about the reduction of German military and maritime forces.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartelles, the head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, admitted that the military forces had actually “saved ships capable of deploying”.
The officer said that the problem over time had been aggravated because the old ships had been removed from service, but their ships had not been replaced.
He was visiting that none of the Budden-Wurttemberg refrigerations could have been taken over by the fleet.
National Trust Hears the Secret Life of Flying Mouse
A new study carried out in one of the areas of the Scottish Gorgeous is designed to show how flying mice use landscapes in search of food.
It should be hoped that the data received will be able to re-examine the behavior of unique winged mammals and help to continue species conservation activities.
The study organized by scientists from the National Fund of Scotland will study conventional bats, soprano bats, as well as brown long-flight mice and Dobanton Nights, inhabitants of Inverewe Gardens, West Ross.
Special registrants will be established at some points around the site to monitor flying mice throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile site surveys using manual detectors.
The expert sound analysis of all records will determine the frequency of screams, as well as the types of activities for which different groups of these animals are responsible.
A map of the environment will then be drawn up and a record will be prepared to provide a detailed picture of their landscape-wide behaviour.
Rob Dwar, NTS Nature Conservation Advisor, hopes that these results will show what habitats are most important for flying mice and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to identify the main areas of the management of the habitat, such as the formation of people, as well as ways to maintain forest masses, optimal for flying mice and other related species.
The populations of flying mice in Scotland and throughout Britain have declined significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by disappearances due to construction and development that affect their habitat and the loss of their habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting installations may pose a risk, as well as a fly stick, chemical processing of building materials and hunting of household baskets.
In fact, flying mice are not blind.
However, their nightly habits are so useful that their ears are more useful than eyes when it comes to catching.
They use complex eco-location techniques to accurately identify obstacles to flight.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 significant gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, is very serious about the population of flying mice.
Ten trained experts are working in the organization, who regularly carry out interviews, check-outs, and sometimes rescue work.
The organization even created the first and only reservation in Scotland of flying mice at Thrave in Damfris and Gallowee, where eight of the ten species of Scottish flying mice live.
The real estate manager of David Thompson said that the property was an ideal territory for them.
“Here, in Thrave, a great place for flying mice,” he says.
“There are old buildings, many old trees and all the elements of good housing.
But many of the flying mice remain unknown, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us to understand better what they need to survive.”
It recalls the importance of checking the presence of flying mice prior to the provision of technical services within private possession, as the unintentional destruction of one nest could lead to the deaths of 400 males and young people, and perhaps even to the destruction of the entire local population.
Flying mice are protected by law, destruction, rubbing or destruction of their habitats are illegal.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish officer of the Flying Mouse Conservation Fund, calls on the public to help.
She said: "There is still much to know about our flying mice, and we do not know how many of them live."
Ronald denies charges of rape and his lawyers are going to trial a German magazine
Kristian Ronald denies charges of rape against him, calling them “faecal news”, and claims that people simply want to “clean up”, using his name.
His lawyers are going to trial the German news magazine Spigel, who has been charged with football.
Forvard Portugal and Yuventusa were accused of rape by an American named Catherine Mayorg, who allegedly took place in the Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375.000 to talk about the incident, reported on Friday to Spigel.
Speaking in a video in Instagram, which featured 142 million signatories, several hours after the charges were reported, 33-year-old Ronald described this information as “faecal news”.
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they told today is all fake news, says the fifth winner of Ballon d'Or on the camera.
“They just want to clean up using my name.
It's okay.
They want to be famous, my name is spoken, but it's just part of their work.
I'm a happy man, and I'm good at it," adds a sportsman with a smile.
Ronald's lawyers are prepared to file charges against Spiegel, which they called “unallowable information on confidentiality suspicions”, according to Reuters.
Counsel Christian Shertz said that the game was intended to claim compensation for “moral damage to the extent relevant to the seriousness of the legal violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years”.
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino hotel in Las Vegas.
When he met at the nightclub, Ronald and Majorg reportedly returned to the playroom, where he allegedly raped her in an annal form, according to the documents submitted to the Clark District Court in Nevada.
Majorga claims that after the alleged incident, Ronald fell on her knees and told her that he was “99 per cent good, but had a one-percent drop”.
The documents state that Ronald confirmed that the couple had been engaged in sex, but that was by mutual consent.
Majorga also claims that she has turned to the police and that her trauma was taken to the hospital, but later she agreed to an extrajudicial solution because she felt “fear that she would be vindictive” and was afraid of “public humiliation”.
The 34-year-old woman said that she was now trying to change her place of residence, as she continued to experience the painful feelings caused by the alleged incident.
Ronald was going to join Real Madrid from Manchester United during the alleged attack, but this summer he moved to the Italian giants Ywe in a transaction of 100 million euros.
Brexit: United Kingdom “feels sorry for automakers who have been lost forever”
Business and Business Minister Greg Clark said that Britain would “feel sorry for this forever” if after Brexit lost its world-leading car production status.
He also commented on the information that Toyota UK reported to the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its plant in Bernastan, near Derby.
"We need a deal," says Mr. Clark.
The Japanese auto manufacturer stated that the consequences of delays on the border in the absence of a Brexit transaction could lead to job losses.
The Toyota Auris and Avensis plant in Bernaton produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90 per cent of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I believe that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our plant will be stopped,” says Marvin Cook, Managing Director of Toyota in Bernaston.
Other car manufacturers in Britain expressed concerns about leaving the EU without an international trade agreement, including on Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, states that it will close the Mini plant in Oxford within a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are that, according to auto producers, if Brexit does not have a deal, the supply chain will be at high risk.
The Toyota production line is launched “in due time” and the vehicle details are supplied by UK and EU suppliers every 37 minutes.
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without a deal, there may be a failure on the border, which, according to industry representatives, may lead to delays and delays.
According to the company, Toyota will not be able to keep stocks at its factory in Derbishir for a day and therefore production will be stopped.
Mr. Clark said that Teresa May's plan, called in Checkers, on future relations with the EU was "just calibrated to avoid these border checks".
“We need a deal. We want to conclude the best agreement that will allow us not only to succeed at present, but also to take advantage of this opportunity in the future,” he told BBC Radio 4 "Today".
“Not only Toyota, but other manufacturers also claim that we must be able to continue the successful supply chains.”
Toyota was unable to specify the time limit for which production would be stopped, but in the longer term it had warned that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and eventually lead to a reduction in jobs.
Peter Cuallaris, who has worked in Bernaton for 24 years and is the head of the trade union, says that the concern of members of the organization is growing: “In my experience, if we lose these jobs, we will no longer be able to return them.”
The representative of the Government said: “We have developed a precise and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU.”
The Trampa meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again, according to the White House
The responsible meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein can be “transferred to another week”, as the fight for Brett Kavano’s candidacy continues to be held as the Supreme Judge, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein is sponsoring the work of Special Adviser Robert Muller, who is investigating Russia ' s involvement in the elections, the links between Trampa and Russia ' s assistants and the potential obstacles to the President ' s justice.
Whether Trump would resign from the post of Deputy Attorney-General, thus jeopardizing Muller's independence, Washington had caused a mass of suspicions for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the use of the wire to record talks with Trump and the President's implications with Amendment 25.
Rosenstein denies this information.
Last Monday, however, he went to the White House allegedly to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday, which was then in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he would “not” prefer to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid clashing with the Senate's judicial committee, where Kavano and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr.
On Friday, Trump was scheduled to conduct a weekly inquiry into the FDB's complaints in Kavanano, which further delayed the full vote in the Senate.
Press Secretary Trump, Sarah Sanders, delivered Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “The date of this meeting has not yet been appointed, it may be this week, or it may be postponed for another week, taking into account all other developments in the Supreme Court.”
But let's see, and I always prefer to keep the press up."
Some journalists contest this claim: Sanders has not been briefing the White House since 10 September.
Chief Chris Wallace was wondering why.
Sanders says that the lack of briefings is not caused by the “sight of the community” of television reporters, although she added: “I will not deny that they are playing in public”.
She suggested increasing the number of direct contacts between trampo and the press.
“The President holds more meetings in response to the questions of journalists than any other president before him”, she added, without bringing the exact figures, “We have these figures.”
Sanders assured that the briefings would continue, but “if the press is able to directly ask questions to the President of the United States, it is much better than talking to me.”
We are trying to do this as often as possible, and you know how many meetings we have held in the last few weeks, and if you can speak directly to the President of the United States, this is a worthy exchange of press briefings.”
The tramp regularly responds to questions from the White House, participating in open meetings or press conferences with high-level individuals.
The conference is only for the press.
The President's strange behavior in front of the journalists gathered this week in New York may be the answer.
The Minister of Health addressed EU workers in Scotland with a letter on concerns about Brexit
The Minister of Health has approached EU staff working in the Scottish GSP to express appreciation for the country ' s appointment and wish them to remain in their post after Brexit.
Gin Freeman, MSP, addressed staff less than six months before Britain left the EU with this letter.
The Government of Scotland has already undertaken to cover the cost of making statements of status for EU citizens working in its public services.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: “The negotiations between Britain and the EU on exit continued during the summer, and this autumn a decision must be reached.
However, the British Government is also strengthening the preparation for a possible scenario with no transactions.
I know this must be a very worrying time for all of you.
That is why I would like to stress once again how much I appreciate the contribution of each staff member, regardless of his nationality.
Members of the EU as a whole and beyond will gain valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve health services and benefit the patients and communities that we serve.
Scotland is, of course, your home, and we really want you to stay here."
Kristian Abercromby had an emergency surgery for head injury
Michael The Tennessee Authority reported that the Tennessee State Tigers semi-defence officer Christian Abercromby had undergone an emergency operation after a head trauma on Saturday after defeating 31-27 in a match with the Vanderbilt Commodores.
The chief coach of Tennessee Rod Reed told reporters that the trauma had been received shortly before the break.
"He went to the side line and just went there," said Reed.
Coaches and medical personnel gave Abercromby oxygen on the side line before putting it on the carrier and taking it to medical examination.
The official representative of the state of Tennessee told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercromby had performed an operation at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “there are no details of the type/degree of the injury”, and Tennessee is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
For Abercrombie, only in second grade, this was the first season of Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
On Saturday, before leaving the game, he successfully captured five balls, which amounted to 18 balls per season.
Foreign buyers will pay a higher levy on the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom.
According to the new Tori plans, a higher purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom will be made from foreign buyers and additional funds will be used to help homeless people.
This step leads to the absence of Corbin's attempts to attract young voters
Increased herbage collection will be taken from those who do not pay taxes in Britain
The Treasury expects it to raise up to 120 million pounds a year for homeless people
Foreign buyers will be charged with a higher levy on the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom, and additional funds will be used to help homeless people, as Teresa May will announce today.
This step leads to no attempt by Corbin to attract young voters who promise to make housing more accessible and raise citizens' income.
The increase in herbage will be taken from individuals and non-tax firms in the United Kingdom, and the additional funds thus provided should stimulate the Government ' s efforts to assist homeless citizens.
The supplement to the existing herb collection, including the increase introduced two years ago for the acquisition of secondary and rental housing, may amount to up to three per cent.
The Treasury expects that this step will cover up to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of new London properties are purchased by non-British residents, which leads to price increases and makes it difficult for buyers who purchase their first apartment to improve their housing conditions later.
Many of the country's elite areas, especially in the capital, have become “presiding cities” because of the large number of foreign buyers who, after buying housing, spend most of their time abroad.
A new policy was developed a few weeks later, after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in herb collection to help more young people acquire their first home.
He accused large construction firms of undermining real estate prices by purchasing land, but not actually using them, and called on Ms. May to give up the quota for affordable housing in order to correct the “constant housing situation” in Britain.
Mr. Corbin announced a number of proposed positive housing reforms that would include rental control and termination of unwarranted eviction.
He also wants to give local authorities more authority to build new houses.
Ms. May said: “Last year, I said that I had dedicated my prime minister to the British dream of becoming a better life for every new generation.
And that includes solving problems in our housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build life here.
However, it is unfair that people who are not citizens of the United Kingdom, as well as foreign companies, have the same access to real estate as those who are working for the British.
For too many people, the idea of buying their own home has become too far away and the danger of some being on the street is too real.
Jack Ross: “My ultimate goal is to run Scotland”
Boss Club Sunderland Jack Ross says that his “final goal” is to become at some stage the manager of Scotland.
The 42-year-old Scottish is pleased with the reinstatement of the North-East Club, which is currently taking the third place in the first league, separating the three-point championship.
This summer he moved to the Stadium of Light after returning St. Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I wanted to fight for my country as a player.
I've got a B and everything," said Ross Sportsound BBC Scotland.
“But I grew up watching my father with my childhood behind Scotland in Hampden, and it always drew me back.
However, this option will only occur if I can be a successful club manager.”
The predecessors of Ross, the managers of Sunderland were also Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardis, Martin O'Neil, Roy Kein, Gas Poet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former manager Alloa Athletic said that he had not experienced any such credentials in such large clubs since he had previously declined the Barnsley and Ipswich Town proposals.
“For me, success at this point will depend on whether I can get this club back to the Premier League.
According to its structure and possibilities, this club is undoubtedly part of the Premier League," said the coach.
“To get him there is an easy task, but I’ll take it as my task, only if I can get the club back.”
Ross has served as manager for only three years, first as assistant manager at Dumbarton, then for 15 months at the Hearts Training Centre.
He then helped Alloa rise from the third level and the next season brought St. Mirren out of the lowest positions in the championship winners.
Ross claims that he feels more comfortable today than ever during his career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“It was probably this crossroads,” he recalls his responsibility at Alloa.
“I sincerely believed that the management was more suitable than the game.
That sounds strange because I did everything well, worked well on this job, and achieved some success.
But the game is more complicated.
There are a lot of things that need to be done every week.
I'm still under stress at work, but I'm feeling good about the manager's office.
I always wanted to lead, and now, doing so, I feel most comfortable like a fish in the water for the rest of my adult life."
You can listen to a full interview at Sportsound on Friday, September 30, on Scotland's radio from 12:00 to 13:00 in English summer time.
According to the survey, 17:30 is the ideal time for beer paint
The summer heat increased the sales of British pubs, but reduced the sales of restaurants.
According to statistics, sales in pubs and bars increased by 2.7 per cent in July and fell by 4.8 per cent in restaurants.
Peter Martin of the CGA Business Consulting Company, which received this statistics, said: “Sustainable solar activity, as well as longer than expected, participation by England in the World Championship, means that July continued the trend of the previous month, June, when sales in pubs increased by 2.8 per cent, and in restaurants, on the contrary, significantly decreased.”
The fall in income in restaurant trade by 1.8 per cent continued in July.
The pubs and bars selling alcohol showed much higher results compared to restaurants.
Dads selling food were also affected by the heat of the sun, even though they were not as strong as restaurants.
The feeling is that people want to jump out of the street just to miss the bottle.
Sales of drinks in pubs and bars increased by 6.6% per month and food by 3%."
Paul Newman, an RSM analyst in the field of leisure and hotel business, says: “These results continue to be the trend that we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sports activities remain crucial when it comes to sales in the poor market.
It is not surprising that restaurant networks continue to experience difficulties, as sales drop of 4.8 per cent per annum will be particularly painful due to ongoing price pressure.
The long hot summer has proved to be as never before for food operators, and it is not yet the fact that August will bring more moderate temperatures, will give the necessary advances.”
The overall increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including reopened ones, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting a slowdown in branding.
Sectoral sales monitoring Coffer Peach Tracker for the British pub, bar and restaurant sector collects and analyzes the productivity of 47 networks with a total turnover of more than 9 billion pounds of sterling and is a recognized industry benchmark.
Every fifth child has secret accounts on social media that he hides from his parents
According to the survey, every fifth child — some of whom are 11 years old — has secret accounts on social media that he hides from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in the faecal instincts page
This novelty raised concerns about sexual content
Twenty per cent of students said they have a “basic” account that parents know about
However, each fifth child — some of whom are 11 years of age — creates accounts in societies that he or she hides from adults.
The survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid increase in the number of faecal “insts” accounts, i.e. Instagram, a photo exchange site.
This novelty has raised concerns about publications of a sexual nature.
Twenty per cent of students said they had a basic, “clean” account that their parents had access to, but also had secret accounts.
One mother, who accidentally got access to her 13-year-old daughter's secret account, was caught there by a teenager who called on others to “seek him out”.
A study conducted by the Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Independent Directors of Schools (HMC) showed that 40 per cent of children between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles in societies, half of which were recognized as being usually secret.
HMC Head Mike Bukenen says: “Many teenagers are trying to create online spaces that are not available to their parents and teachers, and this is a worrying fact”.
Elid Doyle will become a “voice of sportsmen” of Scotland’s light athletics
At the annual general meeting of the governing body, Elid Doyle was elected to the Board of Directors of Scotland's Light Athletics as an observer member of the Board of Directors.
Doyle, Scotland's most well-known sportsman on easy-to-sports. President Yen Bitty claims that this step is an excellent opportunity for sports managers to take advantage of the extensive experience of international sports in the last decade.
“Aylide enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and world easy-to-eat community, and we are confident that it will benefit greatly from easy-to-eat sports in Scotland,” Beatty says.
Doyle says: “I strive to become a voice of athletes, and I hope that I can really make a good contribution and contribute to the development of sports in Scotland.”
The American, who won 200 metres and 400 metres in the 1996 Atlante Games, has a total of four gold Olympic medals, and now works as a row commentator on BBC, has lost his ability to walk after the stroke.
He writes on his Twitter: "The stroke happened to me a month ago.
I've lost my ability to move.
The doctors said it'd only take time to see if I could fix it, and if so, to what extent.
It was exhausting work, but I recovered completely, learned to walk again, and today I am doing the exercises of greed!
Thank you very much for your support."
The advertising of milk-breeding mothers compared to cows divided the user’s views on the Internet
The dairy production company has created online disputes and published an advertisement that compares nursing mothers to dairy cows.
Elvie has published an advertising music video that demonstrates the freedom that the new milk cake provides to nursing mothers.
Four real moms are dancing in a full haystack under a musical track, where they say, "Yes, I'm feeding my own milk, but you won't see my tail" and "If you haven't noticed, it's not my breast."
And there are others who say: "We are guided, we are guided; we feed our young men with milk; we are guided and we are guided."
This advertising role, which was published on the Facebook company's website, led to online disputes.
77,000 reviews and hundreds of comments: the video has received a mixed response from the viewers, and many say it sheds light on the “fears” of the dairy industry.
“It is a very bad decision to use cows for advertising.
Like us, they need to be pregnant and born to produce milk, except that their children take them home within a few days after birth, ” writes one user.
Elvie’s milk sauce is put directly under a special buttgalter (Elvie/Mother)
And here's another comment: "It's true that it's as traumatic for both mothers and children.
But why not use them to advertise milk substitutes for mothers who leave their children?"
Another user adds: “Advertising out of reality”.
Others, on the other hand, protected the role, and one woman even wrote that the song was “pretty. ”
"I think it's a great idea.
If I were to feed a kid, I'd have to buy one.
The breast - feeding really made me feel like a cow.
The advertisement is, of course, a little sloppy, but it feels about it.
""""" """"""""""""""""""" """""""" """"""""" """"""""" """""""""""""
And another comment: "The advertising of mothers who are breast-feeding (usually in their jobs or in their toilets) and who, in truth, feel little of themselves."
This advertising is not to glorify or abuse our milk industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women showed that they all danced with these unmarked milk sauces hidden under the bushel.
The concept of this advertising campaign is based on the fact that many breast-feeding women say they feel like cows.
In fact, Elvie’s milk sauce is completely insensitive, has no wires or tubes, is freely placed in the buttgalter for feeding, while it is inconceivable that women are allowed to move, hold their babies and even walk out the street during feeding.
Ana Balarin, a partner and expert on early development of Mother’s children, comments: “Elvie’s milk sauce is such a revolutionary product that it deserves bold and provocative advertising.
By taking a parallel between women and cows, we wanted to focus on breast-feeding and all its problems, demonstrating the incredible sense of freedom that gives fresh milk.
It's not the first case that Elvie's milk resistance falls into news headlines.
During the London fashion week, the mother of two children appeared at the designer of Martha Jakubowski using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children were uninhibited to move to the tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of detained migrant children has increased sharply, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Administration of Trump have made it difficult to accommodate the children in command.
Usually, most sponsors themselves are the same immigrants who do not have documents and are afraid to threaten their stay in the country, under the guidance of the child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential contractors and other adult members of their families would have to provide fingerprints and that these data would be transmitted to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Olbens, a senior immigration and customs officer, testified at Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had been requested to take over the care of minors.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested had not been tried before.
“Approximately 80 per cent of persons who are either contracting parties or members of their families are illegal in the country, and a significant part of them are foreigners who commit a crime.
That is why we continue to pursue these people," said Olbens.
In the words of the shelter workers, seeking to speed up the process of child rearing, officials introduced new rules whereby some of them were required to appear before the court within a month of detention, not 60 days later, as was the case.
In order to state their legal status as an immigration judge, many of them are present on video rather than on their own.
Those deemed to have no right to assistance will be quickly deported.
According to shelters and information workers in the system in recent months, the longer children remain in detention, the more likely they are to be alarmed or depressed, which may lead to outbreaks of violence or attempts to escape.
Lawyers say that these problems are increasing in larger institutions, such as Thornillo, where signs that the child is experiencing difficulties are more likely to be ignored because of the size of the institution.
They add that transporting children to camp without giving them time emotionally to prepare for it or to say good-bye to friends can exacerbate the trauma that many of them are fighting.
Syria orders the United States, France and Turkey to immediately withdraw the army
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, the Foreign Minister, Valid al-Mualam, also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that war had taken place in the country for the eighth year.
Mualam, who is also the Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil, on the pretext of counter-terrorism, and would “be considered accordingly”.
“They must leave immediately and without any condition,” he said to those who had gathered.
Mualam insists that in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions have been expelled from their homes, “the war against terrorism is almost over”.
He said that Damascus would continue “to carry on this sacred battle until we clear all Syrian territories” from terrorist groups and “lovely illegal foreign presence”.
The United States has deployed some 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and consulting both Kurdish and Syrian Arabs, who speak against President Bashar Assad.
The French contingent has more than 1,000 military personnel in the war country.
With regard to refugees, Mualem said that good conditions had been established for their return and accused “some Western countries” of “dissemination of Iraqi insurance”, which encouraged refugees to remain outside the country.
“We called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to promote the return of citizens,” he said.
“They are politicizing what must be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union warn that Syria will not be helped to recover until a political agreement on the end of the war has been reached between Assad and the opposition.
UN diplomats say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last major area of the Idlib rebels provided an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkey Agreement prevented a large-scale attack by the Syrian forces supported by Russia from taking place in a province where three million people live.
However, Mualam stressed that the agreement had a “clear deadline”, and expressed the hope that military action would be directed against the jihadists, including those from the Al-Qaeda-related Nazar Front, who would be “destroyed”.
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hoped that the first meetings of a new committee would soon be convened, consisting of representatives of the Government and the opposition, to develop a post-war constitution for Syria and to pave the way for elections.
Mualam set out the conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in that committee, stating that the work of the Commission should be limited to “the consideration of articles of the current Constitution” and warned against interference.
Why Trump wins the second term
Following this logic, Mr. Tramp will win the re-election in 2020 if the impeachment and scandal do not put an end to his presidency in advance, and that is what many liberals are likely to expect.
And this will without a doubt be “the very dramatic final of the presidency for all history”.
At this point, there are no signs of fatigue in the eyes.
Since 2014, the premium time ratings have grown from more than double, up to 1.05 million to CNN and almost three times, to 1.6 million to MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million premium viewers, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" exceeded cable channels by collecting 3.5 million viewers per evening during the main news show.
“It’s a fire to which people are drawn, because it’s out of our minds,” says Neil Bear, director of the ABC’s “Appointed Survivor” drama, about a member of the Cabinet of Ministers who becomes president after the Capitol is destroyed as a result of the attack.
Nell Skowell, a long-standing comedy writer and author, “Just funny: some unpleasant truths about entry into the Hollywood Boys Club” offer another theory.
She recalls riding a taxi in Boston once before the 2016 elections.
The taxi driver told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
He said, “Yes, because he is ridiculous.”
There is something valuable in all this chaos — it is fun.
Of course, unlike the rest of the content broadcast on television, the summary lines on the events of Washington can determine the future of “Roo v. Wade” and answer questions about the possibility of the reunification of immigrant families and the health of the world economy.
The exception is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, when you look at the six o'clock in the row, how the group of experts is discussing the use of Bob Woodward’s “deep background” for his book Strah, or about Paul Manafort’s jacket for $15,000 out of straussine (a suit heated by pride), as the Washington Post writes, or about a sharp description of Storm Daniels, say, Mr. Tramp’s anatomy, it is already out of the ordinary awareness.
For example, I'll never look at Super Mario again with the same eyes.
“Partly his job is to make us feel that the reality of the show is to feed you every night,” says Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and founder of the Pawn Stars about the changing composition of the Tramp show and the daily routine of the drama (drake with N.F.L., praise Kim Chen Yn).
You can't let yourself miss any episode, or you're hopelessly left.
When I contacted Mr. Fles this week, on the north coast of Kauai was 27 degrees warm, the sun was shining, but he was hiding inside his house and watching MSNBC during the CNN recording.
He could not get away from the screen, at least not exactly when they showed how Brett Cavano appeared before the Legal Committee of the Senate and decided on the future of the Supreme Court.
"I remember when we did all these crazy shows, people said, "This is the beginning of Western civilization," said Mr. Fles.
“I still thought it was a joke, but it turned out they were right.”

Outsider money is involved in the harshest interim elections leading to the White House
It is not surprising that the 17th District of Pennsylvania is receiving cash flows through the change of districts in Congress, where two officials are participating in the race for the same place.
This suburban area of Pittsburgh, whose geography has not been changed long ago, is supported by a democracy, a member of the Chamber of Representatives of Connor Lamba, who took place in another district in the extraordinary elections last spring.
Lamb is speaking against another current official, the Republican of China Rotfus, who is currently representing the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is substantially interfering with the new 17th.
The cards were revised after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January decided that the old areas were in violation of the Constitution to the Republicans as a result of pre-election machinations.
In the new 17th district, the Honka called for a hot debate on funding campaigns between the main financial forces of the party, the Congress Committee for the Democratic Campaign (DCCC) and the National Committee for the Republic of the Republic (NRCC).
The name Lamba became known in Pennsylvania after the victory with a small difference in the March special elections held in Congress in the 18th district of Pennsylvania.
This place has been occupied for more than ten years by a Republican, and President Donald Trump has won the district with 20 points of advantage.
Political experts give democracies little advantage.
United States of America ordered El Salvador to support China, but then withdrew
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, which had led to a negative reaction from Washington.
In June 2017, Mr. Tramp held a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Vareloy of Panama. He was also in Panama until the partners expelled the management team of the Tramp.
Representatives of the Department decided to withdraw US heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of “the recent decisions on non-recognition of Taiwan”, said at the beginning of this month the Secretary-General of the Department of Heser Nawert.
However, the possibility of punishment was considered only with regard to El Salvador, which received approximately US$ 140 million in 2017, including drug control, economic development and support.
The proposed criminal sanctions, including reduction of financial assistance and visa restrictions, would be painful for that country in Central America with its high level of unemployment and murder.
In the light of the regular internal meetings of North and Central America, the representatives of North and Central America postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, which should have been held to bring about the outcome of a similar meeting held last year, which was perceived as a step forward in efforts to prevent migration in the United States.
However, by mid-September, high-level representatives of the Administration had come to understand that they wanted the preparation of the conference to continue, and had actually discontinued its consideration of El Salvador ' s punishment.
According to the diplomats, the conference is scheduled for mid-October and will be held by Vice-President Mike Pens as a sign that the administration attaches real importance to this meeting.
Three American diplomatic representatives have been well back to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, with no new harsh messages or sanctions from Washington.
The representative of the White House, Mr. Bolton, refused to comment on the details of the debates that had been discussed by three American officials, including two diplomats, who had agreed to discuss internal issues subject to anonymity.
Their reports are also confirmed by a non-administrative analyst, who also spoke in terms of anonymity.
Study the History
The next step could be to report to Special Adviser Robert Muller on the possible obstacle to Mr. Tramp ' s justice, which is currently very substantial evidence in the public reports.
Mr. Muller also reportedly initiated an investigation into the facts of the trampa campaign and its attacks during the past elections.
If Congress changes the landlord, Mr. Trump will appear before the person responsible for this body, just as he is prepared to speak again before the voters, and perhaps finally before the jury of his colleagues.
But there is a lot of 'esli'; I do not want to say that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable, as is the fall of his equivalents in Europe.
We will all make a choice on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect the duration of the fight.
In 1938, the German officers were ready to set up a coup d'état and overthrow Hitler, and this would have happened if the West had resisted him and supported the Czechoslovak troops in Munich.
However, we have not done so and have missed the opportunity to avoid bloodshed for the following years.
The course of history is being developed at such points, and the improbable march of democracy is accelerating or slowing down.
Americans are experiencing some of these breaking moments now.
What will we do if Mr. Trump is fired by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mr. Muller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult situation since, according to the newspaper, he suggested last year that he make secret records of the President ' s activities and discuss his disadvantages for the post.
Mr. Rosenstein claims that The Times data is invalid.
“How will we react if the recently requested FBI investigation into Brett Kavano is not complete or true, or if it is still approved by the Supreme Judge despite the credible allegations of sexual harassment and false testimony?
And above all, will we in the medium term vote in favour of the Congress, which will bring Mr. Tramp to justice?
If we do not pass these tests, this winter will prove to be too long for democracy.
But I believe that we can get through them with the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was imprisoned in Osven in the same Nazi regime, whose officials once occupied a post office where I lived many years later.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later she led me to light the Saturday candles at the table with the symbol of swastika.
With such a family past as I can't be optimistic about our future?"
Norman Eisen, senior scientist at the Brookings Institute, is the chairman of the Washington City of Responsibility and Ethics and the author of the book The Last Court: The Troubled Age of Europe in the history of the Five Lifes and One Legendal House.
Grem Dorrans from Rangers is optimistic about the speed of a football match with the Vienna Rapid.
"Randers" take on the Vienna Rapid on Thursday, knowing that victory over the Austrians, after an impressive thing in Spain over the Villiarreal at the beginning of this month, will allow them to take strong positions in the G League of Europe.
The knee trauma prevented the semi-trailer Grem Dorrans from speaking for the first time in the season against the "Vilirreala" account, but he believes that "Randers" can use this result as a tramp to achieve greater results.
“It was a good time for us because Wilyarreal was a good team,” said a 31-year-old footballer.
“We went into the game, thinking we could get something, and we went out with nothing.
Maybe at the end of the day, we could have done it, but in general, nothing was probably a fair result.
They probably played better in the first time, and our success came to the second time where we were better.
There will be another great European night this Thursday.
I hope we can get three points, but this will be a difficult game because they have shown good results in their last game, but given the support of the sufferers, I'm sure we can move forward and get a positive result.
Last year was certainly hard, taking into account all my injuries and replacements at the club itself, but now there is a good factor in this place.
The composition is wonderfully improved, and the boys are truly satisfied with it; the trainings have gone to the Ura.
I hope we can move forward, leave behind the past season and succeed."
Women lose their sleep because of fear of their retirement
Although the respondents had a clear view of how they wished to be cared for, few spoke to members of their family.
About half of the people involved in the national study said that they had discussed with their wives the value of long-term care.
However, only 10% said that they were talking about it with their children.
“People want to care about them, but they don’t try to discuss this topic with them,” says Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the Nationwide on Life Insurance.
And that's exactly what we need to start with.
Talk to your spouse and children. You cannot prepare your family for what they may need to care for you if you do not want to.
Discuss with your consultant and family where and how you will get medical assistance, as this choice may be an important cost factor.
Consult your financial consultant: he will help you develop a payment plan for this expenditure.
Your choice of long-term care funding can be covered by a traditional long-term care insurance policy or a mixed life insurance policy that will help cover these costs or self-insurance with your own property, provided you have money.
Bring your legal documents in order: get rid of legal battles.
Build trust in medical care and appoint a trusted person who will monitor your medical care and ensure that professionals do your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
We also recommend that the possibility of financial confidentiality be considered.
You should choose a trusted person who will help you make financial decisions and monitor the payment of your accounts if you prove unable.
Don’t forget, too, that your elderly parent needed urgent medical attention, and he’s on his way to the hospital.
Can you provide information on what medicines he is taking and what he is allergic to?
Write down all these details on paper so that they can be prepared in any case.
Martin adds: “It is important not only to have financial resources but also to choose doctors.”
“What are your medicines?
Who'll take care of your dog?
Build up and write down this plan."
In Ilfracombe, a man fired several times from a pneumatic vent
A man fired several times from a pneumatic fan, returning home from a stroll.
The victim, whose chest, life, and arm were hit by bullets for 40 years, was located in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon.
The police described the shooting, which took place about 02:30 in English summer time, as “accident”.
The victim didn't see the attacker.
The wounds are not life-threatening, and the police are now looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to officials, at least 384 people were killed as a result of a massive earthquake and tsunami that broke into the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, and the number of deaths is expected to rise.
As a result of the construction of communications, rescuers are unable to obtain any information from Donggal, a region north of Pala, which is close to the 7.5 ball earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palau as a result of the natural disaster.
Here are some of the key facts about Pala and Donggal, located on the island of Slovenes:
Palau is the capital of the province of Central Slovenia, located at the end of the narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Slovenia, with an estimated population of 379,800 (given for 2017).
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary of the earthquake and tsunamis.
Donghala is a district that is 300 km (180 miles) north-west of the island of Sulawesi.
The district, the administrative area of less province, had 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the basis of the economy of the province of Central Slovenia, and in particular the coastal region of Donggal.
The production of nickel is also important for the province ' s economy, but mainly concentrated in Morovali, on the opposite coast of Slovenia.
According to the Indonesian Agency for the Elimination of Natural Disasters, the tsunamis have been destroyed several times in Pala and Donggal over the past 100 years.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed by tsunamis and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongal.
The tsunamis also occurred in the western part of Donggal in 1996, resulting in the deaths of nine people.
Indonesia is on the Pacific volcanic fire ring and regularly suffers from earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: The severe earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on 26 December triggered tsunamis in 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: The sequence of severe earthquakes occurred on the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: The earthquake of 6.8 hit southern Java, the most densely populated island of Indonesia, causing tsunamis on the south coast, resulting in the deaths of some 700 people.
2009: The 7.6 magnitude earthquake occurred in the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: The 7.5-ball earthquake occurred on one of the Isles of Mentawai in Sumatra, causing tsunamis up to 10 meters, which destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: The poor earthquake occurred in the district of Pidi-Jaja in Acheha, causing destruction and panic, as people remembered the devastating earthquake in 2004 and tsunamis.

Senior son of Sara Paline arrested for domestic violence
Trac Paline, the eldest son of former governor Alaska and vice-president of Sara Paline, was arrested for the attack.
The 29-year-old Palin from Vasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspected domestic violence, involving the situation of domestic violence and for resisting arrest, according to a statement published by the Alaska State Police on Saturday.
According to the police report, when one of his acquaintances tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, he picked up her phone.
According to KTUU, Palin is in Mat-Su's insulator and will be released in a bet of $500.
He appeared in the court on Saturday, and when they asked him if he was guilty of his “innocency of any sort”.
The use of three minor Class A crimes is a threat to Peylin, which means that he may be deprived of his liberty for up to one year and fined $250,000.
He was also charged with the crime of Class B, which was punishable by imprisonment for up to one day and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first case where criminal charges have been brought against Peeline.
In December 2017 he was accused of attacking his father Todd Paylin.
His mother, Sarah Paylin, called the police and reported the alleged attack.
The case is currently pending by the Veteran Court of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, a report of domestic violence and the storage of arms in a state of alcohol abuse in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed to have hit her face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016, after explaining her son ' s ill-treatment with post-traumatic stress disorder, allegedly resulting from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds of killed
At least 384 people died as a result of the earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-ball earthquake triggered tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications are not working, and the number of victims will rise in the next few days.
The earthquake occurred near central Slovenia, which is north-east of the capital of Jakarta Indonesia.
There are video recordings on social media.
Hundreds of people were at a beach festival in Palu when the tsunamis broke down on the beach.
The Federal Prosecutor's Office wants to bring a rare death sentence to the suspect in the attack in New York
The Federal Prosecutor ' s Office in New York seeks a death penalty for Syfulo Saipov, a suspect in the implementation of the New York terror, resulting in the death of eight persons, a rare penalty for a federal crime that has not been applied in the state since 1953.
In October, Saipov, 30 years old, claimed to have taken the Home Depot truck to make an attack on the West Side Show in Lower Manhattan on foot and bicycle.
In order to justify the death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipo “intended” to kill eight people and “intendedly” to cause serious bodily harm, according to the announcement of the intention to obtain the death penalty in the South District of New York.
According to the judicial document, the two charges may result in a death sentence.
A few weeks after the attack, a large federal jury charged Saip with 22 counts of charges, which included eight charges of murder for missiles commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as charges of violence and car destruction.
According to prosecutors, the attack was “intensely planned and intentional”, Saipov carried it out as described as “disgusting, cruel and criminal”.
“Syfullo Habibullaevich Saipov has caused injuries, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrike Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann Lora Decadta, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlie, Ernan Ferruci, Ernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damiana Pagnukko”, says the notice of intentions.
Five of the dead were tourists from Argentina.
Ten years have passed since a death penalty was imposed by the prosecutor in the South District of New York for a criminal offence.
In September 2009, Khalid Barnes, accused of murdering two drug dealers, was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment.
The last time the death penalty for the federal case in New York was applied in 1953 to Julius and Etel Rosenberg, a married couple who were convicted of spying on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Rosenbergi was punished with the use of the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
According to Saipov's court documents, the native of Uzbekistan has demonstrated the lack of resentment after their attack.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he was glad he did.
According to the indictment, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired by the video IGIL on the phone.
He also asked for the flag of IGIL to be hung in his hospital room, the police reported.
He denied his guilt for all 22 convictions.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders on Saipova's side, said that they were “clearly disappointed” by the decision of the prosecutor's office.
“We believe that the decision to apply the death penalty, not the life sentence, will only exacerbate the pain of these events for all their participants,” Patton said.
Saipov's defence had previously been asked by prosecutors not to seek a death penalty.
A member of the Tori Parliament said that NIJEL PARAZ should not be held responsible for Brexit negotiations
Today, during a protest at the Tori Nigel Faraz conference, he vowed to “mobilize the People’s Army”.
Former Ukip leader said that policies should “sympathise” with European skeptics, as one member of the Teresa May parliament suggested that he should be responsible for negotiations with the EU.
A member of the Conservative Party, Peter Bowen, said at a meeting in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would be "out", if Mr. Faraz were Brexit's secretary.
However, the problem faced by Ms. May, in trying to reconcile her deeply divided ranks, is further exacerbated by the fact that members of the Tori party, who are opposed to EU entry, join a separate protest against Brexit, which is taking place in the city.
The prime minister of all forces is trying to maintain his compromise plan, announced in Chekers in the crackdown by Brexit, his opponents and the EU.
The Allies insist that it continue to try to conclude a deal with Brussels, despite a negative reaction, and thus to force Eurosceptics and Laborists to choose between its package and its chaos.
Mr. Bone said at the Leave Meanings Leave meeting in Solihalle that he wanted to “play the Checkers”.
He suggested that Mr. Faraz should level and assume responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
He said, “If he were in charge, we would have gone out.”
Deputy Wellingboro added, "I will continue to speak for Brexit, but we need to win the Checkers."
Speaking against the EU, he said: "We did not fight in world wars to be dependent.
We want to establish our laws in our country.”
Mr. Bowen rejected the assumption that the public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British had changed their opinion and wanted to remain completely inconsistencies”.
Brexit's partner, Tori Andrea Jenkins, was also at the meeting, giving journalists this comment: "I say, Prime Minister, just listen to people."
“Chekers is unpopular among the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for this plan, it is also unpopular among members of our party and our activists, who are actually pushing the streets and, above all, choosing us.
Please put the checkers aside and start listening to what they're saying."
In her harsh address to Ms. May, she added: “The Prime Ministers will remain in their work if they remain faithful to their promises.”
Mr. Faraz said that if policies were to be handed over to the 2016 referendum, they would have to be “scrupulous”.
“This is now the issue of trust between us and our political class,” he says.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them, "We're not going to let it down from your hands."
Turning to the frightened crowd, he added: “I want our political class, which is on the brink of Brexit’s betrayal, to feel a sense of guilt.
“We are mobilizing the national army of this country, giving us the victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until we become independent, independent and proud of the United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, Brexit’s opponents went through a demonstration on Birmingham, then holding a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
Several activists were flipping Tori v. Brexit posters into these outputs.
At the opening of the conference, a member of the Leborist Party, Lord Adonis, criticized the Conservatives for their security problems in the mobile annex of their party.
“And these people claim that they can set up Canada’s IT and technology systems plus, for border work, for free trade without borders with Ireland,” he added.
“This is one common side.
Good Brexit does not exist in principle," he says.
Warren plans to “research carefully” the opportunity to participate in the presidential race
A member of the U.S. Parliament, Senator Elizabeth Warren, said that after the November elections she would “seek to explore the possibility of embalming the Presidents”.
The Boston Globe reports that the Moscow Democrat on Saturday told about her future at a rat meeting in Western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Tramp, protested in November against a member of the Republican Party of Jeff Dila, who was co-president of the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
The talks are that she has the chance to take part in the Trampa post in 2020.
On Saturday, she held a regular meeting with the electors in Holioca; since Tramp entered the post, it had already been her 36th meeting with the electors in the format of the Ratushi meeting.
One of the participants asked her if she was planning to take a stand for the presidency.
Warren replied that it was time for “women to go to Washington to “start” our broken government, and for it to need to be a woman on top”.
As a result of the murder of Sims (starled), the LSU player was arrested
The Baton-Ruz police, Louisiana State, announced on Saturday that the suspect in the murder (gun) of LSU Wade Sims, who took place on Friday, had been arrested.
At 11 a.m., at the Baton-Ruz police press conference, the police announced the arrest of Dayton Simpson, 20 years old.
On Friday, the police department published a video of the shooting with a request to help identify the person who was able to take the video.
Twenty-year-old Sims was shot around the campus of the South University on Friday morning.
“Wade Simms received a gunshot wound in his head, which ended,” reported reporters to police chief Murphy J. Paul on Saturday.
Wade joined his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to participating in the incident, carrying weapons and shooting at Wade Sims.
At Simpson's arrest, he did not resist and was detained in East Baton-Ruz County Police.
The young man grew 1 m 82 cm in Baton-Rose, played 32 games with 10 starts last season and won an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 games.
Gran Pri Russia: Luis Hamilton approaches the title of the world champion after the command tactics have given him victory over Sebastian Fettel
Since Walter Bottas went through his qualification on Saturday, Louis Hamilton took it clear that the Mercedes command tactics played a major role in the race.
From the mid-post Bottas had been well-started and practically lost in Hamilton when he defended his position on the first two turns, and invited Fettel to attack his teammate.
Fettel first went to the pit stop, leaving Hamilton stuck in the tail of the whole group, the choice that became the decisive one.
Mercedes went to the pit one round later, and then went behind Fettel, but Hamilton, after some struggle “cool in the wheel”, broke out ahead, leading the Ferrari driver reluctantly to leave the inner space free, risking a double movement to protect on the third turn.
On his 21st birthday, Max Ferstappen started from the back of the network and was in the seventh place by the end of the first round.
Then he took most of the race, held on his native tires, in order to finish quickly, pushed Kimi Rakeconen to fourth place.
As a result, he went to the stage at the 44th round, but could not increase the speed of the remaining eight rounds, as Rykkonen took fourth place.
The day seemed difficult because Walter had done fantastic work on the exits and had shown this virtue by sharing it with me.
The team has done such an exceptional job to have a couple of tricks in stock," Hamilton said.
Sign Language
President Donald Trump criticized Senator Diane Fianstein at a meeting with the voters on Saturday for her statement that she had not published a letter by Christina Blacy Ford, accused of Brett Kavano, a candidate for the post of High Judge, in sexual harassment.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the President did not mention the direct testimony given by Ford to the Senate Legal Committee, he said that the Senate had shown that the participants were “skinned, ugly and false people”.
“The only possible reaction to all of this, and what has happened in the last few days in the Senate, is wonderful, it is anger, anger, hunger and lies,” he said.
You see all this wandering around, and then they say, "No, I didn't do it.
I didn't do that."
Remember?
Diane Finstein, did you "sweet" the information?
Remember her answer... did you "sweep" the document information?
Oh, no.
I didn't swear.
Yes, stop.
No, we didn't, we didn't, we didn't, we added the senator's intonation.
In July, Finland was sent a letter detailing the charges against Ford against Cavano, and in early September it was unlawfully announced, but Finland denied that the leak had occurred in its office.
“I did not hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, but I did not share her information,” Fienstein told the Committee, according to The Hill.
“She asked me to keep this information in secret, and I did as she asked.”
However, the way in which she denied the charges in the run-off seems to have offended the President who commented at the Saturday meeting: "This is what I tell you: the language of the body has greatly deceived her.
Maybe she didn't say anything, but the body language was worse than I've ever seen.
While continuing to defend his candidate as a Supreme Judge, accused by three women of sexual harassment, the President assumed that the Democrats were using these charges for their own purposes.
“They are certainly trying to regain power in all the available ways.
We observe humility, ill will, no matter who they try, who they have to avoid in order to gain power and control," the President-in-Office quoted Mediaite as saying.
British elite hockey league: Dandi Storia 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Duyer scored two goals for the Giants in the game against Dandi.
In the game of the Elite Hockey League, Dandi Storia was awarded a Friday defeat against Belfast Giants, winning a response match on Saturday with the 5-3 account for Dandi.
The Giants were given an early advantage in two goals thanks to the beatings of Patrick Duyer and Francis Boviller.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Coney raised the level of the home team before Duyer took the Giants out of the leadership.
Francisco Bushar compared Dandi's account to the two goals of Lucas Lundwald Nilsen's victory.
For the people of Adam Kif, who won the Dandi 2-1 victory in Belfast on Friday evening, this was the third defeat in the Elite League season.
Among the parties, this was the fourth meeting in the season when the Giants won three previous matches.
The first goal of Douayer came at 3:35 after Kendall McFall's naked passport with David Rezerford's support, and then Boviller doubled the advantage four minutes later.
During the initial period, Sullivan returned the owners to the game at 13:10, before Matt Markwardt equipped Kuni to balance the account at 15:16.
Duyer found out that the Giants took the initiative at the first break when he killed the second goal at night at the end of the first period.
The master regrouped, and Bushar re-balanced the account, killing the target at 27:37.
Connie and Charles Corcoran gathered together to help Nilsen to give Dandi the first chance to win the victory at the end of the second period, after which he and his team strengthened the victory by holding the enemies in the middle of the field until the end of the final period.
The Giants, who have lost four of the last five matches, will be sent to Milton Cannes for the next match to be held on Friday.
The air traffic controller died so that hundreds of people aboard the plane could avoid earthquakes
The Indonesian air inspector was sentenced to death by a hero after he deliberately died in order to be able to fly hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people died and many lost their lives as a result of a severe earthquake on the island of Sulawesi on Friday.
Strong underground thrusts continue to destroy the area, many of the city’s inhabitants have been under construction.
Although his colleagues were saved by escape to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonio Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post at the fear - inspiring high airport of Mutiar Sis Al Jufrey, Palau.
He remained in his seat to make sure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then on the flight deck, was able to fly safely.
Then, when he found out that the elevator was crashing, he broke up with her.
Later he ended up in a hospital.
The representative of Indonesia, Johannes Siratt, said that this decision could save hundreds of lives, reports the Australian Agency ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a large hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, the dispatcher ended before the helicopter was able to sit in Pala.
“We are very sorry for this loss,” he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities are afraid that the number of people killed by the earthquake may reach thousands, since, according to the disaster management agency, access to the cities of Donggal, Sigi and Butong is limited.
“The number of victims is likely to grow, as a large number of people are still undercover, and many have not been able to get out of there,” says Sutopo Purwo Nugroho’s representative.
The waves, which had reached six feet [6 m] high, devastated the city of Palu, where the mass burial of the dead will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft provide humanitarian assistance to the affected city.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, says Sky News: “A quick help will bring the victims every minute.
Clean water is not enough.
The mini-markets are robbed everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, tells CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross associates are already in a hurry to help survivors, but we do not know what they will stay there.
Tragedy has already taken quite a measure of seriousness, but it can all be much worse.”
President Joco Vidodo of Indonesia arrived at Palo on Sunday and addressed the armed forces of the country, in particular, said: "I ask all of you to work day and night in order to carry out all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" says CNN.
At the beginning of this year, Indonesia suffered from an earthquake in Lombok, resulting in more than 550 deaths.
A plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports that a man has disappeared without a report after the plane crashed into the lagoon
The airline, which was on a voyage to the Pacific Ocean lagoon in Micronesia, now reports that one man was missing, while it was said earlier that all 47 passengers and crew had well left the towing aircraft.
Air Niugini reports that as a Saturday day, she has no information about one male passenger.
The airline stated that it was working with local authorities, hospitals and police, trying to find this person.
The airline was unable to respond immediately to requests for more detailed information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local sailors helped rescue other passengers and aircraft crew after he landed on the water trying to land at Chuk Airport.
On Friday, officials reported that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline also reported that six passengers were hospitalized on Saturday and were all in stable condition.
The causes of the plane crash and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airlines and U.S. V.I. claim that the aircraft landed in the lagoon not far from the runway.
Some witnesses claim that the plane could not land on the runway.
American passenger Bill Janes says the plane has become too low on the runway.
"And that's very good," Janes adds.
Janes told me that he and other passengers had been able to get to the emergency exits on the towing plane, since the water level was on the belt.
He also told us that the Stuarts panicked and yelled on board and that he had suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S.I.S. reported that mariners who repaired the vicinity also helped to save by using the inflatable boat on which they transported people to the shore before the plane sank about 30 metres (100 ft).
Flight Safety Networks show that over the last two decades, 111 people have been killed in aircraft crashing companies registered in PNG, but none of these accidents have been related to Air Niugini.
Analysts have been able to prove the fact that a woman is burned alive
On Saturday, the indictment brought a case against the man charged with burning the residents of Mississippi in 2014.
The analyst from the U.S. Department of Justice, Paul Roulette, gave a long-term witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told members of the department how he used cell phone records to draw up a general picture of the action of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night she died.
Roulette explained that he had received data on the location of these people from several mobile phones; according to this data, the evening Tellis spent time with Chambers, which is contrary to his previous statements, reports The Clarion Ledger.
He said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, but according to the information received, his cell phone was near Chambers, and when the situation became clear, the police interrogated Sanford.
In his testimony, Sanford said he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked for Sanford, did Tellis tell the truth, claiming that he was in the Sanford truck that night, Sanford said that “it was a lie, because my truck was in Nashville.”
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he met Chambers two weeks before her death.
However, according to phone records, they only called for one week.
Roulette also showed that shortly after the death of Chambers Tellis, she had removed her text messages, phone calls and contact information from her phone.
"He's got her out of her life," says Heil.
Protection should begin to set out its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be handed over to the jury later that same day.
The High Breed: What is a "conscious hip-hop"?
Three hip-hoppers are going to fight negatively against this genre, filling their music with positive content.
The High Breed Group from Bristol claims that hip-hop content has changed from basic political and social problems.
The group wants to return to its roots and make the “conscious” hip-hop popular again.
These artists, such as The Fugees and Common, have recently witnessed the rebirth in Britain by such artists as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?
The New York Miss has tried a family couple for racist text.
The New York Nanny tried a family couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a complaint from a woman that she had become “one more black”, which the woman had mistakenly sent instead of her husband.
Spouses deny that they are racist, claiming that the claim was “for the purpose of extermination”.
Lucy Plasco-Flexman, the mother of two children, expressed concern, knowing that the new girl offered by the care service, Giselle Morris, was black when she came to the family for her first working day in 2016.
"Not so much as one black," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flexman in a text to her husband.
Instead of sending a text message to her husband, however, she misdirected his Miss Morris twice.
Aware of its popularity, Plasco-Flexman fired Morris, claiming that the girl who became an African-American was doing a bad job, and that they were expecting a Filipino instead of an African-American, reported New York Post.
Morris paid for one day's work and then sent home to Uber.
Morris is now bringing a family couple to trial and is demanding compensation for the exemption of $350 per day for six months, under the terms of the original oral agreement, which were not secured by any contract.
"I want them to understand that such things are not allowed," she said on Friday, adding, "and I know that this is discrimination."
The wives disagree with the charge of racism and claim that the dismissal of Morris could be considered a reasonable step because they would no longer be able to trust her if they tried her.
“My wife sent her a message that she really didn’t mean.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist," said Joe Plasco, a postman.
“But would you trust your children, whom you were harsh with, even if you were harsh?
Would they trust your newborn child?
All right, let's go!
Calling the claim “expectation”, Plasco said that his wife had given birth to the child only two months ago and was in “a difficult situation”.
“Are you ready to pursue the man who has been in such a situation?
It's not very nice of you," added a bank employee who specializes in investment.
The trial is still ongoing, but public opinion has already given its sentence on social networks, accusing a couple of unacceptable behaviour and logic problems.
The publishers of Paddington feared that readers would not walk with a talking bear, says a new letter
Bonda’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was published, replied: “It’s hard to put yourself in the place of someone who reads it for the first time, even before it was published.
It's very fun to know that Paddington is very successful."
She also said that her father, before he decided to write a children's book on bears, had worked as an operator on BBC, and would refer to refusing publication with optimism, and added that his 60-year anniversary was “and joyful and bitter” because their author did not become the author last year.
As for Paddington's bear, she refers to him as “a very important member of our family”, and that her father was quietly proud that his character had finally come to know him.
“He was quiet and modest,” his daughter said.
“Dadington was so real to him, and to his father it was almost as if his own child had made a success: he was proud of them, although he did not really consider this success to be his own.
I think he was referring to the success of Paddington that way.
Subdington was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, but he always gave honor to the bear himself."
I was forced to say goodbye to my dying daughter on the phone.
After the plane was landed, her daughter was delivered to the hospital at Nice Hospital Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors tried to save her life.
“Nad regularly called and said it was really bad that something went wrong,” says Mrs. Eden Laperuz.
“Then he called again and said that she would die in the next two minutes and that we should be forgiven.
I did.
I said, "Tash, I love you so much, dear.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
The medications that doctors gave her, forcing her heart to work, gradually stopped working, leaving her body.
She died earlier than expected.
I had to just sit there and wait, knowing everything was coming to an end.
I couldn't cry or cry or cry because there were other people around me, other families.
I had to hold my hand firmly."
At the end of the day, Mrs. Ednan Laperuz, grieving for the loss of her daughter, sat on a plane with other passengers, calming down the huge loss she had just had to survive.
"No one knew what happened," she says.
"My head started, I didn't stop crying.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I tried this overwhelming feeling of compassion for Nada.
He needed my love and support.
I know how much he loved her."
Women who survive the loss of loved ones prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who lost their loved ones who committed suicide are trying to prevent others from doing so.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Hamfrey are on the Welsh Bridge openings with comforting words and phone numbers that people can turn to for support.
Mrs. Davis Tyler's son was 13 years old when he was depressed and at the age of 18, he died.
“I don’t want other parents to experience the same thing I do every day, ” she says.
45-year-old Davis, living in Lydia, says her son was a great shot and had a fucking promise smile.
"They all loved his smile.
Everyone said that when he smiled, it was like a light burning in the room."
However, before his death, he left work because he was in the midst of a terrible time.”
This happened in 2014, and Tyler, who ended up with him, found his own brother at the time, who was 11 years old.
Mrs. Davis says, "I'm not afraid that the reaction will go straight."
Mrs. Davis has come up with these openings, "that people knew that there was someone to talk to and tell everything, even if it's your friend.
You cannot sit down and keep silent, you must speak to people."
Mrs. Hamfriz, who has been with Mrs. Davis for many years, lost Mark, her husband, with whom she had lived for 15 years — he did not become her mother shortly after her death.
“He didn’t say he felt depressed, upset, or something like that, ” she says.
“In a few days before Christmas, we noticed changes in his mood.
It was a terrible thing for him to have a child. He did not look at the children when they opened their presents.
She says that his death was a huge trauma to them, but they had to go through it, that event shocked our family.
It destroyed her in pieces.
But we must continue to live and fight."

Next Bretta Kavano hanging on the wall: FBI launches investigation
“I thought that if we could get something of what he asked for — an investigation limited by time and volume, we could bring some unity,” Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee would “break up” in the background of a growing party chain reaction.
Why did Mr. Kavano and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Time is the cause of their fluctuations.
Intermediate elections will take place in just five weeks, on 6 November, and if, as expected, everything goes badly for the Republicans, they will be seriously weakened in their efforts to obtain the person they want and to elect him as the highest judge of the country.
George W. Bush is calling the senators, lobbying for Mr. Kavano, who has been working in the White House for Mr. Bush since then, and who has met with his future wife Ashley, who was then the personal secretary of Mr. Bush.
What happens after the FBI publishes its report?
A vote will be taken in the Senate, which currently consists of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
To date, it is not clear whether Mr. Kavano will be able to obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would enable Vice-President Mike Pens to address the issue of equality of vote and confirm his candidacy as a Supreme Judge.
The number of refugees from North Korea has decreased in Kim
Since Kim Chen Yn came to power seven years ago, the number of North Korean refugees in South Korea has decreased, the South Korean legislator said.
Pak Bin Seug, referring to the data from the Ministry of the South, said that, compared to 2706 cases of escape recorded in 2011, this figure decreased to 1127 cases last year.
Mr. Pack said that the key factors were the strengthening of border control between North Korea and China, as well as the higher rates taken by smugglers who drove people away.
There is no public comment.
The vast majority of North Korean refugees are finally offered the citizenship of South Korea.
Seoul claims that since the end of the Korean war in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally.
Most people are fleeing China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the securely protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China treats refugees as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often subjects them to forced repatriation.
The relationship between the North and the South, which are still at war, has improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of two countries met in Beijing to resume negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This occurred after the June historic meeting of President of the United States of America, Donald Trump and Kim Chen Yin in Singapore, at which they reached common agreements on the disarmament of the Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea, Ri Yun Ho, accused the United States of obstructing progress by sanctions.
“If we do not have at least the slightest confidence in the United States, we will also have no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances we will never be able to begin disarmament unilaterally,” Mr. Ri said in his statement to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kawano “sterical”, and claims that it is not suitable for work in the Supreme Court
The leader of the minority in the House of Representatives of Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavano, a candidate for the post of Supreme Judge, “sterical”, and said that because of his temper he was not fit for work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made this comment in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I cannot think that if a woman ever allowed herself to behave like this, they would immediately call her “sterico”,” Pelosi said about her reaction to the testimony of Kavano in the Senate Legal Committee on Thursday.
Kawano emotionally rejected Dr. Christine Blacy Ford's allegations in sexual harassment that must have taken place when both of them were still young.
Kavano spoke emotionally, even screaming and breathing over the years, telling about his family and school years.
He also unequivocally condemned the democratic committee, calling charges against it “grossful and clearly planned murder of an active person”, organized by liberals who were concerned that Hillary Clinton had lost the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi also said that, in her view, Cavano had only confirmed that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because he was prejudiced on the part of the Democrats.
“I think he is disqualifying himself with his claims, as well as with his approach to Clinton and the Democrats,” she says.
Pelosi was upset when she was asked if she would try to bring Kavano to justice, if his guilt was confirmed, and if the Democrats were to receive most of the House of Representatives.
“I will say this: if he does not speak the truth to Congress or the FBI, it is not only for the Supreme Court, but also for the court on which he is now,” Pelosi said.
Cavano is currently a judge of the District Court of Appeal D.C.
Pelosi added that, as a democrat, she was concerned about the possible decisions of Kawano regarding the Access to Medical Services Act or “Roo v. Wade”, since she was considered a representative of conservative justice.
At his candidacy, Kavano raised the question of whether he would revoke some of the Supreme Court ' s decisions.
"Now is not the time to put an extreme and prejudiced man to the position of Supreme Judge, and to exclaim, 'How wonderful!'," says Pelosi.
And women must own it.
It's just anger, months and years of anger, she can't go through it without tears.
"When we get angry, we cry," Miss Stein told me 45 later.
"I don't think it's as unusual as you think it is?"
She continued: "The woman who worked for me somewhere in the manager's office was very helpful, and she told me that she was also crying when she was angry, but she developed a technique by which she explained to her colleague: "You can think I'm crying because I'm upset.
I'm really dissatisfied."
And then she just kept talking.
I was very impressed by this approach.”
The tears are allowed as an outlet for anger in part because they are treated incorrectly in the roots.
One of my most painful memories of the first job in the office where men were dominated: I once cried out of anger, but I was caught by an old woman, a heartless manager, who I was always afraid of, and I jumped into a ladder.
"Never allow them to see you crying," she said.
They do not know that you are weeping for evil.
They think you're upset, and they're glad they've finally brought you.
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic Congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart during his presidential elections.
In 1987, Mr. Hart was arrested for some non-serious plot and left the race, and Mrs. Schroeder, deeply disappointed, decided that there was no reason for her to stand up to the presidency.
“This decision was not considered,” she admitted, smiling 30 years later.
“There were seven other candidates already in the race, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called that "Belosh and Seven Dwarves" case.
The campaign had already come to an end, had left much money behind, and had therefore sworn that it would not participate in the race unless it had raised $2 million.
It was said it was a completely lost option.
She found that some of her supporters, who gave $1,000 to men, offered her only 250.
“I am what they deserve, a precious commodity,” she wondered.
When she spoke, declaring that she would not conduct an official campaign, she was so touched by emotions — thanks to the people who supported her, by the disappointment of the system, which made it so difficult to collect money and access to voters, as well as by the anger of discrimination on the grounds of sex that she was breathing.
"You'd think I had a nervous breakdown," recalls Mrs. Schroeder about how the press reacted to her.
“It was possible to think that Kleinex was my corporate sponsor.
I was still thinking, what would they write on my memory?
"She's been crying without end?"
How the trade war with America can be useful for Beijing
Experts believe that the first battles of trade between the United States and China were inconceivable, and while the battle is still far from over, the gap between countries can benefit Beijing in the long term.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, made the first warning early this year, taxing the main Chinese export goods, including solar batteries, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation took place this week, when new tariffs affected goods of $200 billion (150 billion), actually taxed half of all goods from the United States of China.
Beijing has had an equivalent response rate each time, recently setting US commodity tariffs of $60 billion from five to ten per cent.
China promised that the US responses would be equal every time, and the world ' s second-largest economy could hardly begin to experience at least the least complex in the near future.
To force Washington to resign means to resign, but to publicly resign the United States would be too shameful for China's President C.
However, experts believe that if Beijing is able to play its cards properly, the pressure of the US trade war can provide long-term support to China by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that the rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that will lead to economic shock in any of these countries is actually much more dangerous than those previously recognized by observers,” says Abigail Grace, a scientist from the Center for New American Security, who specializes in Asia.
Minister for Foreign Affairs stated that Syria was “ready” to return
Syria states that it is ready to return refugees voluntarily and seeks the help of the reconstruction of a country that has been devastated by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Valid al-Mualam, reported that conditions in the country were improving.
“The situation on the ground today has become more stable and secure due to the success of counter-terrorism,” he said.
The Government continues to restore the areas destroyed by terrorists so that people can live peacefully there.
All conditions have now been established for the voluntary return of refugees to a country they had to leave because of terrorist attacks and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives.
According to the United Nations, more than 5.5 million Syrians had left the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem said that the Syrian regime would be grateful for the assistance of the reconstruction of the devastated country.
But he stressed that the country would not accept assistance under any conditions or assistance from countries sponsoring terrorism.
Europe consolidates the victory of Cube Ryder in Paris
The European team won the Cup of Ryder 2018, winning the US team with a score of 16.5 to 10.5 on Le Golf National in the Paris, France.
The United States had already played six consecutive games on European land, and the European Cup of Ryder had not won since 1993.
Europe returned to the crown thanks to the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team, who took 14.5 points they needed to win over the United States.
The American star Phil Mikelson, who fought most of the tournament, made his first long shot in the water at the 16th pool par-3, with his match Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari won all his rounds, became 1-x-4 players, who ever went 5-0-0, as the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spit suffered defeat 5:4 by a player with the lowest score in the European team, Turburan Olesen from Denmark.
One of the best players in the world, Dustin Johnson, resigned 2:1 Jan Polter from England, who may have participated in Cube Ryder for the last time.
Spanish Sergio Garcia, veteran of the 8th Cup of Ryder, became the winner of a tournament for the entire history of Europe with 25.5 points in career.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t hold back today.
It was a difficult year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very happy to get the doll again.
It's all on the team, and I'm glad I was able to help," says emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He's handing over the falcon to his associate John Rem, who won the victory on Sunday over the American Legend of the Tiger Woods Golf with a 2:1 account in a single game.
“I’m extremely proud of this victory,” says 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now his career record is 13-21-3.
These indicators are quite strange for one of the biggest players of all time who won 14 main titles, with only Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. Assembly fought all the way out, trying hard to make it, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who showed the golf course of the highest class throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furik said after his uneasy team statement: “I’m proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning we were able to find Europe easily.
It didn't work.
We're taking the traps before Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played great.
We are regrouping, I will work with PGA America and our Committee on Cube Ryder, and we will move forward with success.
I love all 12 boys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You need to be able to play.
We are the losers."
Red Flood: News Microorganism concentration decreased in Pinellas, Manati and Sarasote
The last report of the Florida Commission on Fish and Wild Nature reflects the overall decrease in the concentration of red tides in some parts of the Tampa Bay.
According to FWC, in the areas of Pinellas, Manati, Sarasota, Charlotte and Koller districts, there are reports of abundant coloration, which says that micro-organism concentrations are reduced.
The Red River extends approximately 130 miles from the North Pinell to the southern districts of Lee.
The eyelids can be observed about 10 miles from Hillsboro, but their number has dropped significantly over the past few weeks.
The Red River is also observed in the region of Pasco.
Last week, the average concentration in and around the Pinellas district, from low to high concentration in the Hillsboro coastal zone, high concentration in the Manata and Sarasota districts and coastal zones, the Charlotte district, high concentration on the Li coast, and low concentration in the Koller district were reported.
In the Pinellas, Manati, Sarasota, Lee and Koller districts, there is still the possibility of respiratory irritation.
No such likelihood was reported in North West Florida last week.
