I read several books last week.
I noticed that she sat in the front row.
I opened the box, it was empty.
I thought he was mad and he was going away.
I was the one who called the door.
I called before.
I saw the man hit by a car.
Oh, I'm sorry.
He fought against racial discrimination.
We went there without him, because he wasn't ready.

We called the door for five minutes, but it was gone.
They had to put their arm to Tom.
They went through the subject right now.

He tried to pull the trigger.
I went to Kyoto.

I see the moon above the horizon.
Come here every day?
Come here whenever you want.

Come with us.
Come here whenever you want.
Come on whenever you want.
It's a virtue and a joke.

I'd like a clearer tone.
We want complete prayers.
I wanted to buy the book, but I realized I didn't have more than 200 yen.
You want to marry me?
You want to do this now?
You want to play tennis with us?
Would you like another cup of tea?
You want a beer?
He wants a watch like yours.
He wants a watch like yours.
You're taller than her.
You need it.
You don't have to eat it.
I want to go to America someday.
I want to learn the Esperanto.
I want to die with Getter Jaani.
I want to stay here.
I want a book.
I want to see the ocean.
I want to live in a quiet city with pure air.
