The members of the Welsh National Assembly are afraid to be called muppets
Among some members of the National Assembly there was confusion. This is the effect of the proposal to change their title to the members of the Welsh Parliament (Member of the Welsh Parliament, in the short term MWP).
The idea was created in connection with plans to change the assembly into the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the meeting on all sides of the political scene are concerned that they may become the subject of the kpin.
One of the parliamentarians from the Labour Party expressed concerns about their grouping, saying that the new name is rife with the Walloon words 'twp' and 'pwp'.
For readers outside of Wales: in the wali language the word "twp" means stupid, and the word "pwp" means departures.
One of Plaid Cymru's policies stated that his group was "unsatisfied" with the proposal and presented other solutions.
The member of the Conservative Party of Wales said that his party was "open" to change the name. However, he noted that the word "MWP" is very close to the word "muppet".
In this case, the waly letter "w" is referred to as the letter "u" in the English dialect of Yorkshire.
As part of the Committee's meeting, which is currently working on the draft bill amending its name, it adopted the following position: "The final decision on the future title of the members of the assembly will naturally belong to them".
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 gave the Welsh National Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation on the proposal.
In addition, the Commission supported the proposal to change the title of the members of the assembly to "Member of the Welsh Parliament", that is, WMP in English, although this short "MWP" enjoyed the greatest popularity among society.
The members of the assembly propose alternative solutions. The difficulties with reaching consensus are a tribute to Elin Jones, the chairman of the meeting, who should present the draft law in the next few weeks.
The law introducing reforms will also take into account other changes in the way in which the meetings are conducted, including the rules governing the withdrawal of members and the structure of the committee system.
Members of the National Assembly will be able to vote on their future title during the discussion of the law.
Macedonians vote in the referendum on the change of country name
The next Sunday the voters will decide whether their country will soon bear the name of the Republic of North Macedonia.
The general vote is intended to help bring about a lasting dispute with neighboring Greece, where the region is called Macedonia.
The Athens Government has long claimed that their northern neighbour's name is a territorial claim and has repeatedly opposed attempts to join the European Union and NATO.
Mr Ivanov, President of Macedonia and opponent of the referendum on the change of name, said that the results of the vote would be disregarded.
However, Plebiscite supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaew, maintain that the change is necessary to enable you to join the European Union and NATO.
Call in the New York Church of St. Martin's silence due to the problems of the hurdle church in Harlem
"The older people I'm talking to say that there was a bar and a church on every corner of the world," said Michael Henry Adams.
"There's no trace of them at all."
As he says, the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"People are currently being given a different kind of company," he observed.
"The bar has ceased to be the place for regular meetings of members of the community".
In the case of churches he is concerned, however, that the measures resulting from the sale of the property are not sufficient for the duration of the decision-making process, and that “they will be at the point of departure sooner or later”.
He added that the churches could be replaced by apartments inhabited by people who would not support the rest of the surrounding churches.
As he said: “The overwhelming majority of people who buy houses in such buildings will be white people. This will speed up the total closure of churches, because it is unlikely that new residents will become members of these parishes.”
Both churches were built by gathering white believers, even before Harlem joined the metropolitan community in 1870 (the church of St. Marcina joined the community a decade later).
The first gathering of white Methodists left the district in the 1930s.
The surrounding meeting of African Americans then took over ownership of the building.
The church of St. Marcina was taken over by a gathering under the leadership of the magnificent John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott against the 125th street vendors (the main trade street in Harlemia), opposed to the employment or advancement of African Americans.
The 1939 fire damaged the building, but John Howard Johnson’s parafiscal plans were made to rebuild the temple and to heal the building of the call team.
The great David Johnson, son of John Howard Johnson and his successor at St. Marcina's church, proudly called the new charylion "the poor calls".
The expert who called them in July described them in a different way, such as "cultural treasure" and "unreplaced historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also observed that this is the first charylion in the world served by black music. This was the artist Dionisio A. Lind, who moved 18 years ago to the church of Riverside Church, where he was waiting for a larger team.
Malcolm J. Merriweather said St. Marcina's church didn't replace him.
In recent months, in St. Marcina's church, a number of complex events with the participation of architects and performers took place. Some of them were conducted by church leaders and some of them by the Diocese of the Episcopal Church.
In July, the Parafial Council (a parafia managing body made up of the Church leaders) addressed its concerns to the decadence, claiming that "it wants to shift costs to the council", although the Council did not take part in the recruitment of the architects and the performers who were sent to the place.
The part of the paraphyan also complains about the lack of transparency on the side of the dicession.
Rekin injured 13-year-old diving in search of lobsters in California
The authorities found that last Saturday the shark attacked and injured 13-year-olds searching for lobsters in California.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in the American city of Encinitas.
Chad Hammel brought the KSWB-TV station in San Diego, that on Saturday morning for about half an hour he sneezed with his friends when he heard a call for help. Immediately with a group of friends came to the boy to help him get out of the water.
As Hammel said, at first it seemed to him that the boy was excited by the capture of the house, but soon he realized that the child was shouting: “I am being bitten!
I was bitten!"
After arriving at the scene, Chad Hammel noticed that the boy had a completely broken skin around the both sides.
"I started screaming to everyone to escape from the water: "There is a shark in the water!" said Hammel.
The boy was transferred by helicopter to the Children's Hospital of the Children's Council in San Diego. His condition was defined as critical.
The species of shark responsible for the attack remains unknown.
During the press conference, Captain Larry Giles said that fish had already been observed a few weeks earlier. However, it was recognized that it was not part of a species of dangerous sharks.
Larry Giles added that the victim suffered serious injuries to the upper part of the skull.
In order to conduct the investigation and for security reasons, the authorities closed the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablanca for 48 hours, to Swami Beach in Ecinitas.
Larry Giles noted that the environment is inhabited by more than 135 species of sharks, although most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's network plans to expand activities on the British cosmetic market
The Sainsbury's network throws a handle on shops such as Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams, introducing cosmetics to its supermarkets that are styled in the goods house, as well as specially trained sellers.
As part of a significant investment in the British cosmetic market, which is worth £2.8 billion and is constantly developing despite the declines in the fashion industry and household goods, there will be greater regulation with cosmetic products in 11 online shops.
The return to the cosmetic industry results from the search for ways of managing the space previously occupied by televisions, microwaves and household articles.
According to Sainsbury's network doubles the number of cosmetic products and will offer even 3,000 items. For the first time, goods such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman or Dr. PawPaw will appear.
Currently sold L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also get more places and separate areas close to these well-known boats shops.
In addition, the supermarket network plans to refresh its product range for Boutique makeup. From now on, most of the products will be friendly to vegan, which is increasingly required by younger customers.
In addition to this, Fragrance Shop will create test points in two Sainsbury's supermarkets. The first opened last week in Croydon, southern London, and the second will occur in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later in the year.
The frequency of internet sales and daily purchases of small quantities of food in local stores makes supermarkets more likely to encourage customers to visit.
Mike Coupe, president of Sainsbury's, said that sales points will increasingly remind the commodity houses, because the network is trying to fight discounts such as Aldi or Lidl, offering more services and products other than food.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos network points in hundreds of shops and has introduced several Habitat network points since the acquisition of both companies two years ago. According to the company, this contributes to increased sales of food goods and increased investment profitability.
The previous attempt to reorganize parts with cosmetic products and pharmaceuticals ended with defeat.
At the beginning of the 21st century, Sainsbury's created a joint-venture company with Boots. However, the cooperation was completed as a result of a conflict of income sharing from pharmacies operating in supermarkets.
Sainsbury's introduces a new strategy following the sale of 281 monkeys by Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for $125 million three years ago.
Lloyds reports will contribute to the implementation of the plan by introducing an extended range of luxury brands for skin care, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four network shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Director of Sales Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the appearance and nature of cosmetics to improve customer impressions.
We have invested in special training for employees to help consumers when buying.
Our brands are able to satisfy all needs, and friendly surroundings and convenient locations allow us to draw the attention of customers looking for cosmetic products, as well as to question the way in which we are making purchases."
Peter Jones "fragile" after Holly Willoughby withdrew from the 11 million pounds contract
Peter Jones, the star of the Dragons' Dan TV program, was "infuriated" when he found out that Holly Willoughby was going to withdraw from the worth of £11 million of the lifestyle brand to focus on a new collaboration with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Holly Willoughby has no time for their brand offering accessories and household articles called Truly.
The activity was once compared to the Goop brand belonging to Gwynet Paltrow.
This morning, 37-year-old presenter announced her departure through Instagram.
A sudden decision to leave the thriving lifestyle brand and focus on the newly connected collaboration with Marks & Spencer and ITV by Holly Willoughby excavated Peter Jones, the star of Dragons' Den.
According to sources, Peter Jones was "angrily" when a popular television presenter announced during a nervous Tuesday's meeting at his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that due to new contracts worth up to 1.5 million pounds, there will be no time to dedicate their marches to the accessories and household articles of Truly.
The company was previously compared to Gwynet Paltrow Goop brand. It was also expected to double the assets of Holly Willoughby estimated at 11 million pounds.
After announcing the decision to leave Truly's brand by a 37-year-old Holly Willoughby in the service of Instagram Peter Jones, he left the United Kingdom and went to one of his airports.
According to the source: “Truly’s brand was a priority for Holly Willoughby.
She tied her future with her and wanted to take care of her for the next few decades.
The decision to withdraw completely surprised all involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday was so close to entering the market.
In the Marlow Store, goods are ready for sale."
Experts believe that this presentation of this Morning programme and one of the most successful stars in the United Kingdom can cost the company millions of pounds in view of significant investments in products – including articles from candlelights and household articles – as well as further delaying entry into the market.
It can also mean the end of a long-lasting friendship.
Holly Willoughby (the mother of three children) and her husband Dan Baldwin for ten years maintained close relations with Peter Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Holly Willoughby, together with Tara Capp, founded Truly in 2016, and 52-year-old Peter Jones joined them in March as president.
The couple were on vacation together, and Jones had 40% of the share in the television production of Dan Baldwin.
Holly Willoughby is to become an M&S ambassador and replaces Ant McPartlin as the owner of the I'm A Celebrity program at the ITV station.
A source close to Peter Jones said last night: "We will not comment on his business."
A difficult conversation, "and then we fell in love with ourselves"
The president joked at the criticism of the media caused by the attention that some considered to be "a failure of a husband", as well as a positive attitude towards the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump submit so much?
Trump said in a loud voice, giving a TV show:
"I didn't give up anything."
The president noted that Kim Dzong Un was interested in the second meeting. The first meeting took place in Singapore in June and was called by Trump a major step towards the denuclearisation of North Korea.
However, nuclear disarmament negotiations are lagging behind.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that he did not see a "analogic response" from the United States to the early North Korean disarmament action.
He noted that instead of this, the United States supports sanctions and pressure.
President Trump expressed a much more optimistic view in his speech.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
"We planned a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
Now we're maintaining a great relationship."
The president said that his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim Dzong Unem had had a positive effect: they had led to the completion of rocket tests, helped free hostages and returned to the rest of the American soldiers.
He also defended his unusual approach when talking to Kim Dzong Une.
"It's easy to keep up with the president. However, instead of 10,000 people waiting outside and trying to get to the crowded stadium, we would have 200 people here," Trump said, pointing to the crowd gathered directly in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia have accidentally destroyed one of the islands by killing hundreds of people
After the earthquake on the island of Lombok, foreign NGOs were told that their assistance was not needed.
Despite the loss of a roof over the head by more than 10% of the people of Lombok, the authorities did not announce food disasters, which is a prerequisite for speeding up international aid.
"In many cases the authorities have made it very clear that they do not require international support. The situation is therefore difficult," Selina Sumbun said.
Although Save the Children is preparing to travel to the Indonesian city of Palu, there is no doubt that international staff will be able to act on the scene.
Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, a national food disaster agency spokesman, said that the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Pala, to see if aid from international organisations should be allowed.
In the face of the constant shocks in Indonesia, the country remains completely unprepared to cope with the forces of nature.
Although in the province of Aceh there are tsunami shelters, they are rare in the case of the rest of the coastal line.
The lack of oxygen warning against tsunamis in the Pale – despite the warning – was likely to affect the number of deaths.
Even under the most favourable conditions, travelling between Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Food claws make logistics even more difficult.
The hospital ship stationed on the island of Lombok is heading to Palu with the help of the earthquake victims. However, it will take at least three days to reach the goal.
President Joko Widodo has improved Indonesia's infrastructure at the top of his campaign and has allocated a large number of funds on roads and railway lines.
However, in the face of future elections, the President's administration is in line with the lack of resources.
In addition, Joko Widodo was placed under the emphasis of the country's religious tension. Members of the majority of the Muslim community adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than a thousand people died, and tens of thousands of people lost their roof over their heads as a result of fighting between Christian and Muslim gangs using swords, bows, arrows, and other simple weapons on the streets.
See: Liverpool baller Daniel Sturridge gets a relay gate in Chelsea's game
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a loss from Chelsea in the English Prime Minister League, winning a 89-minute Saturday match played at the Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge was given by Xherdan Shaqiri about 27 metres from Chelsea gate at 1:0 for the benefit of his team.
Before giving a shot towards the remote gate, he put the ball on his left leg.
The ball speeded high above the criminal field towards the top right corner of the net.
Then she fell into the gate and flew over her casting a Kep Arrizabalag.
"I was just trying to take the position and take the ball, knowing that players like Shaqiri always try to get it out as best as possible. I wanted to give myself the best shot," said Sturridge in an interview for LiverpoolFC.com.
"I noticed the approaching Kante, took the ball and gave the shot without any deeper thought."
Chelsea led 1:0 in half a match after the door of the Belgian star Eden Hazard shot in the 25th minute.
The attacker of the Blues pushed a fifth ball towards Mateo Kovacica and then ran towards half Liverpool.
The cook quickly accepted the injection in the middle of the box.
Then he performed a beautiful play ahead in the field of crime and returned to Hazard.
Hazard had ahead of the defenders, and he left his foot in the direction of a long column of arrows that passed by Liverpool's locker Alison Becker.
Liverpool will meet with the Naples Club in the group League of Championships on Wednesday at 3:00 p.m. at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples (Italy).
Chelsea will meet Videoton at the UEFA Europe League on Thursday at 3:00 in London.
The number of Tsunami victims in Indonesia has increased to 832 people
As Indonesia’s food disaster agency reported on Sunday morning, the number of recent earthquake victims in that country increased to 832.
During the conference, the spokesperson of the agency Sutopo Purvo Nugroho reported that as a result of the Friday earthquake of the country, 7.5 degrees in Richter's scale, many people were imprisoned under the hail.
The town of Palu, inhabited by more than 380 thousand people, is full of brickworked buildings.

The police are asking for contact with persons in the area who have seen or heard any suspected incident.
Brian O'Hagan, Commissioner of the Research and Research Department, said: "The investigation is at an early stage, but I would like to appeal for contact with all the people then living near John Street in Birkenhead who have seen or heard anything of the suspect.
I am also addressing all drivers, and in particular taxi drivers whose registrants have been able to sustain useful materials during the investigation."
The police manual confirmed that the woman lived in Birkenhead and that her body was found inside the property.
After the afternoon, the people who said they knew the woman came to the scene to find out where she was found.
The police informed him that he was about to inform the victim's family about the incident.

Cromwell's memory before the British Parliament's last victim in the dispute about "writing history again"
The removal of the monument would bring justice to remind the Taliban of the destruction of many English cultural and religious forgetfulness by its radical, Puritan supporters.
However, the Cromwell Society described Jeremy Crick's proposal as "crazy" and "try to write history again".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “In view of the ongoing debate on the removal of monuments, the issue of the status of Oliver Cromwell before the Westminster Palace was a matter of time.
The illustrative actions during the English domestic wars were neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Maybe his ancestor Thomas was determined to punish this Cromwell before.
The way Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft introduced Cromwell to the memorial shows how this 19th - century policy was pleased and that for many people it is a character that is still worth remembering.
John Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “By many people Cromwell was seen – perhaps more often in the 19th century than at present – as a defender of parliament from outside pressure.
The assessment, as far as possible, is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
It is certain, however, that the conflict of the 17th century formed the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure that identifies one of the sides of the division.
His achievements as a protector's lord also deserve to be taught and remembered."
In China, there has been a fatal disturbance of the farmer by the pig
According to local media, a deadly attack on the farmer occurred on the market in south-west China.
On Sunday, the newspaper South China Morning Post reported that a dead man named Yuan was found bleeding and with a broken artery near the mall in Liupanshui, in the province of Kuiczu.
The pig breeder prepares to carry out vaccinations in the province of Qinghai, China, on 30 May 2005.
According to the report, the man came to the market with his cousin from the neighboring province of Junnan to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning, the cousin found a man's body and noticed an open door to the nearby cellar.
He said there was a great request for blood in the river.
The body section confirmed that about 250 kilograms of pigs had been fatally disturbed by the farmer.
"My cousin's feet were bleeding and bleeding," said a man named Wu quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
The material from the surveillance camera shows that Yuan came to the market on Thursday at 4:40 to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed a man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The trade manager told Guiyang Evening News in an interview that during the gathering of evidence by the police, the request was isolated to avoid another attack.
According to reports, the family of men and the trade authorities negotiate compensation for death.
In the past, cases of swine attacks on humans have been reported, although they are rare.
In 2016 the pig attacked a woman and her husband at a farm in Massachusetts.
Ten years earlier, in Wales, about 300-kilograms of pigs led the farmer to the tractor, and the man's wife managed to pull the animal.
After eating a pig farmer from Oregon in 2012 one of the farmers in Manitoba told CBC News that these animals are not usually aggressive, but blood taste can free them from brutal behaviour.
"They just want to have fun.
They're so curious about anything children don't want to hurt anyone.
They just have to show them proper respect," he said.
Residues after Hurricane Rosa cause severe rainfall in the south-west part of the United States
According to Hurragan Rosa's forecasts, it's losing its power, moving over the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the next few days, there is intense rainfall in northern Mexico and in the south-west of the United States.
Huragon Rosa knows at almost 137 km/h. On Sunday at 5:00 east time he was given category 1. He was then found 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
According to the forecast on Sunday, Rosa will move north.
In the meantime over the Pacific, it begins to form as an easterly direction on the western coast of the United States. On Monday, Rosa will approach the California Peninsula as a tropical storm, moving the mass of wet air north, to the south-west of the United States.
On Monday, it will bring rainfall of up to 25 cm in parts of the territory of Mexico.
In the next few days, wet tropical air coming into contact with the coming down causes rain showers in the South West of the United States.
In some places rainfall of 2.5 to 10 cm will lead to sudden rainfall, pollution displacement and possible rainfall in desert areas.
Wild tropical air causes rainfall anywhere from 5 to 7.5 cm per hour. This is particularly true in parts of Nevada and Arizona.
Even from 5 to 10 cm of rain is expected in some areas of the South West of the United States, especially above most of Arizona.
Due to the widespread nature of tropical rainfall, sudden floods and violent changes in conditions are possible.
In the face of the threat of tropical rain, it is strongly recommended to move on foot to the desert.
The canyons can turn canyons into flowing rivers, and storms with piers cause local winds and the movement of dust.
Coming before the floods will bring local rains on the southern coast of California.
It is possible that rains of a total height of more than 1.3 cm may cause small movements of pollution and road hazards.
It would be the first rainfall of this time in the region.
The tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday. On Monday afternoon and Tuesday the rainfall will occur in more areas.
On Tuesday, the rains will reach the Four Corners region in the western part of the United States and last until mid.
In October, temperature fluctuations can occur in the Arctic region throughout the United States. However, in the intervertebral zone there will be more heat.
It can lead to violent temperature changes in small distances.
A good example is the weekly temperature differences in the central part of the States.
Between Kansas City (stan Missouri) and Omaha (stan Nebraska) and St Louis (stan Missouri) and Des Moines (stan Iowa) these differences are almost 10 degrees Celsius.
In the next few days, summer temperatures may increase again.
In most central and eastern parts of the United States, temperatures should range from 26 to 32 degrees Celsius in the area from the southern part of the Great Plains to the north-east.
On Tuesday in New York, the temperature can reach 27 degrees Celsius, about 5 degrees above average.
Long-term weather forecasts show a high probability of rising above temperatures in the east of the United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people attended Brett Kavanaugh's interrogation
More than 20 million people have watched six television stations leading a Thursday's hearing of candidates at the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman accused of sexual harassment in the 1980s.
Despite the ongoing political impact on Friday, the commentators had to interrupt regular programmes to inform about the sudden return: the agreement proposed by Senator Jeff Flake, according to which the FBI will conduct a weekly prosecution investigation.
Christine Blasey Ford testified to the senate judicial commission that she was 100% sure that Kavanaugh had noticed her in a state of neutrality and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
In his emotional testimony, Kavanaugh said, however, that he was convinced that such a situation had no place.
It is possible that the fifth number of televisions was even greater than that given by Nielsen 20.4 million.
The company counted the average number of TV stations CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
However, for other stations, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, no figures were available yet.
In addition, Nielsen usually has difficulty in measuring the visibility of people at work.
The given number is close to the visibility of the U.S. football Cup games or the award of the American Film Academy.
According to a report by Nielsen Fox News Channel, whose representatives firmly supported Kavanaugha’s nomination, she had the highest visibility. She was an average of 5.69 million views during the day’s interview.
In the second place was the ABC station with 3.26 million views.
CBS had 3.1 million views, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Jeff Flake became the key figure of Friday's events.
In the early hours, he was captured by CNN and CBS station cameras after the office of this moderate Republican issued a statement that he had decided to support Kavanaugh's nomination. At the recording he yelled at demonstrators who made it difficult for him to get in the way of hearing the Judicial Commission.
Flake with his head down for a few minutes was listening to unrelenting opinions, and the whole event was broadcast by CNN.
"I stand here before you and ask.
Do you think he's telling the national truth?
You have strength in the face of so many women" – you have heard from a demonstration woman.
Before closing the elevator door, Jeff Flake said that his office had issued an appropriate statement and that he would speak at the hearing of the committee.
Later, television stations continued to broadcast events awaiting a vote on the nomination of Kavanaugh before the whole Senate.
Flake said that he would only support the nomination when he knew that the FBI was investigating the charges in the coming week, which the minority of Democrats was charged with.
Flake was convinced after some conversation with his friend, Senator Chris Coons of the Democratic Party.
Flake made a decision after meeting Chris Coons and several other senators.
The election of Flake was important because the Republic would not have the votes necessary to approve Brett Kavanaugh's nomination without investigation.
President Trump has initiated an FBI case on the charges brought against Brett Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of using Brexit for their own benefit
In a weekly Sunday Times report, Prime Minister Theresa May accused the criticism of its European Union's abandonment plan of playing the future of Britain and undermining national interest.
Prime Minister Theresa May attends the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on 29 September 2018.
In addition to this statement presented by Theresa May, the foreign minister in her government, Boris Johnson, attacked a plan of future relations with the European Union following Brexit, according to which the UK and the EU could charge it on its behalf, calling it "a completely non-corrosive one".
Shooting Wayde Sims: Police arrested Dieteon Simpson suspect of LSU's murder
Police arrested the suspect in connection with the death of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player in the colors of the University of Louisiana State (LSU).
According to a report by the police in Baton Rouge, 20-year-old Dieteon Simpson was arrested and put in custody under second-degree murder.
The authorities published a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police informed him that Sims lost his glasses during the battle.
As related to CBS station WAFB police officers found these glasses on the site and found traces of DNA Simpson.
The police reported after Simpson's interview that he confessed to shooting Wade.
As a detained lawyer handed down, the amount of bail was set at $350,000.
On Friday, the coroner's office in East Baton Rouge issued a preliminary report that led to the death of a head and neck shot.
The police command expressed thanks to the State Police Search Group Louisiana, the State Criminalist Police Laboratory, the Southern University Police and the nearby residents for the aid of the investigation leading to the arrest.
Joe Aleva, Director of LSU Sports, thanked the local authorities for their "work and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
A 198 cm man grew up in Baton Rouge. His father Wayne Sims also played basketball in LSU.
In his last season, he scored on average at 5.6 points and 2.6 matches.
On Friday morning, a basketball coach from LSU Will Wade said the team was "scattered" and "scattered" by Wayde's death.
"It's one of the things we're always afraid of," said Will Wade.
Ash emitted by the volcano of Mexico City
The dust emanating from the Volcano Popocatepetl reached the southern parts of the capital of Mexico.
On Saturday, the national food disaster prevention centre encouraged Mexico’s inhabitants to get closer to the volcano due to increased activity in the crater and 183 cases of gas and ash emissions over 24 hours.
The Centre has noted numerous doubts and shocks.
The photos published in social media show the front lines of cars covered with a thin layer of ashes in Mexico’s districts, such as Xochimilco.
Since the earthquake of 7.1 degrees, which visited Mexico in September 2017, geophysics have recorded an increase of 72 km to the south east from the capital of the country.
The volcano, also known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police senior with Catalan separatists before the annual referendum on independence
On Saturday in Barcelona, six people were arrested as a result of the elderly demonstrators who supported Catalonia's independence with the preventive police forces. On that day, thousands took part in their enemies' demonstrations commemorating the first anniversary of the upcoming final referendum on Catalonia's session.
The group of masked separators cast the eggs and paint powder by police officers. The dark clouds of dust overwhelmed the streets usually full of tourists.
It also came to an end in the later part of the day. To stop police forces from fighting, they used sticks.
For a few hours, the group in support of independence scandals "We don't forget, we don't forgive".
As the local press reports, fourteen people received medical assistance due to minor injuries reported during the protests.
After a year since the October 1st referendum, tension is not weak. Although the authorities in Madrid considered them illegal, there is still reason to celebrate the catalonian sessions.
The majority voted for independence, but the frequency was low in view of the wide-ranging boycott of the opponents.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost a thousand people suffered injuries last year in brutal seniors with police trying to prevent voting in polls.
On Friday evening, a group of supporters of the independence of the region decided to prevent demonstrations by supporting policemen.
The demonstration took place in spite of this, but a change of route was forced.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who joined his wife in the separatist protest, said there is no hope for Catalonia's independence.
"Last year we survived one of our most beautiful moments in our lives.
My parents cried out with joy that they could vote, but now we are stuck in the point of no exit," he said.
Despite the important but small victory in the local elections last December, the supporters of the Catalonian session have difficulty in continuing. Many of the most well-known leaders have decided to leave or expect to be arrested in connection with the role played in the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a four-year-old telephony mechanic who supports the police, said politicians on both sides of the dispute are reversing the conflict.
"The situation is getting more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders detained since the end of last year, announced the desire to start in the upcoming elections to the European Parliament.
"Candidateing to the European Parliament in elections is the best way to exacerbate the crisis of the democratic value of the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after driving home
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested several times by car in Londonderry.
The event took place at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday about 7:30 p.m. in British time (BST).
Detective Bob Blemmings said the damage covered the gate and the building.
At some point in the direction of the car, a shot could also be fired.
The Mengi Gate provides a Livingston win over Rangers 1:0
The first goal of Dolly's Mengi for Livingstone was to win the team
From this season on, Livingston's exclamation club had the Rangers in a crash, giving Steven Gerrard a second defeat in his 18 matches at the position of Ibrox Park club coach.
The Dolly Mengi gate proved victorious, and Gary Holt's team moved to the second place in a table occupied with the Hibernian.
The team under Gerrard's leadership remains in this season without a victory to go to the Premiership. Next Sunday the team will meet with the leader of Hearts, to whom he loses eight points.
Earlier, because on Thursday, Rangers will host the Rapid Vienna team as part of the UEFA European League.
Livingston extends the series of victories in his division to six matches. Coach Holt didn't notice any defeats from being replaced last month by Kenny Miller.
Livingstone missed several occasions against undisposed opponents
The team run by Holta should have been running a lot earlier, as the team's game contributed to the range of problems.
First Scott Robinson went through the defense and shot himself in the light of the gate, but failed to shoot him naked. Then Alan Lithgow did not hit the head of Craig Halkett.
The hosts allowed Rangsom to play close to the gate, knowing that they could threaten the rivals during the constant fragments of the game.
And that's the way the breaking gate fell.
Following the submission by the Rangers of the release of the Livingston Free Team, Declan Gallagher and Robinson jointly created the situation of Mendza, who got naked from the inside of the criminal field.
At this stage, the Rangers had more possessions, but they could not force the defenses of the economy and did not cause more problems to Liam Kelly.
This scheme was repeated in the second half, and Alfredo Morelos gave one shot at Kelly's gate.
Scott Pittman's sample was armed by Rangers Allan McGregor, and Lithgow was unable to hit the gate in the light of another permanent fragment on behalf of Livingstone.
The Rangers continued attacks in the Livingstone penal field, but could not use the situation. Two executions were claimed after Halkett's intervention against the Glenn Middleton variable and one hand-playing.
"The Phenomenal" of Livingstone – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland in Almondvale Park
Great performance and result for Livingstone.
In his opinion, they played a great game, again and again, beyond expectations.
Their style and composition have hardly changed from return to extraclass. However, Holt should be appreciated for motivating the team to play.
This game had a lot of heroes.
Captain Craig Halkett played a huge role, leading a great organized defense. Menga made Connor Goldson and Joe Worall very careful throughout the match.
Sorry, there is no choice to fight.
Although Gerrard's leadership had great moments, they didn't support their standards in the match.
In their game something seemed to be missing: only once managed to break through the defense of the owner. This should be a serious warning to the Rangers who were in the middle of the table.
Mixed reactions to Erdogan's visit to Colonia
During the Saturday breakfast in Berlin (September 29th) the leaders of Turkey and Germany accompanied smiles and beautiful weather.
This was the last day of the upcoming meeting of President Erdogan's visit to Germany, with the aim of improving relations between NATO allies.
Disputes have led to differences in issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the European Union.
After meeting Erdogan, he went to the colony where he opened a new, huge mosque.
In this city, the largest number of Turks live outside their homeland.
According to the police, for security reasons, a 25-thousand crowd gathered in front of the temple was blocked, but the president's supporters gathered around to see their leader.
The hundreds of opponents of Erdogan – including many Kurds – also decided to express their opinion, condemning the Turkish leader's policy and the German government's decision to adopt a policy in the country.
The opposition protests reflect the divisions that prompted the visit of a politician called the hero by a part of the Turks living in Germany and who was regarded as an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: a biker died as a result of an accident with a car
The Rowerist died after being hit by a car in London.
There was an accident near the crowded intersection of Bewood Street and Evelyn Street in Deptford, the south-eastern district of the city, about 10:15 a.m. in British time (BST).
After the accident, the driver stopped the vehicle and the rescuers arrived. Despite the intervention, the man died in the crash.
A few months ago, on Childers Street (about half a mile away from the site of the Saturday accident) another fatal accident occurred with the involvement of the biker.
Metro police have found that officials are working on identifying a dead man and informing him about the events of family members.
Roads were closed and bus tours were organized, and drivers were advised to avoid the nearby area.
Long Lartin Criminal Service: Six officials reported injuries as a result of confusion
As provided by the authorities, six officials reported injuries resulting from interference in the criminal facility for men with an increased level of safety.
The HMP Long Lartin penitentiary in Worcestershire began Sunday around 9:30 a.m. and continues.
The Special Unit "Tornado" was called for eight prisoners to be held in one of the wing of the establishment.
The officials on the spot reported minor facial injuries.
“ Specially trained personnel were involved in the HMP Long Lartin criminal service, ” said the firm’s editor.
Six officers have reported minor injuries.
We don't tolerate violence in our institutions, and we're convinced that those responsible will be handed over to the police and may spend more time in prison."
There are more than 500 prisoners in the HMP Long Lartin prison, including one of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
According to the report in June, the director of the facility had to go to the hospital after being attacked by one of the prisoners.
In October last year, prevention teams were called to the plant because of the dangerous interferences in which workers were attacked by ballad bullets.
The sudden floods caused by Hurricane Rosa threaten Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (possible beneficial effects on areas covered by drought)
It is rare that tropical depression will reach the state of Arizona. It is likely that it will occur at the beginning of next week.
The National Weather Service has already issued a warning on Monday and Tuesday in West Arizona, South and East Nevada, South-East California and Utah, including cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
As predicted on Tuesday, Rosa will pass directly over Phoenix. On Monday afternoon, rainfalls will begin.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix reported through the Twitter service that “since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the state of storm or tropical depression over 320 km away from Phoenix.
Huragan Katrina (in 1967) approached a distance of 65 km from Arizona's border".
The latest National Hurricane Center models predict rainfalls from 5 to 10 cm. In some areas Mogollon Rim in Arizona can reach heights up to 15 cm.
In the other desert areas of the South West, including in the Central Rocky Mountains and the Great Cotline, the rainfall is likely to fall from 2.5 to 5 cm, and in some areas up to 10 cm.
In addition to areas threatened by sudden rainfall associated with Hurricane Rosa, the region has been able to cope with drought for some time.
Although the floods are a serious threat, some of the rainfall will improve the situation in the South West, where drought is prevalent.
As the weather.com portal reports, the U.S. Drought Monitor estimates that almost 40% of the Arizona area will match the affected droughts in the second of the highest categories.
Hurragan Rosa arrives first on the California Peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning Rosa continued to move with the hurricane force, reaching speeds up to 137 km/h. Currently she is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and is heading north at 19 km/h.
Hurragan meets the cooler waters of the Pacific Ocean, causing its weakening.
According to the forecast, it will hit Mexico with a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Intensive rainfall in some parts of Mexico may pose a major challenge to success.
Portal weather.com stated that “in the area from the California Peninsula to the north-west part of Sonora state, there are rainfalls of 7 to 15 cm, although they may reach 25 cm”.
Then the Hurricane Rosa will pass through Mexico in the north as a tropical storm. On Tuesday, in early morning hours, it will reach the Arizona border as a tropical depression. On Tuesday evening, it will enter the southern part of Utah state.
"The most serious threat posed by Hurricane Rosa or its remains is the very severe rainfall in the California Peninsula, in the north-west part of Sonor state and in the south-west desert areas of the United States," said the National Hurricane Center.
It is estimated that the rains cause life-threatening sudden floods and pollution in the desert and mud lava in the mountainous area.
An attack in Midsomer Norton: four persons arrested for attempted murder

Officials shall request contact of all persons with recordings of the event.
Trump stated that Brett Kavanaugh "demonstrated the hostility and anger" of the Democratic Party
"The vote given to Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the absolute and repulsive action of the Democratic Party," Trump said of his age in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump stated that Kavanaugh "perceived anger and anger" of the Democratic Party during the nomination process.
On Thursday, Brett Kavanaugh witnessed before the convention. He was staunch and emotionally opposed to the accusations of Christina Blasey Ford. A woman said that several decades ago when they were both teenagers, the man allowed himself sexual assault against her.
Ford also testified during the hearing on the charges raised by her.
On Saturday, the president said that on that day, "the Americans could be convinced of the brightness, class and courage" of Kavanaugh.
"The voice given to Judge Kavanaugh is the voice of the support of one of the most significant lawyers of our time, the knowledge of the law of great merit for the community," he said before the crowd of supporters of the West Virginia era.
The President did not simply refer to the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh, discussing the importance of the frequency of Republicans in case of half the presidential election.
"Of the most important choices in our lives, we are divided by five weeks.
I do not start in these elections, but I remain very active," he said.
"I'm always fighting to defend our great candidates."
Trump argues that the Democrats are pursuing a policy of "resistance and hindering activity".
As the CNN station said one of the assistants of the Republican Party's important policy, the first key senate vote on the appointment of Kavanaugh is expected no later than Friday.
Hundreds of victims of earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia.
According to the authorities on Saturday, at least 384 people died – many of whom were kidnapped by high waves of beach breakers – following a strong earthquake of land and tsunamis that visited the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
On Friday in Pala, hundreds of people gathered on the beach to participate in the festival city. On the way to the shore, they hit waves reaching up to 6 meters high, snatching many people and destroying everything on their way.
The tsunami was the result of an earthquake of 7.5 degrees.
"When the threat came yesterday, people living on the beach did not run away immediately and fell victim to the tsunamis," he said at a conference in Jakarta Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, spokesperson of the Indonesian Food Disaster Agency of BNPD.
"Tsunami attacked everything on its way, driving cars, colds and homes," Nugroho said. Then he added that before reaching the shoreline, the food moved to the sea at a speed of 800 km/h.
As he said, some were saved by climbing a tree and were able to survive.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Pala.
Many destroyed houses and shops, damaged and damaged bridges and water-rounded machete can be seen in the aerial photos published by the Food Disaster Agency.
On Saturday, the coastal city visited secondary shocks.
A series of earthquakes occurred in the area inhabited by 2.4 million people.
According to the Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Use of Technology (BPPT), the energy released by the extensive fifth earthquake of the earth was about twenty times higher than the energy of the nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The declaration stated that the geographical location of the city, which is at the end of the long, narrow bay, could have affected the effects of the tsunami.
Sutopo Purvo Nugroho described the damage as "significant" and said that the impact was caused by hundreds of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels.
He then added that parts of the victim’s body were found under damaged buildings, 540 people were injured, and 29 people were considered missing.
Nugroho said that deaths and damage could be greater along the coast line 300 km north of Pala, in the area called Dongala, which was located near the Earth's earthquake epicenter.
According to Nugro, the communication "was fully co-sponsored", and therefore there are no reports from the province of Dongal.
“There are more than 300 thousand people” — you can read in the Red Cross statement. It has also been added that workers and volunteer organizations are taking part in a disaster-affected site.
"Now we can talk about tragedy, although the situation may lead to a significant deterioration," said the statement.
On Saturday, the agency met with a general criticism because of the lack of information on the impact of the waves in Paul. However, the authorities said that the waves had just come after the warning.
In an amateur recording available in social media, you can see a man screaming out of the building trying to warn about the coming tsunamis of the person on the street.
Within a few minutes, the water wall broke down on the shore, snatching buildings and cars.
The Reuters Agency was unable to immediately confirm the authenticity of the recording.
Earthquakes and tsunamis have caused significant shortages in the supply of electricity, preventing communication within the framework of the Pale. This has, in turn, hampered the authorities' coordination of rescue activities.
According to the authorities, transport aircraft were launched using Jakarta and other cities, but the people evacuated still need food and other basic items of the first need.
The airport located in the city is open only for transport with humanitarian aid. The airport will remain inactive until October.
On Sunday, President Joko Widodo will visit the centres for those evacuated in Pala.
Over 800 victims of tsunamis in Indonesia.
The situation is very bad.
As brought by Doseb T. Sinai, the National Director of World Vision, the staff of this organization arrived safely from the province of Dongal to the city of Pala and found shelter in shelters from the shelters placed in the office area.
"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
The situation is very bad.
Although part of the groups slowly began to carry out the aid, there were voices of criticism that the travel to Paul by foreign humanitarian workers with a rich experience would not be possible.
According to Indonesian law, the acceptance of funding, resources and personnel from abroad can only begin after the disaster has been declared by the national disaster area.
That's not what we're doing right now.
"We are officially still dealing with a disaster of regional scope," said the Indonesian Red Cross spokesman.
"When the government recognizes that a national disaster has occurred, we will be able to start accepting international aid, but it has not happened yet."
After two days from the fifth earthquake of the earth and the tsunamis in Paul, friends and families of those who have been lost are still alive in hope that their loved ones will find some wonder among the destruction.
A little boy was pulled out of the canal on Saturday.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who spent two days under the rags next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandano, a coach of the Indonesian satellite representation, trained two missing parallels participating in this month's Asian Games in Indonesia.
As Petra Mandaga said, other people trapped in the Roa Roa hotel were his students.
"As an experienced co-pilot, I am struggling with my own emotional burden," he announced.
Gendon Subandano told us that within a few hours of the appearance of the community's satellite information about the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel, whatsApp communicator sent messages to athletes participating in the festival on the beach.
His messages were marked only by one grey hooker instead of a pair of blue hackers.
"It seems to me that this means that messages have not been delivered," he said.
Stealers stole 26 750 USD while filling cash in the ATM in Newport on the Levee shopping center
According to the Newport police commander's statement on Friday morning, the thief was stolen 26 750 USD from Brink's employee who added cash to Newport on the Levee's ATM.
"The car driver emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and prepared to supplement the cash," wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in a public communication.
Another man "run from behind to Brink's employee" and stole a purse with money for the ATM.
According to the report, the witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but the police did not report how many people were involved in the theft.
All persons with information on the identity of the thief are requested to contact the police in Newport under number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes name to Ye
Raper Kanye West decided to change his name to Ye.
As he announced his intention in Twitter on Saturday, he wrote about himself: "A person who was previously known as Kanye West".
Forty-year-old music has been using the pseudonym Ye since some time. It is also the title of his eight album released in June.
The change took place before a visit to the Saturday Night Live program. It is expected that during the artist's performance he will present his new album, Mr. Yandhi.
He will be replaced by the songwriter Ariana Grande, who, according to the authors, has given up "for emotional reasons".
The West has already stated that the word "Ye" is not only short of his present artistic experience, but it has religious significance.
"It seems to me that "yes" is the most commonly used word in the Bible. In the Holy Scriptures it means "You"," said West in an earlier period of the year, talking about the title of the album with a radio presenter about the pseudonym Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's about us.
First I was Kanye, which means the only person. Now I am Ye – a reflection of all our good, bad and bad traits.
The album shows us who we are."
The West was among other famous rappers who decided to change their name.
Sean Combs, known under the pseudonyms of Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, announced this year that he wanted to be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, former West co-worker, also recorded his pseudonym in various ways, with a connector, without a connector and large letters.
President Andrés Manuel López Obrador elects not to use military against civilians
In the early 50th anniversary of the student demonstration by the president of Mexico, Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO) has committed himself never to use war against civilians.
On Saturday in place of the Three Cultures López Obrador promised "never use the army to repress the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, soldiers opened fires in front of a peaceful demonstration, killing even 300 people. The event occurred at a time when left movements of students began to develop throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support the young people of Mexico by providing monthly financial assistance for students, as well as by creating more free public schools.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities led young people to criminal groups.
The United States should double the funding of research on artificial intelligence
As Kai-Fu Lee says, the investor and knowledgeer of artificial intelligence working for Google, Microsoft and Apple groups, together with increased Chinese activity in this area of the United States should double research expenditure in the field of SI.
Note is taken to relate to the announcements on artificial intelligence published by various U.S. government agencies, although the US does not have an official SI strategy.
Meanwhile, last year China presented its plan, according to which by 2030 they wanted to be the most innovative country in the field of artificial intelligence.
"At first we have to double the research budget over SI: all other countries are far behind the United States, and we are trying to make another breakthrough in this area," Kai-Fu Lee said.
In a report this week, CNBC also said that double funding could double the chances of further breakthroughs in the field of artificial intelligence in the United States.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, president of the company Sinovation Ventures. The company invested in one of the most important companies in Chinese art intelligence, known as Face++.
In the 1980s, Kai-Fu Lee worked at Carnegie Mellon University on the creation of an SI system that won the best American player in the game Othello. He then took the lead in Microsoft Research and was president of the Chinese Google Department.
Lee has recognized the success of earlier U.S. government technology initiatives, for example, organised by the Agency for Advanced Research Projects in the Defence Area (DARPA) for the most interesting projects of work. He has also asked the question of the deadline for the next edition of the competition, as he believes it will help to find future viewers.
As Kai-Fu Lee said, scientists in the United States often have to work very hard to get government grants.
"It's not China that we get the best representatives of academic environments, but corporations," Lee said.
For a few years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been hiring excellent scientists to work on artificial intelligence.
According to Lee, changes in immigration policy could also help the United States in the development of SI.
"I think that people who are dealing with artificial intelligence who have received a doctor's degree of science should automatically admit a green card," he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese State Council published a plan to create artificial intelligence for the next generation.
According to Lee, the Chinese National Foundation for Natural Science (National Natural Science Foundation of China) provides funding to members of academic institutions in a way close to the American National Foundation for Science and other governmental organizations that recognise American science. However, the quality of academic activity in China is lower.
In earlier this year, the United States Department of Defence launched a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which will engage in the work of partners from the world of industry and science. The White House announced the establishment of a special commission for artificial intelligence.
This month, DARPA also informed about the allocation of USD 2 billion to the AI Next initiative.
The National Science Foundation currently invests more than USD 100 billion a year in research on SI.
At the same time, the American initiative to set up the National Commission for the Safety of Artificial Intelligence has not moved forward from month to month.
Macedonians vote in the referendum on the change of the name of their country
On Sunday, the Macedonians voted in the referendum on the change of their country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia, which would allow the movement to win a decades-old dispute with Greece, which is blocking the country's efforts to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, where the historic region of Macedonia is located, maintains that the name of the northern neighbour is a claim to its territory, and therefore called upon the country to join the EU and NATO.
In June, the governments of the two countries reached agreement on the name, but the nationalists argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slovenian majority of Macedonians.
President Ivanov said he would not take part in the vote. The boycott campaign raised doubts as to whether the frequency would reach the minimum level of 50% required to consider the referendum binding.
The referendum asked the following question: "Do you support joining NATO and the EU after the adoption of an agreement with Greece"?
The name change supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaew, say that it is worth paying the price for Macedonia's accession – one of the countries that emerged after the fall of Yugoslavia – to organisations such as the European Union or NATO.
"I voted for the future of my country so that young Macedonians can live free under the European Union umbrella. EU membership will provide us with greater security," said 79-year-old Oliver Georgievska from Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, a sufficient number of parliamentarians have declared that it respects the results of the vote.
The change of name requires the support of two thirds of Parliament's members.
The National Electoral Commission informed that no unusual events were recorded until 13 p.m.
However, the frequency at this hour was only 16% compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016. At that time 66% of the persons qualified gave their vote.
"I voted in favour of my children. Our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Tanewski, an elector from Skopje.
On 30 September 2018, in Strumica, Macedonia, Prime Minister Zoran Zaew, his wife Zorica and son Duszko voted in a referendum on the change of country name in order to pave the way for membership in NATO and the European Union.
Prior to the building of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kawardarkow prepared a small scene and set up a chair in front of the hires distributed by the boycotting referendums.
"We support membership in NATO and the EU, but we want to join these organisations with the united head, not the back door," Kawardark said.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don't want us as Macedonia, we can go to other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaew argues that NATO membership will bring the necessary investments to Macedonia, at which the unemployment rate is more than 20%.
"I believe that the vast majority will talk about changing the name of the referendum, because 80% of the citizens support the European Union and NATO," Zaew said after the vote.
He said the vote on 'yes' was 'confirming our future'.
In a poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Public Research Institute from 30 to 43% of voters declared their desire to participate in the referendum.
According to another survey carried out by Macedonian TV Telma TV in Sunday's referendum, 57% of respondents are scheduled to vote.
70% of respondents found that they supported a change in the name.
In order for the vote to be successful, the frequency must be 50% + 1 vote.
The failure in the referendum would be the first serious concern in the policy of the Western government since the adoption of power in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City defeats the entire Brigton defense and gets the gate
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling sent Brighton's defense home at a Saturday meeting concluded with 2:0 for Manchester City. The match was played at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
The gate obtained by Aguerra in 65 minutes seemed to be childishly easy.
The action began from being given in the middle of the box to the Argentine attacker.
The baller raced three Brighton defenders.
Then Aguero was found among the four Brighton contestants.
First he played one of them, then he raced the others and found himself on the edge of Brighton's criminal field.
Then he played the ball to the left where he was waiting for Sterling.
The English attacker just gave the ball back to Aguera in the criminal field, which beat Brighton Mathew Ryan's brake shot on the right side of the gate.
"Aguero fights with his footfall," he told the journalist, Coach Manchester City Pep Guardiola.
"We talked about playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's exactly what happened.
We were lucky he got the gate at the time."
However, Sterling provided the blue first single lead in the Premier League.
The gate he's talking about fell in 29 minutes.
In this action, Aguero got the ball deep in the middle of Brighton.
He sent a great offer to Leroy Sane on the left.
Sane made a few moves, allowing Sterling to move on to the distant columns.
The Manchester City attacker was driving a ball to the net just before she got out of the car.
Manchester City will meet with Hoffenheim at the UEFA Championships League on Tuesday at 12:55. The meeting will take place at Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in Sinsheim (Germany).
Scherzer wants to destroy the chances of winning Rockies
After losing his chance to participate in the play-off phase by Washington Nationals Scherzer, he didn't have to take the first stage.
However, the popular competition Scherzer hopes to take place in Sunday's meeting against Colorado Rockies, if only Rockies keep the chance to play in the play-off phase. Currently the team has one more victory than Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West division.
Rockies can at least count on a wild card if they win a fifth meeting against the Nationals result 5:2. However, they still want to get their first title to the division champion.
"Although we play "about nothing", at least we will go out on the battlefield, knowing that the atmosphere in Denver and the presence of opponents will be at the highest level, as in the rest of the season.
Why don't I want to take part in this meeting."
The Nationals have not yet announced the starter for a Sunday meeting. However, the team agrees to show Scherser in the first class.
It would be the thirty-fourth show of Scherzer in the first class.
The right-wing team leader from Washington recorded results 18-7 and ERA 2.53. 300 times eliminated the bats and counted 220 and 2/3 rounds in the season.
So Trump in West Virginia
Trump did not simply refer to his nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court Judge, discussing the importance of the frequency of Republicans in the case of half of the election.
"In November we are going to go mad at all the achievements that have been achieved.
From one of the most important choices in our lives, we are divided into five weeks.
I don't get started, but I'm very active, and I keep on arming our great candidates," he said.
He then continued: “We have to deal with a huge group of radical Democrats, and we see their actions in our own eyes.
They are determined to take power by all possible means, they are evil and evil.
They do not care about who is injured and who is forced to harm, in order to gain power and control; this is their goal and control; and We do not give them any change.
As he said, the Democrats are carrying out the mission of "resistance and obstruction of activities".
"It has been very good to see this in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "bad, evil, unpleasant and unreal".
The president referred to the Senate Judicial Commission, calling on the name and name of the American senator from the Democratic Party of Diana Feinstein, which met with a loud noise from the crowd.
"Do you remember her answer?
Are you responsible for the leak?
"Ouch, do I hear?
It was the worst word I've ever seen."
The Working Party is no longer a group of people with different views.
The party is intolerant to those who express their own opinions
When the members of the Momentum organization in my party voted against me, I was not surprised.
Finally, I am a member of the Group of the Ambassadors of the Working Party, who was recently told that they were not well seen, and all because of their own opinions.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan met with similar treatment because she opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the application for a bribe was based on differences of opinion between me and Jeremy Corby.
The differences concerned the importance of responsible economic policy, national security and Europe.
In a Friday announcement on the meeting of the Working Party parliamentarians from Nottingham East, it was possible to read: "We want the meetings to be open and productive".
For eight years, I have performed the functions of the Ambassador of the Labour Party, and the majority of the five-day meetings of the General Committee seemed to be so.
Unfortunately, many meetings are currently taking place differently, and the promises of a "more heartier and more gentle" policy have long been forgotten, as they have ever been remembered.
It is increasingly evident that different views are not tolerated in the Working Party. Each opinion is assessed in accordance with the Party's direction.
It all started soon after Jeremy Corby's position as President. The colleagues, in which I felt we had similar views, began to expect me to change my direction and take up the positions I had not agreed with before, concerning issues such as national security or the EU's single market.
After every public event, no matter what the content, I will meet in the social media with attacks calling for nominations, abstention from the Centre or abstention from the Labour Party.
It's not just my experience.
I'm more lucky than some of my colleagues, because the points addressed under my address are rather political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues who experience daily sexist or racist treatment, but do not avoid further action.
One of the most disappointing aspects of the current policy is the transition to a daily agenda with injuries to others.
Last week Jeremy Corbyn said that the Working Party should support a culture of tolerance.
In fact, we are no longer a group of people with different views, with every request for 'vote of trust' and every change in the rules of choice of the party's world view being suspended.
Over the past two years, I have been repeatedly suggested that I do not hesitate to raise some questions, and then everything would be "okay".
But that's not why I took care of politics.
Since joining the Working Party 32 years ago, as a result of Margaret Thatcher's neglect, which led to my school class's breakdown, I try to ensure better quality of public services for those in need – both local councillor and minister.
I've never covered my beliefs, even during my last election campaign.
Everyone in the Nottingham East district knew my position and knew the differences of opinion with the party authorities.
To those who supported the fifth proposal, I would like to say that I cannot understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the president of the Laborists near Brexit, which would harm the domestic economy, businesses and public services.
However, the most important transmission I am sending not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters (both members of the Labour Party and others): I am proud that I can serve you. I promise that no threat to cancellation of the nomination or the desired political goals will discourage me from acting in accordance with their beliefs and in the best interests of all of you.

Ayr versus Melrose 38:17 – invincible Ayr again upstairs
There is no doubt, however, that the Air team has won this extremely interesting match of the Scottish extralige.
The team is in the first place in the table and remains the only unaccompanied team.
At the end of this distinguished defense and better use of the opportunity led the team of the economy to win. Coach Peter Murchie could have been pleased with his guardians.
"So far, the games have been a challenge for us, but we are still unsatisfied, so I am pleased," he said.
Robyn Christie of the Melrose team said: “It is necessary to pay tribute to the Ayr racers.
Ayr went out for a 14-minute drive after Grant Anderson and Frazier Clim. However, the yellow card for Rory Hughes, who came to the team from the Glasgow Warriors team, allowed Melrose to balance the result when Jason Baggot caught the ball after an unused opportunity to raise.
The climate increased Ayr's driving after the execution of the crime just before the end of the first half. He first got a hit, and then took the opportunity to raise, getting the 17-5 for Ayr.
Melrose had a good start in the second half, and Patrick Anderson's application increased by Baggott reduced his loss to five points.
Then there was a longer stop due to the serious contusion of Ruaridh Knott. The racer was removed from the box on his nose. After reinvigorating Ayr, he increased the lead after the application of Stafford McDowall and the rise of the climate.
Next, the captain of the Air Blair Macpherson team received a yellow card. Melrose again used his number: applying with no attempt to raise Bruce Colvin reduced his driving.
The bosses took the initiative when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for dropping the air without a ball.
The climate took advantage of the opportunity to raise it. Then again he managed to raise the result just after the game was resumed, when Kyle Rowe caught a shot from a criminal record and enabled Gregor Henry to get his fifth application for the farmer.
The Still Game series star starts a career in the gastronomic industry
Ford Kieran, the star of the Still Game series, seems to be starting business in the gastronomic industry. Recently it was discovered that he was the director of the restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis at the popular BBC station site. He is performing and co-sponsoring the series together with his multi-year comedy partner Greg Hemphil.
Duet announced that the next nine seasons would be the last in the series history. Everything indicates that Ford Kiernan is planning the future after the abandonment of Craiglang.
According to official data, he became Director of Arigermorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this, although the Scottish Sun informant suggested that Kiernan is trying to engage in the "growing gastronomic industry" in Glasgow.
"The Sea belongs to us": deprived of access to the Bolivian Sea, hope that the court will reopen its way to the Pacific
Marines are patrolling the base of the Marine War Base in La Paz.
There are blue flags out of public buildings.
In the harbors of Lake Titicaca’s warships in the Amazon, the motto is: “The sea is ours under the law.
His recovery is our duty."
In Bolivia's lack of access to the sea, the mention of the shoreline lost to Chile in a bloody 19th-century conflict is still alive.
These hopes may be greater than a few decades. Bolivia expects a judgment of the International Court of Justice. It is due to be issued on 1 October after five years of trial.
"Bolivia's actions are taking the lead. The residents are united, optimistically set up and counted as a beneficial virtue," said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians throughout the country will jointly attend the International Court of Justice meeting. They hope that the organization with its headquarters in The Hague will recognize Bolivia's claim and Chile will have to join the negotiations after decades of unresolved talks on the granting of independent access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic president of Bolivia, who is going to be in an exciting re-election struggle next year, also gives hope in Monday's ruling.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he said at the end of August.
Some analysts say, however, that the chances of making a favourable decision for Bolivia are small and that even the appealing decision would not change much.
The United Nations Office at The Hague has no authority to grant Bolivia the territory of Chile. It also noted that it will not affect the establishment of any talks.
As Paz Zárate said, Chilean expert on international law, the decision of the International Court of Justice will be issued six months after the submission of final arguments.
Unfortunately, Bolivia has been able to distance the country from its destination for the past four years.
"The issue of access to the sea has been addressed by the current Bolivian administration," Paz Zarate said.
Morale's invincible rhetoric has ridden the Chileans of any remnant of good will, she suggests.
Bolivia and Chile will be able to resume their conversation at some point, but it will be very difficult in the face of the present situation.
For both countries, there has been no exchange of ambassadors since 1962.
Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, former president and representative of Bolivia in Hadza, did not agree with the view that the court's decision-making process was extremely rapid.
On Monday, Bolivia will bring "an exceptional opportunity to start a new era in relation to relations with Chile" and the possibility "to end the 139-year period of disputes with mutual benefit," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales — still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America — was using the subject of access to the sea as an element of political play.
"The pain will never give up the right of access to the Pacific," he added.
"The decision is a great opportunity to make sure that we have to cope with the past."
North Korean rulers claim that nuclear disarmament will not happen until they can trust the United States.
North Korea Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his people will never get rid of nuclear weapons until they can trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to fulfil the promises made at the Singapore summit between the leaders of both countries.
His comments appeared when the US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, appeared to be on the verge of a renewed nuclear diplomacy more than three months after meeting North Korea leader Kim Jong Unem in Singapore.
Ri argues that the 'cold' is as if no sanctions were lifted and the US objected to a declaration ending the Korean war had ever thrown North Korea on its knees.
Washington does not want to agree to sign a declaration without prior taking concrete disarmament steps by Pjongang.
Both Kim Jong Un and US President Donald Trump want another meeting.
However, there is widespread skepticism that Pjongang is seriously involved in the disposal of the arsenal, which is seen in North Korea as the only security measure.
Pompeo plans to visit Pjongang next month as part of preparations for the second Kim-Trump summit.
The Paris fashion shows announce the appearance of the newest big lines to cover their heads in clothing shops.
If you want to increase your collection of hats or completely protect yourself from the sun, we have good information for you.
The designers of the fashion Valentino and Thom Browne presented a series of crazy, surpassing covers of their summer collection for 2019, which faded in style during the fashion week of Paris Fashion Week.
Incredibly unpractice hats were on Instagram this year. These designers decided to present their misleading creations on the run.
The distinguished work of Valentino was a huge beige hat decorated with a wide, springing round of models.
Other superior accessories included arbushes, a hat, and even pineapple — but they were not designed to warm the head.
Thom Browne also showed a number of personal masks — at the same time on Halloween.
Many colored masks had a sharp mouth and resembled more Hannibal Lecter style than the high couture.
One creation reminded the equipment to dive with the tube and the eyelids, and another looked like dissolved ice.
And if you don't want to break up with a big fashion, you're lucky.
Style watchers provide that huge hats can reach clothing shops.
Unmeasurable hats are just behind the "La Bomba", a broken hat with a width of 61 cm, all worn – from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cultural brand behind this unusually unpracticable chapel, which passed through the social media, presented another great creation — a broken beach bag almost as large as a model worn in a bathing suit.
The baked orange bag from the rafia, finished with rafia fries and worn with a white leather handle, was distinguished in the Jacquemus La Riviera collection for the summer 2019 season during the fashion week of Paris Fashion Week.
Luke Armitage, star stylist, said F. EMAIL: “I hope that large chapels and beach bags will appear in the shops next year — because the designer has been able to influence so much, it would be difficult not to use the demand for superior accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills needed for the world's citizens
Independent schools in Scotland are constantly enjoying their scientific achievements — in 2018 they were able to praise the other outstanding results of exams, individual and collective success in sports, arts, music and other social activities.
The schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) to which more than 30,000 students are participating throughout Scotland are seeking to provide the best level of services provided to students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further and higher education, chosen by them to pursue their careers and to point out their role as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector with the possibility of developing and implementing a school-friendly learning programme, we see that innovative languages are still popular and desirable subjects for choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said: “If you speak to another man in a language he understands, then he will get to his head.
If you're talking to him in his own language, it's what's going on in his heart."
This is a clear reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The results of the last review this year show that languages take the first place in league rankings, with the highest rates of remoteness in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who learned foreign languages received higher A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 per cent of students received higher grades A in Mandarin and 72 per cent of German students, 69 per cent of French students and 63 per cent of Spanish students also received grades A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as necessary skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
At present, language learning, as subjects for selection, is carried out in the same way as that of STEM subjects (close sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics) under education programmes in independent schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 study conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills showed that for reasons of difficulty in occupying job-free jobs by employers, 17% did not meet the language skills of the candidates.
As a result, language skills are increasingly becoming a requirement for young people to prepare for the start of their career.
These skills are needed in a globalised world with an increasing number of jobs requiring language skills,
Lifelong learning skills, such as learning a second language, will have a tremendous advantage in the future — no matter what the course of professional development is.
The possibility of a direct agreement with people from other countries automatically increases the chances of a multilingual person in relation to competition.
According to a 2013 survey of over 4,000 adult British people, 75% of them could not speak foreign language so well to conduct conversation, and French was the only language whose percentage of people using them was two-digit, i.e. 15%.
Therefore, investing in learning foreign languages is so important for today’s children.
The knowledge of several languages, in particular the languages of the developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding suitable employment.
In Scotland every school will differ in terms of the languages taught in it.
Many schools will focus on more classic innovative languages, while others will learn languages that are considered most important for the United Kingdom by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the interests of the child, in independent schools there will always be many languages to choose which will be taught by specialised teaching staff in this area.
Scottish independent schools are involved in creating a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills needed to make a success — whatever their future holds.
At present, it cannot be denied that international business languages still play a key role in the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should be treated as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will still offer Scottish youth a great choice, diversity and level.
That's just the right thing to do.
John Edward, President of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
Debate LeBron on the Lakers team on Sunday in San Diego.
Fans who want to see LeBron James' debut in Los Angeles Lakers finally met.
Luke Walton, Coach Lakers, announced that LeBron James was playing a Sunday pre-season match against the Denver Nuggets team in San Diego.
It's not known how many minutes he'll play.
"More than one, but less than 48," said Walton on the official website of the Lakers team.
The reporter of the Lakers team, Mike Trudell, on Twitter announced that James is most likely playing an incomplete number of minutes.
After the training that took place at the beginning of this week, James was asked about his plans for the six pre-season Lakers matches.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need to take part in pre-season games to prepare," he said.
So what's going on in West Virginia?
President Donald Trump is starting tonight at Wheeling in West Virginia a series of election events.
This is the first of five selected by Trump for election events to take place next week, together with positions in friendly places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
In addition to the vote confirming that his election to hold a free position in the Supreme Court, Trump is seeking to build support in the forthcoming elections in the semi-governments, as the Republics may be in danger of losing control of the Congress when the votes cast in November.
What time is it going to be tonight for the West Virginia Trumpet to be elected, and where will it be possible to view it online?
The Western Virginia Championship will be held today at 7 p.m. on Saturday, 29 September 2018.
So the Western Virginia Trump will be able to track live via the Internet on YouTube.
The Trump will probably refer to this week's hearings of candidates appointed to the Supreme Court, Bretta Kavanaugh, who took place in a tense atmosphere in connection with allegations of improper sexual behaviour, as well as the Senate's planned vote on suspension of the election for a maximum of one week, during the FBI investigation.
However, the main objective of this series of electoral events is to support the Republicans in the face of the difficult November elections.
So President Trump's campaign with five events next week aims to "mobilize volunteers and volunteers to assist Republicans in the protection and extension of the majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives" — Reuters.
"Congress control is such an important point in the President's schedule that as the hottest season approaches, he will visit as many states as possible," said Trump's campaign spokesman, who did not agree to his name — Reuters.
Today's election at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling can attract fans from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as the attention of the media from Pittsburgh" — West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday Trump will visit West Virginia — the state in which he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016 — for the second time in the last month.
Trump is trying to help the West Virginia candidate to the Senate, the Republican Patrick Morrisey, who loses in the polls.
"This is not a good sign for Morrisey when the president comes to support him in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a politician at West Virginia University — Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: United States team shows the spirit of struggle, maintaining hope for victory in Sunday singles
After three one-sided sessions, the foursome format that took place on Saturday afternoon could be what Ryder Cup needed.
It's a completely invented sport concept, but it's a kind of thing where the players really believe in it, and they're the ones who are the ones who are the ones who do it.
So what's the difference between them right now?
"They've run six points, and now they're only running four, so I think we're having a little break," Jordan Spieth said.
Europe, of course, has four points, while there are twelve more to be achieved.
The Americans, as Spieth says, however, feel the wind in the bubbles and have good examples to imitate, especially in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and each of them can boast of getting three points out of four.
Spieth is dangerous in all areas and provides an example.
The screams on the whole throat, which is a sign of excitement, became more and more loud during the course of his round, hiding the key pot and winning the match when he and Thomas got two holes in two blows.
His reflection on the land that won them with the outcome 15 met with a similar cry — one that made it clear that the American team was still in the game.
"Just focus and worry about your own game," Spieth said.
That's all that's left of each of these contestants.
18 bucks to win.
The only players who have won more points in the last two days than Spieth and Thomas were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the irrefutable story of Ryder Cup.
A strange but charming couple from the European team won four out of four and didn't make a mistake.
"Moliwood" is the only couple who didn't count the bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided the bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back on Friday morning.
The way in which they play and how their energy seems to flow both to and from the hazy crowd proves that these players should be defeated on Sunday, as well as that there is no better player than Fleetwood or Molinari, who could add to the potential victory of the European team on Le Golf National.
It'd be best if they were playing on a variety of wings at the same time.
However, it is too early to speak of the victory of the European team.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly played Sergio Garcia, the early fourball hero when he was saved with Alex Noren.
Goddess and twice as many men on the front of her have dug Spain and Sweden into a hole from which they would never get out.
There's no one to help get out of the hole on Sunday.
Fourball and foursome formats are so fascinating because of the interaction between the funds, the advice they give, the advice they do not give, and how the strategy can be changed at one point.
Europe has so far played a better role as a team and has taken on a significant advantage of the last day, but the foursome session has also shown that the US team has a fight-in-fight which some, especially in the States, have doubted.
Europe with a result of 10-6 includes driving on the final day of Ryder Cup.
Europe with a significant advantage on the last day of Ryder Cup after winning the 10-6 Saturday fourball matches and foursomes with the United States.
The inspired duet — Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari — has scored a match with two victories over the warrior Tiger Woods, increasing his current Le Golf National score to four points.
The European team Thomas Bjorn, trying to maintain the trophy he lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated a small American team in the early form of fourball, winning a 3-1 series.
The United States has put greater resistance in the form of foursomes, winning two matches, but they can't afford to lose.
To keep the trophy, Jim Furyk has to get eight points out of 12 singles that will take place on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first European debuter to win four points in a row, while with Molinarim (this club was called "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend) are only the second pair in the story of Ryder Cup, which won four points in four opening matches.
After the collapse of Woods and Patrick Reed in fourball format, they won a great match for pumped Woods and American debuter Bryson Dechambeau, gaining an even more empathic 5-4-4 result.
Woods, who got tired of two Saturday matches, occasionally showed genius flashing, but had lost 19 out of 29 matches in fourball and foursome formats so far, and that's seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who was not participating in the early fourball format, returned to Henrik Stenson in foursome format to win the 2+1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koopka – taking positions 1 and 3 in the world rankings respectively.
The European team, however, did not all come to mind in this pleasant, cold day in the field that was driven to the south-west of Paris.
The three-time winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the point of reference for the Americans, winning two points on Saturday.
They won the 2+1 victory over Spain Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourball and later returned to win Poulter and Rory McIlroy in foursome format, losing two opening holes.
Only twice in the history of Ryder Cup happened to make the team a four-point loss, starting single, although the Furyk team would only have a resis to keep the trophy.
However, taking second place two days ago, the Sunday contract seems rather unlikely.
North Korea speaks of "stateless non" unilateral disarmament with no confidence.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea said on Saturday during the UN talks that the lack of sanctions only deepens the lack of confidence in North Korea in the United States and there is no way that the country unilaterally renounces nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said at the annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant measures of good will" last year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, disassembly of nuclear testing sites and commitment to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we do not see any concrete response from the US," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no guarantee of our national security and in such circumstances there will be no mention of the unilateral disarmament of North Korea."
While Ri reiterated the well-known North Korean complaints of Washington's refusal to "step" approach to denuclearisation, in which North Korea would be rewarded for its step-by-step action, his statement appeared to be significant because it did not reject unilateral denuclearisation, as it did in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump in the first history of the summit between the President-in-Office of the United States and the leader of North Korea, which took place in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim Jong Un committed himself to "denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula", and Trump promised security guarantees to North Korea.
North Korea expected the formal end of the Korean war (50-1953), but the United States delegation announced that Pjongang must first give up nuclear weapons.
Washington also relied on calls to alleviate the severe international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on "denuclearisation in the first place" and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal in a forced way, even opposed the signing of "war-end declaration," Ri said.
"The statement that sanctions can put us on our knees is a cold of people who behave in a way that is ignorant of us.
However, the problem is that the lack of sanctions deepens our confidence."
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim Jong Une and Donald Trump, which he spoke about at the beginning of the week of the United States leader at the UN Forum.
Instead, the Minister drew attention to three meetings between Kim Jong Unem and the leader of South Korea Moon Jae-in in the last five months, after which he added: "If the party on denuclearisation was South Korea, not the United States, then there was no such impact on denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula".
However, Ri's tone of speech was completely different from last year when he said during the UN General Assembly that the goal of North Korea missiles in the United States was inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim Jong Una "rocket man" (man of rocket) on a suicide mission.
This year, at the UN Trump Forum, which threatened to "complete destruction" of North Korea, Kim Jong Una praised him for his courage to take steps towards disarmament, but also said that there was still a need to put a lot of work and said that until North Korea was released from nuclear weapons, sanctions would not be abolished.
On Wednesday Trump said he did not appoint a time zone for this, saying: “Whether it takes two years, three years or five months — it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pjongang for the steps taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday at the UN Security Council Forum: "The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must be continued and constant until we have established full, final and verified denuclearisation".
Since 2006, the Security Council has given a unanimous warning of sanctions against North Korea, attempting to curb the financing of the Pjongang nuclear programme and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and later said that he would visit Pjongang again next month as part of preparations for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit cannot be called a success.
He left Pjongang in July, saying that progress had been made, after which North Korea had condemned him for "setting up gangster demands" within a few hours.
North Korea committed itself this month at a meeting with Moon Jae-in, that it will dismantle the missile testing site and the nuclear complex if the United States takes "relevant measures".
He stated that Kim Jong Un told him that the "responsible measures" he was dependent on are security guarantees to ensure that Trump had committed himself to Singapore, and that steps were taken to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students take part in a course on adequate long-term rest
The new course at Harvard University, which took place this year, provided all the students with more sleep to fight the growing culture of macho, which is based on learning by "caffeine-driven night students".
Students from the best university in the world often have no idea of the basis of care.
Charles Cheisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed a course he believes is the first of this type in the United States.
To create a course, he was inspired by speaking about the influence of sleep debauchery on science.
"After the talk ended, a girl came to me and said, "Why am I just saying this right now when I'm in my last year of study?"
She said that no one ever told her about the meaning of the dream that surprised me," The Telegraph said.
During the course, which took place for the first time this year, students learn how good sleep habits help to achieve good results in science and sports, and improve the overall feeling of students.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the health care department, said that this course was intended to be introduced after it was said that students suffered from a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The hourly course includes a number of interactive tasks.
One section includes a picture of the room in the academy, where students click on cupcakes to coffee, curtains, exercises and books to get information about the influence of caffeine and light and how sleep disadvantage affects sports results, as well as how important it is to keep sleep regular.
In another section, participants will learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart failure, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that this does not lead to an immediate change in students’ behaviour.
But we believe that they have the right to know — just as everyone has the right to know the health consequences of smoking cigarettes," added Professor Cheisler.
The culture of pride from "permanent science" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and the increasing pressure on students are becoming a growing problem of sleeplessness.
Ensuring a sufficient amount of sleep with good quality should be a "secret weapon" of students fighting stress, exhaustion and anxiety, and even preventing weight loss, because lack of sleep causes the brain to go through hunger, making the student hungry, he said.
Raymond So, 19-year-old Californian researcher in chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Cheisler develop a course after taking part in one of his activities last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to press for a course for the whole campus.
The next step is to invite all graduate students to complete a similar programme of studies before moving to a competitive institution.
Professor Cheisler recommended that students set up a warning alarm when to go to sleep and when to get up, as well as to be aware of the harmful influence of the "heavenly light" emitted by electronic devices screens and LED lighting, which can break down the daily pace and lead to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga manages the Gerrard team
The Rangers suffered another time during the fight on their way to Livingston when Dolly Menga shot himself to defeat the disassembled Steven Gerrard team, achieving 1-0.
The team from Ibrox Stadium wanted to record their first victory from the 4-1 victory in February over St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team won the second time in 18 matches, causing for his team a difference of eight points with the leader Ladbrokes Premiership — Hearts.
Menga shot naked seven minutes before the end of the first half, and the Rangers' composition showing a lack of involvement didn't seem to improve.
While Rangers recorded a fall in sixth place, Livingston succeeded in a third — just behind the Hibernian with one goal lost.
The Rangers may have other problems due to the need to provide the wound to the head of Judge Caluma Spence's line after he was hit by the object thrown from the guest court.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, which allowed him to sell Ayr and move to the Betfred Cup semifinal.
Holt, on the other hand, went through with the same unit of Livingston, who took the point of the Hearts team last week, and was fascinated by the way his well-trained team suffered at every step of its opponents.
The Rangers may have dominated possession of the ball, but the Livingston team did more with the ball when they got it.
They were supposed to get naked in just two minutes when it's the first release of the ball through Meng allowed Scott Pittman to go with Allan McGregor's gate, but the assistant didn't take his chance.
Then Keaghan Jacobs addressed the deep release to Captain Craig Halkett, but his colleague Alan Lithgow playing in the defensive position could only remain in the rear position.
The Rangers regained control in the third quadrant, but it seemed as if they had more hope than faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos was sure to admit that he had a 15 minutes before the end of the game, when he and Steven Lawless had fallen on himself, but Judge Steven Thomson had developed a Colombian complaint.
The Rangers managed to deliver only two customs shots in the first half, but ex-Ibrox, Liam Kelly, was almost worried about Lassany Coulibaly's head and weak shot Ovie's Ejaria.
While the 34-minute goal won by Livingstone could be opposed to the running game, no one can deny that they earned it for the effort they made to win it.
The Rangers again failed to deal with the deep permanent fragment of the game by Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't respond when Declan Gallagher threw a ball at Scott Robinson, who kept quiet, giving it to Mengi to just finish the action.
Gerrard did not empty the break and replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent — this exchange almost immediately had an impact on the wing that threw the ball into Morelos, but the impressive Kelly managed to block it, getting it out of his position.
The Livingston team continued to attract guests to the game exactly as they liked when Lithgow and Halkett performed long sessions each other.
Holt's team could have increased the lead in the last few minutes, but McGregor had a good time before Jacobs, after which Lithgow took the game off the road.
The Rangers' reserve, Glenn Middleton, had another hope for the execution of the crime when he got in touch with Jacobs, but Thomson turned his eyes again.
Almanac: inventor of Geiger
And now the page of our Sunday Morning edition Almanac: September 30, 1882 – 136 years ago... the day he was born in Germany came physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger.
Geiger developed a method of detection and measurement of radioactivity, which eventually led to the creation of a device known as Geigera.
Since then, Geiger has become both an element of science and pop culture, for example in the 1950s "Bells of Coronado" film, in which you have had little chance of a cowboy scientist Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
The man said, "What's wrong?"
Rogers: “It is Geiger’s counter used to locate radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you start these hearings, you will hear the effects of atoms emitted by radioactive minerals."
Evans: "Now hear something!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name has survived to this day.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" the enemy cell.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" the enemy cells and destroy them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize the enemies of the cell during treatment.
This method depends on separating the immune cells from the patient and changing them into the laboratory.
Then they can "observe" the protein common to many tumours, and then they are injected into the body again.
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of tumours.
In one woman treated with a vaccine, the resistance mechanism to recognise the cell’s foetus was observed for more than 18 months.
The method is to separate the immune cells from the patient, change them into the laboratory, so that they can "observe" a protein common to many tumours called HER2 and then inject the patient into these cells again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Cancer Institute at Bethesda in Maryland said: "Our results show that this vaccine is very good age."
HER2 "incentives the growth of several types of tumours", including the cancer of the chest, the ovum, the lungs and the intestines of the liver, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach to the withdrawal of immune cells from patients and the "teaching" of their localization of tumour cells has been associated with the treatment of certain types of protein.
Kanye West is on a pro-trump diet in the Saturday Night Live program — with a MAGA cap on its head.
It didn't go too well.
Kanye West was "excited" in a studio during the course of the Saturday Night Live programme after he approved the president of the United States of America Donald Trump and said he would apply for an office in 2020.
After this night's performance of his third titled Ghost Town, during which he had an established hat with the title "Make America Great", he made a statement against the Democrats and again expressed his support for the Trump.
"As often as I talk to white people, I hear, "How can you like Trump? He's a racist!"
If I cared about racism, I'd be out of America a long time ago," he said.
The SNL program began with a sketch with Matt Damon, in which a Hollywood star ridiculed Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the senate judicial commission on allegations of sexual assault brought by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although he was not broadcast, the video from West was sent to the social media by the comics of Chris Rock.
It's not known if Rock wanted to piss West by posting.
In addition, West complained to the public that behind the scenes he had problems with his hat.
"They took me behind the scenes.
They told me not to go out with that hat on my head.
They're on me!
And then they say I don't have an exit," said Washington Examiner.
West continued: "You say I don't have an exit?" adding: "I'll set up a "superman pillar, so you won't be able to tell me what to do.
Let's accept."
His words twice caused the "breathing" of the public, and the members of the SNL team appeared to be troubled, according to Variety. The person in the study during these events said: "The study had a grave silence."
West was invited to the program in place of the songwriter Ariana Grande, whose boy, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
West was intrigued by the many works of I Love it in the processing of Perrier water bottle.
West received support from the captain of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who posted the following tweet: “To one of the bravest: HAPPINESS FOR MAFII’S CONSTRUCTION”.
The leader of Karen Hunter's show on her Twitter said that West was just "he was himself and it's absolutely great".
"But I will NOT reward people (by buying their music or clothes or by supporting their "arts") who, I think, accept a wide range of ideologies that are harmful to my community.
He's free.
We're free," she added.
Before the rapper program, he announced on Twitter that he changed his name and that he now "is formally called Kanye West".
However, he is not the first artist to change his name — followed by Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Friendly rapper, Snoop Dogg, accepted the name Snoop Lion, and the legend of music, Prince, changed the name to symbol, and then an artist known as Prince.
Attempting to kill a knife in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after he stabbed a man in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The event took place in Ballyhackamore, as the police say.
The accused is due to stand before the civil court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the prosecution.
Star Game of the throne Kit Harington triggers the issue of male toxicity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in the medieval HBO station series "Game of the Throne".
31-year-old actor hit the stereotype hero macho, saying showing such roles on the screen causes young boys often think they have to play hard to be respected.
In an interview with Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that "something went wrong" and wondered how to deal with the toxic problem of manhood in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his partner from the throne game plan, Rose Leslie's 31-year-old actor, admitted that she feels "a bit sure", moving this issue.
“I personally feel pretty sure at this moment — where did we make a mistake on the subject of man?” he said.
"What did we teach men when they were growing up, looking at the perspective of the problem we are currently dealing with?"
Kit believes that the development of male toxicity can be partly responsible for television due to the presentation of very male figures.
He continued: “What attitudes are born, and what are taught?
What is taught on television and on the streets, which makes young boys start thinking that they have to stand on a particular page to be a man?
I think this is one of the most important issues of our time — what can be done to change it?
You can clearly see that everything is wrong with young men."
In the interview he also admitted that he did not play in any prequel or sequel game of the throne after the series ended the following year, saying that he “ended with the battlefields and horses”.
From November Kit will play in the art "True West" Sam Shepard, who is a story about the film producer and his brother – a thief.
The actor recently stated that he considered knowing his wife Rose the best thing that happened to him in Gree about the throne.
"I met my wife on the plan, which provided me with my future family and a new life," he said.
In this many prized series of Rose’s fantasy series, Emmy played Ygritte — an object of loving interest in the character played by Kita, Jon Snow.
In June 2018, the couple withdrew to the home of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China recorded a 14-percent increase in the incidence of new cases
China has reported a 14-percent increase in the number of people living with HIV and with AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected by this problem, as health care workers do.
Only around 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
A determined majority of new cases have been transmitted by sex, which means a change in relation to the past.
Traditionally, HIV virus spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of the transfusion of infected blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been almost completely reduced, as said by Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000 per year.
The transmission of HIV through sex is a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexualism was decriminalized in China in 1997, but the discrimination of LGBT people is widespread.
In view of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that between 70 and 90% of men who have sex with men will eventually get married.
Many cases of transmission of the disease result from insufficient safety during sexual activity in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has provided universal access to HIV drugs as part of its efforts to combat this problem.
Maxine Waters objected to the fact that one of her team members disclosed data from the senators of the Republican Party — "dangerous lies" and "theory."
A member of the U.S. House of Representatives, Maxine Waters, dismissed the charges on Saturday as if a member of her team had posted personal data from three Republican senators on Wikipedia's websites and legislators.
A member of the Los Angeles Democratic Party has ensured that these charges have been dropped by experts and websites related to "super-trading wings".
"Truths, lies and even more despicable lies," Waters reported on Twitter.
Public information also included addresses and phone numbers of American senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch from Utah.
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday. She was placed by an unknown person in the Capitol during a panel hearing in the Senate on allegations of sexual abuse directed against the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The race took place some time after Qavanaugh's candidacy was questioned by three senators.
Conservatives, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the post source was linked to the Waters office and published information about a member of the Waters team — as Hill suggests.
"This baseless task is totally false and it is a 100% lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my team — whose identity, personal data and security were violated as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations — was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This baseless task is totally false and it's a hundred percent lie."
Waters ’ statement quickly led to criticism on the Internet, including by Ari Fleischer, a former press spokesman for the White House.
"That's the way to say no," Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests that she does not have the right temperament to be a member of the Congress.
When someone's accused of something he didn't do, he can't be angry.
He can't dare.
He may not question the motives of the accused person.
It's got to be quiet for that."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to the democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of expressing excessive anger during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate for the mid-term elections to replace Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"It's a rough case, if it's true," he wrote on Twitter.
In her statement, Waters said her office had informed “the competent authorities and the prosecution authorities of these fraudulent charges”.
"The perpetrators will be exposed and brought to legal responsibility for all their actions that pose a threat to any of my team members," she announced.
Review of Johnny English: Nokaut — a spy parody with a weakened Red Atkinson
Looking for references to Brexit in every new movie with a British subject has become a norm. It seems to apply to a new part of the series of "Johnny English" and "Johnny English" films, which started in 2003 from the film "Johnny English" and which came back to the screens of the 2011 film "Johnny English: Reactivation".
Will the self-response satire concerning how hopeless we are become the new export goods of the country?
In any case, forever surprised, characterized by rubber face, the incompetent Johnny English again received a license for sharing — his name and the name more than anything else signals that he is an expanded, comical production for non-English views.
He is, of course, a stupid secret agent, who, despite his strange features to smoothie glamour, has a little from Inspector Clouseau, the Jasia Fasoli sceptre and a drop from this guy who adds one need to the tune of the lead Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
In the past, he was also a traveler and a global mystery man — Atkinson once played in the already forgotten television ads Barclaycard, in which he left chaos.
In the latest movie in the Johnny English series is one or two moments worth of attention.
I really liked the scene where Johnny English was approaching the helicopter, dressed in a medieval weapon, while his helmet was rhythmically hit by squirrel blades.
On the screen you can see the gift of Atkinson to play comedy physically, but the sense of humor seems to be quite low and unnecessary, especially that currently also "serious" film brands, such as 007 and Mission Nis, offer comedy elements as part of the film.
The humorous elements seem to be directed rather to children rather than adults — I think Johnny English’s crazy adventures are not as creative and consistent as the gags in their Atkinson films about Jasi Fasoli.
From the very current point of view it is that the United Kingdom has serious problems.
Cyberhacker penetrates to the British super-secret spy network, revealing the identity of all British agents operating in the field — to frighten the agent into service, Kevin Eldon, who unfortunately played a small role.
This is the last drop in the charming hot premier, who is a poppy, worn-out figure already suffering from a nervous breakdown caused by a lack of political popularity: Emma Thompson does everything she can to get into Theresy May, but the script does not give her the opportunity to develop wings.
Her advisors from the intelligence agency inform her that, due to the disclosure of the identity of all active spies, she will have to return to the service of one of the retired agents.
And this means Johnny English in his own person, currently employed as a teacher in some elegant school, giving informal lessons on how to become a secret agent — a few bad gags when teaching Spanish spying lessons.
English is called to Whitehall for execution, once again connecting with his former assistant Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man associated with the commander of the submarine — a married but somewhat tired figure played by Vicki Pepperdine.
So Batman and Robin's party in the secret service of Her Royal City are returning to action, meeting the beautiful woman fatal Ophelia Bulletin, the character played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously controlled by the charismatic billionaire technology maniac, who claims that he can solve the computer problems of the United Kingdom — he is the villain of Jason Volta, the players of Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their crucifixion composed of absurd situations: dressed as waiters burn down the French restaurant; they introduce chaos by moving on board the luxury yacht of Volty; and English joins the launch while using the set to virtual reality to get to know the interior of Volty's house.
In this last sequence, any restrictions are removed, but despite the nice and noisy performance, the entire film is very much a reminder of the television for children.
Typical medium.
Like other films in the Johnny English series, I couldn't resist the idea: couldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson the role that would really be responsible for his talent?
The working party rejects as if it was drawing up a plan which provides for a four-week week's work for the British for which they receive a five-day remuneration
Jeremy Corby's Work Party will consider introducing a radical plan that will allow British workers to work four days a week, receiving a five-day reward.
Similarly, the party wants the company's managers to pass on savings to employees due to the evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, giving them an additional day off.
As a result, workers could enjoy a three - week weekend with the same amount of pay.
The sources suggest that this idea will "be entered" into the economic programme of the party and the country's exit plans against workers.
The four-week shift was supported by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from economic change.
An older member of the Working Party in a conversation with The Sunday Times said: "It is expected that a change of policy will be announced before the end of this year".
"This will not happen from day to day, but the four-week working week is something that is included in the party's approach to restoring the economic balance for the benefit of the employee, as well as in the overall industrial strategy of the party.
The Working Party is not the first party to support such an idea — the Green Party undertook to introduce a four-day work week during the 2017 election campaign.
At present, however, these plans are not supported by all members of the Working Party.
The Working Party's Handbook said: "The working week is not a party's policy and its introduction is not considered by it".
John McDonnell, the Chancellor of the Shadow Office, used the last week's conference of the Labour Party to present his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from "directors without face" and "speculants" in public utility companies.
The Chancellor's plans from the Shadow Office also mean that the current shareholders of the water companies may not recover their full participation, as the Government of the Labour Party could make 'remunerations' based on detected abuses.
It also confirmed plans to place employees in company administrations and to establish integrated ownership funds in order to transfer 10 per cent of the equity of private sector companies to those who receive annual dividends of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy answer in the "60 minutes" program to ask if the FBI's investigation into the Kavanaugh case could change their attitude
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court by at least one week and has raised questions as to whether the establishment of the office of inquiry could induce the Republican senators to withdraw their support.
On Sunday, Scott Pelley will be conducting a "60 minutes" program and asked the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find out something that could change their attitude.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
“When I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after how it happened when this assignment came out, and I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was stable, determined and clear."
However, Graham’s opinion seems to be cut out in stone.
"I made a decision about Brett Kavanaugh and to change it there is a need for a strong commitment," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett firmly denied it," Graham added, returning to Christine Blasey Ford.
“None of the people who gave it could verify it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't think anything's gonna change."
What is the event of the Global Citizen Festival and or at any rate contributed to the reduction of poverty?
The next Saturday in New York will be the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that can be honored by the extremely impressive composition of the stars and the equally impressive mission — the eradication of poverty in the world.
The World Citizen Festival will visit tens of thousands of people arriving at Great Lawn in Central Park to enjoy not only the performances of stars such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to support the achievement of the most important objective of this event, which is the eradication of extreme poverty by 2030.
Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Powery Project, an international group working to combat poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To receive a free ticket for this event (unless decided to buy a VIP ticket), participants had to perform a number of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending e-mails to the world leader, making telephone calls or other important actions to help raise awareness of the end of poverty.
But what success can Global Citizen have in the perspective of 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of awarding people a free concert a good way to convince them to take action, or is it another case of so-called "clickivism" when people feel they're doing something important by signing an online petition or posting an entry on Twitter?
Global Citizen claims that since 2011, more than 19 million "actions" have been recorded in support of action, seeking to achieve many different objectives.
It also argues that these actions have helped to stimulate global leaders to announce commitments and regulations of more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group entered into 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its activities, which already paid or financed at least $10 billion.
The group estimates that the security measures have so far directly affected almost 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, the British partnership of investors and contractors involved in "helping children achieve their full potential", which promised to send Rwanda $35 million to help eliminate malnutrition in the country, after Global Citizen members sent over 4700 tweets.
"Thanks to the support of the British government, donors, national governments and members of the Global Citizen, such as you, we can make social injustice, which is not experiencing, go to history" — Tracey Ullman, Ambassador Power of Nutrition, during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions calling on the United Kingdom to improve the quality of food for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which reaches up to 5 million women and children with food problems.
On one of the most frequently asked questions on its website, which sounded "How can you be sure that extreme poverty will be eradicated?"
The Global Citizen responded: “It will be a long and difficult path — sometimes we will meet and face defeat.
But just as in the case of the earlier major movements for civil rights and the fight against apartheid, we will be successful because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are among the stars present during this year's New York event, which hosts Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy to "block" Russian energy exports — Secretary of the Interior
Washington may "if necessary" flee to his military Navy to prevent Russian energy from flowing into the markets, including those in the Middle East, revealed by the Secretary of the United States, Ryan Zinke, Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia’s involvement in Syria — especially where it operates at the invitation of the legal government — is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I think that the reason why they are in the Middle East is the desire to intervene in trade in energy, as is the case in Eastern Europe," he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to address this problem.
"The United States, by reason of its military commander, has the opportunity to ensure that the maritime routes remain open and, if necessary, to create a barrier to ensure that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants of the event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group which itself defines the name "the voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He also compared Washington's approach to Russia and Iran, noting that they are actually the same.
"The economic option of Iran and Russia is less dependent on the use and substitution of fuels," he said, comparing Russia to a "knock-knock-knock-knock-knock-knock-knock-knock-knock-knock-knock-knock-knock-knock.
These statements were made at a time when the Trump administration continues to carry on a mission aimed at increasing short-lived land gas exports to Europe — which is a much cheaper option for European consumers compared to Russian gas.
To this end, the administration officials of Trump, including the president of the United States of Donald Trump, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which according to Trump made Berlin "slave" Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline worth 11 billion dollars, which is intended to double the existing passenger capacity of 110 billion metres, is a purely economic project.
Kreml argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is solely economical and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after meeting with United States Energy Secretary Rick Perry in September in Moscow.
The United States' position triggered a violent reaction by Germany, which confirmed their commitment to the project.
The leading industrial organisation Germany, the Federation of the German Industry (BDI), called on the United States not to interfere with EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I believe that this is a major problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industry (BDI), after a recent meeting of Chancellor Angeli Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren, Senator Massachusetts, said she was considering the candidate for the president in 2020
Elizabeth Warren, Senator Massachusetts, said on Saturday that after the mid-term elections she would consider running for the president.
At a meeting in Holyoke in Massachusetts Warren, she confirmed that she was considering her candidacy.
"The time has come for women to go to Washington and repair the corrupt government. This is also true of women who hold the highest position," said The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will consider my candidacy as President."
At the meeting, Warren mentioned President Donald Trump, saying that he is "leading the country in the wrong direction".
"I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy," she said.
Warren without a garden expressed her criticism of Trump and his candidate to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday on Twitter Warren wrote: "Of course we need an FBI poll before we vote".
The poll published on Thursday showed, however, that most of Warren's voters do not think they should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts voters who chose the option "probably" said that the senator should not run as a result of a survey conducted by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidacy.
The survey showed greater support for former Governor Deval Patrick’s candidacy — 38 percent of the people supported his potential candidacy, and 48 percent opposed it.
Other known names from the democratic camp taken into account for the potential candidate in 2020 were Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'd make an official decision by January, as the Associated Press submitted.
Sarah Palin talks about the stress team (PTSD) Track Palina during the election age Donald Trump
Track Palin (26) spent a year in Iraq after moving to the military in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"What my own son is going through, which must go back, I understand other families who feel the effects of the PTSD and the wounds our soldiers are returning with," said the audience at the election age of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called her son's arrest "the subject of taboo", after which she said about her son and other war veterans: "They return a little changed, return the prisoners, return, wonder if respect will be shown for what their fellow soldiers, aircraft and all other members of the army have given away to their country."
He was arrested on Monday in Vasilli in Alaska and accused of domestic violence against a woman, urged to file false testimony in the report on domestic violence and possession of weapons in a state of negligence, as Dan Bennett, spokesperson for the Wasilli Police Department.
18 states and the District of Colombia support the fight against a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Colombia support the legal challenge for the new U.S. policy, which refuses to grant asylum to victims fleeing the gang or domestic violence.
Representatives of 18 states and districts filed a list of friends in Washington on Friday to support the applicant for asylum against this policy — as NBC News reports.
The full name of the cause in Grace v. Sessions, which the American Civil Liberties Union organized in August against federal policy, has not been disclosed.
She said that her partner "and his brutal sons from the gang" had abused her, but the American officials rejected her asylum request on July 20th.
She was detained in Texas.
Prosecutors of the states supporting Grace described Salwador, Honduras and Guatemala, where there are a large number of asylum seekers in the United States, as countries facing common gangs and domestic violence.
The new American asylum policy has repealed the 2014 Board of Immigration Appeals decision which has allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing from domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, Attorney General of the District of Colombia, said in a Friday statement that the new policy "is ignored for decades by state, federal and international law".
"Federal law requires all asylum applications to be dealt with on the basis of specific facts and circumstances, and such a prohibition violates this principle", as stated in the list of amicus curij.
The prosecutors further argued in the letter that the policy of refusing entry to immigrants is damaging to the United States economy, claiming that they could become entrepreneurs and "become the necessary workforce".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
"Assil is available to those who leave their country of origin because of persecution or fear on a racial, religious, national basis or because of belonging to a particular social group or who have no other political convictions," the session said in its statement of 11 June on asylum policy.
Asylum never intended to solve all the problems — even those serious — that people from around the world are struggling with every day.
Desperate rescue attempts at the Pala where the number of deaths doubled in the race aimed at finding survivors
For the survivors, it became more and more tragic.
"It's a very intense feeling," said Risa Kusuma's 35-year-old mother, comforting her hot-blooded son in the evacuation center in the devastated town of Pala.
“Every minute the ambulance will import the body.
There's no clean water."
People were seen returning to destroyed houses, searching for flooded water and trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were wounded, and hospitals, damaged by earthquake of 7.5 degrees, were quickly filled.
Some of the wounds, including two Haris, who found fractures in the spine and arms, rest outside the military hospital in Pala, where patients were treated outside due to strong secondary shocks.
The tears filled his eyes, as he told of a violent earthquake on the ground that shook the room on the fifth floor of the hotel, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to escape.
I think I've been pushed into the rumouvian wall." — Harris said Associated Press, adding that his family had come to town for a wedding.
“I heard my wife cry for help after which her voice was silenced.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. Ambassador accuses China of "injury" advertising.
A week after the official Chinese newspaper posted a four-sided advertisement in an American newspaper that boasts mutual benefits from US-Chinese trade, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using American press to spread propaganda.
The president of the United States, Donald Trump, last Wednesday, referred to China’s Daily Supplement to the Des Moines Register — the most popular newspaper in Iowa — accusing China of attempting to interfere with the United States Congress, which will be held on November 6th — China objected to this accusation.
Zarzut Trump about Beijing trying to get involved in the U.S. elections, confirmed what US officials told Reuters that it was a new step in escalating a campaign by Washington aimed at reducing pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertising promoting trade with their countries, Beijing and Washington are currently conducting a trade war escalation that has led to a rise in tariffs for mutual imports.
The Chinese tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were to affect exporters in states such as Iowa, which supported the Republican Trump — Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former state governor of Iowa — the main exporter of agricultural products to China — said that Beijing inflicted injury on American workers, farmers and entrepreneurs.
Branstad stated in the Sunday issue of the Des Moines Register that China “now, with double strength, begins to sneeze by placing advertising in our own free press. ”
"By expanding its propaganda, the Chinese government uses a respected American tradition of freedom of speech and free press, placing a paid advertising at the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
For this, there will be no opposition votes in the street in Beijing and no real reflection of the divergent opinions that Chinese may have on the disturbing economic direction of China, given that the media is under the strong control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most famous Chinese newspapers refused to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans express themselves before the mid-term elections of women with the right to vote by the Kavanaugh affair, analysts warn
While many leading Republicans support and weapons nominated to the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh in the face of several allegations of sexual assault, the analyst warns that your members are meeting in the coming mid-term elections with a violent response, especially by women.
The emotions associated with this event are enormous, and most Republicans are now officially willing to vote.
"This can't be undone," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Maxwell School at Syracuse, on Saturday.
Reeher said he had doubts as to whether Senator Jeff Flake's (Arizona's) efforts to conduct a recent investigation by the FBI were sufficient to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday -- they will not forget this morning and they will not forget it until November," Karine Jean-Pierre, the senior adviser and national spokesperson for the MoveOn group, said on Friday, as the newspaper published in Washington.
On Friday morning, the protesting candidate ran the password "Come November", demonstrating in the Senate Hall because of the decision of the Republicans controlling the Judicial Commission not to withdraw Kavanaugh's nomination despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony — as Mic said.
"The level of democratic enthusiasm and motivation goes beyond the scale," said one of the Stu Rothenberg information pages, an unbiased political analyst.
“People say that he was already tall — and that’s true.
But it may be higher, especially among undecided women of middle class and younger voters from 18 to 29 years of age, who, although they do not like the president, often do not vote."
Even prior to Ford's public recognition, in which she described in detail her allegations of sexual assault addressed to the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that if the Republic decided to approve the candidacy, this could result in a violent reaction.
"The Republican Party must deal with little trouble," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, as NBC News reports.
"It is not only the vote of the Commission or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh will be elected, but also the way in which the Republic managed the situation and how Ford dealt with it," said Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities USA, on one of the information channels that helped to select Democrats.
However, the Americans seem to be a little divided over who they believe in in the face of Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, with a little more support.
The new YouTube survey shows that 41 per cent of respondents strongly or rather believed in Ford's testimony, while 35 per cent said that they firmly or rather believed in Kavanaugh's testimony.
In addition, 38% of the respondents claimed that Kavanaugh was probably or probably lying at the time of the submission, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
After Flake's pressure, the FBI began an investigation into the charges filed by Ford, as well as at least one other prosecutor, who is Deborah Ramirez, as The Guardian reports.
Ford confessed last week under oath before the Senate Judicial Commission that Kavanaugh had attacked her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that he was appointed to the Supreme Court and showed her his genitalia during his studies at Yale University in the 1980s.
The manufacturer of the World Wide Web network plans to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook platforms.
Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web network, launches startup, which is to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google platforms.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company based on an open source platform — Solid — belonging to Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which individuals have access to specific information.
In an exclusive interview for Fast Company Berners-Lee, he joked that the goal of Inrupt was "dominance over the world".
"We have to do it now," he said, referring to the start.
"The historic moment has come."
The application uses Solid platform technology to enable people to create their own "internet shop with personal data" or otherwise POD.
It can include contact lists, list of things to do, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify available in one browser and at the same time.
The unique feature of the internet store with personal data is that it depends entirely on who has access to what information.
The company calls this "personal authorization through data".
According to the president of the company, John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is to provide resources, processes and skills to help make the Solid platform available to all people.
Currently, Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several developers employed for project work and the volunteer programmers' community.
Starting this week, technology makers around the world could create their own decentralised applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to “Facebook and Google about whether to make a complete change, which from day to day causes a turning up of all their business models.
"Don't ask them for permission."
On Saturday, at the Media platform, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt is the supply of commercial energy and the ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Technology Institute in Massachusetts.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has had a great deal to do in the debate on network neutrality.
Calling for life Inrupt Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I'm extremely excited to think about the next era in the development of the network," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Marking the Spiritual Cross of Victoria during World War I
The memory of the only spiritual Church of England, which during World War I was marked as a combatant by the Victorian Cross, was taught 100 years later in his home town.
Colonel Bernard Vann was appointed on 29 September 1918 for a dance at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
He was killed by a sniper four days later, never knowing that he was marked by the highest British military order.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren discovered a monumental stone during the Rushden parade in Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said that the stone was exposed exactly in the centenary of the Grandfather’s marking was “an exceptional symbolic character”.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Canal “in a very dense fog and under a strong blade of field and machine guns”.
Then he rushed to the line of fire and with the "most courage" led it forward, then suddenly he launched an attack on the position of the Polish divisions, eliminating three of them.
Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 — a few months before the end of the war.
Michael Vann (72) said that his grandfather’s actions were “something that I would never be able to succeed, but also something humble”.
With his brother, Dr. James Vann, he placed the sword after the parade of Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he feels “very honored, able to participate in the parade” and added that “the courage of a true hero is manifested in the support he receives from many people”.
MMA fans didn't sleep all night to watch Bellator 206, instead they got the Pig Peppa.
Imagine that you haven't slept all night to watch the packed emotions of Bellator 206 and finally can't see the main fight.
The program can in San Jose included 13 races, including six on the main card, and was shown live in the night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m. when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to fight, the sights in Great Britain were shocked by the change of the program to the Peppa Pig.
Some were disappointed when they did not sleep until early morning hours, especially after seeing this battle.
One of the fans on Twitter described an exchange for a cartoon for children as "some sick joke".
"In accordance with the Government's regulation, the content of this type is irresponsible to allow it to be released at 6 a.m., so that it was necessary to change the programme for children," said Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice-President of marketing and communication of Bellator when asked about the transmission.
"Peppa bitch, yes."
The president of Bellator's organization, Scott Coker, said they are working on a timetable to take into account future views from Britain.
"When I think about the repeat of the situation, I think we can fix it," Coker said.
"But Sunday is the sixth morning, so that we will not be able to cope with it until Sunday according to our time, and Monday according to their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program was changed there, we were caught in a lot of comments, none of which sounded friendly.
We tried to fix it... we thought it was a technical shock.
But it wasn't just a legal matter.
I can promise you that this situation will not happen again.
We're going to limit the program to five fights instead of six — the standard amount.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt " Worse" because of sexuality
Tom Daley, an Olympic water jump, says he grew up feeling worse than anyone else because of his sexuality, but gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize that not everyone was like him until he went to high school.
In the Desert Island Discs radio 4 station run by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights to give another "hope".
He also said that becoming a parent made him less concerned with winning the Olympics.
The usual leader for many years, Kirsty Young, took a few months off because of the disease.
When she first appeared in Laverne's program, Daley said that she felt "less valuable" when she grew up, because "the simultaneous love of boys and girls was not socially acceptable".
He said: “To this day, feeling less worth and being different is something that gives me the strength to make success. ”
He said he wanted to prove that he was "something valuable" so that he wouldn't disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-time brown Olympic medalist became a leading member of the LGBT community and used his speech in this year's National Community Games in Australia to appeal to a larger number of countries for the decriminalization of homosexuality.
He said he decided to express himself because he felt happy, able to live open, without any involvement, and thus wanted to give another “hope”.
The three-time world champion said that in love with the American filmmaker Dustine Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, he was “astounded”.
Daley got married to Oscar's winner (who is 20 years older than him) last year, marking that this age difference was never a problem for him.
"When you're going through so much in such a young age," he meant his first Olympic at the age of 14 and his father's death because of cancer three years later, "he said it was hard for him to find someone of the same age who experienced similar accidents and falls.
The couple were the parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley in June.
"The most important thing for me last year was to get a gold medal," he said.
"And you know what? More important than the golden Olympic medals.
My gold medal is Robbie."
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 years after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept that he was dying, and one of the last things he asked was whether he already had tickets to the London Olympics in 2012 — he wanted to take the lead.
"I couldn't tell him, "he won't be with us to be in the first place, Dad," he said.
"I held him by the hand when he stopped breathing. Just when he stopped breathing and died, I realized that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley took part in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
"I knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life – jumping into the water before the crowd of people at the Olympic Games – was the best possible feeling," he said.
It also inspired him to choose the first song — the Proud in Heather Small — that accompanied him during his preparations for the Olympic Games and that continues to make him feel the weight of his skin.
The Desert Island Discs program is broadcast at BBC Radio 4 every Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Showing lack of Mickelson shape on the bench during the Saturday part of Ryder Cup
The American Phil Mickelson set a record on Sunday when he played his 47th match at Ryder Cup, but he'll have to work on his form so he doesn't print his pen.
Mickelson, who played twelve times in a two-year event, was sent to the lobby by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourball and foursome games.
Instead of being in the center of action, as often happened in his case in the U.S. team, the five-time main winner had to spend a day on team climbing and working on improving his game in order to repair the cause of his shipment to the hunt.
The 48-year-old who has never given up the simplest hits, even at the top of her career, is not well proved on the narrow Le Golf National field, on which the wrong hits are unforgivably punished by long roughs.
And if the field itself is not sufficiently discouraging for Mickelson, on Sunday's ninth match, he must face the precision of British winner Open — Francesco Molinari, who joined forces with the debutist Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If America (with the loss of four points at the beginning of 12 singles) starts the game with a worm, the mickelson match may turn out to be extremely key.
Furik expressed his confidence in his rival — he could not do anything else.
"He fully understood his role today, he hit me on his back, he hugged me with his hand and said he'd be ready tomorrow," Furik said.
"He's very sure of himself.
He is in the glory gallery and has led many to the game of his teams both in the past and this week.
I didn't think he was playing two games.
I thought there'd be more of them, but that's how it happened, and that's how we had to do it.
He wants to play all the time, just like everyone else."
Mickelson's gonna kill Nick Faldo's record about the Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
This could mean the end of his career in Ryder Cup, which never compared to his individual achievement.
Mikkelson has 18 wins on his account, 20 defeats and seven remises. Furik said his presence led a lot to the team.
"It's funny, sarcastic, funny, funny and it's good to have it in the team's room," he explained.
“I think young players were having a good time with him this week, which was nice to see.
It's a lot more than just a game."
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a high point advantage can soon be reduced
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a significant point advantage before starting a single on the last day of Ryder Cup can easily turn into a difficult game.
In 1997 the Danish won the game at the Valderram field, where together with his accompanying Vice-Captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but the finish line passed as short as possible, winning 1411⁄2-1311⁄2.
"It is not to be forgotten that we had a great advantage in the field of Valderram; we also had a great advantage in the field of Brooklyn where we lost, and in the case of the field of Valderram we only won hair," said Bjorn, in the picture, after winning the 5-3 Class of 2018 both on Friday and yesterday, which led 10-6 on the field of Le Golf National.
Time will show me and all the team members that it's not over yet.
Tomorrow you'll give everything to yourself.
Get out there and do everything you can.
The end will only come when the points appear on the table.
We have the goal of winning the trophy, and we need to focus on it.
From the beginning I said that I focus on the 12 players who are on our side, but we also know well who people are on the other side — the best players in the world."
“ I wouldn’t do better, ” said Bjorn, who was fascinated by the way his competitors worked in a difficult field.
But tomorrow is something else.
Tomorrow they start single, and that's another question.
It's good to play with your partner when everything comes up, but when you play alone, your golf skills are tested to the limit of possibilities.
It's a message that players need to deliver, so give it all to them tomorrow.
A partner also has to give everything to himself."
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk will expect his competitors to achieve better results in a single game than during the match with his partner, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Sam Furik experienced great returns to action on the last day, being a member of the victory team in the field of Brooklyn, after which he suffered defeat after the European team performed "a miracle in the field of Medina".
"I remember every word," he said in answer to the question how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, was warming up to fight his competitors on the last day.
“Tomorrow we play 12 important games – you want to start the game at a fast pace, as was done in the fields of Brooklyn and Medina.
If this thread goes on one side, it's going to put a lot of pressure on the middle-class.
We set up our composition accordingly and set up the boys in a way that would allow us to be fascinated tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned to conduct a contract with Rory McIlroy in the main match, as well as Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahmo, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter — other European team players in the front half of the program.
"I decided on this group of guys in this order, because I think he'll be able to handle all the games," Bjorn said about his single election.
New German warship again delayed
The latest freight of the German Navy should be used in 2014 to replace the older warships since the Cold War, but this will not happen until at least next year due to poor arrangements and rising costs at an alarming rate — as the local media have reported.
The surrender to the use of "Rheinland-Pfalz", the main ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg class, was moved to the first half of 2019, according to the Die Zeit newspaper, referring to the words of the military spokesman.
The ship should be included in the military in 2014, but changes to this ambitious project had to be made due to the problems that arose after delivery.
Four Baden-Wuerttemberg units ordered by the military commander in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
They will, of course, be equipped with powerful work, a number of anti-aircraft and anti-aircraft push-ups, as well as technological solutions to prevent detection, including reducing radar, sub-red and acoustic tracks.
Other important features include longer periods of conservation — the operation of new fractals should be possible even for two years away from the mother’s ports.
The continued delay, however, means that these modern warships, which are intended to enable Germany to respond to situations abroad, will be obsolete at the time of the start of the service, says Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate appeared on the front pages of the newspapers last year, when the German Navy officially refused to give up the ship and returned it to Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
It was the first time the warship had returned to the shipyard after delivery.
There was little information about the reasons behind the return, but German media reported on a number of key "software and equipment" that made the ship useless in the war mission.
In particular, software errors were particularly important because Baden-Wuerttemberg’s ships are to be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, or half less than in the case of older Bremen class freight.
It has also been shown that the ship is too heavy, which reduces its achievements and restricts the ability of the Navy to carry out the war on future modernisation.
It is considered that the significant 7,000 tonnes of Rhineland-Palatinate ships are twice as heavy as ships of a similar class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to poor equipment, the cost of the whole project — including crew training — also becomes a problem.
It is said that it reached a level of EUR 3.1 billion (US$ 3.6 billion), while the initial cost was EUR 2.2 billion.
Problems with the use of new fractals are of particular importance in the light of recent warnings that the force of the German fleet is blowing.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German Parliament's Defence Commission, admitted that the sailors "end up ships capable of use".
He also said that this problem increased over time as a result of withdrawal from the operation of the old units without providing replacement ships.
In addition, he expressed his dissatisfaction with the fact that none of the baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates could be included in the Navy fleet.
National Trust listens to the secret life of the bat
New surveys conducted on the site of the Highlands are aimed at demonstrating how the landscapes are being used during food acquisition.
The results of the studies are expected to shed new light on the conservation of these exceptional flying mammals and to help guide future actions to protect them.
The research carried out by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will cover both silkworms and bristles with long ears and bats from the Inverewe Gardens family in Western Ross.
Special registries will be located in key locations around the site to track the activity of the bat.
NHS workers and volunteers will also carry out field studies using portable detectors.
The purpose of the expert sound analysis of all recordings is to determine the frequency of signals sent by bats and the manner in which each species is kept.
The map and report will then be developed to create a detailed image of their landscape-scale behaviour.
Rob Dewar, NTS Nature Protection Advisor, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of the settlement are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to identify the benefits of work related to the management of habitats, such as the creation of shells, as well as the best ways to maintain forest areas for bats and other related species.
The Netopris population in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom has decreased significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development, which have an impact on buildings and the loss of dwellings.
Wind turbines and lighting installations may also pose a threat, as well as mosquitoes and some chemicals used in construction materials and even domestic cats.
The bats aren't really that blind.
However, because of the nightly habits, their ears are more helpful than the eyes in the catch.
They use a complex echolocation technique to search for robots and obstacles on their way.
The NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of more than 270 outlying buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, treats batons very seriously.
It consists of ten trained experts who regularly carry out research, building control, and sometimes even rescue actions.
The organisation even established the first and only reserve dedicated in Scotland to the crew of Thrave in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten Scottish species of bat.
David Thompson, the estate manager, says she's the ideal territory for the bat.
"Threave has a great area for bats," he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of old trees and great dwellings.
However, there are still many unknowns as regards bats. The work we do here and in other settlements will help us better understand what they need to develop."
It underlines the importance of monitoring the presence of bats before entering into conservation work in holdings, as accidental destruction of one cluster may kill up to 400 males and young people, which may lead to the disappearance of the entire local population.
They are under protection — their killing, harassing or harassing them, and their destruction is illegal.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish officer of Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to provide assistance.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and in the case of many species, we don’t even know how to manage their populations. ”
Ronaldo rejects allegations of violence while his lawyers intend to invite German magazines
Cristiano Ronaldo identified charges of violence against him as "fake news", saying that people "want to promote" using his name.
His lawyers are going to invite the German intelligence magazine Der Spiegel, who published these allegations.
The Portuguese attacker Juventus was accused of rape by an American woman, Kathryn Mayorg, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
According to the Friday report, Der Spiegel was supposed to pay a woman $375 000 for silence.
Ronaldo (33 years), a few hours after the charges were announced, in an Instagram report to his 142 million followers, described these reports as "fake news".
“No, no, no, no, no.
Today's reports are fake news," said a five-time gold ball winner.
“They want to promote themselves using my name.
Nothing new.
They want to be famous for saying my name, but it's part of my job.
I'm happy and everything's okay," the baller said with a smile on his mouth.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to invite the Der Spiegel magazine for the tasks that they called "an unacceptable declaration of suspicion in the area of privacy" — as Reuters suggests.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the footballer would claim compensation for “the moral damage of the amount of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years”.
They said it was supposed to take place in June 2009 in the hotel room Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
When they met at the nightclub Ronaldo and Mayorg, they likewise went to the ballroom where he allegedly raped the woman anal — as was the result of documents filed in the district court of Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after he said he was a good man in "99 percent", who was visited by this "one percent".
According to the documentation, Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but this happened with mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that photos of her injuries were taken at the hospital, but later she agreed to a court agreement because she was "feared to refuse" and "public humiliation".
34-year-old says she wants to cancel the deal now because she still can't forget the supposed departure.
During the alleged attack, Ronaldo moved from Manchester United to Real Madrid, and this year he moved to Juventus after paying 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK "would forever regret" car manufacturers' departure
The Great Britain "would regret it all the time" if after leaving the European Union she lost the world leader in car production, said Business Minister Greg Clark.
He added that he was "anxious" when Toyota UK representative told the BBC in an interview that if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement, production in Burnaston near Derby will be temporarily suspended.
"We need an agreement," said Clark.
The representative of the Japanese car manufacturer said that the effects of border delays in the absence of agreement on Brexit could lead to a reduction in jobs.
The Burnaston factory, which produces Auris and Avensis models, produced almost 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other countries of the European Union.
"I think if the UK leaves the European Union at the end of March without agreement, then we will stop production in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of Toyota in Burnston.
Other British car manufacturers are afraid of leaving the EU without agreement on how cross-border trade works, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW intends to close its mini car factory in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns concern — as car manufacturers say — the risks associated with the supply chain if the European Union leaves the UK without an agreement.
Toyota's production line operates on a "just-in-time" basis, where part reaches 37 minutes from suppliers both in Britain and in the EU in the case of cars produced on the order.
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without agreement, it may become more difficult on the border, which the industry's representatives say may lead to delays and partial disadvantages.
As the company representative said, Toyota would not be able to withstand more than one day without delivery to her factory in Derbyshire, which would stop production.
Clark said the Chequers Theresy May plan on future relations with the EU is "precisely designed to avoid border control".
"We need an agreement. We want to achieve the best possible agreement that will allow us not only to enjoy the current success but also to make the right use of this situation," said BBC Radio 4.
“Not only Toyota’s statements, but also other producers, show that we need to be able to continue what has been a very efficient supply chain set.”
Toyota’s representation was unable to determine how long production would be suspended, but it warned that in the longer term additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the company, which would lead to a reduction in employment.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and is a member of the United Nations board of directors, said that the relationship is becoming more and more concerned: “I know from experience that if jobs are eliminated, they will never be restored.
The Government's Handbook said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan of our future relations with the European Union".
Meeting Trump with Rosenstein can be delayed again as White House is given
The important meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein can be "lated for another week" because of the ongoing fight for candidates for the highest court of Brett Kavanaugh, as he gave on Sunday the White House.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who examines the possibility of involving Russia in the election, the links between the close associates of Trump and Russia and the potential hindering the action of the President of Justice.
Whether Trump will fire a deputy prosecutor's office, endangering Mueller's independence, has been a hot topic for the month in Washington.
At the beginning of this month's New York Times, Rosenstein spoke on the subject of holding a hearing to record talks with Trump, as well as on the possibility of removing the president from his position on the basis of Amendment 25.
Rosenstein denied these reports.
Last Monday, however, he went to the White House in the face of reports as if he were going to resign.
The date of the meeting with Trump, who was then in the United Nations headquarters in New York, was scheduled for Thursday.
Trump said he would not release Rosenstein, and there was a postponement of the meeting to avoid collaborating with the hearing of the senate judicial commission, during which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday Trump conducted a weekly FBI investigation into charges against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the Senate vote.
The Truppa Press Manual, Sarah Sanders, appeared Sunday at Fox News.
When asked about her meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The deadline for this meeting has not yet been set, it may take place this week, and it may be moved for another week, taking into account all the events associated with the Supreme Court.
We'll see, I'm sure I'll inform the press."
Several journalists questioned this statement: Sanders has not held a press conference of the White House since 10 September.
The program leader, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said that a small number of press conferences were not caused by the dissatisfaction with the "stantial" television journalists, after which she added: "I will not hide that they are "stantial".
Then she suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The President-in-Office is holding more "Questions and Answers" sessions than any other president before him," she said, adding without giving evidence: "We have met with numbers".
The press conferences will still take place, Sanders said, but "if journalists are able to directly ask the President of the United States questions, this is a much better solution than talking to me.
We are trying to do this regularly, and we have done so very often in the last few weeks. Press conferences will be held at such sessions, during which we can speak directly to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Soluble press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have demonstrated why he is, acting too freely and sometimes strangely in front of the assembled journalists.
Ministry of Health writes to workers from the European Union employed in NHS Scotland in the face of concerns about Brexit
The Minister of Health has sent a letter to workers from the European Union who are employed in the Scottish health service in order to express their gratitude to them from the country and to ask them not to leave Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, wrote less than six months before Britain left the European Union.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to covering the costs of examining applications for "setled status" for EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: “In the summer negotiations on Britain’s departure from the European Union continued, and decisions will be taken in the autumn of this year.
The British Government has also intensified preparation for the possible outcome scenario without agreement.
I know this is a very worrying time for you all.
That is why I wanted to repeat once again how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of staff, regardless of his nationality.
Colleges from across the EU and beyond provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the health service work and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we very much want you to stay here."
Christian Abercrombie passes the operation as a result of a head injury
The glaring Tennessee State Tigers team, Christian Abercrombie, went through the operation as a result of the discovery of a head injury on Saturday's Vanderbilt Commodores match, which ended with the defeat of the Tennessee team with a result of 31-27, told Mike Organ.
Rod Reed, head coach of Tennessee State team, told reporters that the contestant was struck shortly before the end of the first half.
"He went to the sideline, and then moved on to the ground," Reed said.
Coaches and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the side line, then placed it on the nose and carried out further tests.
The representative of Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville (Tennessee) that Abercrombie was operated at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “there are no details of the type/size of the injury yet”, and Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie (a second-year student who has been released from school for a year to train his skills) plays his first season in the Tennessee State team after transfer from Illinois.
On Saturday before the match ended, he had five greys, which gave him 18 greys all season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher treasure charge when buying real estate in the United Kingdom
In line with the new foreign-traffic tour plans, higher treasure fees will be charged for the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom. The funds thus obtained will be used to help homeless people.
This move is intended to undermine the success of Jeremy Corby's actions to attract a young electorate.
The levy will cover persons who do not deduct taxes in the United Kingdom.
The Ministry of Treasure estimates that even 120 million pounds a year will be made available to help homeless people.
Theresa May informs today that foreign property buyers in the United Kingdom will receive a higher treasure charge and that additional funds will be available to help homeless people.
This move is taken as an attempt to undermine Jeremy Corby's efforts to attract the young electorate by promises of cheaper apartments and to increase the burden of more earners.
Higher tax fees will apply to individuals and companies not taxing in the United Kingdom. Additional measures will help the government to fight homeless.
An additional charge — plus the current treasure charge, including two years ago higher rates for other houses and rent-purchase apartments — may amount to up to three percent.
The Treasury expects that this move will make up for up to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of newly built property in London is purchased by residents of other countries, leading to price increases and hampering the purchase of the first house or apartment.
Because many foreigners buy property, and most of the time they spend abroad, many rich regions — and especially capital — have become “a city of spirits. ”
The new rules are only a few weeks after Boris Johnson's call for a reduction in treasure fees that would help young people to buy the first house.
He accused large developers of maintaining high real estate prices by taking over the land, but not using it. Prime Minister May also called for the abolition of the limits of cheap housing to eliminate the “dwelling scandal” in Britain.
Jeremy Corbyn announced a number of attractive housing reforms, including rent regulation and the end of the "no reason" issue.
It also wants to give local governments more power to build new houses.
Theresa May said: “Last year, I said that as a prime minister, I was committed to rebuilding the British dream of every next generation being better than the previous one.
This also means repairing our housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it is not right that people who do not live here, as well as foreign companies, can easily buy real estate here as hard as British residents.
For too many people, dreaming about their own home has become very remote, so the humiliation associated with the need to sleep on the street remains real."
Jack Ross: "My biggest ambition is to become a Scottish selector"
Sunderland team coach Jack Ross says his "most ambition" is to remain at a certain point in Scotland's selection.
This four-year-old Scotland is working on the North-East Club's recovery, which currently takes the third place in League One with a three-point loss in relation to the best team.
He moved to the Stadium of Light that year after he introduced St. Mirren's club in the last season and returned to the Scottish Premiership.
“I wanted to represent my country as a competitor,
But I only managed to get to staff B," Ross said in an interview with BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
“As a child I often watched with the father of the Scottish game in Hampden and it always attracted me.
However, this possibility will only come if I act successfully as a club coach."
Among Ross' predecessors were Coach Sunderland, Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former coach Alloa Athletic says she doesn't feel discouraged by taking the role of such famous personalities in such a big club, rejecting previously proposals from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“At last, I will be able to see if I can bring this club back to Prime Minister League.
In view of its structure and the conveniences it has, there is no doubt where it is located" he adds.
"It will not be easy to do this, but I certainly feel that I have been successful here, only if I succeed."
Rossa's coach career has lasted for just three years. He was then an assistant coach in Dumbarton, and for 15 months he was a member of the Hearts team.
Afterwards, Alloa helped to re-advance after the downgrading to the third league, and in the next season he led the St Mirren team from the end of the fall to the title of the championship.
Jack Ross says he now feels much more comfortable than when he played in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"This was a real point of return," said Coach Alloa.
“I really believed that driving a team is much better for me than playing.
It's weird because as a professional, I've worked well and I've achieved a few great successes.
But playing is a hard piece of bread.
You have to go through different situations every week.
They still meet me when it comes to stress and stress related to coaching, but I feel good about this role.
I've always wanted to train others and now I'm doing it.
The entire interview at Sportsound can be heard on Sunday, September 30 in Scotland radio between 12:00 and 13:00 BST time
Studies show that the best beer time is 17.30 a.m. on Saturday
The summer flood caused a violent flow of customers to British pubs, but it turned out to be a check in the restaurants' networks.
Studies showed that in July sales in pubs and bars increased by 2.7 per cent, but in restaurants fell by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, from CGA’s consulting firm, who developed the data, says: “The steady decline and longer than expected participation of England in the World Championships have resulted in the results of July being similar to June when the turnover in pubs increased by 2.8 percent, with the difference that the restaurant’s earnings dropped even more.
As noted in June, the 1.8% drop in sales in restaurants in July increased even more.
The drinking of pubs and bars was the best thing that ever happened — their sales increased by more than the drop recorded in restaurants.
Pubs serving food also suffered during the fires, although not as much as the restaurant owners.
Looks like people were just wanted.
The sale of beverages in managed pubs and bars increased by 6.6 per cent this month, and food fell by three per cent."
Paul Newman, from RSM, who is involved in an analysis of the entertainment and tourism industry, says: “These results are reflected in the trend that we have been observing since the end of April.
The most important factors affecting the size of 'outside home' consumption remain the weather and major sporting or social events.
The fact that restaurant networks are experiencing difficult moments is not surprising, although the drop in sales of 4.8 per cent compared to the previous year will have particularly significant consequences if the constant pressure to reduce costs is taken into account.
The long and burning summer has come at the least beneficial moment for the owners of the local serving food and time will show whether a little more moderate temperatures that we had in August will bring so much relief."
The overall increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, taking into account these newly opened ones, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand development.
Coffer Peach Tracker, which is responsible for monitoring sales in the pubs, bars and restaurants in the UK, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups with a total turnover of more than 9 billion pounds.
One to five children has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents
Studies have shown that one in five children — some 11 years of age — has a secret account on social networks that they hide from parents and teachers
The survey carried out among 20,000 secondary school students showed an increase in the number of "Fake Insta" pages
The news highlighted the concerns that the articles published on them are sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they have a "main" account that shows their parents
One out of five children — some 11 years of age — has an account on social networks that does not reveal to adults.
The survey carried out among 20,000 secondary school students showed a rapid increase in the number of "fake Insta" accounts — the name refers to the Instagram service, in which photos can be shared.
The news was alarmed that these accounts were intended to publish content of a sexual nature.
Twenty per cent of students have admitted that they run a "main" account that shows their parents and also has a private account.
One of the mothers who, by chance, stumbled on the secret page of her 13-year-old daughter, met a teenager who told others to "rapture her".
The study carried out in independent schools by the Digital Awareness UK and the Association of Headmasters" and Headmistresses" Conference (HMC) showed that 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 years have two profiles. Half of them are admitted to maintaining private accounts.
HMC’s president, Mike Buchanan, says: “It’s worrying that so many teenagers create their own places on the Internet where parents and teachers cannot find them.
Elid Doyle will become the "voice of athletes" of Scottish Athletics
During the annual general meeting of Scottish Athletics Athletics Doyle, she was elected to the board as a non-executive director.
Eilid Doyle is the most famous Scottish lightweight. President Ian Beattie has defined this move as a perfect opportunity for people who manage sports to take advantage of her rich international experience in the last decade.
"Eilid enjoys a great respect for Scottish, British and world leagues, and we are sure that introducing them to the board will bring great benefits to the Scottish league," Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I am very happy that I will be able to deliver the votes of athletes to the Council, and I hope that I can really help manage sports in Scotland. ”
The American, among its four gold Olympic medals, won 200 and 400 metres in the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta and is now regularly held in the BBC as an expert, cannot be the result of a transient bloodless attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “One month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said it would be time to show me whether I'd regain my ability and to what extent.
It was a secular job, but I was completely healed, I learned to walk again and I went back to my training!
Thank you for all the words of support!"
The advertising of lactators that compare mothers to cows stimulates extreme emotions on the Internet
The company producing lactators called for a storm on the Internet, publishing an advertisement that compares mothers breast-feeding to breast-feeding cows.
To announce the launch of the "first in the world of a quiet lactator to wear under clothing", its producer, Elvie, published a radio advertising in the form of a teledisc, which underlines the freedom it provides to mothers.
She presents four true mothers dancing in a blue box where she hears the words: "Yes, I feel, but I don't see the tail" and "If you don't notice, it doesn't just swap my tits."
Refren goes this way: "Spring them out, pump them out, feed them children, pump them out, pump them out, I'll see my lord."
The advertisement, which was published on the company's Facebook page, caused major online controversy.
The film currently has 77,000 views and hundreds of comments. Users express extreme opinions, many of them say it is inappropriate to joke about the "horror" that takes place in the dairy industry.
"The use of cows to advertise this product was a very bad idea.
Like people to give milk, they have to get pregnant and give birth to infants, with their children being taken away after a few days from their birth," wrote one user.
Elvie lactator can be taken under the bistonosis for feeding (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: “It is obviously traumatic for both mother and child.
Of course, let's use cows to advertise lactators for mothers who can stop their children."
Someone else added: “This advertisement is completely out of the question.”
Another weapon of the clip — one of the women said that she thought the song was "beautiful".
"I think it's a great idea.
If I were still breast-feeding, I'd buy myself that.
I felt like a cow when I was pulling food.
The commercial's a little crazy, but I can't find a second floor in it.
It's a great invention" -- someone wrote.
Another commented: “It’s a fun commercial directed to mothers who pull food (often at work or toilet) and feel like ‘blood’.
It is not for the praise and criticism of the dairy industry."
At the end of the film it turns out that women danced with lactators that were discreetly attached to their chest.
The campaign was inspired by the view that many feeding women feel like cows.
However, the Lactator Elvie is completely quiet, there are no cables or pipes and it can be worn undetected under the biustonous to feed, which gives women the freedom to move, to hold children in their hands, and even to leave home while taking food.
Ana Balarin, a creative partner and director of Mother, said: “Laktor Elvie is such a revolutionary product that he deserved a brave and provocative premiere.
As we put together feeding women and milk cows, we wanted to show all the challenges associated with the withdrawal of food, together with a fun and consistent sense of freedom that he provides.
It's not the first time Elvie lactator hit the headlines.
During the London Fashion Week during the show Marty Jakubowski, a mother of two children showed up with the same product.
Hundreds of immigrant children have been secretly transferred to the labor camp on the border with Texas
The number of children detained by immigrants is increasing violently, although the number of people crossing the border every month does not change. This is partly due to the fact that the harsh rhetoric and principles introduced by President Trump's administration have made it difficult to place children in sponsorship.
Most of the sponsors are also undocumented immigrants who are afraid of threats to deportation if they report after a child.
This risk was increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult residents of the common holding would receive fingerprints that would then be transferred to the immigration office.
Last week, the senior officer of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, Matthew Albence, testified before Congress that his agency had already arrested dozens of people who had reported themselves as sponsors for children left without care.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested were not previously listed.
“A minimum of 80 per cent of those who are sponsors or reside with them in one household are illegally resident in the country, and most of them are foreigners with a criminal past.
That's why we're always chasing them," said Albence.
The secretaries say that as part of their efforts to speed up the regulation of the situation of children, officials introduced new rules that require that a part of them appear in court within a month of detention — not after 60 days, as was the case with previous standards.
Much will be done through videoconferencing, not personally, to ask an immigration judge to legalise their status.
Those who do not qualify for exemption shall be immediately deported.
According to security workers and reports that have been published in recent months, the longer children are in custody, the easier they can become restless or depressed, which in turn can lead to outbreaks of aggression or attempts to escape.
Defenders have said that these problems are even more serious in larger centres, such as Tornillo, where it is easier to see signals that something bad is happening to the child.
They also added that transferring children to a camp without providing them with the right time for emotional preparation or saying goodbye to friends can reinforce the trauma that many of them are already facing.
Syria calls on the American, French and Turkish "occupational forces" to withdraw immediately
During his speech before the UN General Assembly, the Syrian Foreign Minister, Walid al-Moual, also invited refugees from Syria to return home, although the war in that country has been going on for eight years.
Moual, who also plays the role of Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces are illegally residing on Syrian land, under the pretext of combating terrorism, and "we will deal with them accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he announced to the Assembly.
Mowell claims that "war on terrorism has almost ended" in Syria, where more than 360 thousand people have died since 2011, and millions have been forced to leave their homes.
He says that Damascus will continue to "run its holy battle until the Syrian territory is cleansed" from both terrorist groups and from "all foreigners residing illegally".
At present, there are about 2,000 American soldiers in Syria who are mainly engaged in training the Kurdish and Syrian forces against President Baszzar al-Assad and advising them.
In addition, there are more than 1,000 French soldiers in a war-torn country.
As far as refugees are concerned, Moual stated that conditions are good enough for them to return, and he accused "some Western countries" of "exciting unreasonable fear" that would discourage them from returning.
"We have asked for international community and humanitarian organisations to help these returns," he said.
"They are politicising things that should be of a purely human nature."
The United States and the European Union have warned that until President Assad joins the opposition to the political agreement to end the war, Syria will receive no reconstruction aid.
The UN diplomats say that the last agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last major coalition of rebels in Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has helped to prevent a major attack by the Syrian forces supported by Russia on the province in which three million people live.
Moualem stressed, however, that the agreement has a "evident time frame", and expressed hope that military action will be measured in jihadists, including combatants associated with Al-Qaida Front of the People's Defence of Levint, who will be "destroyed".
The UN envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to call soon the first meeting of a new commission composed of members of the governing party and the opposition in order to draw up a draft of the military constitution of Syria and prepare for elections.
Moualem outlined the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the Commission, saying that the work of the panel should be limited "to verify the records of the current constitution" and warned against ingestion.
Why Trump wins again
According to this logic, President Trump would be elected for a second term in 2020, unless, as many liberal observers hope, his presidency would soon end by removing the office and scandal.
It would certainly be "the most dramatic final of the presidency so far".
There's no sign of fatigue at the moment.
Since 2014, the results of CNN's surveillance in the received teams have doubled and reached 1.05 million views and MSNBC has nearly tripled to 1.6 million views.
According to the Nielsen Fox News, an average of 2.4 million views is attracted in the hours of greatest visibility, which is an increase of 1.7 million four years ago, and the MSNBC program "The Rachel Maddow Show" has achieved the highest results among cable TVs, attracting up to 3.5 million views of evening information programs.
"People fly like we go to the fire -- that's something we don't understand," said Neal Bear, the lead producer of the ABC series "Designated Survivor" about the cabinet secretary who becomes president after the attack on the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy artist and book writer "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club", has another theory.
Remembers how she went by taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The manager said he'd vote for Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
"It makes me laugh," he replied.
"Chaos has fun value."
Of course, reports from Washington could, like anything else on television, judge the future of the Roe v. Wade case, whether it is possible to connect the families of immigrants or whether it is a world economy.
Exclusion is a luxury on which only the most privileged views can be allowed.
In addition, this is not just about being a well-informed citizen when you look at the panel of experts discussing Bob Woodward's use of secret informants when writing the book Fair, about Paul Manafort's shirt from a $15,000 shock skin ("overloaded pride clothes", as defined by The Washington Post) or about the shocking details of President Trump's anatomy published by Stormy Daniels.
For example, I'll never look at Super Mario like I used to.
"What he's doing is partly reminiscent of the reality of the show in terms of what evenings are providing new content," said Brent Montgomery, Director General Wheelhouse Entertainment and Maker of "Pawn Stars", about changing the scope and daily returns of the Trump show (such as the attack on NFL players or the praise of Kim Dzong Una).
You can't afford to miss the cut because you're gonna have a problem.
When I met Mike Fliesm this week, the weather on the northern coast of the island of Kauai, where he has his home, was beautiful, but he sat in the middle, watching MSNBC and recording CNN at the same time.
It was not possible to avoid this, not when Brett Kavanaugh stood before the Commission of the Judiciary of the Senate and considered the future of the Supreme Court.
"I remember how we used to do all these crazy programs and people said 'this is the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," Fleiss told me.

The flow of money from outside to election campaign to Congress
It is no wonder that after the reorganization of the electoral districts, which will result in the race for one position now being two congressmen currently in office, to the 17th electoral district of Pennsylvania, the river of cash.
This recently established suburban district of Pittsburgh is represented at the Congress by Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who took his place in another district during the special elections last spring.
Lamb competes with another current congressman, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represented the 12th district in Pennsylvania, which is largely covered by the 17th district.
The district maps were corrected after the January judgment of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, which ruled that the old districts were designated unfairly, which gave the Republican priority and was incompatible with the Constitution.
The race in the new district 17 began with the fight to fund the campaign between the main party funding bodies — the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb's name won popularity in Pennsylvania after winning hair in a wide-ranging election to the 18th round, which took place in March.
For more than a decade, he was in the position of the Republican, and Donald Trump won 20 points in the district.
Political experts have given the Democrats a minor advantage.
The United States considered Salvador's punishment for supporting China, but withdrew from this idea
The diplomats noticed that Dominicans and Panama have already recognized Beijing, despite the slight opposition from Washington.
In June 2017, President Donald Trump held a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela, Panama, and by the time he was expelled by the partners of the Trump Organization management team, he had a hotel in Panama.
The officials of the State Department decided to revoke the heads of the American diplomatic missions from Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama because of "the recent decision to terminate Taiwan's recognition", said Heather Naurut, in her statement on this month's statement.
However, the sanctions under consideration were to be imposed only on Salvador, who was estimated to have received $140 million from the United States in 2017, inter alia, aid to combat drugs and to support development and the economy.
The proposed sanctions, which were to include restrictions on financial aid and the granting of visas to certain persons, would be very sensitive to this Central American country, which is struggling with a large unemployment and a high rate of homicide.
As progress has been made in the meetings of international officials, North and Central American officials have postponed a high-level conference to address safety and economic well-being in order to address the proposals of a similar meeting from last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from coming to the United States.
In mid-September, top-level administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, thus making any consideration of sanctions against Salvador.
The diplomats say that the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, is to be held by Vice-President Mike Pence, which is to be a sign of an invitation to the meeting of the representatives of the administration.
Three American envoys returned quietly to Salvador, Panama and Dominicans, and they did not accompany any new harsh communications or punishment from Washington.
John Bolton's handbook from the White House refused to comment on the details of the debate, which were presented by three American officials, including two diplomats, who, subject to the provision of anonymity, agreed to discuss internal procedures.
Their relations were confirmed by an external analysis of the administration's environment, which also expressed itself anonymously.
Learn History
Another element may be the Special Prosecutor's report, Robert Mueller, on the possible impossibility of obstructing the action of the justice dimension by President Trump, which is currently available to the public.
According to the report, Robert Mueller's investigation also examined whether Donald Trump's campaign had something to do with Russia's attack on American elections.
If he changes the membership of Congress, President Trump will be held accountable when preparations are made for re-election before the electors, and perhaps even before the jury.
There are many unknowns here, and I do not want to suggest that the fall of Trump — not even those in the same position in Europe — is inevitable.
We all have to make a choice on both sides of the Atlantic, which will decide how long it can last.
In 1938 the German officers were ready to make a coup against Hitler, if only the West had supported him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
It didn't work out, and we lost the chance to avoid the years that followed.
The wheels of history turn around such turning points, speeding up or slowing down the inevitable origin of democracy.
There are now several such points in front of the Americans.
What will we do if Donald Trump releases Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man on whom the future of Robert Mueller's investigation depends?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since we revealed in our paper that last year he proposed a secret record of the president and speculated that he wasn't looking for this office.
According to Rosenstein, the report presented by The Times is incorrect.
“How do we react if the newly ordered FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh proves incomplete or unjust or if it is appointed a judge of the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And, above all, will we, in the middle of the presidential term, select those who will bring Donald Trump to the convention for responsibility?
If we don't go through these tests, there will be difficult times for democracy.
However, I believe that we will succeed — because of the lessons I have received in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew, and she was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once took up my residence as an ambassador.
She survived, she emigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me to light the sabas candles on that table marked with swath.
Having such a legacy, how could I not look into the future optimisticly?"

Rangers Club Racer, Graham Dorrans, with optimism waiting for a match with the Rapid Vienna team
Rangers take up Rapid Vienna on Thursday, aware that the victory with Austria, after the impressive resignation from Villareal achieved this month in Spain, will significantly increase their chances of qualifying from the G League of Europe.
Until 2:2 with Villareal contusion, the knee prevented assistant Graham Dorrans from playing this season, but he believes that this result works on Rangers as a trampoline for greater success.
"It did us good because Villareal is in good shape," said 31-year-old.
“We went to this game with faith that we would achieve something — and we fought the point.
Maybe we could finally push them, but generally the remission is probably a fair result.
Spain was probably better in the first half, but in the second, we were better.
As far as Thursday is concerned, this is another important evening for Europe.
We hope we can get three points, but this game will be difficult, because our opponent has achieved a good result in his last match. I am sure, however, that thanks to the support of the kibitz we will go through and this and we will fight a positive result.
Last year was definitely hard because of all my contusions and changes in the club itself, but now we're all feeling good in our seats.
The team is great, and the boys really like to play.
I hope we can go on, leave the last season behind and make a success of it."
The fear of retirement savings makes women sleep out of sleep
Although the pollers knew exactly how they wanted to be treated, few spoke to the family about it.
In a study conducted by Nationwide, about half of the participants said that she was talking to her spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to the kids about it.
"People want to take care of their family members, but they don't take care of this conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationalwide Life Insurance Company.
What do you want me to start with?
Talk to your spouse and children: You will not prepare your family to take care of yourself if you do not express your will in advance.
Talk to your counselor and family where and how you want to be taken care of, because this choice will be an important factor in determining costs.
Ask for help from the financial advisor: He can help find a way to pay for these expenses.
Long-term care funds can come from a traditional care policy, a hybrid policy that allows you to pay cash for such expenses, or from your own property — if you have it.
Prepare legal documents: You will avoid these court battles.
The appointment of a trusted health care agent, who will monitor and ensure that the persons concerned act in accordance with your will, if the communication becomes impossible.
Consider, too, the employment of an agent who will take care of the finances.
Choose a trusted person because she will make financial decisions for you and make sure that all accounts are paid if you are not able to do so on your own.
Don't forget about the details: Imagine that your parents in the next century suddenly need medical help and they're going to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about drugs and allergies?
Write down all the information you need to be prepared.

Man repeatedly shot from a windshield in Ilfracombe
The man was shot several times from the windshield when he returned home from the evening party.
Forty-kilkulet was located in the vicinity of Oxford Grove village of Ilfracombe in the county of Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and arm.
The police identified the shooting that took place around 02:30 BST time as "accidental action".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
The reported injuries do not endanger a man's life.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to official reports, at least 384 people died as a result of a massive earthquake of land and tsunamis that visited the city of Pala on Friday.
No information from Dongal Kabupatene, which is located in the north of Pala, was obtained due to the breakdown of the rescuer's communication, near the Earth's earthquake epicenter at 7.5 degrees.
After the disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated from Pala.
Here are some of the most important information about the city of Pala and the Cabupatija Dongala on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of Central Celebes, a province located at the end of the narrow bay on the western coast of the island. It is estimated that 379 800 people lived in 2017.
When the earthquake and the tsunami occurred, it was the 40th anniversary of his establishment that the city’s trade lasted.
It is a kabupatene (administrative unit below the province) extending along the north-west coast of the island for more than 300 km.
It is estimated that 299,200 people lived in 2017.
The main pillars of the Central Celebean economy are fisheries and agriculture, which have developed especially in the coastal region of Dongal.
Another source of provincial income is the nickel mine, but they are mainly located in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
According to information from the Indonesian Agency for the Elimination of Disasters in the past 100 years, earthquakes and tsunamis have visited Pala and Dongala several times.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed and hundreds of homes destroyed.
In 1996, nine people died as a result of the tsunamis in West Dongal.
Indonesia is on the active seismic Pacific ring of fire, causing earthquakes to occur there quite regularly.
Major earthquakes in recent years:
2004: The Great Earthquake, which visited the west coast of the province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on 26 December, caused the tsunamis that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean, making it more than half in Aceh.
2005: At the end of March and early April, the western coast of Sumatra visited a series of strong earthquakes on the ground.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: On the south of Java, the most relaxed island of Indonesia, there was an earthquake of 6.8 degrees, causing the tsunamis that hit the southern coast, killing almost 700 people.
2009: Near the village of Padang, capital of Western Sumatra, there was an earthquake of 7.6 degrees.
As a result, more than 1,100 people died.
2010: Earthquake of 7.5 degrees hit one of the island of Mentawai near the coast of Sumatra. It caused waves of up to 10 meters, which destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: The flat earthquake hit the Pide Jaya cabupate in Aceh province, causing destruction and panic among people who still remembered the destruction that brought fatal effects of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, there was no wave of tsunamis, but more than 100 people were killed.
2018: Great earthquakes have visited the tourist island of Indonesia, Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mainly on its north side.
They caused thousands of homes to be destroyed and caused temporary difficulties for thousands of tourists.
The oldest son of Sara Palin arrested under domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of former governor of Alaska and candidates for vice president,Sary Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
According to a report published on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers from the town of Wasilla in Alaska, 29 years of age, he was arrested with domestic violence, obstructing reporting and resisting arrest.
According to the police report, when the suspect's friend tried to call the police to report the crime, he picked up her phone.
The KTUU station reports that Palin is in custody following Mat-su and has a security deposit of $500.
According to her information last Saturday, he stood before the court where he said in his defense that he was "probably innocent".
There are three Class A violations in the Fire, which means he can get a fine even in the year of prison and $250,000.
He was also accused of exceeding Class B for which he was threatened with a fine of $2000 on the day of imprisonment and imprisonment.
It's not the first time he's been charged with a criminal charge.
In December 2017 he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palina.
Then his mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is now before the Alaskan Veteran Court of Appeal.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, of obstructing the filing of a report and of having a weapon unwarranted in connection with the incident.
His partner says he hit her in the face.
In 2016, veteran groups criticized Sarah Palin, who linked aggressive behavior of her son to the stress team that she had acquired during her service in Iraq.
Hundreds of people died as a result of tsunamis following earthquakes in Indonesia
At least 384 people died as a result of a five - hour earthquake that visited the Indonesian island of Celebes.
Earthquakes of 7.5 degrees caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication are not working, and it is expected that the number of victims will increase in the next few days.
The earthquake took place near the central part of the island of Celebes, which is on the north east of the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta.
In the social media, films show a moment of disaster.
When the tsunamis hit the coast, hundreds of people were found on the beach in Pala, where the festival was held.
Federal prosecutors call for a death penalty for the suspected terrorist attack in New York
Federal prosecutors from New York call for the death penalty for Sayfull Saipov suspected of carrying out a terrorist attack in New York, resulting in the death of eight people. This is a rare punishment — it has not been committed in this state for a federal crime since 1953.
To carry out an attack that took place in October on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, the thirty-year-old Saipov said he used a borrowed Home Depot truck, which he used to drive pedestrians and bikers on his way.
According to the New York South District Notice of the intention to claim the death penalty to justify its need, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "targetly" killed eight victims and "targetly" caused serious injury to the body.
According to the court document, both charges threaten the death penalty.
Several weeks after the Federal Court of Appeal attacked, Saipov filed a 22-position indictment, including eight allegations of murder in illegal activities — which is the procedure usually used by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases — and the commission of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
According to the prosecutors, the organization of the attack required "solid planning and thinking".The way Saipov carried it out was defined as "defensible, cruel and immoral".
"Sayful Habibullaevic Saipov has brought harm, harm and loss to family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damiana Pagnucca" – says the statement of intent.
Five of the victims were citizens of Argentina who lived in New York tourism.
The last time the death penalty was imposed in the southern New York district ten years ago.
The accused Khalid Barnes was found guilty of murdering two drug dealers, but in September 2009 he was finally sentenced to life.
The death penalty was last executed in New York in 1953 in Julius and Ethel Rosenbergach. Marriage was lost after two years before they were declared guilty of conspiracy and spying on the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were lost in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to Saipov's court documents, which came from Uzbekistan, he did not show any conscience within a month of the attack.
The police say the investigator said he was feeling good about what he did.
According to Saipov's indictment, he admitted to the authorities that he was inspired by the ISIS films he watched on the phone.
According to the police, he also claimed suspension of the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
In the case of an indictment involving 22 charges, he is innocent.
David Patton, one of the federal defenders from Saipova's office, said they were "desolate for obvious reasons" of the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty and to refuse to live without the possibility of early release from the blame will only prolong the suffering that these events have brought upon all the interested parties," he said.
Saipov's defense team asked the prosecutors not to ask for a death penalty.
A tourism parliamentary say that NIGEL FARAGE should take responsibility for the Brexit negotiations
During today's protest that took place during the tour conference, Nigel Farage pledged to "mobilize the army of the people".
The former leader of the UK Independence Party (UKIP) said that politicians must "feel hot" beating Eurosceptics when one of Theresa May's parliamentarians suggested that they should take responsibility for negotiations with the European Union.
A Conservative MP, Peter Bone, told the protesters in Birmingham that if Farage was the secretary of Brexit, "the United Kingdom would be outside the Union".
However, the addition of the remaining tours in the Community to the individual protest against Brexit, which took place in the city, further emphasized the burden of setting up its deep-separated series, which is before Theresa May.
Your Prime Minister is trying hard to implement his plan of compromise with the Chequers between Brexit and its opponents and the European Union itself.
Her allies say that despite the opposition, she will seek to conclude an agreement with Brussels and force Eurosceptics and Laborists to make a choice between her proposal and "chaos".
Peter Bone told the Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted to "put out a plan with the Chequers".
He suggested that Nigel Farage should be the deputy who should be responsible for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were to do this, we would now be outside the Union," he said.
The MP from Wellingborough added, "I support Brexit, but we have to throw out a plan from the Chequers."
Presenting our opposition to the European Union, he said: “We did not fight in world wars after this, so that we might be subject to one another.
We want to establish our rights in our own country."
Peter Bone rejected the suggestion that citizens had changed their opinion since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their opinion and want to stay in the Union is completely false".
Brexit Andre Jenkins of the Tours Party, who told reporters: “I’m just saying: Prime Minister, please listen to people.
The Chequers plan doesn't enjoy support at all, the opposition won't vote on it, our party or our activists who make the streets and choose us, and they don't support it.
Leave the plan with the Chequers and start listening."
In a statement addressed to Prime Minister May, she added: "Transfers keep their positions when they keep their promises".
Nigel Farage said that politicians taking part in the demonstration must "feel hot" if they were to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"Now this is a matter of trust between us — people — and the political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them 'we won't let you do it'".
Turning to the prejudiced crowd, he added: “I want you to make politicians who are on the brink of Brexit feel hot.
"We are mobilizing the army of the people of this country, which has given us victory in the Brexit referendum, and we will not stop until we become independent, independent, proud United Kingdom."
At that time, Brexit’s opponents marched through the city to the center, where a two-hour demonstration took place.
The gang of activists went off with the banners of "Torysi v. Brexit" after the group was set up this weekend.
Laborist activist, Baron Andrew Adonis, ridiculed conservatives for the security of the party application at the beginning of the conference.
"These are people who claim to be able to organise information systems and all technology to support the Canada Plus, a liquid border, free trade without borders with Ireland," he added.
"That's a complete farce.
There's nothing like good Brexit," he added.
Elizabeth Warren plans to "consider seriously" the candidate for the president
US Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after the November elections, "he will seriously consider the presidential election".
According to The Boston Globe, the representative of the Democrats from Massachusetts spoke about her future when meeting with the voters that took place on Saturday in Western Massachusetts.
Elizabeth Warren, who often criticises President Donald Trump, will apply for a reelection in November. Her opponent will be a representative of Republicans, Geoff Diehl, who was co-president of the Trump campaign in Massachusetts during the 2016 elections.
It is now said that in the 2020 elections, Warren can win the Trump.
The Saturday event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with the voters in the town hall formula since Donald Trump took office.
One of the participants asked if he was planning to run for the president.
Elizabeth Warren replied that it was time for “women to go to Washington to repair our corrupt government — and it also means a woman on the top.”
Arresting the death shooter in which the player of the LSU, Wayde Sims team died
The Baton Rouge police informed Louisiana on Saturday about the arrest of a suspect on Friday shooting, in which a basketball player from the LSU, Wayde Sims, died.
The police department at Baton Rouge informed of the arrest of 20-year-old Dieteon Simpson at a conference that took place about 11:00 east time.
On Friday, a shot was published asking for help in identifying the man visible on it.
Twenty-one-year-old Wayde Sims died as a result of a shooting near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims was shot with firearms in his head, resulting in his death," said Murphy J. Paul, police chief, according to 247 sports.
Wade stood up to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being in a crime scene, with a gun and shot at Wayde.
After being arrested, during which he did not resist, he was transferred to the East Baton Rouge County Police Department.
A 1.98 m junior Wayde Sims was raised in Baton Rouge. He played 32 matches, with the last season he started 10 times, during which he spent on the park on average 17.4 minutes, won 5.6 points and counted 2.9 collections for the match.
Grand Prix Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after the team's command enabled him to win with Sebastian Vettel
From the time that Walter Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the Mercedes team's command would have a major impact on the outcome of the race.
Bottas, who started from the first field, started very well and almost beat Hamilton, defending his position in the first two circles and forcing Vettel to attack his colleague from the team.
Vettel went to the service station as the first one and allowed Hamilton to go on a peleton trail, which should decide on the races.
The Mercedes racer went to the boxing in the next round and appeared behind Vettel, but after the action around the circle, which led Ferrari reluctantly to leave the internal part of the track, risking a push to the defensive after a double race with the aim of defending the position on the third turn, Hamilton moved on.
Max Verstappen started at the end of the stake and at his 21st birthday at the end of the first round he was in the seventh place.
He then ran for a large part of the race because he did not change his tyres to achieve a fast finish and to receive Kimi Raikkonen's fourth position.
Finally, he went to the service point at the 44th round, but in the other eight rounds he was no longer able to speed up.
“It was a hard day because all weekend Valteri did a great job and turned out to be a real gentleman when he was asked to let me go.
The whole team gave everything to take top two," said Hamilton.
It was a really bad word.
During the meeting that took place on Saturday, President Donald Trump met with Senator Diana Feinstein, who maintained that she did not disclose the contents of a letter from Christina Blasey Ford, in which she accused the judge of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the President did not refer directly to the statements made by Christina Ford before the Justice Senate Commission. Instead, he said that what was done in the Senate showed that people were "skinned, angry and lying".
"What could happen is one thing, but this beautiful situation in the Senate that we have witnessed for a few days when we see anger when we see people who are angry, angry, angry and lying," he said.
"We see what was published and revealed, and then they tell us 'Oh, I didn't do it.'
I didn't do it.
Remember?
Diana Feinstein, did you reveal that?
Remember her answer... did you reveal the contents of this document? — oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't reveal it."
Wait, wait.
Did we reveal...No, we didn't reveal" -- he added, undermining the senator.
Diana Feinstein received a letter from Christine Ford describing the charges against Kavanaugh in July, and her content ran off at the beginning of September.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's insinuation, I didn't reveal her story," Feinstein confessed to the commission as reported by The Hill.
"She asked me for discretion and, in accordance with her request, I did not disclose these contents."
However, her statement did not convince the president, who commented on it this way at the Saturday meeting: “I tell you, it was really a bad body.
Maybe she didn't, but it was the worst word I've ever seen in my life."
Continuing the defence of the candidate to the Supreme Court judge, whom three women accused of sexual harassment, the president suggested that the Democrats use insinuations for their own ends.
‘They are determined to take over any measure.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to destroy to take over authority and control," said the president, according to the Mediate Service.
Elite League: Dundee Stars — Belfast Giants 5:3
In a match with Dundee Patrick Dwyer's club won two goals for the Giants team
The Dundee Stars Club has rescinded its five-year-old Elite League team with Belfast Giants, winning a five-year-old tournament on Saturday.
The giants quickly gained a double advantage after the shootings of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvilleer.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cowne were equal to the result, after which Dwyer again led the Giants.
Francois Bouchard rebalanced the result by winning the goal for the Dundee team, after which two gates shot by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen sealed her victory.
This was the third lost in the Elite League season for subsisting Adam Keefe, who, despite the initial loss on Friday night, won with the Dundee team at Belfast 2:1.
Both teams met in this season for the fourth time — the first three matches won by the Giants.
The opening goal of Dwyer fell in the fourth minute (3:35) after assistant Kendall McFaull. Four minutes later Beauvilier doubled the result thanks to assistant David Rutherford.
After an intense opening at 13:10 a.m. Sullivan introduced the team of the owner back into the game, and then Matt Marquardt compared the result at 15:16.
Two provided the advantage of the Giants before the first break when at the end of the first third he won his second goal that evening.
The host team was regrouped and Bouchard rebalanced the result of the bulk gained during the game at 27:37 minutes.
At the end of the second third, Cowne and Charles Corcoran jointly helped Nielsen to provide the Dundee team with the first prize in this match. The final victory of Dundee was sealed in half of the last third by the same competitor who shot the fifth goal for his team.
The giants who lost their last five matches four, the next match will be at Milton Keynes on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies helping hundreds of people in the plane to escape the earthquake
The air traffic controller from Indonesia was shouted by a hero after he died, helping to safely launch a plane with hundreds of people on board.
More than 800 people died, and many were considered to be lost after a great earthquake on Friday, which hit the Indonesian island of Celebes, causing tsunamis.
There are still strong secondary shocks in the region. Many people have been imprisoned in the city of Paul.
Although his colleagues fled, saving their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Agg refused to leave his position in the scattered flight control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Pala.
He stayed there to make sure that the Batik Air line plane (lot 6321), which was just on the starting line, was safely launched.
Then he jumped out of the tower when it seemed to him that they were about to fall.
He died in a hospital.
According to an Australian ABC News station spokesperson for Air Navigation Indonesia, Johannes Sirat, said that the controller's decision probably saved hundreds of lives.
We organized a helicopter from Balikpapan to Borneo to transfer him to a larger hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, Antonius left this morning before the muzzle arrived at Paul.
"This message has broken our hearts," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities are afraid that the number of deaths can reach thousands. The national disaster management agency informs that access to the cities of Dongal, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"We believe that the harvest of death continues to increase, because many bodies are still under the bush and cannot be reached," said Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, spokesperson.
The six - foot - long [6 m] waves destroyed Paul, where the mass funeral of the victims will be held on Sunday.
Military and civilian aircraft provide assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News station: “The ambulants will constantly import bodies.
She's starting to miss drinking water.
Small shops are smelted."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “Indonesian Red Cross is speeding up rescue, but we don’t know what to do.
It's already a tragedy, and it might be even worse."
On Sunday, the president of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, came to Paul, who turned to the army: “All of you, please, work day and night in order to carry out all the duties of evacuation.
Are you ready?" says CNN.
This year, Indonesia was visited by an earthquake that killed more than 550 people on the island of Lombok.
The plane crash in Micronesia — Air Niugini lines say one person is missing after the plane crashed on the lagoon
Airline operated by a plane that broke down on a lagoon in Micronesia in the Pacific, informs that one person is missing. Previously, all 47 passengers and crew members were safely evacuated from a towing plane.
Air Niugini reported that according to data on Saturday afternoons, they could not count one man who traveled by ferry.
They made sure that they and local authorities, hospitals and investigators were trying to find him.
However, they did not respond immediately to requests for additional passenger details such as his age or nationality.
After the plane crashed into the water during an airport landing on Chuuk Island, local ships helped to save other passengers and crew members.
The officials informed on Friday that seven people were transferred to the hospital.
The airlines said there were six passengers left in the hospital on Saturday, all in stable condition.
It's not clear what was the cause of the disaster, and we don't know what's going on.
Airline and U.S. Navy say the plane landed on a lagoon not far from the runway.
According to some witnesses, he got out of the dog.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was coming very low.
"This has helped us a lot," he said.
Jaynes said he and other people managed to cross through the passageway to get out of an emergency flying plane.
According to him, the crew members panicked and yelled, and he himself suffered a dangerous head injury.
The U.S. Navy military reported that the rescue action also helped mariners who were working nearby on the modernization of the coast. Through a stormed boat they managed to transport people to the shore before the plane sank to a depth of about 30 metres.
According to the Aviation Safety Network database, 111 people have died in the last two decades of aircraft crashing under the airline registered in Papua New Guinea. However, there is no Air Niugini.
The analyst reconstructed nighttime events when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecutor concluded the presentation of evidence in the re-trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
An analyst from the U.S. Department of Justice, Paul Rowlett, spent many hours testifying as a court in the field of information analysis.
He described to the judges how by means of cell phone records he replayed the 29-year-old accused, Quinton Tellis, and 19-year-old victims, Jessica Chambers, from the night she died.
As reported by the newspaper Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said he had received location data from various cell phones that showed that the Feral Night Tellis was from the Chambers, thus covering his earlier claims.
When the data confirmed that when Quinton had to stay with his friend Michael Sanford, his cell phone was at Jessica Chambers, the police decided to interview Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford confessed he wasn't in town that day.
To the prosecutors' question about whether Tellis was telling the truth, claiming that he was at Sanford's truck that night, he replied that he was "lieving, because my truck was then in Nashville".
Another inaccuracies is Tellis' claim that he's known Chambers for about two weeks.
Cell phone records showed that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that some time after the death of Chambers Tellis he removed her contact details from the phone, as well as texts and connections.
"He took her out of his life," Hale said.
The final defense is due to begin on Sunday.
The judge said that the case would probably be handed over to the jury on the same day.
The High Breed — what is hip-hop conscious?
Hip-hope trio wants to change the negative image of the species by filling in its music with a positive transmission.
According to The High Breed from Bristol today, hip-hop left the original political content and social issues.
The members of the team want to return to its roots and restore the popularity of a conscious hip-hop.
Thanks to the creativity of artists such as Akala and Lowkey, the rebirth of artists such as The Fugees or Common has recently been observed in Britain.
Another black?
Ninja from New York invites a couple to be released after "racist" SMS
Ninja from New York is calling for her release from work on racist grounds after receiving a misaddressed SMS in which the mother of the child complains that she is "another black person".
The couple objected as if they were racists, comparing the attitude to "sanction".
The mother of two children, Lynsey Plasco-Faxman, was clearly constricted when it became clear that the new nurse, Giselle Maurice, who had just spent her first day at work in 2016, was a blacksmith.
“NO, THE ROAD MAN” — she wrote to her husband in her text.
Instead of sending him to him, however, she sent him to Mrs. Maurice twice.
According to the New York Post newspaper, when Plasco-Faxman realized that he was a full-fledged gaff, Giselle Maurice fired Giselle Maurice, claiming that a hearty nurse, who is an African American, was wrong to perform her duties, and she was waiting for her nieces from the Philippines.
Mrs. Maurice got paid for her day of work, and then she was sent to Uber's house.
Now he claims compensation for the exemption of $350 per day for six months for which he was initially employed with his residence, although he has not signed the contract.
"I want to show them that there is no such thing," said the newspaper Post on Friday and added "I know it's discrimination".
Couples are defending the charges of racism, claiming that the conclusion of their cooperation with Ms. Maurice was justified because after they pictured her, they feared that they would not be able to trust her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't intend to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist," said the Postman, Joel Plasco.
"Would you trust your children in the person you have hurt, even if it happened by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on, come on."
Compared to the “sanction”, Plasco said his wife was born only two months earlier and was in “a very difficult situation”.
"Are you going to blow up something like that?
It's not too nice," he added the investment banker.
Although the case has not yet ended, the public opinion quickly issued a few judgments in the social media, criticising it for its behaviour and way of thinking.
The new letter reveals that the publishers of the book about Paddington were afraid that readers would not feel links to the talking mission.
The author’s daughter, Michael Bonda, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the warm reception of the book, says: “It’s hard to put the person who first read it before the book was published.
It's very funny now that we already know what we know about the great success of Paddington."
He claims that her father, who had inspired him to write a book for children before a small plush mouse, worked as a cameraman at BBC, was sure his work would be rejected. He also adds that after his death last year, the 60th year of publication of the book seemed "sweet-gorzka".
About Paddington, described as "very important member of our family", says her father was in secret proud of his success.
"He was a quiet man, he didn't hesitate," he adds.
“But since Paddington seemed very real to him, it was almost like having a child who achieved something — you feel proud of him, even though it is not your job.
I think the success of Paddington has been seen in a less positive way.
Although he himself invented it and created it, he always gave the credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter died, and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After her daughter was landed, she was transferred to Louis Pasteura 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life empty.
"Nade called regularly and said it's really bad that he's probably not going to get out of it," says Tanya Ednan-Laperous.
“Then he called to say that Natasha will die in two minutes, and I have to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be at your place.
The medications that doctors gave her to maintain the heart function slowly stopped working and were removed from the body.
She died a while ago, and that was the end of it all.
I could just sit there and wait for it to develop.
I couldn't go out or cry or cry because I was among other people.
I really had to stick to it."
Finally, Tanya Ednan-Laperous, who had already mourned the loss of her daughter, came aboard with other passengers, unaware of the pain she was suffering.
"No one knew," she said.
I had my head down, and my tears flowed all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane, I felt all-encompassing compassion for Nada.
I felt he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Posts from women in mourning are supposed to help prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women whose loved ones have committed suicide try to get others away from the purpose of taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys place on the Welsh Bridge emails with inspiring messages and phone numbers under which people can get help.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he got depressed, and at the age of 18, he took his life.
"I don't want any parent to feel like I feel every day," she says.
45-year-old Sharon Davis, who lives in Lydney, says that her son was a good cook for a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew his smile.
They always said they could explain any room."
However, before his death, he gave up his job because he was “in a really black place. ”
In 2014, Tyler's brother was 11 years old and that's what he found his brother when he committed suicide.
Mrs Davis says, "I'm always afraid of the effect of domination."
Sharon Davis created the cards “to tell people that there are people to whom you can turn and who you can talk to, even if you only know them.
Don't sit still. Talk to someone."
Kelly Humphreys, who has been friends with Sharon Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years shortly after her mother died.
"He didn't say that he felt embarrassed, sad or something," he says.
“For a few days before the birth of God, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He was already in full length in the world, when the kids opened the presents, he didn't even look at them."
He says that his death was very painful for them, but they had to deal with it: “It broke the hole in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we must continue to live and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugha depends on Italy because the FBI launches an investigation
"I thought that if we were really able to get what he asked — a limited investigation in time and a limited amount — maybe we could achieve some unanimity," Jeff Flake said on Saturday and added that he was afraid that the Commission would "break up" into opposing camps, leading to the impact.
Why didn't Brett Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want to investigate the FBI?
The whole hate of them comes from now on.
The election to Congress is in just a few weeks — November 6th — if, according to the forecasts, the Republic loses the opportunity to choose a certain person to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has already picked up the phone to call the senators and get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for him in the White House and through him met his wife Ashley, who was the personal secretary of the president.
What happens when the FBI prepares a report?
The Senate, which currently holds 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, will have a vote.
It is not certain whether Brett Kavanaugh will obtain at least 50 votes from the senators, which would allow Vice-President Mike Pence to break the impas and bring him to the Supreme Court.
Under the Kim governments, the number of refugees from North Korea
According to South Korean legislator Kim Dzong Un, seven years ago, the number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea fell.
Citing data from the South Korean Ministry of the United States, Park Byeong-seug said that 1127 refugees were reported last year, and in 2011 – 2706.
According to him, the key factors that have affected this situation are more detailed border controls between North Korea and China and higher rates charged by human traffickers.
Pjongang did not issue a public statement on this matter.
The vast majority of refugees from North Korea are finally proposed for South Korea.
According to the Seoul authorities, since the end of the Korean war in 1953, the border illegally exceeded more than 30,000 Koreans from the North.
Most of China's escapes, which have the longest border with North Korea, make it easier to cross than a strictly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
The Chinese consider refugees to be illegal immigrants, not refugees, and often send them back to the country.
The relationship between the North and the South, which is theoretically still at war, has clearly improved in recent months.
This month the leaders of both countries met in Pjongang, where they held talks on the negotiations on denuclearisation, which had previously been on the dead end.
This happened after the historic meeting of U.S. President Donald Trump with Kim Dzong Une, which took place in June in Singapore. The outcome of this meeting is a general agreement on the desire to clear the Korean peninsula of nuclear weapons.
However, on Saturday, the Foreign Minister of North Korea, Ri Yong-ho, accused the United States of missing progress in this matter.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no certainty about our national security, and in these circumstances there is no way that we can defend ourselves on our own," Ri said in a speech he made before the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugha "the hysterical" and claims that he is not fit for work in the Supreme Court
The leader of the minority in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh a "hysterical" and said that he is not naturally able to work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made this statement during an interview she gave on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin.
"I think that if a woman acted in this way, she would be regarded as a 'histories'," Pelosi said about her reaction to the testimony that Kavanaugh presented on Thursday before the Senate Justice Commission.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied charges of alleged sexual harassment by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
In his opening speech, Kavanaugh showed strong emotions — he almost screamed and lost his speech when talking about family matters and high school years.
He also clearly persecuted the Democrats from the Commission, setting out the charges against him "gross and coordinated reputation" organised by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelos said that she found that Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he was not able to work in the Supreme Court because it revealed his prejudice towards the Democrats.
"I think he himself has been disqualified by issuing these statements, as well as by the way he attacked Clintons and Democrats," she said.
She was asked if she would try to dismiss Kavanaugh from the office if he received his nomination and if the Democrats had obtained the majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi was shocked.
"I say so: if he does not speak the truth to Congress or the FBI, he should not only sit in the Supreme Court, but also serve in this court where he is currently working," she said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the District Court of Appeal in the District of Colombia.
Pelos added that as a Democrat, he feared possible Kavanaugh rulings on the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade trial because he was considered a conservative judge.
During the corroborated case, Kavanaugh ignored the question of whether he would have failed to comply with certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"This is not the time to bring a hysterical court, a person who will expect us to say 'but it is wonderful'," Pelosi added.
And women have to control it.
It's the right diet, months and years of raging anger, and she can't throw it away without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Gloria Stein told me 45 years later.
"It's quite common, isn't it?"
She added: “A woman who was a manager in a company helped me a lot. She said she was crying when she was angry, but she came up with a way that when she was nervous and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to 'You sure think I was sad because I was crying.
I'm angry.
He's still doing his own thing.
I thought it was great."
The tears are permissible as a result of some anger because they are in fact misunderstood.
One of my most obvious memories of one of the first positions in a man - dominated office is how one time I started crying out of unbearable anger.
"Never let them see you crying," she said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad, and they're happy they got you."
Patricia Schroeder of the Democratic Party, then a Member of Congress from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was caught with a lover on a boat named Monkey Business and retired from the race, frustrated at the borders of Patricia, she realized that she could actually consider the idea of a self-chanced presidential candidate.
"It wasn't a thoughtful decision," she said, laughing 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates and the last thing they needed was another.
Someone has defined this situation as the "King Snow and Seven Sparrows".
As the campaign has been going on for a long time, Schroeder had a stake in raising funds and promised he wouldn't go to the race if he didn't collect $2 million.
It was a battle sentenced to death.
She discovered then that some of her supporters who gave her men $1,000 had only 250 for her.
"Do they think I have any discounts?" she wondered.
During a talk in which she announced that she would not conduct a formal campaign, she was so filled with emotion — gratitude for the people who supported her, frustration over the system that so much made it difficult to collect money and turn to voters, not delegates, and anger for sexism — that her voice was in her throat.
"You can think I've been through a nervous breakdown," he says.
“You might think that Kleinex is sponsoring me.
I remember thinking about what they wrote on my grave.
'She was crying?'
What benefits can economic war between the United States and China bring to Beijing
The halls beginning the economic war between the US and China were deafening and, although the battle is still ongoing, in the longer term the conflict between these countries can be beneficial for Beijing, experts say.
The first warning was fired this year by US President Donald Trump, imposing duties on China's key export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most important escalation took place this week following the introduction of new tariffs on goods worth $200 billion (150 billion pounds), which resulted in the taxing of half of all goods coming to the US from China.
Each time, Beijing has reciprocated in nature, raising the last charge on American goods worth $60 billion from five to ten percent.
China is determined to respond to every hit in the US and does not appear to be the second economy in the world to be soon to resign.
The forced withdrawal of Washington means acceptance of the demands, but the public humiliation of the United States would be too embarrassing for the President of China, Xi Jinping.
However, according to experts, if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressure from the US trade war could strengthen China in a long way, reducing the dependence between the two economies.
"The fact that the rapid political decision taken in Washington or Beijing could create conditions for the resolution of economic chaos in any of the countries is actually much more dangerous than the observers have so far acknowledged," said Abigail Grace, a researcher in Asia in the think tank Center for New American Security.
According to the Syrian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Syria is "ready" to return refugees
The government argues that Syria is ready for a voluntary return of refugees and asks for help in rebuilding a country that has been destroyed as a result of more than seven years of war.
In his speech before the UN General Assembly, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Syria, Walid al-Moual, stated that conditions in the country are improving.
"The situation in our territory is now more stable and secure thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
In an effort to restore normality, the government is constantly rebuilding areas destroyed by terrorists.
All conditions have already been met so that refugees who have had to leave the country because of terrorism and unilateral economic movements in their daily lives and maintenance measures can return voluntarily to it.
According to the United Nations estimates, Syria has left more than 5.5 million people since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living there need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moual said that the Syrian regime would gladly accept help in rebuilding a destroyed country.
He stressed, however, that he would not accept aid under the conditions laid down or offered by the countries sponsoring the rebellion.
Europe welcomes the Ryder Cup victory in Paris
The European team won Ryder Cup 2018, winning the US team with 16.5 to 10.5 on the Le Golf National field in the suburbs of Paris.
In the European country, the United States has lost its sixth row and since 1993 has not won the Ryder Cup Cup in Europe.
Europe won the trophy when, under the leadership of the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn, it won 14.5 points that were needed to defeat the United States.
The American star, Phil Mickelson, who did not go well through most of the tournaments, hit a ball from the base directly to the water at the 16th PAR3, giving the same match to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari has been shining through all the rounds and has been one of four players who since 1979, when it first took place in the current format, managed to achieve the result 5-0-0.
The American Jordan Spieth was eliminated by 5&4 by the lowest ranking player from Europe, Thorbjorna Olesena from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, who holds the highest position in the world rankings, lost two slots before the last league with Englishman Ian Poulter, for which he might have been the last Ryder Cup.
Hispan Sergio Garcia, who has already participated in eight such tournaments and has won 25.5 points in his career as a European with the greatest number of winners in Ryder Cup.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t stop today.
It was a tough year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for believing in me and choosing me.
I'm so happy to get the shower back.
This is the success of the whole team and it is my pleasure to be able to help," said Garcia, excitedly after winning the team from Europe.
He sends a stick to his cousin, John Rahmo, who won a single American golf legend on Sunday, Tiger Woods, a result of 2+1.
"I feel the incredible pride of the winner of Tiger Woods. I grew up watching his game," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all the matches in France and now has results 13-21-3 at Ryder Cup.
It's an uncountable statistics, as on one of the biggest players of all time, who won 14 most important titles and only resigned Jack Nicklaus.
The United States team had a lot of trouble finding the currents all weekend, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played at a really high level throughout the tournament.
After the disappointing appearance of his American captain, Jim Furyk, said: “I was proud of the boys, they fought.
At some point this morning, we pushed a few Europeans.
We're out of here.
The heads of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played really well.
Together with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Commission, we will find a way forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
I'm full of surprises for the opponents.
They played a lot better than us."
