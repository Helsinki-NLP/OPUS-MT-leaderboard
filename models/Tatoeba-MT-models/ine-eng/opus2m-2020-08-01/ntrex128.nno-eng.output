Welsh members of the National Assembly are afraid of being taken seriously
Several members of the National Assembly were recently horrified by a proposal to change the name of members of the Assembly or AM (member of the Assembly) to members of the Wallisian Parliament or MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The reaction was due to plans to change the name of the National Assembly of the Wallisian Parliament.
Members of several political parties are concerned that they may be ridiculed.
A Labour member said his group is worried about your MWP rhymes on Twp and Pwp
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh, "twp" means stupid and "pwp" boob.
A member of the Plaid Party said the group "is not naked" and has proposed options.
A Welsh Conservative member said that his group has an "open mind" when it comes to renaming, but let MWP not far from the word "muppet".
In this context, the Welsh letter w is not expressed differently by the English Yorkshire dialect its statement of the letter u.
The National Assembly, which now writes a legislative proposal to introduce the name change, said: ‘The final decision on which members of the National Assembly will be called will naturally be made up to the members themselves.’
A Welsh official decided from 2017 gave the national assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the delegation published the results of a public hearing on the name proposals that showed great support for calling the Assembly the Welsh Parliament.
In the case of the title of members of the national assembly, the delegation preferred the Wallisian Member or WMP, while the MWP elections received the most support during the public hearing.
Members of the National Assembly have a certain opportunity to come up with other proposals, but the struggle to agree has given the leader of the delegation, Elin Jones, the main works, to submit the bill in a few weeks.
The legislative framework for reforms includes other changes to the functioning of the delegation, including rules on the disqualification of members of the assembly and the design of a committee system.
Members of the House will be able to vote on what they should call when they discuss the bill.
Make-up calls to change the name of the country
On Sunday, voters shall vote over whether to change the name of their country to ‘North Macedonia’.
The people's dissatisfaction was determined to resolve a conflict that has taken place for many decades with the neighbouring country of Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the neighbouring north represents a requirement on the territory and has had many objections to Macedonia's EU and NATO applications.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, a supporter of the popular opinion on the change of name, said that he was coming to look away from the result.
Those who support public opinion, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change right and away is the price of becoming a member of the EU and NATO.
The clocks in St. Martin stand while the churches in Harlem, New York, strive.
"The old I have spoken to," said Adams. "In the old days there was a bar and a church on every corner,"
‘Today, none of the components are present.’
He said he understood why he just disappeared.
“People are socializing in other ways today,” he said.
‘Bars are no longer substances in the neighborhood that people usually visit.’
When it comes to the debts of the churches, he is concerned that the money from selling property does not come to be as long as the leaders believe, "and before or since they are back where they started."
He allowed churches to be replaced by shareholder apartments filled with the kind of people who don't care about helping the historical sites in the neighborhood.
“The majority of those who buy shareholdings in these buildings are white,” he said. “and so comes the day when all churches are closed, because it is not likely that these people who move into the shareholdings will become members of these churches.”
Both churches were built of white socks before Harlem became a black town - Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's church a decade later.
The original White Methodist Congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A black shoe that had been announced nearby, moved into the building.
Santt Martin was taken over by a black shoe rent by pastor John Howard Johnson, who also led the boycott of the shops in 125th Street, a chief delegate in Harlem where the owners opposed or promoted the response.
The building suffered great damage in a fire in 1939, but when pastor Johnson’s followers planned to build him up again, they also ordered a new game.
Pastor David Johnson, son of Johnson senior and follower of Sankt Martin, was proud and called the clock game “the hours of the poor.”
The expert who played the game in July calls it something else: «A cultural tax» and «a historical instrument that cannot be replaced».
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also commented that it was the first watch game in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who left the church to play the largest clock game in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said Sankt Martin did not find a substitute for him.
What has happened in Sankt Martin in recent months has become a complicated story about architects and construction workers, some added by the leaders of the playwrights in the church, and others by the episcopal bishop.
The church, which is the leader of the sock and consists of the leaders of the playwrights, wrote to the bishop in July with concerns that the bishop ‘city asks the church to pay’, even though the church was not involved in the bishop’s admission of architects and construction workers.
Some of the members of the Sock complained about the lack of openness from the bishop.
13-year-old injured by hi underhumard in California
The authorities report that a 13-year-old was attacked by a shark on Saturday while he drowned after lobsters in California on the opening day of the lobster season.
She was attacked just before 7:00 in the morning near the Beacon beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel commented on the KSWB TV in San Diego that he had drowned with friends in about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the guy screaming for help.
Hemmel said that first thought he only the guy was excited to have caught a lobster, before he realized that the guy called out, "Something bit me!
Something's wrong with me!"
"His whole throat was torn apart," said Hammel, "that he observed when he reached the boy.
"I said, 'They all must come out of the water. There is a shark in the water.'
The good was picked up by air ambulance and taken to the Council Hospital for Children in San Diego, and his condition is critical.
It's not sure what kind of shark it was that attacked the guy.
Captain Larry Giles said in a press conference that a shark was observed in the area a few weeks earlier, but that shark was not a dangerous black shark.
Giles added that the guy had serious damage to the body.
The authorities closed access to the water from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours to investigate and secure the area.
Giles commented that there are more than 135 different species in the area, but most are not prepared to be dangerous.
The Sainsbury store's bets on beauty product
The British store chain Sainsbury's will compete with Boots, Superdrugs and Debenham's beauty product and offer wholesale services in the store.
As part of an investment in the UK's beauty market, worth £2.8 billion and continues to grow while the mote and interior hall goes down, Sainsbury's beauty products will be tested in 11 stores next year, and several shops will succeed.
The investment in beauty product comes at a time when the shelves that used to be filled with TVs, microwaves and interiors are now empty.
Sainbury's said they should double the number of beauty products to 3000 products and offer brand Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
They will give L'Oreal, Maybellline and Burt's Bees more space and have separate areas for each brand as in the Boots stores.
The store will also relaunch its own shop shop Boutique and make most of the products vegan, something to attract more young customers.
In addition, the perfume dealer Fragrance Shop will test his perfume salt in two of the Sainsbury's shops. The first one opened in Croydon, London, last week, and the second one will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Networking and changing to buy small quantities of food every day from local small shops means that large shops need to find new ways to reach customers.
Mike Coupe, the managing director of Sainsbury's, has commented that shops will look more and more like a supermarket, while stores are trying to fight the Aldi and Lidl low-priced shops with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has joined the Argos interior chain in hundreds of shops and introduced several Habitat stores, since they bought up both chains two years ago. Sainsbury's claims this has increased the food hall and thus prevented the purchase.
The store's previous attempt to renew beauty and pharmacy divisions was not a success.
Sainsbury's collaboration with Boots early in the 2000s, but this ended when the parties did not agree on how to share the profits from the pharmacy in the shops.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's rare pharmaceutical chain Celesio, which had 281 pharmacies and owned Lloyd's pharmaceutical chain, for £125 million three years ago.
They let Lloyds still have a role to play and will offer an extended range of skin products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, commented: "We have changed how the beauty hats look and experience to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also added colleagues with special competence to offer beauty services.
Our trademarks are designed to suit all needs, while the attractive environment and practical locations mean that we are now an attractive destination of beauty that challenges the old way of action.»
Peter Jones' "breathing" after Holly Willoughby moved away from appointment worth £11 million
The star from the Dragon's TV program, Peter Jones, is "racing" after the TV host Holly Willoughby withdrew from an agreement with the life mark of his worth £11 million to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time to promote their interior and accessories True.
The couple's cooperation has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The host from this Morning program, 37, was notified to Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has left the star from the Dragons Den, Peter Jones, in the middle of the development of the new cooperation they claim to be a lifestyle brand to focus on their own contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The source reports that Jones was "slow" when the Golden Holly attended a busy meeting on Tuesday in the headquarters of Jones' business in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that Holly's new contracts -- worth up to £1.5 million -- mean that she no longer has time to cooperate on the interior and accessories brand True.
The cooperation has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was supposed to double Willoughby's estimated fortune of £11 million.
Willoughby, 37, used Instagram to inform her not to work with True, while Jones hid Britain to rest in one of her holiday homes.
One source said, "Truly was absolutely at the top of Holly's priorities.
It would be her long-term plan for the future and would last for many decades.
Her decision to withdraw has surprised all the involved.
No one crossed his own ears on Tuesday, Truely was so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse in Marlow filled with goods ready for sale.»
Experts believe that the fate of this Morning host, which is one of the richest stars in the United Kingdom, can cost the company millions because of the rapid investment in the product, from putters to stearin light to clothing and interior, and can cause delays in the launch.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, who is the mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, has our close friends of Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby created the brand True together with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as the chairman of the board in March.
Couples holiday together and Jones own 40 percent of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will be M&S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin who will host his ITV program I'm A Celebrity.
A source near Jones said last night, "We're not commenting on his business."
Mute calls "and so we love ourselves"
He paid for the criticism he came to get from the media to make a comment some people could experience as "unprecious" and to be so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
said Trump with his Customs Voice as "Newheite Speaker".
"I haven't given up anything."
He commented that Kim was interested in a new meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June, which Trump called a major step towards the disarmament of the nuclear programme in North Korea.
But the negotiations on the nuclear programme have stopped.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, the North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders of the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea has not received a "comparable response" from the United States regarding the early disarmament of North Korea.
Instead, he added, continued the US with sanctions to press North Korea.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech.
"It's going great between us and North Korea," he said.
"We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have a nice relationship."
He added that his work to improve his relationship with Kim has brought positive results - the end of rocket testing, help in the release of hostages and the return of the lives of American soldiers.
He defended his unusual procedure when dealing with Kim.
"It's so easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get in there, we had about 200 people standing right there," said Trump and the group pointed out to him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroy and kill hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake, foreign aid organisations were informed that they did not need them.
Although more than 10 per cent of the inhabitants of Lombok had to flee, none of them declared a national crisis situation, which is necessary for international emergency assistance.
“Unfortunately, they have in many cases been very clear that they do not want international assistance, so it is a little challenging,” said Sumbang.
While the Red Children set up a team to travel to Palu, it is still not safe to add foreign passports to the field.
Sutopo, spokesperson for Indonesia’s National Crisis Agency, said that the authorities are assessing the situation in Palu in order to see if international organisations are allowed to provide emergency assistance.
Although Indonesia is often exposed to earthquakes, the country is not particularly prepared for the natural forces.
In the Aceh area, they have built the escape rooms for tsunamis, but they are not common in the rest of the country.
Despite warnings against tsunamis in Palu, there was no alarm, which most likely led to several victims.
Traveling between Indonesian eyes is usually quite challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that landed in Lombuk to treat those who were damaged in the earthquake is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the place of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo focused on improving Indonesia's infrastructure during the presidential election, and has spent a lot of money on new roads and railways.
But lack of funding has made it difficult for the administration of President Joko, and next year there is another choice.
President Joko is also being pressurized when it comes to sectarian tensions in Indonesia, while members of the Muslim majority have taken a good look at his conservative threat.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to flee when Christians and Muslims were fighting in the streets and used machetes, arrows and bows, and other primitive weapons.

Parliament status of Cromwell becomes the last victim of the «rewrite of history»
The removal of the statue would be karma for Cromwell and the Taliban-like destruction of several cultural and religious objects in England that his Puritan followers did during the civil war in the 1600s.
But the Cromwell-affiliated Crick describes his proposal to remove the statue as “dress” and “an attempt to write about history.”
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Association, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of the statues, that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace would become a goal.
The iconic class during the English Civil War was ordered or executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the actions of his forefather, Thomas, centuries before.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's outstanding representation of Cromwell is evidence of public opinion in the 1800s, and is part of the history of a figure that many still think is worth celebrating."
Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was in the 1800s, and is still today, seen as a defender of Parliament against external pressure, and in his case it was, of course, against the monarchy.
Whether this representation is correct or one is still a topic of discussion in historical debate.
What's certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 1600s has shaped the development of our nation, and Cromwell was an individual that we know represented one side of it.
What he achieved as Lord Protector is also worth celebrating and remembering."
Murdered and killed Chinese peasant
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwestern China, following local media reports.
The man, named Yuan, was found dead, with cut pulses and cover with blood, close to a pig belt on the market in Liupanshui in the Guizhou province, reported South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig bunny prepares to give pigs vaccines on a garden on May 30, 2005, in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He had recently traveled with his fat from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning he found his fat dead, and discovered that the door to one of the pigs' bungalows was open.
He said there was a big goose in the leg with blood around his mouth.
The autopsy showed that a 250 kilos of fat had killed the farmer, according to the report.
"The bones to my fat were bloody and ruined," said the fat, named Wu, to Guiyang Evening News.
The surveillance camera shows that Yuan came to the market at 4:40 p.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed him didn't listen to Yuan or his fat.
The market leader told Evening News that the pig had been locked in to prevent him from attacking others, while the police gathered evidence on the east.
Yuan's family is now negotiating compensation with the market leader.
Although rare, such attacks from pigs have already occurred.
In 2016 a pig went to attack a woman and her husband in Massachusetts, and caused serious damage to the man.
Ten years earlier, a 295 kilos [295 kg] of pig caught a Welsh farmer between himself and a tractor, until his wife frightened the pig away.
After a farmer in Oregon became the food of his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba to CBC News reported that pigs are not aggressive to normal, but that the taste of blood can affect animals.
«Dei will only play.
They like to bite a bit, they're curious... they won't hurt you.
You just have to have enough respect for them," he said.
The rest of the hurricane, Rosa, brings rain to the southwest of the United States
As we saw in the weather message, the hurricane Rosa weakens over the cool water along the northern coast of Mexico.
Nevertheless, Rosa will bear the rain for North Mexico and South West America in the next few days.
Rosa had wind power up to 136 km/h and was a category 1 hurricane until 05:00 in the eastern time zone of the United States on Sunday, and the hurricane center was 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa will move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, there is a low pressure across the Pacific that moves east towards the west coast of the United States. Rosa is approaching Baja California peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, and will move tropical humidity north to southwestern USA.
Rosa will bring up to 25 centimeters of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
The tropical wetlands will react with low pressure and cause heavy rain in the southwest in the next few days.
Locally, between 3 and 10 centimeters of rain can create dangerous rivers and possible desert landslides.
Tropical humidity will result in rain between 5 and 7 centimeters per hour in some parts of the southwest US, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Between 5 and 10 centimeters of rain are expected in parts of southwestern USA; especially over large parts of Arizona.
Hazardous fluams can occur due to widespread terrain and tropical rain.
The danger of tropical rain is being warned against tourists in the desert.
The rain can turn the flames into flaming eons and lightning and tornadoes will bring strong wind and dust.
The coming low pressure will also bring rain to parts of the coast of southern California.
Total rainfall of more than 1 centimeters is possible, something that can create small flumes and smooth roads.
This will be the first rain village for the season in the region.
Spreaded tropical rainy towns will start in Arizona late Sunday evening and early Monday morning, before the rain rises late on Monday and Tuesday.
The Four Corners region can expect a lot of rain on Tuesday and Wednesday.
October can witness intense temperature fluctuations throughout the United States as the Arctic becomes colder, but tropical stretches will still be quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic differences in temperatures, even between small areas.
Sunday was an example of dramatic temperature differences in central parts of the United States.
There is almost 20 degrees temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the late summer heat will try to build up and spread again.
Many of the Central and Eastern USA are expected to experience a hot start in October, with 25 degrees and above from the southern part of the large plains to parts of the North-East USA.
New York City can reach 25 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above average.
The long-term warning indicates that there are high odds of above average temperatures in the East-U.S. during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people look at Brett Kavanaugh hearing
On Thursday, more than 20 million people saw the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh in the U.S. Supreme Court and woman who blamed him for sexual assault in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six different TV channels.
At the same time, the political debate on the issue was held, with interruptions in the usual TV programmes of various broadcasters to reveal the latest news on Friday: a consensus reached by Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake that the FBI should investigate the debts during the next week.
Ford told the Supreme Court Committee that she was 100% sure that Kavanaugh felt her when she was full and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said, during a sensitive hearing, that he's 100 percent sure it's not her.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people saw the hearing on Friday, followed the Nielsen.
The company came to this number by finding the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News and MSNBC.
Speech was not possible from other channels that showed the audience, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also has trouble counting the viewers from the office.
To put this into perspective, there's a similar number of viewers looking at an American football final or the Oscar division.
Fox News its hosts have supported Kavanaugh, and the channel was also it with most lakes during the day with 5.69 million lakes, Nielsen said.
ABC was in second place 3.26 million sailors.
CBS had 3.1 million lakes, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
People are still interested after the call.
Flake was in focus during the drama on Friday.
After Flake, who is a moderate Republican, declared that he is on Kavanaugh's side, he was the film of CNN and CBS while Protestants called after him on his way to a hearing with a courtroom on Friday.
He stood and looked in the ground for several minutes while the Protestants stared at him on CNN's life.
"I'm right here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he will tell the truth to our land?"
Some said to him, "You have power, while so many women are powerless."
Flake said that his office had spoken, and before he entered the elevator he said he would have more to say during the committee hearing.
The broadcasting agency showed the call on TV when the court panel had to vote for or against the nomination of Kavanaugh for full late and further speaking.
But Flake said he could only do it if the FBI investigated the claims against Kavanaugh during the next week, something that the Democrats have also asked for.
Flake was partly overwhelmed after talking to his friend, the democrat and Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several other senators afterwards, Flake made a decision.
Flake said that he was determined to have power, because it became clear that the Republicans could not resolve for Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation of complaints against Kavanaugh.
Theresa May's debt criticises for playing politics when Brexit is involved
The British Minister of State Theresa May owes the critics of her plans to leave the EU to "balance politics" with the future of the United Kingdom, regardless of national interests, in an interview with the newspaper The Sunday Times.
Theresa May is in Birmingham, England, to participate in the Conservative Party's conference on 29 September 2018.
Alongside the May interview ahead of Sunday Times, an interview with former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson is taking place on the so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and says that the proposal that Britain and the EU should collect their fees is "very absurd".
Wayde Sims shooting in the United States: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson for Sims shooting
Police arrested a man suspected of the fatal shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from Louisiana State University (LSU), was killed.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, is arrested and imprisoned for deliberate murder, says Baton Rouge, Louisiana police.
An official video shows the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said Sims lost his glasses during the battle.
The police found the glasses on the outside and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, following a report from the WAFB channel, which is linked to CBS.
After hearing from Simpson, the police said he confessed to having a shot at Wayde.
Simpson's bail was set to $350 000, reports local opinion The Advocate.
The coroner of the East Baton Rouge published an early autopsy report on Friday that showed that the cause of death was a bullet in the head that went into the neck.
The Baton Rouge police thank the state police in Louisiana for their special forces, the state police their crime lab, the police at Southern University and local residents to help them find Simpson.
The Athletic Director of LSU, Joe Alleva, thanked the local police for being ‘vigilant in the pursuit of justice’.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2 meter high basketball player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
On average he scored 5.6 points with 2.6 backs per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said that the team was “silenceless” after Wayde was killed.
"That's something we're always afraid of," Wade said.
Volcanic ash over Mexico City
Oske from the Volcano Popocatepetl has reached southern parts of Mexico’s capital.
The National Centre for Crisis Prevention requests Mexicans to stay away from the volcano on Sunday after the activity increased in the crater and centre recorded 183 gas and oske emissions over 24 hours.
The center had observed several rumblings and tremors.
Pictures on social media show thin layers of oak on cars in different neighborhoods in Mexico City, including Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted an increase in activity in the volcano, which is 72 kilometres south-east of the capital, since an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.1 occurring central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano is known as Don Goyo and has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the riot of self-restraint
Six demonstrators were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protestors of self-defence with police forces, and thousands of other demonstrators protested against self-defence one year after the resolution on possible release from Spain.
A group of masked separatists were held back by police forces while throwing eggs and powder lacquered that created dark clouds of dust in streets that are usually filled with tourists.
The crash also broke out later on the day, and the police used batons to prevent escalation.
For several hours, the separatists called out "Don't forget, don't forgive" while the Protestants called out against themselves, "Long live Spain."
Local news channels reported that fourteen people were treated for minor damage after the protests.
The vote is still under pressure in the region and many will still have their own year after the 1st October resolution, which was called illegal by Madrid but which was celebrated by separatists in Catalonia.
Most voters voted for themselves, but there was also low electoral participation among those against self-reliance and boycott.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured yesterday after the police tried to prevent the riot and electorate clashes in the region.
Groups that were too self-dwelling in tents on Friday to prevent demonstrations in support of the State police.
The demonstration, however, went off the stack, but it was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who took part in separatist protests with his wife, said he no longer had hope of being in Catalonia.
"Yesterday we experienced one of our moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy to be able to speak for themselves, but now let us fast again," he said.
Although they won the regional elections before December, the Catalan parties who are too proud to hold power this year, while many of their leaders are in exile or arrest while waiting for legal cases for their role in the organization of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of their stand.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed the protests in support of the police on her phone, said the conflict was home to politicians on both sides.
“The tension is increasing more and more,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who had been part of the ongoing case-laws last year, declared that he was to hold elections in the European Parliament next year.
"To remain a candidate in the European elections is the best way to condemn the decline of democratic values and the oppression we have experienced from the Spanish state," he said.

Menga-Schot gives Livingston 1-0 matches over Rangers in Scottish football
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston's security says
The rioted Livingston surprises Rangers and Steven Gerard with his second saying after 18 matches as coaches for the Ibrox Club in Glasgow.
Dolly Menga's shot proved to make the difference while Gary Holt said side joined with the hibernian in others.
Gerrard's side has no winner in the Scottish Premiership League this season, and shall play against Hearts, as they lay eight points behind, next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers will be hosting Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Livingston has six wins in a row, and Chief Coach Holt still hasn't lost since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingstone loses chances of being removed
Hold his team would have rented long before they scored, and created more problems for Rangers with the direct play says.
Scott Robinson broke through, but had a low effort towards goal, something that made Alan Lithgow have to work hard after meeting with Craig Halkett his heading over the goal.
The home team was eager to let Rangers play ahead of them, well aware that they could create trouble for the distance.
And that's how the decisive goal was scored.
Rangers went to a fresh park and Livingston made an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson went against Menga, who took a touch and score from the middle of the penal field.
Before that, Ranger's ball dominated, but he saw that the home defence was solid and the Keeper Liam Kelly was focused.
This pattern continued into the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to save a target.
Scott Pittman tried to score, but was stopped by Rangers' Keeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow squeaked far after the ball was returned from Livingston.
The suits were sent forward and back to the Livingston-penalty field, while two sentences--after Halkett's challenge to Glenn Middleton, and one for hands--were blown away.
Livingston's Phenomenal Analysis
BBC Scotland without Alasdair Lamont and Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal fight and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
Each player played fantastically and still impresses the curve up.
The player style theirs has hardly changed since they returned to the top class, but much of the thank you for going to Holt for the way he looked at the team since he became a coach.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was intense, and organized a defense at military level, while Menga distracted Connor Goldson and Joe Worall throughout the fight.
The ranges were, in contrast, not motivated.
Yet as good as they have been under Gerrard, they were still not good enough this time.
They didn't play well enough, and cut up only half of the house once, something that should get Rangers to realize they don't get up anymore.
Erdogan gets mixed welcome in Cologne
The leaders of Turkey and Germany smiled under the blue sky when they met to eat breakfast on Saturday, September 29, Berlin.
It is the last day of Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which is hoped to repair relations between the two NATO countries.
The countries have been divided when it comes to human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's role in the EU.
Erdogan went to Cologne to open a big new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police prevented a population of over 25 000 from gathering in front of the mosque because of ‘security reasons’, but many of Erdogan’s supporters met to see their president.
Hundreds of Protestants against Erdogan - many of the Kurdish - also met up to condemn Erdogan's policy and the German state decided to welcome him into the country.
The duplicating Protestants reflected the distinction between German Turks, who looked at Erdogan as a whole, and others, who looked at him as an autocrat.
Car accident in Deptford, London: cyclist died after collision with car
A cyclist has lost his life in a collision with a London car.
The collision was near the intersection at Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a road in Deptford in southeastern London, at 10:15 local time.

The collision took her only a few months after another cyclist died when the driver left in Childers Street, about 1.6 kilometers from today's accident.
The London police reported that they were about to identify the man and inform his family.
Roads have been closed and buses have to run around the area, while other drivers have been invited to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison in England: Six Watches Damage in Rebellion
Six prison guards have been injured in a riot in a high-security prison for men, says the prison office in England.
The current storm broke out in the HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire around 09:30 local time on Sunday.
Special Tornado forces are collected to calm down the riot, involving eight prisoners in a separate part of the prison.
The guards have been treated for minor damage to the face.
One prisoner said: "Special interest guards must calm down the ongoing rebellion in the HMP Long Lartin.
Six guards have been treated for damage.
We do not tolerate the choice in our prisons, and we are ready that those responsible will be reported to the police and may have to sit in prison any longer."
It has more than 500 people in HMP Long Lartin, including some of the most dangerous criminals in Britain.
In June, it was reported that the prison director was treated for damage after a prisoner went into custody.
And in October last year special forces had to come to prison to calm down a serious riot, where prisoners threw billiards on the guards.
Orkanen Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flame (for the benefit of drought)
Tropical low pressure is rare in Arizona, but it is just such a weather phenomenon that is on its way to Arizona early next week, in the rest of the hurricane Rosa moves southwest over the desert and creates fear of flame.
The national weather service has issued warnings against fluam on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and south and east Nevada, southeast California and Utah, including the towns Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to move directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, and can give rain already late Monday.
The national weather service in Phoenix twitter that only "tit tropical cyclones have had tropical storm or low pressure status within 300 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that reached 60 kilometres within the Arizona border.»
The latest models from the National Orcancer Centre report between 5 and 10 centimeters of rain, with isolated quantities up to 15 centimeters in the Mogollon Rim area in Arizona.
It can be calculated between 2 and 5 centimeters in other areas of the South West, including central parts of Rocky Mountains and Great Basin, with isolated total quantities up to 10 centimeters.
For areas outside the risk of flame, the Rosa can be a blessing in the dry.
Although fluam is a serious concern, this will probably be estimated to be a small area in the South-West USA that is exposed to drought.
According to dry monitors in the United States, extreme drought is more than 40 percent of Arizona, which is the next highest dry category, reports weather.com.
First comes the hurricane Rosa to move across the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
With a wind of over 135 kilometers an hour, Rosa is on Sunday morning 619 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moves north at a speed of 20 miles an hour.
The storm meets colder water in the Pacific and is worried about it.
It is expected to reach the coast of Mexico with tropical storm strength, Monday afternoon or evening.
There's going to be a lot of calculation in parts of Mexico, something that can increase the risk of flame.
«The line between 7 and 15 centimeters is expected from Baja California to North-West Sonora, with the possibility of up to 25 centimeters," weather.com reported.
Rosa will pull north along Mexico as a tropical storm before she reaches the border of Arizona early Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure, which will pull up through Arizona and into the south-Utah Tuesday evening.
‘The greatest danger to Rosa or the rest of this is heavy rain in Baja California, North West Sonora, and the American South West Dark,’ said the National Orcancer Centre.
This figure is expected to create life-threatening rivers in the desert and landscapes in the mountain area.
Action in Midsomer Norton, England: Four arrested for attempted murder

Trump says Kavanaugh "Member" while the "bad and bad" Democrats were against him
"A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the graceful and unreasonable tactics of the Democrats," Trump said during a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had ‘members’ during which ‘bad and sin’ Democrats were through the nomination process.
Kavanaugh gave a witness in front of the convention on Thursday, and emotionally refused to blame Christine Blasey Ford for sexually assaulting her several decades ago, when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified about her debts during the ring.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people had seen how brilliant and courageous" Kavanaugh was that day.
"A voice to Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to one of the most powerful lawyers in our time, a lawyer with free service in public," he said to a number of followers in West Virginia.
The president also referred to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke about how important it is for Republicans to vote in the US elections.
"Five weeks to one of the most important choices in our lives.
I don't stop, but I really do," he said.
‘That’s why I travel around to fight for good candidates.’
Trump argued that the Democrats are out after "resisting and blocking."
The first important resolution of the Senate on the nomination of Kavanaugh is expected to take place on Friday at the latest, a Republican representative told CNN.
Hundred killed in earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, speaking of killed acres
At least 384 people have been killed, many of them taken by huge waves on the beaches, while a strong earthquake and a tsunami frame the Indonesian island of Sulawesi reported authorities on Sunday.
Hundreds of people were gathered to participate in a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when the waves, which were six meters high, hit the beach at sunset, and took many people while they destroyed everything they came over.
The tsunami came after an earthquake of 7.5.
“When the warning of tsunami came yesterday, there were still people on the beach who did not move at once and who were killed,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesperson for the Indonesia BNPB crisis relief agency, Jakarta said.
‘As if the tsunami was not enough in itself, he took with him cars, trets, houses; he framed everything on land,’ Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had travelled over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
Some climb up into trees to avoid tsunamis and survive in that way.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Photos from the air published by the crisis agency show many ruined buildings and shops, distorted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershock continued to hit the coastal town on Saturday.
Earthquake could be seen in the area around, with a population of 2.4 million.
Indonesia’s technology testing and testing agency (BPPT) said that the energy from the earthquake on Friday was about 200 times greater than the energy from the nuclear bomb over Hiroshima during the Second World War.
The geography of the city, located at the end of a long narrow wave, may have increased the size of the tsunami, the agency said.
Nugroho described the damage as «wide» and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels have collapsed.
The bodies of the deceased have been found under the rest of the collapse buildings, he said, and added that 540 people were injured and that 29 were still missing.
Nugroho said that the number of deaths and the size of the destructions could be greater along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Dongala, which is more episthetic to the scar.
"We haven't heard anything from Dongala, communication is cut," Nugroho said.
‘More than 300,000 people live there,’ the Red Cross said, adding and volunteering is on their way to the random areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it may get much worse," said the Red Cross.
On Saturday, the crisis agency was criticised for not informing us that a tsunami had hit Palu, even though the authorities said waves had arrived before the time that was announced.
An amateur video shared on social media shows a man in the upper floor of a building calling desperate to man down in the streets to warn them against the coming wave.
A few minutes later, a wall of water hits the coast, and it includes buildings and cars.
Reuters could not verify the video first.
The storm and tsunami caused a power break and cut off the communication around Palu, which made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate emergency assistance.
The military has launched the process of sending cargo aircraft from Jakarta and other towns, reports the authorities, but the refugees still need food and have other basic needs.
The airport in the city was reopened to receive emergency aid, but will continue to be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The number of deaths in Indonesia exceeds 800.
It's very bad.
The additions in World Vision from Donganga have arrived safely to Palu City, and have set up count in the backyard of his office. On the way to the city, the total damaged areas passed," Dosebah said.
“They said they saw many destroyed houses,” he said.
It's very bad.
While emergency relief organisations are starting their work to help those affected by tsunamis, some complain that foreign emergency relief workers with crisis management expertise have been denied entry to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, foreign aid organisations cannot and will not be able to start work until Indonesia has declared the area to be a national crisis zone.
It has not yet occurred.
"There is a crisis at provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, a speaker for the Red Cross in Indonesia.
‘When the state says ‘OK, this is a national crisis,’ we can open up for international aid, but they haven’t updated the status yet.’
There is still evening in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, and friends and family of those who are still lacking hope for a miracle, but knows that such natural disasters do not end well.
On Saturday a little boy was saved from the clock.
On Sunday a woman was rescued from the rest of a collapsing building, where she had been caught by the dead mother for two days.
Gendon Subandano, coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, thirty-two of the missing paragliders from the Asian games that were ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
One man called Monday said that some of those who were trapped in the Roa Roa hotel were his students.
“As one with a lot of experience in paragliding, I have an emotional burden to look at,” he said.
Gendon said he desperately sent whatsApp messages to the paragliders from Palu, who had participated in the local beach festival, after he heard that the Roa Roa hotel had collapsed.
But his messages showed only one grey hook, instead of two blue hooks.
"I think this means that the messages did not come forward," he said.
Thieves set $26,750 from a minibank in Newport, Levee, USA
On Friday he stole $26,750 from a employee in Brink's company in which he was about to fill up a minibank in Newport, Levee, USA, followed a press release from the Newport police.
The employee had just emptied a minibank in the maintenance area and was about to deliver more money, said Detective Dennis McCarthy in the press release.
While the worker was busy, "man up behind the worker" and stole a bag of money to deliver.
The Witnesses observed several suspects as they escaped from the distance, followed the press release, but the police could not determine the number of persons involved in the raid.
If anyone has information about who was involved, they should call the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The Rapper renames to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes names - to Ye.
He declared the name change on Twitter on Saturday, and wrote: "The creation was previously known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has had Ye as a nickname for a while, and used the name as the title of his eighth album, which he released in June.
The name change came just before he was to perform on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new Yandhi album.
He replaces the singer Ariana Grande on the show after she cancels because of "emotional reasons," said the program host.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current artist name, West has previously stated that the word has a religious meaning for him.
“I believe the word ‘yes’ is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you,’” said West earlier this year when he discussed the album title with the radio host Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am us, it is us.
The name has changed from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye-- to reflect what we do, what we do bad, our confusion, everything.
The album reflects on who we are."
Kanye is one of several famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs was formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or Diddy, but this year he declared that he preferred the name Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has previously collaborated with West, has also changed the writing style of the name with and without strings and large letters.
Mexico's future president promises not to send the military against civilians
The future president of Mexico, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has promised never to send military forces against civilians. The country will soon mark the 50th anniversary of the bloody treatment of students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would "never use the military to oppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the military shot at peaceful demonstrators and killed about 300 people, at a time when left-wing student movements spread in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly support to students and opening several free universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of access to education have led young people to join criminal gangs.
The United States should double investment in artificial intelligence
Since China works more actively with artificial intelligence, the US should double its investments in research on the subject, says the investor and user of artificial intelligence, Kai-Fu Lee, who works for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
His comments came after various parts of the U.S. government spoke of artificial intelligence, even though the United States lacked a formal strategy for the use of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan yesterday, aiming to be number 1 in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
"A doubling of the research budget on artificial intelligence would be a good start, since all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we are looking forward to the next breakthrough in artificial intelligence," Lee said.
A double in funding can double the chances that the next major breakthrough in artificial intelligence will happen in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, who published the book ‘AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order’ this month via the Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the Managing Director (CEO) of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the largest companies of artificial intelligence in China, Face++.
In the 1980s he worked at Carnegie Mellon University with a system of artificial intelligence that hit the highest ranking player of the game Othello, and later he worked as a leader in Microsoft Research and was president of Google in China.
Lee recognised earlier technology competitions organised by the US state, such as "Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge", and asked when the next competition would be, so that he would be with and identify the next visionaries.
Researchers in the United States usually have to work hard to get support from the state, Lee said.
"It's not China that takes the academic leaders, it's the big companies," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired well-known university students to work with artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy can also help the United States strengthen researchers in artificial intelligence.
“I think that doctoral students should receive automatic maintenance permits before artificial intelligence,” he said.
The Council of State of China published its plan for the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
China’s National Association of Natural Sciences funds students at academic institutions, not unlike the American National Science Association and other state organisations’ way of distributing money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a joint centre of artificial intelligence, which is intended to involve partners from industry and academies, and the White House declared the formation of a committee of artificial intelligence.
This month DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI (artificial intelligence) Next.
The National Science Association invests more than $100 million a year in research on artificial intelligence.
At the same time, no one has worked on legislative proposals on national security and artificial intelligence for several months.
Make-up calls to change the name of the country
The Macedonian people rose on Sunday in a People's Discourse whether they should change their names to the Republic of North Macedonia to resolve a ten-year-old conflict with Greece, which has tried to prevent Macedonia from becoming a member of the EU and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, insists that the name of the neighbouring north represents a requirement on their territory and has used veto to vote against Macedonia's membership in NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the new name proposed, but nationalist opponents argue that the name exchange can undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of the Macedonian population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he will not vote in public opinion, and a boycott has questioned how much public opinion comes to reach at least 50 percent of the population it needs to be valid.
The question of the People's Disposal is: "Are you for NATO and EU membership and as agreed in the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters for the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price of the name change is worth EU and NATO membership.
"I am here today to resolve for the future of this country, for the young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the EU, because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the vote is not binding in accordance with the law, a sufficient number of Members of Parliament have said that they will follow the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
In order to change the name, Parliament needs two-thirds of its membership.
The State Electoral Committee reported that nothing unusual had happened before 13:00.
Only 16 per cent had voted, in contrast to 34 per cent in previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 of all registered voters voted.
‘I raise my children, we belong to Europe,’ said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
The Minister of State of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko rose in Strumika in the Macedonian People's Discourse to change their names and open to join NATO and the EU on 30 September 2018.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, organized a boycott of public opinion in front of Parliament in Skopje by setting up tents and chairs.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we are not to change the name of our country," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want us under the name of Macedonia, we can go to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of the Eurasian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev has stated that NATO membership will attract investors to Macedonia, which has more than 20 per cent of jobs.
"I believe that the majority will resolve for the change, of your 80 percent of our citizens will become members of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after the vote.
He said that a Yes result can be interpreted as a "confirmation of our future."
A survey of Macedonia's Institute for Policy Research last Monday showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters are coming to participate in popular opinion – something below the required number.
Another opinion measurement of the Telma TV channel in Macedonia showed that 57 percent of voters plan to vote on Sunday.
Of these, the channel said 70 percent came to solve yes.
In order to close the public debate, at least 50 percent of the volume, plus one of the volume.
If public opinion is not closed, it may damage the policy of the left-wing government that took over in May.
See: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero navigates through Brighton defense and scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke the Brighton defense that led to a 2-0 victory for Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculous when he scored for 65 minutes.
The Argentine eater received a fit on the central track at the beginning of the sequence.
He drove past three Brighton defenders and reached open ground.
Suddenly, Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He came around one defender, before he ran past several others on the edge of Brighton's penal field.
He got past a fit on the left and found Sterling.
The English spice used its first kick in the field to give the ball back to Aguero, who used right foot to hit the Brighton Keeper Mathew Ryan with a shot straight into the right end of the target.
“Aguero still wears his feet,” said City coach Pep Guardiola to reporters.
«We talked about how he could play 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored when he did."
But it was Sterling who gave the sky blue the first advantage of the Premier League.
That target came in the 29th minute.
Yesterday, the ball was taken deep into the Brighton Territory.
He fired the ball in a beautiful way along the left end of the path to Leroy Sane.
Sane was holding the ball while he was renting Sterling against the target.
The sky blue eater kicked the ball into the target right before it splits out of the path.
City will play against Hoffenheim in the Champions League Group phase at 12:55 on Tuesday in Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer will play spoilers against Rockies in American baseball
With Nationals removed from Playoff Containment, there was little reason to force a new start.
Scherzer has a high competitive instinct, and hopes to take the coin on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if it can lead to a playoff for Rockies, who runs a game over Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
Rockies water at least 5-2 against the National Friday night, but looks forward to locking the first division title.
“Even if we don’t play for anything, it’s worth playing because of the atmosphere here in Denver, with the audience and the other team that’s most likely playing at the highest level so far this year.
Who does not want to play with such conditions?"
It is still uncertain who will start in the Nationals on Sunday, but it may be Scherzer to "pitche".
Scherzer, which in this case starts for 34th time, throws a "bullpen session" on Thursday and normally "pitche" on Sunday.
Scherzer, from Washington, is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump collects voters in West Virginia
The president briefly referred to his first election for the Right, Brett Kavanaugh, while he spoke about how important it was for the Republicans to vote in the US interim elections.
«All we have done is so far at stake in November.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lives.
This is one of the big, big -- I don't stand, but I'm running around to fight for the best candidates," he said.
Trump went on, "You can see this horrible, horrible group of democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they're too high that they're absolutely going to take back power, you see how bad they are, how ugly they are.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to run to take power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we don't give it to them."
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to "oppose and block."
“And you can see it based on the last four days,” he said, and he called the Democrats “sin and bad and dirty and dishonest.”
He referred to Senator and Democrat Diane Feinstein, who had his audience bow.
"Do you remember her answer?
Were you the one who played the paper?
Uh, uh, what?
No, no, I'm waiting--it was really bad body language--the worst body language I've ever seen."
Work is no longer tolerated.
They're intolerant to those who say what they say.
When the Momentum activists in my local party blew up to sensory me, it wasn't surprising.
I'm the last one in a series of Labour MPs who have been told that I'm not welcome - just to tell you what I mean.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated in the same way because she protested against antisemitism.
In my case, I was criticized for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
When it came to how important it was to drive responsible economies, national security, Europe, and other similar themes that Jeremy ironically probably disagreeed with previous leaders.
At the meeting in Nottingham East Labour on Friday, it said "we want to meet to be inclusive and productive."
In the last eight years my Labour MP has had Friday meetings just like that.
Unfortunately, today's meeting was not like this, and the promise of a smarter policy has been forgotten for the longest time, if it was followed at all.
It has become more and more evident that different views are not tolerated in Labour, and that each sentence is condemned by the leaders of the party.
This happened shortly after Jeremy became a shareholder, when colleagues I used to be politically agreed with suddenly expecting me to change my mind and agree on matters I would never agree with - whether it was national security or the internal market in the European Union.
When I speak publicly, there is nothing to say about what I say, I always get concerned about social media and people who want me to leave while they criticise central politics and say that I shouldn't be a member of the Labour Party.
And that's not just my experience.
I know that I am happier than some of my colleagues because the comments against me are at least political.
I admire my colleagues, who get the sex discrimination and racist psychos to face themselves every day, who are still professional and not going away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this period of time is how normalised it has become to worry politicians.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should become more tolerant.
In fact, we are no longer a tolerant party that has something for everyone. For each proposal of mistrust and for each change in the divide rules, the party becomes smaller and smaller.
I've received a lot of advice over the last two years from people who have said I have to take it easy and not be so loud, so maybe people will "just like me better."
But that's not why I chose to join politics.
When I joined Labour, when I was still going to school 32 years ago, it was because I was mad at Thatcher and how the government failed the country.
I have never hidden my political opinions, nor in previous elections.
No one in Nottingham East can be in doubt about what I stand for and which of the current leaders I don't agree with.
To those who voted in favour of the Friday proposal, I can only say that when the country faces a Brexit that will harm private, local and public services, I do not understand why people care to waste energy to ask questions about my loyalty to the Labour Party.
But in fact, I'm not the only message I've got to go to Nottingham Momentum, but to the voters in the election, whether they're Labour electors or not: I'm proud to serve dives, and I promise that no one can get me to go off or change my policy and prevent me from doing dives in the way I think is best for everyone.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unbeatable Ayr goes to top in Scottish rugby
Two of his "tries" may change the result a bit, but there is no doubt that Ayr earned to win in this very entertaining Tennant's Premiership campaign today.
They are now at the top of the pole as the only invincible layer of all ten.
It was their sovereign defense and ability to take chances that gave home team and coach their, Peter Murchie, good reason to be naked.
"We have been tested in the last campaigns, and we are still invincible, so I must be naked," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "Why do you make a lot of noise? They were smarter than us to take a chance."
Grant Anderson had a "try" for 14 minutes, where Frazier Climo tried a "conversion", which put Ayr in front, but a yellow card from Captain Rory Hughes of Scotland from Warriors Lot Melrose gathered, and Jason Baggot took a "unconverted try."
Climo got a penalty right before the break, he scored and converted a solo try to give Ayr 17-5 before the break.
But Melrose started the other half well and Patrick Anderson's "try," which became "converted" by Baggot, reduced the spinning moon by five points.
There was a long break when Ruarid Knott was seriously injured and put on bars, and from the restart fake Ayr forward through a "try" from Stafford McDowall, such as Climo "converted".
The acting captain of Ayr, Blair MacPherson, got a yellow card, and again Melrose tried a "unconverted Bruce Colvine try," at the end of a series of aggressive games.
The home team played back, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card to deal with the climate without the ball from the penal configuration, score MacPherson a «try».
Climate 'converted' again after Kyle Rowe took David Armstrong's box kick and sent Gregor Henry away from home team his fifth 'tri.'

«The sea is ours»: Bolivia hopes that the right will open the waterway to the Pacific
Sailors patrol marine headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings flags with sea blue flags.
Marine bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazonaselva are covered with the motto: "The sea is ours. We are right
and the obligation to return to it.»
In the landlocked Bolivia, the people can still remember a coastal line lost to Chile, in a bloody conflict over resources in the 1800s.
These hopes may be stronger than in many decades, while Bolivia awaits the judgment of the International Court of Justice to come on 1 October after five years with a district.
"Bolivia has drive, peace of mind and unity, and of course expects a positive result," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians come to look at the verdict of the International Court of Justice, hoping that the Hague Court supports Bolivia's claim, and that, after ten years of negotiations, Chile gives Bolivia a personal exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic native president of Bolivia - who strives to be elected next year - has good reason to hope for a positive result.
“We will soon return to the Pacific,” he promised late in August.
But some analysts don't think the court is coming to let Bolivia have access to the sea - and that a little bit would have changed even if they had access.
The Netherlands-based United Nations Court of Justice has no power to transfer Chilean territory to Bolivia and has stipulated that they will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The ruling of the Court of Justice only six months after the last negotiations indicates that the case was not complicated, said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
For the last four years, they've been far from making Bolivia say they've done it the opposite.
‘The problem of access to the sea has been taken over by the current Bolivian administration,’ said Zárate.
Morales, with his warlike rhetoric, has killed what was that of Chile's goodwill, Zárate meant.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the negotiations at a time, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss the problem after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The former president, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, who is Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's ruling was unusually fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will be given an ‘extraordinary opportunity to open new relations with Chile’ and a chance to ‘set a line at 139 years of disunity and profit both of them’, he said.
Calzadilla also rejected that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, used this maritime problem to win voices.
‘Bolivia will never give up the right of access to the Pacific,’ he added.
‘The judgment is an opportunity to see what we need to do to forget about the progress.’
North Korea says they won't destroy nuclear weapons if they don't trust the U.S.
The North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong Ho, says that his nation cannot be the first to eliminate if they cannot trust Washington.
On Saturday, Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly.
He urged the United States to follow up on their pledges at the Singapore meeting between US and North Korean leaders.
Ri's comments come at a time when the U.S. foreign minister, Mike Pomepo, seems to want to start off with his fixed atomic weapons plomatism, more than three months after the Singapore meeting with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un.
Ri says that the United States has a false hope that North Korea will be subordinated if the United States continues to face sanctions and opposes a possible declaration of the end of the Korean war.
Washington refuses to join any declaration of the end of the war, without Pyongyang canceling first.
Both Kim and the American President, Donald Trump, will hold a new meeting.
But many are critical that Pyongyang is serious when it comes to construction and that the country is most likely to see its weapons as a guarantee of security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump meeting.
Paris shows that massive headlights are the last mote on the way to a handcuff near you
If you want to upgrade your hat collection or block the sun completely, you will no longer need to search.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne have discovered a number of large and special headgears in their SS19 collection.
The highest practical hats can be seen on Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their shocking creations right on the catwalk.
The greatest plague was an overwhelming, beige Valentino hat with a feather-like, brake that covered the models its heads.
There was also another over-dimensional accessories under the moteshwet, including a jewelry vasmelon, a magic hat, and even an pineapple--but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also discovered a collection of spherical masks--just in time before Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had lips that were sewn together and more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One of the creations resemble divers, complete with snorkel and mask, while another looked like a melted ice in the cake.
If you like this huge dramatic motto, you can only look at yourself.
Moteexperts trace that the huge hats come to a room in a handbag near you.
The oversized hats come right after "La Bomba", the straw hat with the 60 cm wide brake that has been seen on knowledge from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the highest unpractice hat, which was everywhere on social media, has now sent a new creation out on the catwalk--a straw beach bag of the same size as the bikini-dressed model that wore her.
Beachesweska, with a color of burn orange and frozen top with a white skin handle, was the most evocative part of Jacquemus's La Riviera SS19 collection under fashioneka in Paris.
Kendis-stylelist Luke Armitage commented to FEMAIL: "I expect to see large hats and beach bags in the mote shops next summer - the designer has made such a big impression that I doubt it's going to ignore the demand for the oversize is right."
John Edward: Global citizens need language skills
Private schools in Scotland are known to be at a high academic level, and this continues in 2018 with excellent results of the exam, which is only strengthened by individual and common success in sport, art, music and other social measures.
With more than 30,000 lifts across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Self-Retirement Schools (SCIS), work to offer the best services to the lifts and their parents.
Self-employed people have the goal of preparing their higher education and higher education, careers and the role of global citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a tailor-made pendulum, we see that modern languages are popular electives in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, the message goes to his head.
If you speak with him in his own language, then the message will go to his own heart."
This is an important reminder that we cannot only rely on English when we want to build relationships and trust in people from other countries.
By looking at the results of this year's exam, we can see that language is at the top of the league tables with the highest standing characters for individual scales.
A total of 68 percent of the lifts that took up the language received A.
The data collected from SCIS' 74 member schools show that 72 per cent of the highs received A in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of those who took German, 69 per cent of those who took French, and 63 per cent of those who took Spanish also received A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support language as vital qualities, which children and young people will absolutely need in the future.
Languages considered optional are equivalent to STEM-faga (science, technology, engineering studies and mathematics) in the mind of self-employed schools and elsewhere.
A study carried out by the British Selection for Additives and Properties in 2014 showed that 17% of employers failed to fill jobs due to lack of language skills among applicants.
For this reason, language in school is increasingly important in order to prepare young people for employment.
With more job opportunities for language experts, these characteristics are essential in a globalised world.
No matter what type of career a young person has, if they have learned another language, they have a good advantage in the future with such a property.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give a multilingual person the benefit of a competitive world.
Following a YouTube survey of more than 4,000 adults in Britain in 2013, 75 percent could not speak any languages other than English well enough to keep a conversation going, and French was the only language that was spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15 percent.
This is why it is so important to invest in language training for our children.
To be able to find more languages, especially languages used in developing countries, can give children a better chance of finding good jobs in the future.
In Scotland, each school is different when it comes to what languages they teach.
Many schools focus on the classic modern languages, while others teach languages that are classified as important in Britain when we look forward to 2020, such as mandarin and Japanese.
No matter what your child is interested in, there will always be a number of languages to choose between in your own schools, and teachers who are specialists in this area.
Scottish self-defense schools are dedicated and want to create a learning environment that will provide children and provide them with the qualities they need to close, no matter what the future holds.
One cannot deny that in this global business-oriented environment, language is vital for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in the education sector.
Modern languages should be called ‘international communication properties’.
Self-employed people will continue to offer this choice, offering diversity and high competence for Scotland's young people.
It's a good thing to do.
John Edward is Director of Scottish Self School Board
LeBron debuts in Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The waiting time is soon for fans who are looking forward to seeing LeBron James debuters at the Los Angeles Lakes basketball.
The Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the concert on Sunday, against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But the length of the game has not yet been determined.
‘It’s going to be more than one minute and less than 49,’ Walton announced on Lakers’s official website.
Lakers reporter, Mike Trudell, tweets that James most likely will play a limited time.
After training this week, James was asked about his plans for Laker's schedule for the pre-season.
"I don't need race games at this stage of my career to get me ready," he said.
Trump West Virginia Rally Time, YouTube
President Donald Trump starts on a whirlwind of campaigns tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's the first of Trump's five planned stops next week, including stopping at friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmatory vote waiting to choose to fill the High Court's vacant position, Trump aims to build support for the forthcoming mid-term elections, as Republicans are in danger of losing control of the Congress when voting is to be given in November.
How long is Trump going to be in West Virginia tonight, and how can you see it online?
Trump's collection in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7:00 p.m. in the evening, Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can see Trump Si West Virginia collection online below, via live stream on YouTube.
Trump will probably record this week's hearings by the Supreme Court-nominated Brett Kavanaugh, who was excited about the debts of sexual abuse, with an expected confirmed vote from the Senate waiting for up to one week while the FBI investigates.
But the primary objective of this gathering cafe is to help Republicans meet November elections and get some time (driving).
So President Trump's campaign says that these five meetings next week are entitled to "oppose volunteers and supporters who the Republicans are trying to protect and extend the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"The control of Congress is so critical to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible when we enter the busy campaign season," says a speaker for the Trump campaign who refuses to be informed to Reuters.
Designed for Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the gathering can bring supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania to cover Pittsburgh media, followed by West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump visited West Virginia, the state he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senator Patrick Morrisey, who has been requested in the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come and try to give him a promise in terms of opinion,” said Simon Haeder, a political researcher at West Virginia University, followed Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows guts for fighting to keep hope alive on the singles on Sunday
After three one-sided sessions Saturday afternoon's foursomes could only be as this Ryder Cup throne.
The swinging pendulum of the moment is a completely invented sport adventure, but one that players really believe, and never more than in competitions like these.
So where would they say the moment is now?
"You had a six-point lease, and now there are four, so we take it as a little moment," said Jordan Spieth as he jumped off for the day.
Europe has, of course, four points leading to 12 more at stake.
The Americans, as Speeth says, know that they have some wind in their sails, and they have much to encourage, not least the shape of Speeth and Justin Thomas who played together all day, and each has three points from four.
Spieth has our mortals from tea to green and rents after example.
The Guttural screams of the fair were higher when his round continued, sought an important spot to take match four all-squao.re when he and Thomas had been two after two.
His putt that won the 15th match, was met with a similar scream, the type that tells you that he thinks the American team isn't out of this.
“You’ve actually just got grave deep and worried about your own fight,” said Spieh.
There are now all of these players left.
18 holes to create a brand.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the invincible story of Ryder Cup.
Europe's remarkable, but sweet couple are four from four and can't do anything wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple not to shoot a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also missed bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine (the last nine holes on a 18-hole track) on Friday morning.
That course, and the way their energy seems to move both to and from this noisy, engaged audience, argues that they are the players to be hit on Sunday, and that there would be no more popular players to seal a potential European saying when the sun goes down over Le Golf National, than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Best both at the same time in different holes.
Talking about European honor is still too early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did short work by Sergio Garcia, the morning's bell when he was paired with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first nine, dug the Spanish and Swedish into a hole they never came close to climbing out.
But on Sunday, there's no one who can help you out of your hole.
The fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to watch closely because of the interaction between opponents, advice they give, and advice they don't give, and the way that a strategy can change on a blind eye.
Europe has played better as a team so far and taking a significant lease in the last day, but this foursome session also showed that Team USA had the guts for the fight that someone, especially Stateside, had doubled.
Europe takes 10-6 rentals in Ryder Cup final
Europe will have a healthy advantage in the last day of Ryder Cup after coming out of Saturday's fourballs and foursome matches with a 10-6 lease across the United States.
Inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two winners over a fighting Tiger Woods to take his fight so far on Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European side offered to keep the trophy lost on Hazeltine two years ago, dominated a wrong American side in the morning fourballs, and took the series 3-1.
The United States provided more resistance in foursomes and won two camps, but they could not get the deficit.
Jim Fury's side needs eight points from the 12 single campaigns on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, called Molliwood after a spectacular weekend, is only the second pair to win four points from their opening in four camps in Ryder Cup history.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed into fourballs, they went out so great to kick off a Woods and American smoke Bryson Dechambeau with an even more after 5 and 4.
Woods, who went through two camps on Saturday, showed sporadic brilliance, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 camps in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who lived for the morning's fourballs, returned to the partners Henrik Stenson in foursomes to a 2 and 1 defeat by Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranked one and three in the world.
Europe did not even get everything they wanted on a nice, breathed day south-west of Paris.
Three times Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas won the reference to the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won a brave 2 & 1 say about Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs and came back later to beat Paulter and Rory McIlroy 4 & 3 in foursomes when they lost the two holes in the opening.
Only two times in Ryder Cup history has a layer come back from a four-point base and entered into a single, even though the holder only needs the Fury side to draw to maintain the trophy.
After having been the next best in two days, it seems like a Sunday attack will be outside them.
North Korea says it's not going to talk down one-way without trust
The Foreign Minister of North Korea told the same nations on Saturday that if sanctions continue to increase the mistrust of the United States and that the country would in no way give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the World Power that North Korea had taken "significant steps" to improve its relationship over the past year, for example, they have stopped nuclear and missile tests, dismantled the nuclear test site and did not promise to distribute nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“We don’t get anything equivalent back from the United States,” he said.
"Without trust in the United States, we will not be confident of our national security, and in such circumstances it is not possible to disarm ourselves alone first."
While Ri, a well-known North Korean, has brought several complaints about Washington's resistance to a phase approach to the elimination of nuclear weapons, where North Korea would be paid to take a gradual step, showed considerable interest in his question by not rejecting unilateral nuclear disarmament, as Pyongyang had done earlier.
Ri referred to a common question published by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a first summit sometime between a seated US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work for "nuclear power building on the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea has wanted a formal end to the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also been opposed to talks to facilitate tough international sanctions in North Korea.
‘The United States insists on ‘nuclear power building first’ and increases the pressure with sanctions to achieve its objective by force, and they even oppose ‘the declaration of peace to end’, said Ri.
"Trust that sanctions can break us, is a false hope among those who are not interested in us.
But the problem is that when sanctions continue, our mistrust will only increase."
Ri said nothing about the plans for a new summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. president highlighted in the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead of holding three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader, Moon Jae-in, over the past five months, he added: "If the party in this call for nuclear disarmament was South Korea, and not the United States, it would not have stopped the construction of the Korean peninsula as it has now done"
Nevertheless, the tone in Ri’s speech was dramaticly different from yesterday, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was not possible to stop North Korean missiles against the American mainland, after the evil president Trump called Kim a rocketman on suicide orders.
Trump, who yesterday threatened to ‘total destruction’ North Korea, praised Kim for his efforts to take steps to disarm, but said that much work still had to be done and that sanctions had to remain in place for North Korea to dissolve its nuclear weapon.
On Wednesday Trump said he had no time frame for this, and said, "If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should pay Pyongyang for the measures taken.
But the United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The sanctions of the Security Council must still be maintained strongly and without fail until we have the complete, final, verified settlement of nuclear weapons."
The Security Council has unanimously increased its sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to channel funds to Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a new summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times already this year, but his last tour did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made, but a few hours later North Korea condemns him to come up with "walking-like demands."
North Korea promised at a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile city and also an atomic complex if the United States did "appropriate action."
He said that Kim had told him that the “representative measures” he was seeking were security guarantees such as Trump promised in Singapore, and stepped against the normalization of Washington's relationship.
Harvard students take a course in getting enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has helped all students get more sleep, in an attempt to fight against the growing macho culture that goes out to study in caffeinerus all night long, which means that one uses caffeine to stay awake all night to study.
One academic found that high school students often lack care when it comes to all the basics - how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed the course, which he believes is the first of his battle in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after talking about the affected lack of sleep on learning.
"At the end of it came a girl to me and said, 'Why am I told this now, when I grow old?'
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleeping--something that surprised me, he said to The Telegraph.
The course, roll out for the first time this year, explains what is important for good sleep habits helps academic and athletic performance, and improves their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and managing director of health services at the university, said that the university decided to introduce the course after the students had severed their sleep during the week.
The hourly course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section there is a picture of a bedroom where students click on coffee cups, wardrobes, coaches and books to be told about the effect of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation, and how important it is with evening routines.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of campuses, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
'We know it won't change the behavior of the elevator at once.
But we think they have the right to know -- just as you have the right to know -- the health effects by choosing to smoke cigarettes, let Prof. Cheisler go.
The pride culture of daytime still exists, he said and added that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students mean that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
To ensure that you get enough sleep, of good quality, the student should be his secret weapon against stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said--even to avoid going up into weight, since sleep deprivation sees the brain in a fainting mode and makes them constant swallows.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from California who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler develop the course, after having our students with him last year, the first year he was at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to press on to get a course for the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all doctoral students to complete a similar study program before they start at the prestigious institution.
Prof. Czeisler recommended that the elevators should consider setting up an alarm for when to go to bed, and also for when to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of ‘blue light’ coming from electronic displays and LED lighting, which can convert the internal clock to a total, which leads to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga targets Gerard's men down
Rangers went on a new defeat on the highway when Dolly Menga sent his post to Steven Gerrard's favorite side to a 1-0 loss on Livingston.
The ibrox page was looking forward to taking the first winner on the far-off side of the 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone in February, but the team of Gary Holt caused only Gerrard his second defeat of 18 camps as a tenant, and gave eight points, a round under the Ladbroke leaser of Premier League, Hearts.
Slap to seven minutes before half-time, and a ranger-setting with no inspiration never looked to be equal.
While Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third and lies only behind Hibernian on target separation.
And there may be further problems in stock for Rangers after the liner Calum Spence had to be treated for a wound in the head, after an object apparently was thrown away from the side.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that celebrated Ayr into the Betfred Cup semifinals.
Holt, on the other hand, went with Livy 11, who took a score with a dream shot last week, and he would have been excited about the way in which the well-bredly attracted his took the evening cloth on his opponents at each shift.
Rangers might have had the ball most, but Livingston did more with the ball they had.
They should have scored in just two minutes when Menga sent Scott Pittman his first post to Allan McGregor's target, but the middle-level player failed in his fight.
A long spring park from Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defence partner, Alan Lithgow, could only shoot far on the return.
Rangers took control, but it seemed to be more hopeful than believing in their last third round.
Alfredo Morellos knew that he was supposed to have a 20-metre penalty when he and Steven Lawless were collapsing, but Judge Steven Thomson turned away the desire of the Colombian.
Rangers managed only two shots on targets in the first half, but earlier Ibrox target guard Liam Kelly was almost worried about Lassana Coulibaly's head and a hollow shot from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's opening in the 34th minute may have been against the rules, no one can deny that they only earned it because of the shot.
Again Rangers failed to handle a deep deathball from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher hit Scott Robinson's ball, which was fun to pick out Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard paused as if he had replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and replaced it with an immediate effect when the player made a hole for Morelos, but the impressive Kelly race to block.
But Livingstone continued to list the guest layer to play exactly what they liked, by sending Lithgow and Halkett long shot.
Holt's team could have increased the rent at the end, but McGregor managed to prevent Jacob's in it until Lithgrow left a long post from the corner label.
The Ranger's reserve, Glenn Middleton, had a new claim for punishment when he supported Jacob's, but still Thomson ignored it.
Almanac: The inventor of the gear counter
And now one side of our Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and WE RECOGNIZE ... the day that he was to become physicist Johannes Wilhelm «Hans» Geiger, was born in Germany.
Geiger develops a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger numerator.
As a scientific observatory since then, the Geiger counter was also a observatory in pop culture, as in the movie Bells of Coronado from 1950, with the apparently unlikely late cowboy researchers Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is it in all the world?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, it can be used to find radioactive minerals, for example uranium.
When you look at these earphones, you can actually hear the effects of atoms that come from the radioactivity in minerals.»
Evans, "Yeah, don't worry about it!"
“Hans” Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63-year-old day.
But the invention that asks for his name lives on.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune defense to "see" red cells.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune defense to "see" red cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune defense to recognize red cells as part of the treatment
The method involves removing immune cells from a patient and changing them in the laboratory
They can then see a protein that's common in many forms of cancer and then reinject.
A test vaccine shows promising results in patients with a number of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize red cells again, experienced that the ovary-forces disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves removing immune cells from a patient, changing them in the laboratory, so that they can "see" a protein that is common in many forms of cancer, called HER2, and then reinjecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 «drive the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovary, lung and colorectal cancer," explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to withdraw immune cells from patients and "learn" how they target cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West started a Pro-Trump-diatribe, introduced a MAGA-lue, after he visited the TV show Saturday Night Live.
It didn't work so well.
Kanye West was kicked out of the studio during Saturday Night Live after a terrible performance where he praised his president, Donald Trump, and said he would make a choice in 2020.
After taking his third song for the evening, called Ghost Town, where he had a Make America Great-caps, he gave the Democrats a tornado and repeated his support to Trump.
"How many times do I talk to a white person, and they say, 'How could you like Trump, he's racist?'
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have moved out of America for a long time, he said.
SNL started the show with a number together with the comedian Matt Damon, where Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in the Senate's legal selection of the charges of sexual abuse by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not sent, it was uploaded to the West by the cartoonist Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock tried to stop West with the post.
The West also complained to the public that he had a difficult backstage because of his headache.
"The mob beat me in the back of the scene.
They said, "Don't go out there with that hat on.
The mobbing me!
And then they say I'm in a low position," he said, following Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Would you like to see the space below?" says he would "take on the superman cap, because this means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want to go forward?
Try love.»
His comments led to a knockout at least two times from the audience, and SNL cast members seemed rather concerned, Variety reported, with a person who told the publication: «The whole studio was dead».
West was picked up as a late replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, when her former girlfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days ago.
West confuses many with a performance of the song I Love it, dressed like a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the captain of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner as a tweeter: «To one of the most courageous spirits: THANK YOU TO MAKE UP WITH THE PUBLIC.»
But talk show Vertinna Karen Hunter tweets that the West “mostly simply was just as he is and it is absolutely fantastic.”
«But I did NOT choose to hire anyone (by buying his music or dressing or supporting his «art») who I believe embraces and asks for ideology that is harmful to my society.

Game of Thrones star Kit Harington out against toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for the swordfighting role as Jon Snow in HBO's chosen medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the skater, 31, has gone out against the stereotype of the macho hero, and says that such roles on the screen often lead young guys to feel that they have to be tough to be respected.
In conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he thought something had gone wrong and asked how one should deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo age.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones partner Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he knew “very strong” to address the problem.
“I personally believe that something has gone wrong with masculinity.” he said.
"What have we learned men when they grow up, when it comes to the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that TV is partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to very human characteristics.
He continued, 'What is born and what is learned?
What is learned on TV and in the streets, what makes young guys feel that they have to be this special side of being a man?
I think it's really one of the big questions in our time-- how do we change it?
For it is clear that something has gone wrong for young men.'
In the interview he also admitted that he would not make Game of Thrones runners or follow-up when the series ends in summer, and says he is "complete with battlegrounds and horses".
From November, Kit will play in a new recording by Sam Shepards True West, who is a history of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The player recently discovered that he was looking at the meeting with the woman said Rose to be the best that came out of Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife in this show, so that it gave me my future family and my future life,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the chosen to Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are framed in the country, says health supplement.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
Most new cases were transmitted through six and marked a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV rapidly spread through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who received HIV this way was reduced to almost zero, Chinese health personnel said at a conference in the Yunnan province.
From year to year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sex is an acute problem in China's LGBT environment.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT/HBTQ persons is claimed to be expanding.
Because of the conservative values in the country, studies have shown that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases come from insufficient sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of an attempt to address the problem.
Maxine Waters refuses to add leak information from the GOP Senator, it explodes in 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theories'.
United States Rep. Maxine Waers sentenced on Saturday claims that a member of her staff had provided personal information about three republican United States senators on the Wikipedia pages of the lawmakers.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the claims were pedalized by "extreme-right wing" investigations and websites.
"T lying, lying and more contemptuous lies," Waters said in a Twitter survey.
The information published included informational addresses and phone numbers of the American Sens. Lindsey Graham in South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on Thursday, was sent by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a hearing by the Senate panel on the allegations of sexual abuse against the highest-ranking Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came once after the three senators had asked Kavanaugh questions.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the post was linked to Waters' office and issued the information to a member of the Waters staff, reported Hill.
"This baseless claim is completely false and an absolute lie," continued Waters.
‘One of my additions - which has been compromised by their identity, personal information and security as a result of these malicious and false claims - was in no way responsible for the leaking of this information.
This baseless claim is completely false and an absolute lie.»
The issues of Water were quickly criticised on the Internet, among others by former press secretary in the White House, Ari Fleischer.
‘This denial is sin,’ Fleischer wrote.
"This indicates that she does not have the temper to be a member of the Congress.
When someone is blamed for something they didn't do, they don't have to be angry.
They don't have to be fat.
They don't have to ask questions for the reason of the debtor.
They must be calm and peaceful."
Fleischer showed himself to compare the Waters' reaction to the criticism of the democrats of Judge Kavanaugh, who was owed by critics to be apparent to sin during the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is trying to take Water's place in the middle elections, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
«Still if it is true», he tweets.
In the questionnaire, Waters said that her office had warned her "to correct the powers of the government and the law enforcement units of these false claims.
‘We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed,’ she continued, ‘and that they will be legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to each and every one of my employees.’
Johnny English beats again - spindle of weak Rowan Atkinson
It's traditional to watch Brexit's remarkable features in all new films with a British angle, and it works for this revitalization of Johnny England's action comedy spof-frenchise - which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and which was relived in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will the hydrovironic satire that deals with how openly we are, become the new export potential in the country?
In any case, the big-eye, incompetent Johnny English with the rubber cover has for the second time been given renewed permission to fuck things up--his name signals more than anything else that he is a broad comic book for cinematographers in non-English countries.
He is, of course, the stupid, secret agent who traverses in his picards' wish to spread a little glamorous has got a little bit of Clouseau, a dash of Mr. Bean and a portion of the guy who contributes with a simple melody to the fire cars, the theme during the 2012 Olympic opening ceremony in London.
He is also originally based on the traveling and international mystery man Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV ads, something that left chaos behind.
There's one or two nice eyelids in this last JE excursion.
I love Johnny English who came near a helicopter while he was dressed in a Middle Ages armored suit while the rotor blade beat his helmet.
Atkinson's gift to physical comedy is on the screen, but the humor is felt quite weak and strangely superfluous, especially since «serious» film brands such as 007 and Mission Nei now safely offer comedy as an ingredient.
The humor felt as if he was targeting children instead of adults, and for me, Johnny England's noisy accident is not as inventive and focused as Atkinson's replica clause is worn in the person in Bean.
The permanent current situation is that the United Kingdom is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated Britain's superintendent network of spy websites, which discovers the identities of all the agents of the United Kingdom have in the area, to the detriment of the agent at work - a unfortunately small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last strand for a minister of state who is a Pompus and Warlord figure, who already has a complete collapse of political popularity: Emma Thompson is doing his best with this quasi-Theresa-May character, but it is not so much in the script to work with.
Her informant informs her that when each active spy has been in debt, she must get someone who is retired.
And it means that the incompetent Johnny English himself, who works as a teacher at some elegant establishment, but gives unofficial lessons about how to work undercover: a couple of fine families here, as English offers a School of Rock-type Academy for spying.
English will be sent back to Whitehall for a emergency briefing and reunite with his former understanding assistant Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, moving to a subcontractor's job, an over-enthusiastic role where Vicki Pepperdine is a little thrown away.
So Batman and Robin's ability to get things to become awfully crazy in Hennar's Secret Service is back too fully in the meeting with Olga Kurylenko's beautiful woman fatal, Ophelia Bullettova.
In the meantime, the Minister of State was in danger of exposing the charismatic technology of the billionaire, who claimed that he could solve Britain's data problem: the disturbing Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin to travel by grandfather-like wild game: dressed as servants, they see the guys at a nice French restaurant; they create chaos and smuggle on board the Volta light boat; and English releases pure anarchy as he tries to use a Virtual Reality header to get acquainted with the interior of Volta's house.
All stops are probably pulled out to the last sequence, but as loving and disciplinary as it is, it's quite a lot of children's TV over the whole.
Quite moderate things.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but think, "Can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really makes justice to his talents?
The Labour Party denies that they are planning a plan for English people to work for a four-day week, but will be paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party now evaluates a radical plan that wants Britain to work for a four-day week -- but gets paid for five.
According to the report, the company manager will continue to send savings through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers by giving them an extra Friday.
Then the addition could enjoy a three-day weekend--but still get the same pay.
Source said the idea would "pass" with the economic agenda of the party and plans to increase the benefits for workers.
The change of a four-day week has been approved by Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from the changed economy.
An older source from Labour told The Sunday Times: A policy message is expected to be announced before the annual shift.
'It doesn't happen overnight, but a four-day work week is a wish that fits into the close-up party to balance the economy for the benefit of the worker, as well as to the party's industrial strategy.'
The Working Party would not be the first to approve such an idea when the Green Party promised a four-day working week in its 2017 election campaign.
However, the ambition is not accepted by the whole Labour Party.
A spokesperson from the Labour Party said: 'A four-day workweek is not party policy and is not assessed by the party.'
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used a previous week's work conference to strengthen his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said that he was determined to withdraw power from the 'no-faceless directors' and 'professors' in rich companies.
The plans of the shadow Chancellor also mean that current shareholders in the watercourses cannot fully recover their efforts when a Labour Government could make 'deduction' due to perceived abuse.
He also has confirmed plans to place employees in company management and set up Inclusive Ownership Funds (including ownership funds) to provide 10 per cent of equity in private sector enterprises to add, which would receive annual dividends of up to £500, approximately SEK 5000.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, told the 60-minute TV program about the FBI in the investigation of Kavanaugh that they could change their minds
The FBI's investigation of complaints against judges Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least one week, and raises the question of the extent to which the Agency could influence some Republican senators to withdraw the statement.
In an interview on Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley asked the Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could reveal something that would make them redefine.
Kennedy works more openly than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I'm mine, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said on my way into the ring, I said, I have spoken to the judges of Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, and he came out and said, 'Have you done it?'
He was determined, determined, expansive.”
Graham's voice seems to have been seen in stone anyway.
"I have made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh, and it would take a dynamic charge to change me," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this:
"And all her names could not confirm it.
It's 36 years.
I don't see any new changes."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday is New York's host to the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has an enormously impressive set of stars that perform and an equally impressive mission; to end poverty in the world.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people flocking to Central Park's great plenary, not only to enjoy seeing Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes' performances, but also to increase awareness of the true goal of the event to end extreme poverty by 2030.
Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concerters had to complete a number of tasks, or "actions" as voluntary work; send e-mail to a world leader, call a phone call or other meaningful ways to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful would Global Citizen have been 12 years to reach its goal?
Is it the idea to hire people with a free concerted real way to persuade people to demand a call for action, or just another case of so-called "clickivism" people feel that they make a real difference by signing an online appeal or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has been saying that it has registered more than 19 million «actions» from its supporters and has participated in and pressed on a number of different goals.
It is said that these actions have helped world leaders to announce commitments and policies corresponding to more than $37 billion, which will affect lives to more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group showed 390 commitments and announcements following their shares, of which at least $10 billion have already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the safe resources so far have had a direct impact on almost 649 million people around the world.
Some of the most important commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a British-based partnership of investors and entrepreneurs who are committed to ‘helping children reach their full potential’; pledges to give Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4700 tweets from global citizens.
"With support from the British government, donors, national governments and global citizens, just like you, we can make the social injustice of undernutrition to a footnote in history," told The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, an audience during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after taking more than 5,000 actions to require Britain to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the British government announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition.
In answer to one of the common questions on the website, they say, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global citizens replied: "It will be a long and difficult road - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But as the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements lead us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are among some of the actors that are taking part in the New York Year's event, which will be presented by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Fleet as "blocked" to prevent Russian energy exports - Interior Secretary
Washington can “if necessary” because to its fleet to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, international secretary Ryan Zinke has revealed, as quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria - especially where they operate at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to communicate energy, just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe," he said.
And follow the official, there are ways and means to tackle it.
“The United States has this ability, with our Fleet, to ensure that the waterways are open and, if necessary, blocked to ensure that their energy is not placed on the market,” he said.
Zinke spoke to participants on the events organised by Consumer Energy Alliance, an ideal group that presents itself as the ‘vote to the energy consumer’ in the United States.
He compared Washington's approaches to managing Russia and Iran, and noted that they are actually the same.
“The economic solution for Iran and Russia is more or less exploiting and replacing fuel,” he said, while pointing to Russia as a ‘one-trick pony’ with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The declarations come as the Trump Administration has been commissioned to increase exports of liquid natural gas to Europe, and to replace Russia, the far cheaper alternative for European consumers.
In this context, officials of the Trump Administration, including President Donald Trump of the United States, are trying to translate Germany into withdrawing from the ‘inappropriate’ Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin a ‘capture’ for Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is designed to double the existing pipeline capacity of 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
Kreml claims that Washington’s intense opposition to the project is driven only by economic reasons, and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position has withdrawn from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
The German Leasing Organisation for Industry, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a major problem when a third country disturbs our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industrial Association (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "run hard" to stand up as President's candidate in 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would take a "deep look" to stand as President's candidate after the mid-term election.
At a meeting of the Holyoke Council, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider silence as a candidate.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our bad government, and it includes a woman at the top," she said after The Hill.
‘After 6 November, I will carefully assess the appointment of the President’s candidate.
Warren entered President Donald Trump during the council meeting and said that he was ‘in the wrong direction’.
“I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy,” she said.
Warren has our crash in his criticism of Trump and his highest-ranking Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, a poll issued on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren's own electors did not consider that she should stand as a candidate in 2020.
51 percent of the "probably" Massachusetts electors said that the senator should not stand as a candidate, followed by Suffolk University Political Research Centre/ Boston Globe.
Thirty percent support such an application.
The investigation showed more support for a round of former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting a potential candidate and 48 percent against.
Other highly profiled democratic names discussed with a view to a potential 2020 candidacy include former vice president Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
The petition said that he would decide officially in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin argues for Track Palin his PTSD (post-traumatic stress) at Donald Trump Collection
Track Palin, 26, was a year in Iraq after we were hired in September.
He was arrested and called for a government event in the world on Monday night
"What my own son goes through, what he goes through when he comes back, makes me can relate to other relatives who are affected by PTSD and some of the wounds our soldiers return with," she told the audience at a collection for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin calls his "eleven in space" arrest and says about his son and other war veterans that "they come back a little different, they come back here, they come back and wonder if respect for what they and their fellow soldiers and pilots and all the other military have done for the country is there".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was liable for physical elections in the world against a woman, in order to have a report on elections in the world and the storage of a weapon while he was Russian, followed by Dan Bennett, spokesperson for Wasilla Politi Department.
18 countries, D.C. challenge of support for new asylum policies
Eight states and districts in Colombia support a legal challenge to a new American policy that denies asylum for victims fleeing from re-election or election in the world.
Representatives from the 18 states and the district submitted a friend-off card in Washington on Friday to support an asylum seeker who challenges politics, NBC News reported.
The full name of the applicant in Grace v. Sessions corresponds to the fact that the American Civil Liberties Union (American Civil Liberties Union) archived in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
She said her partner "and the elected regents" abused her, but US officials denied her application for asylum on 20 July.
He was arrested in Texas.
The lawyers of the states that support Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, who produce a large number of applicants for American asylum, which nations face cross-cutting problems with repetitions and choices in the world.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision from immigration laws, which allowed illegal immigrants who fled their homes of choice to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Justice Minister Karl Racine said in a poll Friday that the new policy "is ignoring many decades of government, federal and international law."
‘Federal law requires that all asylum cases be judged for the particular facts and circumstances of the claim and such an obstacle to this principle,’ said a friend-of-law card.
Advocates further argue in the summary that the policies that deny immigrants access harm the US economy and say that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "offer the necessary work".
Advocate General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims of refugee abuse and re-election in June.
‘Asyl is available to those who have left their home country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion,’ said the Sessions of 11 June in the announcement of the policy.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all problems - even all serious problems - which people face every day throughout the world.
Desperate rescue work in Palu while dying doblast in the race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation became even more serious.
“It feels very excited,” said 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, who comforted her sick baby son at an evacuation center in the corrupt city, Palu.
"Every minute ambulances come with bodies.
Clean water is difficult to find.»
Residents have been observed on their way back to their damaged homes, where they search through washed-up parts and try to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals destroyed by the earthquake, which had a force of 7.5, were overfilled.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Harris, who had broken back and shoulder, lay outside Palu's Military Hospital, where the patients were treated outside due to still strong fears.
Tears filled his eyes as he told him that he knew the powerful earthquake shook the hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter on the fifth floor.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pushed into the ruins of the wall, I believe, ” said Harris to the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife call for help, but then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
US Ambassador owes China to “mobbing” with “propaganda ads”
A week after an official Chinese newspaper launched a four-page advertisement in an American daily and highlighted the mutual benefits of trade with the United States and China, owe the US ambassador to China Beijing to use the American press to spread propaganda.
USA President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to China's paid supplement in the Des Moines Registry - the state of Iowa's largest salsavis - after having owed China to try to blend into the US Congress elections on 6 November, a debt China refuses.
Trump's guilt that Beijing was trying to get mixed up in U.S. elections marked the new phase in a escalating campaign by Washington to press China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertising to support trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an increasing trade war that has seen them in turn increasing taxes on each other's imports.
China's payroll rates early in the trade war were designed to hit exporters in countries like Iowa that support Trump's republican party, Chinese and American experts have said.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and the former long-term governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
«China», Branstad wrote in part in the Sunday Des Moines register, «doubt the mob by running propaganda advertisements in our own free press».
‘In its dissemination of propaganda, the Chinese government takes advantage of America’s dear tradition of freedom of expression and a free press by introducing a paid ad into the Des Moines register,’ Branstad wrote.
“In contrast, by the aiscotic down the street here in Beijing, you will find limited divergent voices and will not see any true reflection of the different meanings that the Chinese people may have on China’s problematic economic path, given that the media is below the solid thumb of the Chinese Communist Party” he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers has declined the offer to publish" his article, even though he did not say what a newspaper.
Republicans recommend female voters lead the middle term with Kavanaugh Debacle, warns Analysts.
Since many top Republicans are standing-towns and defend the highest-ranking board of Kavanaugh in the face of more debts for sexual abuse, the analyst warns that they will probably see a retreat, especially from women, in the upcoming mid-term elections.
The feelings about this have been extremely high, and most Republicans have recorded that they have already wanted to move forward with a voice.
These things cannot be undone, says Grant Reeher, professor of State Science at Syracuse Universities Maxwell School, to The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s last eyeball pressure for an FBI investigation would be enough to silence his voters.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday -- they won't forget it tomorrow, and not in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national spokeswoman for the Progressive Group MoveOn on Friday. Washington, DC notice.
On Friday morning, the "November" protestors came! while they demonstrated in the hall to the Senate when the Republicans, who run the judicial committee, chose to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination trass in the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are coming to be outside the chart," said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst, to the news page.
"People say it already has our height, it is true.
But it may become higher, especially among female electors in the suburbs and younger electors, 18 to 29 years of age, who, while not like the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford’s public witness, who detailedly stated the allegations of sexual abuse directed against the current highest right, analysts suggested that a coup could be followed if the Republicans press forward with the confirmation.
"This has been a confusing root for GOP," said Michael Steele, former leader of the Republican National Committee, early last week, followed NBC News.
‘It’s not just about the committee’s vote or the final vote, or about Kavanaugh being put on the bench, it’s also about how Republicans have handled this and how they have dealt with it,’ Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities USA, a group that is involved in choosing Democrats, points to the news channel.
But the Americans seem to be a little bit apart from who they should believe in in the cold water of Fords and Kavanaugh's testimony, with a little bit more sidetracks with the latter.
A new opinion from YouTube shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably violated Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said that they definitely or probably violated Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought that Kavanaugh was probably or definitely lying under his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After Flake's press, the FBI is currently investigating the claims made by Ford, and at least another complainant, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Fore witness to the Senate's Governing Board's decision last week that Kavanaugh totally violated her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the highest-ranking sex organ showed her while they attended a party during the time they studied at Yale University in the 1980s.
The founder of the World Wide Web Plans to launch a new Internet to meet Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company built by Berners-Lees open source platform Solid.
Solid lets users choose where the data is stored and what people have access to the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee said the meaning of Inrupt is "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said about the start.
"It's a historic eyelid."
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data storage" or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, home lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It is like Google Drive; Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in a browser and all at the same time.
What's unique about the personal web store is that it's completely up to the user who can access all kinds of information.
The company calls it ‘personal authorisation through data’.
The idea of Inrupt, following the Managing Director of John Bruce, is that the company should include resources, process and appropriate capabilities to make Solid available to all.
The company consists of the eyebrows of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM and some additional developers with contracts to work with the project, as well as a community of voluntary codes.
From this week on, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised apps using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team don't talk to Facebook and Google to introduce a complete change where all their business models are completely turned over at the top of the night.
"We do not ask for their permission."
In a media post published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new network collection built on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last few months, Berners-Lee has had a strong influence in the debate on net neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will become the current founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I'm extremely optimistic about this next epoch online," said Berners-Lee ten l.
Bernard Water: WW1 Victoria Cross Divine Fair
The only Goddess of the English Church who won a Victorian Cross during the first world war as a fighter has been celebrating in his home town 100 years later.
Lt Col Pastor Bernard Water won the prize on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew that he had won the highest British military honor.
A monument was taken from his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Water, said that it was "bright symbolic", that the stone would be taken away just 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning performance.
According to London Gazette, Lt Col Water led its battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin on 29 September 1918 "through a very thick shot and under heavy fire from the fields and masks."
He later jumped up to the front line, and with the «largest gallantie» he led the line forward before he learned to fight a field gun and threw out three of the group.
Lt Col Water was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "something I know I could never live up to, but something I am proud of."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also placed a crown after the parade, which was led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Wann said that he was very proud of playing a role in the parade, and added that “the value of a real is fully shown by the support given by many people.”
The MMA fan was up all night to see Bellator 206, they got Peppa Gris instead
Imagine this, you've been up all night to see a package of Bellator 206men so you can't see the main event.
The San Jose bill included 13 camps, including six on the map and was shown live overnight in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, just in the Gegard Mousesi and Rory MacDonald prepared to meet each other, sailors in the United Kingdom were once again amazed when the blankets changed to Peppa Gris.
Some were a little impressed after they had stayed awake for the early hours especially for the fight.
A fan on Twitter described changing the drawing series of children as "a sort of sick joke."
‘It’s public regulation to have 6 hours if the content was not such, so they had to switch to the programme for children,’ said Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice-President of Marketing and Communication, when he was asked about the transfer.
« Peppa-grisen, «yes».
Bellator Company President Scott Coker said they should work with planning to include British sailors in the future.
“I think that when I think about replay, I think we can figure it out,” said Coker.
"But the clock is six in the morning on a Sunday, and we don't find out before Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Trust me, when it passed, there were many texts that went forward and back, and they weren't all friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn't; it was a public problem.
I can promise you, next time it won't happen.
We keep it to five matches instead of six -- as we usually do -- and we tried to survive to the fan, and we just went over.
It's an accident.»
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley was known as the subject because of sexuality
The Olympic actor Tom Daley says that in his growing up he felt worse than everyone because of his sexuality--but he gave the motivation to become a success.
The 24-year-old said he didn't understand until he went on the next course that "not everyone is like me."
When he spoke on the first Radio 4 Desert Island disc presented by Lauren Laverne, he said that he spoke about his homophilic rights to give others hope.
He also said to become a parent made him less concerned with winning OL.
The permanent reporter at the Longrennsshow, Kirsty Young, has taken several months free of disease.
What could look like an absence in the Lawyer's first program, Daly said he knew less than anyone else who grew up because it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls.
He said, "From today, I have a sense of being less than and different, if we were the real things that have given me the strength and strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he didn't disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-time Bronze Olympic Medal has been a professional LGBT campaign and used its appearance at the Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to several countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke out because he knew lucky who could live up without misunderstandings and wanted to give others hope.
The three-time world champion said it was to be in love with a man -- the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 -- "surprising me."
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than he was, yesterday, but he said that the age difference never had a problem.
'When you go through so much at such a young age'--he went to the first OL his 14 years old and his father died of cancer three years later--he said it was difficult to find anyone at the same age who had experienced similar heights and descents.
The couple were parents in June to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his whole perspective had changed.
"If you had asked me yesterday, do everything I need to win a gold medal," he said.
«You know what, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic Gold Medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept that he would die and one of the last things he had asked about was whether they had tickets to London in 2012 - when he wanted to be in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him you wouldn't be on the front row," he said.
“I kept up when he stopped breathing, and it wasn’t until he actually stopped breathing and he was dead as I finally recognized that he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at OL in 2012 and won bronze.
“I only knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life – to appear in front of an audience at an Olympic game where there was no better feeling,” he said.
It also inspired the first song of his--Stolt by Heather Small--which had vibrated with him in the building of O.L. and gave him still gait.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Out of shape his Mickelson on the bench on Ryder Cup Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47. Ryder Cup camp, but he must turn shape to avoid that it is an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who played in the two-year event for a 12th record, was placed on the bench of Captain Jim Furyk for the fourth and fourth rounds of the Saturday's golf course.
Instead of being in the middle of the act, as he often has been for the United States, split the five times the winner's day between being a cheerleader and working with his game before the range of hope to correct what he hurts.
Never the most competent longshoes. Do not enter the top of your career, the 48th year is best to meet the longshoes on the throne, the French main track where balls hit unless the golfer is accurate with the battle.
And if the path itself isn't scary enough, Mickelson meets in the ninth match Sunday, the exact British Open Master Francesco Molinari, who has met with smoke Tommy Fleetwood to win all four campaigns this week.
If the Americans, four points down by starting the 12 single battles, get to a hot start, Mickeyson's fight can be very crucial.
Fury expressed trust in his husband, not that he could say much differently.
“He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a kick on my back and put his arm around me and said that he would be ready tomorrow,” said Furyk.
«He has great confidence in himself.
He is a Hall of Famer, and he has added so much to these layers in the past and this week.
I didn't think he played two matches.
I saw more for myself, but that's how it was, and that's what we thought we had to do.
He will be out there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record in most Ryder Cup matches that will be played on Sunday.
It can mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never completely matched the heights in his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven-halfs, although Furyk said that his proximity brought some intangible properties to the team.
“He’s a morosam, he’s sarcastic, entertaining, likes to keep fun with people and he’s a nice guy to have in the storage room,” he explained.
“I think the younger players had the fun that got in touch with him, too, this week, which was fun looking.
He contributes much more than just playing.”
Europe Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that large rent can soon disappear
Thomas Bjørn, the European Captain, knows from experience that a significant rental on the way into the last few days of Ryder Cup can easily be turned into an unpleasant journey.
The Danish made its debut in the 1997 Valderrama fight, where a side captain of Seven Ballesteros held a five-point advantage over the Americans, but only came over the target line with the nose leading with the narrowest margins, winning 1411⁄2-1311⁄2.
“You kept reminding yourself that we had a big lease on Valderrama; we had a big lease on Brooklyn, where we lost, and on Valderrama, where we won, but only so far,” said Bjørn, after he had seen Class 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday to rent 10-6 on Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone on that team that this isn't over.
You're going to full opening tomorrow.
Go out there and do all the right things.
This is not over until you have scored.
We have a goal, and it's trying to win this trophy, and that's where the focus is going to be.
I've said all the time, I focus on the 12 players that are on our side, but we're so clear about what's on the other side -- the biggest players in the world."
Glad about how his players have acted on a tough golf course, let Bjørn add: "I would never take the winner in advance.
Tomorrow's another day.
Tomorrow is the individual performance that comes forward, and there's another thing to do.
It's great to be out there with a partner when things go well, but when you're out there individually, you're fully tested out of your capacity as a golfer.
This message you need to share with players; get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now leave your partner, and he must go and get the best out of himself."
In contrast to Bjørn, the opposite number Jim Furyk will be looking after his players will perform better individually than they did as partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furik himself has been in both ends of the snow operations in the last great days, after having been part of the winning team in Brooklyn before he ended up losing when Europe took off the Mirakel in Medina.
‘I remember every damn word of it,’ he said in reply to be asked how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, had gathered his players on the way into the last day.
«We have 12 major camps tomorrow, but you want to get started with the fast start that you saw at Brooklyn, which you saw at Medina.
When the moment comes, you see a lot of pressure on the middle of the campaign.
We set up our line-up at the same time and set up the guts in a way that feels good, you know, we're trying to do something magical tomorrow."
Thomas has been assigned the task of trying to hire Rory McIlroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter the other Europeans in the top half of the regime.
“I went with this group of guys in this order because I think it covers the whole road,” said Bjorn about his choices of singles.
Germany’s new warships once again
The newest freight of the German Navy would have been ordered in 2014 to replace older warships from the cold wartime, but it will not be there at least next year due to faulty systems and running costs, reported local media.
The launch of the Rhineland-Pfalz, the lead ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg class of frigates, has now been appointed for the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit-avisa, which quotes a military speaker.
The vessel was expected to join the fleet in 2014, but the worrying problems after delivery plague the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg classes of ships ordered the Maritime Defence in 2007, come as compensation for the old Bremen class frigates.
It is understood that they will contain a powerful cannon, a number of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some hidden technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important functions include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to deploy the latest fractanes for up to two years away from ports at home.
However, continuous delays mean that the intermittent warships, which have allowed Germany to exercise power abroad, will already be delayed when they enter service, notes Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 fleet made headlines yesterday, when the German fleet officially refused to accept the ship and returned it to Blohm & Voss’s yard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the German fleet returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
There was little knowledge of the reasons for the return, but German media quoted a number of important "software and hardware errors" that made the warship useless if they were deployed to a combat task.
Software errors were especially important when ships in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be driven by a team of around 120 sailors - only half of the workforce on older Bremen freighters.
It also showed that the ship is dramaticly overweight, which reduces performance and limits the possible fleet to add future upgrades.
The 7000 tonnes ‘Reinland-Pfalz’ is supposed to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans in World War II.
Apart from the wrong hardware, the price of the entire project - including training of the human being - will also become a problem.
It has been said that it has reached €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) from the initial €2.2 billion (EURO)
The problems associated with the latest frigates are becoming particularly important in the light of the latest warnings that Germany's fleet will decline.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German Parliament's defence committee, acknowledged that the fleet actually ‘has almost ended on the ship of distribution competent’.
The officer said that the problem had been over time because old ships had been solved, but no ship of compensation had been delivered.
He regrets that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg classes were able to join the fleet.
National Trust steals covert life for flag mouse
New research carried out on a property in the Scottish highlands aims to reveal how the flag mice use the landscape in hunting for food.
It is hoped that finding will shed new light on the behaviour of the unique flying mammals and help to guide future conservation activities.
The study of researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the usual and soprano pipistrelles and in addition brown longora and Daubenton flaggermus at the Inverewe Gardens in Western Ross.
Special recorders will be located in important locations around the property to track flag mouse activities throughout the season.
NHS additives and volunteers will also perform mobile surveys using managed detectors.
Expert audio analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the flag mouse calls and what kind of species to do.
A habitat map and report will then be produced to create a detailed landscape scale image of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, a naturalist advisor to NTS, hopes that the results will reveal what areas of habitat, natural homes, which are most important for flag mice and how they are used by each species.
This information will contribute to determining the benefits of habitat management work as the purchase of land and how it is best to maintain the same forest area for flag mouse and other related species.
Flag musc populations in Scotland and above the United Kingdom have significantly decreased over the last century.
They are threatened by construction work that affects resting places and loss of habitats/buplaces.
Wind turbines and lighting may also pose a risk, such as flight papers and some chemical treatments of building materials, and also attacks of pets.
The flag mouse is not really blind.
But because of their nightly hunting habits, their ears are still more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching exchange animals.
They use sophisticated eco-location techniques to find errors and obstacles in their flight routes.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes flag mice very seriously.
There are ten trained experts, who regularly carry out investigations, rest inspections and sometimes save lives.
The organisation has even created Scotland's first and only dedicated flag museum reserve at Thrave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten flag museums.
Property Manager David Thompson says that ownership is the ideal territory for them.
"Here at Thrave we have a nice area for flag mouse," he said.
«We have old buildings, many vet trees and all the good habitats.
But it's a lot about bats that are still unknown, so that the work we do here and on other properties will help us understand more about what they need to thrive."
He underlines the importance of checking for flag mice before carrying out maintenance within property, since it is possible that endless destruction of a single bupplasm can kill up to 400 female flags and young people, and perhaps exterminate an entire local population.
The flag mouse is peaceful and it is illegal to kill, plague or disturb them or destroy their resting places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish Officer for Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the audience to come in and help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our flag mice and too many of our species we don't know how their populations are going."
Ronaldo rejects election debts in which the lawyer seeks German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has marked the electoral debt against himself as "false news", and says that people "want to highlight themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are set to investigate the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the claims.
Portugal and Juventus have been indebted to choose an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is claimed to have paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the event, reported Der Spiegel on Friday.
In a live Instagram video Ronaldo, 33, to his 142 million followers follow only hours after the debts, that the debts are «false news».
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news, says five times the Goldball winner into the camera.
‘They want to market themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
They'll be known to say my name, but it's part of the job.
I am a happy man and all good, "Leave the player and smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to investigate Der Spiegel's claims, which they have called "an illegal reporting of suspicions within the area of personal protection", according to Reuters
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player would seek compensation for “moral damage in an amount that represents the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.”
The alleged event is said to have found a city in June 2009 on a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga went back to the room of the player, claiming that he should have elected her anal, follow a document submitted by Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged event and said that he was '99 percent' a 'good guy' and failed with 'one percent'.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was the consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had taken photographs of her damage to a hospital, but later she was told about a solution because she felt "feared by reprisals" and was concerned about "to become publicly audmilitary."
The 34-year-old says she's now trying to change the bust when she continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to be with Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and last summer he moved to the Italian giant Juve in a €100 million deal.
Brexit: UK 'City for Always Undo 'to lose car manufacturers
The United Kingdom «ville cancels it forever» if it loses its status as world leader before car production after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was ‘about’ that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said the effect of border delays in case a non-agreement Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant - which makes Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, where 90% were exported to the rest of the EU.
"My opinion is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see a production stop at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers have been afraid to leave the EU without agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns deal with which car manufacturers win are the risks of supply chains in the case of a Brexit non-contractual.
Toyota's production line is driven on a "just-in-time" basis, with parts coming every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars ordered.
If the United Kingdom left the EU without an agreement on 29 March, disturbances may occur at the threshold that the industry claims may lead to delays and lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's worth of inventory at its Derbyshire factory, the company said, and thus production would be stopped.
Mr Clark said that Theresa May's Checker's plan for future relations with the EU is "netally calibrated to avoid border checks."
"We need an agreement. We want to have the best agreement that will allow, as I say, not only to enjoy the success today, but for us to take this opportunity," he continued the BBC Radio 4 agenda.
‘The proof from not only Toyota but other manufacturers is that we must be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains.’
Toyota could not say how long the production would be stopped, but in the longer term it warned them that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately cost work.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years, and is the United Union Association on the plant, said that his members are more occupied by: "After my experience, when these jobs go, they never come back.
A spokesperson for the government said: "We have presented a precise and reliable plan for our future relationship with the EU."
trumpet meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, says White House
Donald Trump's high-ranking meeting with Deputy Lawyer Rod Rosenstein could be "pressed back a week" as the fight against the highest right nominated Brett Kavanaugh continued, said the white house Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian rollout, links between Trump and Russia and the potential impediment of the President's justice.
Korvidt Trump will say to the general of the courtrooms or not, and thus put Mueller himself in danger, has given food to Washington slabs for several months.
Earlier this month, New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed a lead to record talks with Trump and the possibility of removing the president by means of the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, and it was reported that he was about to say up.
In the city, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he would prefer not to kick Rosenstein, but then the meeting was scheduled to avoid crashing with the Senate's hearing of both Kavanaugh and one of the women who have accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, of witness.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation of claims against Kavanaugh, something that delayed the Senate's full vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
When she was asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said, "No date has been set.
But we'll see, and I always like to keep the press up to date."
Some reporters may disagree: Sanders has not held a press orientation for the White House since 10 September.
True, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of orientations was not due to a lack of TV reporting their game for the gallery, although she said, "I'm not disagreeing that they do it."
She mentioned and that direct contact between Trump and the press is coming to increase.
«The President holds more press conferences than any president has done before», he said - quite rightly without showing evidence of the claim. «I have seen the speech.»
Sanders says that updates will still happen, but "if the press gets the chance to ask the president of the United States directly, it's much better than talking to me.
We've tried to do this part, and you've seen us do it often in the last few weeks, and it's going to take over instead of a press orientation if you can talk directly to the president of the United States."
Trump takes equal questions when he travels from the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with visitors.
It is unusual for the president to hold press conferences alone.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why, where he acted to bring the reporters without shame, and almost bizarre.
Health Secretary writes about Brexit's fear of EU workers at NHS in Scotland
The Health Secretary has written to EU workers working at NHS in Scotland to express their gratitude and wish to continue after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, who is a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter even though it was less than six months before Britain withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to addressing the costs of applications that have determined the status of EU residents working in delegated public services.
In the letter, Freeman wrote: "In the summer, negotiations on withdrawals between the United Kingdom and the EU have continued and the expected end of the harvest is approaching.
However, the British government has stepped up preparations in case there is no agreement.
I understand that this must be a difficult time for everyone.
That is why I will now repeat how much I value the contributions I have made to all the additions, no matter what nationality they have.
Members of the European Union, both outside and outside, have valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve health and benefit patients and society.
Scotland is clearly diving home, and we want the dive to be here."
Christian Abercrombie undergoes acute surgery after head injury
The linebacker Christian Abercrombie, who plays at Tennessee State Tigers, went through an acute operation after having suffered a head injury when the team lost 31-27 against Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, reports The Tennesseen newspaper.
Head coach of Tennessee State, Rod Reed, reported that the damage occurred right before the break.
"He came to the side bar and collapsed, in a way," Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the side line before they placed him on a bar and took him back for further evaluation.
An official speaker from Tennessee State told WSMV that Abercrombie was finished operating at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
There is no detail about the extent of the damage yet, said Harris, and let Tennessee State still try to find out when the damage arose.
Abercrombie goes to college the second year, and is in her first season after being transferred from Illinois.
He had a total of five seizures before he was injured in the Saturday fight, and is now up to 18 in total this season.
Foreign buyers must pay a higher document fee when buying property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers must pay a higher document fee when buying property in the United Kingdom. The extra income should be used to help the homeless, following the new plans of the conservatives
Determined will neutralise Corbyn's success by attracting young voters
The increase in document fees will be added to those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
Stattskassa expects an increase of up to 120 million pounds a year - to help them homeless
Theresa May today announces that foreign buyers have to pay a higher document fee when they buy property in the United Kingdom. The extra income should be used to help them get homeless.
This decision will be seen as an attempt to neutralise the success Jeremy Corbyn has had to attract young voters who hold a lot, with the promise to offer reasonable bus stops.
The increase in document fees will be added for individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and the additional money will strengthen the government's desire to reduce the number of traffic accidents.
The fee, which is in addition to the current document fee, includes the higher levels introduced two years ago on the busted number two and rental facilities, which may be as high as three percent.
State funds are expected to reach up to 120 million pounds a year.
About 13 percent of London's new buildings are purchased by non-UK residents. This makes prices more expensive and makes it more difficult for first-time buyers to enter the bust market.
Many prosperous areas of the country - especially in the capital city - have become "magnificent cities" because of the large number of foreign buyers most of the time in other countries.
This new policy will only come weeks after Boris Johnson would cut the document fee to help several young people buy their first home.
He called on large construction companies to keep prices up by taking ownership, but not using them, and asked Theresa May to give up the allowances at reasonable bus stations to fix Britain's 'bus city chess'.
Corbyn has announced a series of promising proposals for building reforms, including controlled rentals and land-use closures.
He wants and gives more power to build new bus stations.
May said: "Yesterday I said that I would dedicate my position to bringing back the British dream - that life should be better for every new generation.
This means fixing the damaged bust market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it may not be right to be as easy for individuals who do not live in the United Kingdom, or foreign companies, to buy buses that are too hard-working, British citizens.
For many people the dream of their own busted has gone too far away, and the audacity of being a turnaround is real.
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland'
The head of Sunderland, Jack Ross, says that his ultimate ambition is to become the manager of Scotland at a time.
The Scotch (42) boasts of the challenge of revitalizing the club from the north-east. They are currently in the third place in League One, only three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer, after having led St. Mirren back to the Scottish elite series last season.
«I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B country battle, and that's it," Ross told Scotland's BBC Sportsound.
"But I grew up to see Scotland at Hamden in a fight with my father, and there has always been something that has dragged me back.
This possibility can only come if I succeed as a club manager.’
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland Manager include Dick Advocate, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic says he's not worried about getting so many established names in such a big club, since he's previously turned down approaches from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"At present, success for me will be measured in whether I can get this club back to Premier League."
Based on the structure and facilities of this club, there is no doubt that they are at home in the Premier League," he said.
“It’s not easy to get them there, but I can probably only look at myself as successful if I can get the club back there.”
Ross is only three years into his career as manager, after a period as assistant head of Dumbarton and a period of 15 months in the heart's training device.
He then helped Alloa to get from depression to third level, and transformed St. Mirren, who was about to climb down, into title winners in the championship series the following season.
And Ross says he knows himself more comfortable now than he ever did while he was playing in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"That's enough of a road divide," he says about running Alloa.
“I thought that being a manager would be much better for me than being a player.
It's the right-handed thing out, because I did it well, it worked well and it looked like a relative thing.
But playing can be tough.
There are many things you need to get through every week.
I still notice it when it comes to stress and pressure with work, but it feels right to be manager.
I always wish to be a manager, and now I am. It is the most comfortable I have felt in my own body in my adult life."
On Sunday, September 30, you can listen to the entire interview at Sportsound, Radio Scotland, between 12 and 13.
Research shows that the perfect half-liter clock is 17.30 a.m.
The heat wave of summer has led to an increase in the intensity of intensive pubs in the United Kingdom, but also to increase the pressure on restaurant chains.
In July the hall increased by 2.7 percent in childhood - but for the restaurant industry it dropped by 4.8 percent, the statistics show.
Business consultant Peter Martin, who is behind the statistics, said: “The current sun, and the fact that England was in VM longer than planned, means that July followed the June pattern of pubs went up 2.8 percent, only that restaurants became even harder.
The fall of 1.8 percent in the restaurant industry was only worse in July.
Pubar and only as a sales drink, it made a marked improvement and went up more than the restaurants went down.
Pubars sell food, received and marked the decline in the sun, even though it was not as dramatic as for restaurant owners.
It may look like people just want to go out for a drink.
Among pubs and only the drinking room had increased by 6.6 percent this month, while food had dropped by three percent.
Paul Newman, an analyst for travel and leisure at RSM, said: "These results are the continuation of the trend that we have seen since the end of April.
The weather, and the impact of a huge social or sports event, will still be the main factors when it comes to the living room.
There is no surprise that the restaurant industry will continue to suffer. A drop in the room of 4.8 percent per year will be bad at the top of a running cost pressure.
The long, warm summer could not come at a worse time for food-driven operators. Time will show if the more moderate temperatures that have been in August can give a more prolonged breathing room."

One of the five children has secret profiles on social media that they hide for parents
One of five children - some as young as 11 - have secret profiles of social media that they hide for parents and teachers, shows a study
Study of 20 000 students on continuation reveals an increase in false Insta profiles
This news has increased the fear that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of the high wins have a 'head' profile they show for parents
One of five children - some as young as 11 - make social media profiles that they keep secret for adults.
A survey of 20 000 people in the next school revealed a strong increase in fake Insta profiles - a reference to the Instagram image-sharing platform.
News has increased the fear that sexual content will be posted.
Twenty percent of the high wins they have a sterile 'head' profile they refer to parents, while they have private profiles.
A mother who snooped over the secret side of 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who encouraged others to "choose me".
The researchers, made by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) at various schools, found that 40 percent of them between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private users.
The chief of HMC, Mike Buchanan, said: “It is exciting that so many teenagers are being tempted to create places on the Internet where parents and teachers cannot find them.”
Elid Doyle becomes an athlete's voice in the Scottish Peace Council
Elid Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Peace Council as a non-administrative director at the annual general meeting of the Board.
Doyle is the most decorated peacekeeper in Scotland, and leader Ian Beattie describes the event as a great opportunity for those leading the sport to benefit from its extensive international experience during the last decade.
“Eilid has great respect across Scotland, the United Kingdom and its civil society, and we are sure that the civil right in Scotland can benefit from getting it into the board,” Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I am eager to act as a voice for practitioners, and I hope I can help and help sports in Scotland."
The American, who has gold from both 200m and 400m in Atlanta in 1996, among its total four OL gold and is now a regular guest at BBC, was unable to go after a drop.
On Twitter he wrote: "Today is a month since I got hit.
I couldn't go.
The leagues said it was only time that could tell me if I came to be good again, or to what extent.
It has been exhausting work, but I have become quite good again, learned to go again, and today I do flexibility exercises!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Split Internet opinions about breast pump advertisements comparing mothers with lactating mothers
A breast pump company has split its internet opinion with an advertising that compares breast-feeding mothers to dairy cows.
To mark what is described as ‘the first silent, visiting breast pump’, the technology company Elvie released a small amount of advertising inspired by music videos to demonstrate the freedom the new pump gives to mothers who extract milk.
Four real mothers dance in a high-full of cows, to a song that includes text like, "Yes, I'm milking myself, but you don't see a tail" and "If you don't check it, it's not a spinster, it's my doll."
The frenzied goes on, "Spring it out, pump it out, I feed these kids, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies."
On the other hand, the advertising published on the company's Facebook page has created controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from the lakes, and many say it highlights the “screaming” in the dairy industry.
‘Very poor determination to use cows to advertise for this product.
Like us, they need to be pregnant and fed to produce milk, only that the calves are trusted from the days after birth," writes one.
Elvie breast pump is discreetly in an amme-BH (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: «I understand quite traumatic for both mother and child
But yes, why don't you use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who keep their kids?"
Another added: ‘For an off-road advertising.’
Others defended the advertisement, and a lady admitted that she seemed to sound "hard."
«I think this is a great idea.
I'd have one if I was still breast-feeding.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
This commercial is a little crazy, but I took him for what he is.
This is a genius product," wrote one.
Another commented: "This is a funny advertising directed towards mothers who pump (often at work or at toilet) and feels like cows.
This is not an advertising that distorts or condemns the dairy industry.’
At the end of the video, the group of women discovers that they have all danced with the discreet pump packed into their BHs.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women like pumps say they feel like cows.
Elvie's pump is quite quiet, however, has no wires or pipes, and his discreet inside a amme-BH, something that gives women freedom to move, keep their young, and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balardin, partner and creative director of Mother, commented: «Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product, that it triggers a wave and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between mothers who extract milk and milk cows, I would like to place searchlights on breast pumping and related challenges, and at the same time demonstrate the unfathomable sense of peace that the new pump will bring, in an entertaining and recognizable way.
This is not the first time that Elvie pump has created headlines.
During the fashion week in London, a mother appeared on the podium for designer Marta Jakubowski, while she used the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children quietly move to tents on the border to Texas
The number of children in prison has peaked even though monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, partly because the strict policy introduced by the Trump administration makes it more difficult to place children in sponsorship.
Traditionally, most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves, and they fear that standing up and taking up against a child can threaten their own ability to stay in the country.
The risk of the increase in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult family members would have to submit fingerprints and that these data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence witnessed from the Immigration and Customs Administration of the Congress and said that the Agency has arrested dozens of people who have applied to be sponsors of equal minors.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested had nothing on their wheelchair.
‘Approximately 80 percent of those who are either sponsors or family members of sponsors are illegal in the country, and a large proportion of these are criminal aliens.
So we will continue to persecute these people," said Albence.
As a result of additions to the clay, new rules have now been introduced to deal with children. The rules require that some of them are now in court before a month has passed, in the past 60 days.
Many will participate through video calls and not at personal meetings, in order to have an immigration trial conducted.
Those who are not qualified for freedom will be deported quickly.
The longer the children are in labor, the more likely they are to develop anxiety or depression, which can lead to elective rash or escapes, they say they're added in the clay. Reports that have appeared in the last few months say the same.
Speakers say that these concerns are greater in large installations such as Tornillo. Due to the size of the plant, it is more likely to ignore the signs of child wear.
They let it move children to the tentacle without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally, or to say hate to friends, can strengthen traumas that many have already worn out.
Syria requests US, French and Turkish occupying forces to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also asked for Syrian refugees to come home, even though the country is now at war in the eighth year.
Moualem, who serves as Minister of State, said that the front forces are illegal on Syrian soil under the auspices of combating terrorism and ‘will be treated from it’.
"They must withdraw immediately and without conduct," he said to the assembly.
Moualem insisted that "the war against terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have been removed from their homes.
He said that Damascus will continue to "fight a holy battle until all the Syrian territories have been cleansed" for both terrorist groups and "the illegal presence of the front."
The United States has some 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly for training and counselling of both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the warlord's country.
When it came to refugee problems, Moualem said it was safe for them to come back, and he blamed 'some Western countries' for having 'distributed irrational fear' about the environment that made the refugees stay away.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate return," he said.
"They make politics out of something that would be a purely humanitarian problem."
The US and the EU have warned that there will be no help in rebuilding Syria before a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war is in place.
United Nations diplomats say that a recently established agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in Idlib, the last major rebellion, has created an opportunity to continue press forward with political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement eliminates a major attack from Russian-supported Syrian forces in the province where three million people live.
Moualem stressed, however, that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would be directed towards jihadists, including soldiers from the Nusra Front, who are linked to Al-Qaeda, who "will be eradicated."
The UN envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to soon gather the first meetings of a new committee consisting of government and opposition members to draw up a post-war law for Syria, and pave the way to the election.
Moualem lays down the conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the Committee and says that the work of the panel should be limited "to review the articles of the current Constitution" and to warn against disturbances.
Why Trump is coming to win a term
With that logic, Trump will win the re-election in 2020 if, as many liberal sailors are likely to hope, the Presidency will get an early end due to scandals and the rule of law.
It would certainly be "the most dramatic end of a presidency ever!"
In writing, there is no sign that the viewers have gone astray.
Since 2014, CNN has doubled its rating in best transmission time to 1.05 million, while MSNBC has almost tripled to 1.6 million.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the best transmission time, from 1.7 million to four years ago, followed by Nielsen. MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has played at the top of the cable rating with as much as 3.5 million viewers on evenings with great news.
"This is a fire that people are being lured away, because there's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer in the "Designed Survivors" drama, which is about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the congress building.
Nell Scovell, an old comedy author and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
She remembers a tour of the box in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he came to vote on Trump.
Why? She asked.
"Because he makes me laugh," he answered after Scovell.
It's a maintenance value in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, history from Washington can determine the future for Roe v. Wade, if immigrant families get together and health to the global economy.
Disabling is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes further than being an informed citizen when you find yourself at six o'clock to see a panel of experts discussing Bob Woodward's use of sources with "deep background" for the book "Fair," Paul Manafort said bomber jackets of the steels to $15,000 ("a plague driven by arrogance", said Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniel's anxious description of Trump's, eh, anatomy.
Personally, I'm never going to look at Super Mario the same way again.
“Parts of what he does that makes it feel like a reality program is that he gives you something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, the daily leader of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “Pawn Stars”, about the show that goes on with Trump's employees and day-to-day disputes (go into a fight with NFL, Rose Kim Jong-un).

When I met Fleiss this week, it was over 25 degrees and sun outside his home on the northern coast of Kauai, but he sat inside and looked at MSNBC while he took up CNN.
He could not turn away, not when Brett Kavanaugh stood before the Senate Commission and the future of the Supreme Court hanging in a thin thread.
"I remember when we made all these sparrows show before in time and people said "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," said Fleiss.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

Money from the outside flows into the densest range
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania, in its 17th district, sees an abundance of money, thanks to a conversion of the Congressional districts that led to two sitting members fighting at the same seat.
The recently surrounded urban district of Pittsburgh is being promoted by Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district through a special election in the spring last year.
Lamb is fighting against another seated member, Republican Keith Rothfus, today a representative of the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, who is largely overlapping with the new 17th district.
The map was re-drawed after the Supreme Court in Pennsylvania in January found that the old districts were unlawfully designed to win the Republicans.
Competition in the 17th district has launched an arm's length of funding for the campaigns, between the major parties' money-launderings, the Democratic Congressional Committee and the Republican Congressional Committee.
Lamb was a well - known name in Pennsylvania after a button says in a close selection of specialties in Pennsylvania’s 18th Congressional District.
The seat had been heard by a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district with over 20 points.
Political experts have given democracies a little bit of benefit.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador on the basis of support for China, but withdrew
Diplomats note that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognised Beijing without negative reactions from Washington.
Trump had a warm meeting with the president of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama to throw out partners from the Trump Group.
The Secretarys of State decided to return the American diplomatic mission leaders from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama to the "last decisions to no longer recognise Taiwan", said Heather Nauert, the spokeswoman of the department, in an early appointment this month.
However, punishment was only assessed against El Salvador, which received estimated US$ 140 million in 2017, including drug control, development and financial support.
The proposed penalties, which included cuts to financial support and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and their high unemployment and murder.
As the internal meeting developed, North American and Central American officials were exposed to a conference on security and economic well-being to follow up a similar collection last year that was seen as a step forward to prevent immigrants from coming to the United States.
However, in mid-September, the top managers informed them that they wanted the conference to continue, and therefore put a stop to the assessment of the punishment for El Salvador.
It has now been said that vis-à-vis President Mike Pence will meet the conference, which has been planned in mid-October, as a signal of the relevance of the administration's meeting, the diplomats said.
And the three American broadcasts returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new bold messages or punishments from Washington.
A Bolton speaker would not comment on the details of the debate described by the three American service ministers, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal comments on the introduction of anonymity.
Their description was confirmed by a non-intellectual analyst who works closely with the administration and does not speak under the assumption of anonymity.
History Study
A waiting for Special Adviser Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possible obstacles to justice, which is now significant evidence of in the public protocols.
According to the reports, Mueller must have turned his attention in the search for whether Trump's campaign plotted with Russia would have come up with an attack on our choice.
If the Congress were to exchange governors, Trump would have to stand right in this body, in which he prepares to convince the electors and perhaps a jury of his peers.
It is very ‘whatever’, and I do not mean to suggest that Trump's case is inevitable – also for his opponent in Europe.
It's a choice to take us all on both sides of the pond, which will affect how long the fight can be.
In 1938, German officers were ready for a coup against Hitler, only the West had stood against him and helped the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and missed a chance to avoid years with bloodbath this led.
The course of history revolves around such a turning point, and democracy is accelerated or postponed its inevitable march.
The Americans are facing several of these turning points now.
What will we do if Trump kicks the Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been on deep water since this paper revealed that he proposed to hear the president secretly, and speculated whether he was inappropriate for his role.
Rosenstein says The Times' description is incorrect.
“How will we react if the recently asked FBI investigator by Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair – or is he accepted by the Supreme Court despite credible charges of sexual abuse and unfair testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the middle election for a congress that keeps Trump responsible?
If we fail these tests, democracy will face a long winter.
But I don't think I'm wrong because of what I learned in Praha.
My mother was a Czech Slovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime as once occupied the country I have my ambassador in.
She survived, immigrated to the United States, and 60 years later she sent me out of guard to light the Sabbath lights on the table asking for the Swaziland.
When this is my legacy, how can I not be optimistic about the future?

Rangers Graham Dorrans is optimistic before the Rapid Vienna meeting
Rangers accept Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that they are saying about the Austrians, after an impressive undecided in Spain against Villareal earlier this month, will give them a good starting point to qualify from Group G of the European League.
A crash prevented the middle-way player Graham Dorrans from performing his first performance this season before the 2-2 result against Villareal, but he believes Rangers can use this result as a jumpboard for bigger things.
"It was a good score for us, because Villareal is a good team," said the 31st.
“We went into the fight with confidence that we could get something, and came out again with a score.
Maybe we could take it at the end, but everything is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, and then we came out in the second half and it was better.
On Thursday it will still be a great European evening.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it's going to be a tough fight, and they got a good result in their previous fight, but with the audience behind us, I'm sure we can run and get a positive result.
The last year has definitely been tough, with everything that's happened to my injuries and changes in the club, but now everything feels good.
The stable is good and the guts are good; training is good.
Hopefully we can run now, put past season behind us and be successful."
Women lose sleep over this fear of retirement
Despite the fact that participants in a survey had clear thoughts about how they would be taken care of, few spoke to family members about it.
About half of those who participated in a survey by the insurance company Nationwide said they were talking to their spouses about the long-term care costs.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their kids about it.
“People want a family member to take care of themselves, but they don’t take the necessary steps to have that conversation,” said National Council President Holly Snyder.
Here you go.
Talk to your spouse and your young ones: You cannot prepare your family to take care of yourself if you do not wish for your well-known time in advance.
Cooperation with a counselor and your family to discuss how and how to receive care, as these options can be a major part of determining the costs.
Get an economic advisor: Your advisor can also help you figure out how to pay for these expenses.
Long-term care funding options may include a traditional long-term care insurance, a life insurance with cash to help pay the expenses, or that you yourself are insured with your own wealth - as long as you have the money.
Create legal document: Reject legal campaigns before they start.
Get a health authority in place, so you appoint a person you trust to supervise your medical treatment and to ensure that professionals are acting in line with your wishes if you cannot communicate.
You can also assess a mandate for your finances.
You should select a person you trust to make economic decisions and make sure that your bills are paid if you do not have the possibility.
Don't forget the little details: Make sure your old parent has a medical emergency and is going to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write down all these details in a written plan, so you are ready.
"It's not just the finances, it's not just the money, but who's the legal person?" asked Martin.
«What kind of medicine is it?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Have a plan ready.’
Man shot several times with air weapons in Ilfracombe
A man has been shot several times with an air rifle in what he was on his way home after a tour of the city.
The victim for 40 years was in the area around Oxford Grove in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hands.
Politicians describe the shooting, which occurred around 02.30 local time, as a ‘random action’.
The victim did not see the attacker.
His injuries are not life threatening, and the police ask for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a massive earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, public servicemen say. The number of deaths is expected to increase.
Without the possibility of communicating, assistant workers have not received any information from Dongala, a region north of Palu that was more episthetized for the scar who had a strength of 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster was a fact.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Dongala, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central Sulawesi province and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesiøa. Estimated population in 2017 was 379 800.
The city celebrates its 40th anniversary when the storm and tsunami hit.
Dongala is an area that extends over 300 km with a coastline northwest of the island.
The area, which is an administrative region lower than a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and gardening are the berth of the economy of the central Sulawesi province, especially in the Dongala coastal region.
Nickel winning is and is important in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the other side of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years, following the disaster reduction office in Indonesia.
In 1938 more than 200 people were killed and hundreds of houses destroyed by a tsunami in Dongala.
In 1996, the west side of Dongala was hit by a tsunami that killed nine people.
Indonesia lies in the Seismic Fire in the Pacific Ocean and becomes the framework of earthquake.
Here are some of the great scars and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on 26 December, triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Sea, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A number of major earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra at the end of March and the beginning of April.
Several hundred died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake with a magnitude of 6.8 hit south in Java, the most populous island of Indonesia, and triggered a tsunami that crept into the south coast and took the lives of almost 700 people.
2009: An earthquake with strength 7.6 hit near the city of Padang, capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people have mixed lives.
2010: An earthquake of 7.5 hit one of the Mentawai islands outside Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of about 10 metres to destroy dozens of villages and took the lives of about 300 people.
2016: A small earthquake hit the Pidie Jaya area in Aceh and caused destruction and panic when people were reminded of the earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
No tsunami was triggered this time, but more than 100 lost lives were caused by buildings that rustled.
2018: Great earthquake hit the Lombok island and took the life of more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
Screamed destruction of several thousand buildings and left several thousand tourists temporarily beached.
The oldest son of Sarah Palin arrested and targeted for election in the world
Track Palin, the oldest son of former governor in Alaska and vice president Sarah Palin, has been arrested, aimed at assault.
Following a report released by the state police in Alaska, Palin (29) was arrested on suspicion of election in the world, involved in reporting elections in the world and opposed arrest.
According to the police report, he took the phone from a female acquaintance when she tried to call the police to report the crime.
Palin will be imprisoned in the Mat-Su prison, and will be held against bail $500, reported KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday and declared himself "not guilty" when he was asked, enter the network.
Palin faces three crimes in Class A, which means he can be imprisoned for up to one year and get $250,000 in fines.
He's also been targeted for a class B crime, which can be punished with a day in prison and a fine of $200.
It's not the first time Palin has been accused of something criminal.
In December 2017, he was summoned to attack his father, Todd Palin.
Mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is up in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was targeted for attacks in the world, involved in a reporting of elections in the world, and held a weapon while he was engaged in the event.
His girlfriend had claimed that he hit her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticised by veterans after linking her son’s elective behaviour to PTSD from the time he served in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of lives lost
At least 384 people have lost their lives after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The quake, with a magnitude of 7.5, triggered a tsunami and has destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are down, and the number of people dying is expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake hit right outside the central part of Sulawesi, located north of the capital Jakarta.
Videos that show the dramatic moment when the tremor hits, flourish on social media.
Several hundred people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the shore.
Federal actors will have a rare death penalty for suspicion in New York's terror
Federal actors in New York will have a death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, suspected of having killed eight people -- a rare penalty that has not been committed for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov (30) is supposed to have used a car from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bicycle road along the West Side Highway in lower Manhattan in October, where he drove down pedestrians and cyclists on the road.
In order to justify a death penalty, the actors must be able to prove that Saipov killed the eight victims ‘by will’ and that he ‘by will’ inflicted serious bodily harm, following a note that is archived in the southern district of New York.
Both of these events may be the basis for a possible death penalty, as stated in the legal document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury issued a list of 22 focal points, including eight murders aimed at money-expression, usually used by federal actors in connection with organised crime, and a target for the choice and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for ‘essential planning and covering’, said the actors and described how Saipov carried out the attack as ‘degradable, cruel and destructive’.
‘Sayfull Habibullaevic Saipov caused damage and loss to family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco’, says the note.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the southern district of New York sentenced to death in one case.
Khalid Barnes was sentenced to life by two doppelgangers, but was finally sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being sentenced to conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
On June 19, 1953, both were executed in the electric chair.
Saipov, originally from Uzbekistan, showed a lack of information during the days and months following, in accordance with legal documents.
He told the detectives that he had done well, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching videos from ISIS on the phone, it is stated.
He also asked to have the ISIS flag in the hospital room, the police said.
He's not guilty at all.
David Patton, one of the federal, public defenders representing Saipov, says that they are "clearly disappointed" with determined authority of the prosecution.
“We believe that the decision to go after a death penalty rather than accept a declaration of guilt for life in prison without the possibility of release will only prolong the dream from the event for all involved,” Patton said.
Saipov's defenders had previously asked the actors not to go after the death penalty.
Member of Parliament in Tory of my Nigel Farage should hire Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilise the People's Army" today, during a protest at the Tory country meeting.
The former leader of the British Independence Party said that the politicians had to "feel the pressure" of the Eurosceptics – suggesting that one of their parliamentarians, Theresa May, would hire the negotiations with the EU.
The conservative, minority member Peter Bone told the protesters in Birmingham that the United Kingdom "had been out" now if Farage was Brexit Minister.
The challenge facing May is to reconcile its deep split lines has been underlined by a separate protest in the city, rather than by Tories who want to be in the EU.
The Minister of State was tired of planning the Chequers compromise on the right track after Brexitees, Remainers and the EU.
Allied insists that she will press for an agreement with Brussels in spite of the retreat – and force the Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between its package and its ‘caustics’.
Bone told the Leave Means Leave Group in Solihull that he wanted to "reject Checkers"
He suggested that Farage should be given a fair standing and responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had managed, I would be out now," he said.
Member of Parliament from Wellingborough added, 'I will fight for Brexit, but we must reject the Chequers'.
To mark his opposition to the EU, he said: "We do not fight world wars to be subordinated.
We will make our own promises in our own country.”
Bone rejects the claim that the opinion of the people has changed since the 2016 election: "The idea that the British people have changed their opinion and wish to become is totally inappropriate".
Brexit's fights from Tory, Andrea Jenkins, also took part in the march. She told reporters: "I say only: Minister of State, listen to the people!"
«Chequers are not popular in the population, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular in our party or our activists who frequent the streets and get us selected at the beginning.
Please, drop the Chequers and right after»
In a message addressed to May, add it: "The administrators keep their jobs when they keep their promises".
The danger was that politicians would have to "know the heat" if they were to betray the decisions made in the polls in 2016.
"Now it's about trust between us - the people - and the political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them that "we're not going to let them get away with it."
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: "I want to have a dive of the political class, which is about to betray Brexit, to recognize the heat.
"We mobilize the people's army in this country who gave us the Brexit saying and must not rest until we have become an independent, self-controlled, proud United Kingdom.
At the same time, Remainers marched through the streets of Birmingham before they held a two-hour meeting downtown.
A hand-made activist fan with "Tories Against Brexit" banners after launching the group this weekend.
Labour colleague Lord Adonis made some of the conservatives of the security problems they had with a party app during the opening of the conference.
"This is human beings who tell us that they can have all the data systems in place and all the technology for Canada plus, for a free friction limit, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a total grandfather.
There's nothing like a good Brexit," he added.
The Warehouse plans to take a careful look at the presidential election
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will take "a careful look at the presidential election" after the November election.
Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat was talking about the future during a city meeting in Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, re-elections in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was but a member of Trump's campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She has our focus too much speculation that she might try against Trump in 2020.
The events in Holyoke on Saturday were her 36th meeting with electors in a councilhouse since Trump joined.
One participant asked if she had plans to make a presidential election.
Warren replied that it is time “that women take the trip to Washington to fix our corrupt government, and it includes a woman at the top.”
Arrested in the shooting of Louisiana State University players Sims
The Baton Rouge police announced on Saturday that a suspect has been arrested in the case of the basketball player from Louisiana State University (LSU), Wayde Sims, remained shot and killed Friday.
At 11 a.m. local time, the police announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson (20), in a press conference for ET.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday, and asked for help to identify a man set on the video.
Sims (20) was shot and killed early Friday in the southern part of the university.
"Wayde Sims got a bullet wound in his head and eventually died as a result of it," said police chief Murphy J. Paul to the media on Saturday, writing 247 sports.
Wayde went in to defend a friend and stayed shot by Simpson.
In response, Simpson has admitted that he was in the city, with the weapon, and admitted that he shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without drama and put in custody at the police department in eastern Baton Rouge.
A third year student of nearly two meters, raised in Baton Rouge. Sims played 32 camps, ten of them from the beginning last season, where he had on average 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 returns in each match.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the title of the world after the Lagordra give says about Sebastian Vettel
It became clear from the moment Valteri Bottas qualified himself in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the warehouses from Mercedes came to have a great role in the course.
Bottas got a good start in the course, and let Hamilton take care of himself in what he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack the teammate.
Vettel was first in the depot and the fate of Hamilton came into traffic at the rear of the track, something that should be crucial.
The Mercedes drove into the depot a round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton had gone ahead after a little action side-by-side that made the Ferrari driver counterville had to let the inside be free in order not to defend himself at the third corner.
Max Versteppen started, on his 21-year-old day, on the back row and lay in the seventh place at the end of the first round.
After that, he led large parts of the course as he went for a quick conclusion with the aim of running past the Kimi Raikkonen who was in fourth place.
He entered the depot in the 44th round, but could not increase the speed of the last eight rounds while the Raikkonen got a fourth place.
It's a difficult day, because Valteri did a great job all weekend, and was a real gentleman who missed me.
The team has done an exceptional job that has both the first and the second," said Hamilton.
It was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump made a fool of Senator Diane Feinstein on an election Saturday because of her insistence that she did not leave the letter from Christine Blasey Ford where she refers to the highest-ranking board of Kavanaugh for sexual abuse.
In a speech at an election meeting in West Virginia, the President did not mention the testimony Ford had given directly to the Senate, but also commented that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "bad and fall and speak abusively".
"The perfect thing that can happen, and the beautiful thing that has happened in the last days of the Senate, when you see the mind, when you see people who are bad and bad and uncomfortable and speak abusively," he said.
"When you look at publications and leaks and then say "Oh, I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Do you think it's dark?
Diane Feinstein, did you?
Thinks her answer turned out... you left the document -- "Oh, uh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't do it."
Please wait.
No, we didn't," he added, while he imitated the senator.
Feinstein received the letter with details of the call to Kavanaugh from Ford in July, and it was played earlier in September--but Feinstein refused to let the leak come from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's remarks, I didn't leave her story," Feinstein told the committee, in The Hill.
“She asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential, which she asked about.”
But her refusal did not fall into good ground with the president, who commented at the Saturday's election: "I say drown, it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
While he continues to defend the Supreme Court, who has been accused of three women's bad sexual behavior, the president suggested that the Democrats used the tactics for their own gain.
‘You are determined to regain power in all the ways that they consider necessary.
You see the badness, the badness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to run to get power and control," said the president in Mediaite.
Eliteligen: Dundee Stars - Belfast Giants (5-3)
Patrick Dwyer score two goals for Giants versus Dundee
The stars from Dundee compensated for the loss of Belfast Giants on Friday to win the 5-3 return campaign on Saturday.
Giants got an early two-way lease because of an attack by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie paid off before Dwyer again sent Giants to the rental.
Francois Bouchard compensated for Dundee before two goals of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen won the victory.
It was the third loss in the league this season for the Gutanes to Adam Keefe, who beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday.
This was the fourth meeting between the creation of this season, where Giants has won the last three matches.
The opening of Dwyer came in the fourth minute after an assistant from Kendall McFaul, and David Rutherford served an assistant to Beauvillier as a double rental four minutes later.
In what was a travel opening period, Sullivan took home in the game again in the 14th minute, before Matt Marquardt provided compensation to Cownie in the 16th minute.
Dwyer assures that Giants took the rent on a break when he scored his second goal for the night on the drum of the first round.
The home team regrouped, and Bouchard once again provided an equation with a radiant goal after 27 minutes played.
Late in the second round, co-operate with Cownie and Charles Corcoran to help Nielsen get Dundee's rent for the first time in the fight. He, on the other hand, secured the winner with the fifth goal of the team half-way in the last round.
Giants, who have now lost four of the last five campaigns, meet Milton Keynes' home in the next match, which is Friday.
Flight rentals lose their lives to ensure that hundreds of aircraft escape earthquakes
A flight rental in Indonesia will be hailed as a whole after he loses his life in what he continues to ensure that a plane with several hundred passengers arrived safely in the air.
More than 800 people have lost their lives and many are missing after a great earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi and triggered a tsunami on Friday.
Strong aftershocks continue to disturb the area, and there are many who are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
But despite the fact that his colleagues fled for life, Antonius Gunawan Agung (21) refused to leave his post in the control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu, even though it was wild.
He stayed to make sure that the plane on the runway, Batik Air Flight 6321, took off safely.
He then jumped down from the tower when he thought it was a collapse.
He later died at the hospital.
The spokesperson for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirat, said that the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, reported ABC News Australia.
We sent a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in a larger city.
Unfortunately, he left this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"This is heartbreaking," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities are afraid of a number of deaths will increase to thousands, while the country’s crisis relief agency says that access to small towns in Dongala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The number of deaths increases while we find bodies trapped under buildings. Many of them cannot reach us," said the bureauman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves up to six meters have destroyed Palu, which should hold a mass graveyard on Sunday.
Emergency assistance comes in with military and commercial aircraft.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said to Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance comes with several bodies.
It's hard to find clean water.
Small shops have become thieves.’
Jan Gelfand, the leader of the Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is trying to help the survivors, but we don't know what they will find when they arrive.
This is already a tragedy, but it may get much worse."
The president of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, came to Palu on Sunday and said to the military in the country: "I beg everyone to work around the day to do everything they can to help with the evacuation.
Are they ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia earlier this year was struck by earthquakes in Lombok, and 550 people died.
Aeroplane Management in Micronesia: Air Niugini reports now that you are missing from the Lagoon Air Force
The carrier operating an aeroplane controlled in a lagoon in Micronesia in the Pacific reported that a man was missing, having previously stated that all 47 of the passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the aeroplane before it went down.
Air Niugini said that from Saturday afternoon they don't know where the human passenger is.
The airline said they work with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to find the man.
The airline gave no more details about the passenger, and his age and nationality are unknown.
Local shipowners helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water when it tried to land at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
On Friday, the authorities said that seven persons had been sent to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still at the hospital on Saturday, and all were in stable condition.
It's still unknown what's causing the steering wheel and what's actually her.
Both the airline and the American Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon not far from the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane was flying past the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was very low.
"It was extremely good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes made sure that he and other passengers were able to wash through the water, which led them up to life, to the emergency exits of the plane before it went down.
He said that the flight crew had panicked and screamed, and he pulled on a head injury that was not serious.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors in the vicinity, who were working to repair a cabin, also saved passengers with a rubber boat they used to transport passengers to land before the plane dropped about 30 metres.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network website shows that 111 people have died under the control of the PNG-registered airline their aircraft for the last 20 years, but none of them flew with Air Niugini.
Analyticals make timelines over the night when women were burned alive
The authorities presented all the evidence on Saturday during the previous trial for a man to burn a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett witnessed for several hours as an expert witness in intelligence analysis.
He prepared for the jury how he put together recordings from mobile phones to find out what she was when Jessica Chambers (19) was killed by the spokesperson, Quinton Tellis (29).
According to the newspaper The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said that he used location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chamber's evening he killed, in contrast to what Tellis explained earlier.
When the location data showed that Tellis had his cell phone with Chambers at the same time as he said he was with friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he was out of town that day.
Then the interviewer asked Tellis if he was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said that he was "laughing, because my car was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis said he knew Chambers in about two weeks when she died.
But their mobile phone bills showed that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that a moment after Chambers died, delete Tellis' messages, calls and Chambers' contact information from his cell phone.
"He wiped her out of her life," said Hale.
The defence will end the case on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the case to go to the jury later that day.

Artists The Fugees of Common have become more popular in the United Kingdom through the artists Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
New York City children's passport seeks a pair of kicks after a "racist" text message
A child passenger in New York seeks a couple to give her a divorce based on discrimination after receiving a wrong text message from a mother who complained that she was "one black person."
The couple refused to be racist and compared the case with "expression."
Lynsey Plasco-Faxman, mother to two, was dissatisfied when she saw that the passenger she had added, Giselle Maurice, was black when she first came to work in 2016.
"NOEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEI, ONE A SEARCH PERSON," Plasco-Faxman wrote in a text message to her husband.
But instead of sending a message to her husband, he sent it to the passenger Maurice, twice.
After admitting her mistake, the inappropriate Plasco-Faxman fired the Maurice child passenger, and said that the former child passenger, who was afro-American, had done a bad job, so now she would have someone from the Philippines, followed The New York Post.
Maurice was paid for one day's work before they sent her home in a Uber.
Now Maurice's getting compensation for giving her a kick, she's gonna have $350 a day for six months for her job, even though she was without a contract where she was to stay with her family.
‘I want to show them that it’s not right to do that,’ she said to The New York Post on Friday, and added, ‘I know it’s discrimination.’
The couple denied that they were racist, and said that giving Maurice the shot was the only thing they could do after having offended her, of whom they were afraid that she would come to take revenge.
"My wife had sent something to her that she didn't mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist," said the husband Joel Plasco to The New York Post.
"But would you let someone you've offended look after your children, even if you didn't mean to offend them?
Your newborn baby?
Think about it."
Plasco compared the case to "expressing", and said that his wife was seven months pregnant and was in a "very difficult situation."
"Are you really going to attack a person in such a situation?
It's not a nice thing to do," said the investor Plasco.
As the case goes on, public authorities are quick to judge the couple on social media, and criticise them for their behaviour and logic.
The layout behind Paddington's books was afraid people wouldn't like a talking bear, revealing a new letter
The daughter of author Michael Bond, who was born shortly after the approval of the first book, commented: “It is difficult to see for herself how it was to read the book for the first time before it was published.
It's very funny to know now how successful Paddington was."
Jankel said that her father, who worked as a cameraman for BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book on the wet teddy bear, would be optimistic even if the book had been rejected.
When it comes to Paddington, whom she described as “a very important member of the family,” she said that her father was proud of the extent of his success.
"He was a pretty quiet man, and he never broke," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having children who achieved something: you get proud of them yourself if it isn't you who's behind.
I think he saw Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his creation and fantasy, he always gave all praise to Paddington himself."
My daughter was supposed to die and I had to say good-bye on the phone
When her country was taken to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice in all haste, how much medical work is forgiven to save her life.
“When I called regularly to say that it was really bad, that they didn’t think she was coming to it,” said Ednan-Laperous.
"So Nad called to say that she came to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I am so happy in you, dear.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be right back.
The doctors had given her to keep her heart pumping was slow on the way out of her system.
She had already died and now the body was about to turn off.
I just sat there, knowing that this was happening.
I couldn't laugh or scream, because I was in a room surrounded by family and people.
I really had to hold everything."
In the end, Ednan-Laperous, who now took care of the loss of her daughter, had to board the plane with other passengers who did not know what she had just gone through.
"You didn't know anything," he said.
«I sat with my head bent while the tears fell.»
It's hard to explain, but it was on the plane that I knew how much sympathy I had for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how happy he was with her."
Providing women hang patches on bridges to prevent suicide
Two women who lost their loved ones who took suicide are trying to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have attached notes to a bride in Wales who is going to inspire and get people who are thinking of killing themselves to redefine themselves and call the numbers on the notes.
Davis, his son Tyler, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and took his life when he was 18.
‘I don’t want any parents to know themselves as I know myself every day.’
Davis, aged 45 and living in Lydney, said her son was a talented cook with a smile that infected.
"Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They said that his smile lit up all the rooms."
But before he died he ended up at work, because he was in a "very dark place."
In 2014, the 11-year-old brother of Tyler was the first to find Tyler after he had taken his own life.
Davis said: “I am still concerned that the cousin may have been affected by Tyler’s death.”
Davis wrote the notes "to let people know that there are other people out there who care and who they can talk to, even if there is a friend.
Don't sit there. You have to talk to someone."
Humphreys, who has been friends with Davis for many years, lost her partner Mark after they had been together for 15 years and he had recently lost his mother.
“He never said he was sick or depressed or anything,” she said.
«A few days before Christmas I noticed that he began to behave differently.
He was in the basement emotionally on Christmas Day, when the children opened their presents he didn't see at the entrances."
He said that his death was very traumatic for the children, and they continued working through the dream: "There is a big void in our family now.
We're completely ruined.
But we all have to fight to live on."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in a thin thread while the FBI launches the search
“I thought that if we actually got something like what he asked us about – a limited investigation – we might get a little lonely,” said Flake on Saturday, and added that he was rescued by the committee “couple together” in the middle of a party-class.
Why would Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
They're nuts because of the clock.
The mid-term elections in the United States are only five weeks away, on 6 November, and if the Republicans do not do so well, this will make it difficult for them to choose Kavanaugh in the U.S. Right.
George W. Bush has called senators to get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and was introduced to his wife Ashley in that way, then he was the secretary of Bush.
What happens when the FBI presents its report?
They're going to vote in the Senate, 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's still unclear if Kavanaugh is able to gather at least 50 voices in the Senate.
Number of runners in North Korea 'go down' under Kim
The number of South Korean runners to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, reports a South Korean legislator
Park Byeong-seug referred to data from the South Korean Association Department, and said it was 1127 runners last year – compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park said that more stringent borders between North Korea and China and more expensive smuggling charges are the main reasons for the decline.
Pyongyang has not spoken publicly.
Most of North Korea's couples are receiving South Korean citizenship.
Seoul reports that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most refugees via China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the strictly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korean countries.
China looks at refugees as illegal immigrants, not refugees, and often sends them back by force.
The relations between North and South Korea – which are still purely technically at war – have improved over the past few months.
This month the leaders of the two Pyongyang countries met to negotiate the disarmament of nuclear weapons.
These talks come after the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed to work for an atomic-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho owes the US not to get any page then.
"Without relying on the United States, we cannot trust that our country is safe, and in such a situation we cannot first defeat our weapons," said Ri in a speech in the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical," and says he can't serve in the upper right.
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated for the upper right, "hysterical" and said that he has too much temperament to serve in the upper left.
Pelosi calls Kavanaugh "hysterical" in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
‘I know that if a woman had acted in that way, she had been called ‘hysterical’,’ said Pelosi about the burden of witness to Kavanaugh in front of the Senate judge on Thursday.
Kavanaugh was emotionally and refused all allegations that he sexually harassed Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In the opening talk of Kavanaugh, he was very emotional and shouted at times with a lump in his throat as he told about his family and years of going on.
He criticised the Democrats in the committee and called the attacks on him "grotess and a planned attack on his reputation," organised by liberal politicians who were afraid Hillary Clinton did not win the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi added that she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proves that he can't serve in the upper right, because it shows that he's prejudiced against democrats.
“I believe that the way he acted he disqualified himself, and what he said about the Clinton family and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi came with an objection when she was asked if she would try to get Kavanaugh to leave if he was elected to the right-hand side, and if the Democrats get a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I can say this – if he doesn’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he can’t serve in the upper right, nor in the right he holds now,” said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is a judge in Washington D.C.'s Federal Court of Appeal.
Pelosi also said that as a democrat she is concerned about potential Kavanaugh judgments against the law known as Obamacare and the case of Roe vs. Wade, because Kavanaugh is known to be a conservative judge.
In his hearings to confirm Kavanaugh, he avoided answering questions as to whether he had come to turn certain decisions into the upper right.
“It’s not the right time for a hysterical, judgmental person in the upper right who expects us to say he’s great,” Pelosi said.
And women must bend the sword
It's a fair, bitter criticism, after months and years of rage, and she doesn't get it out without crying.
"We went when we're sick," Steinem said to me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
She went on, "I got a lot of help from a woman in a high position of firm, who said that she was cheating when she was sick, but developed a technique as she said to the person who made her sick so that she was, "You think I'm sorry because I'm crying.
I'm sick."
And then she just keeps going.
I think it was brilliant.
Tears work as a way to get the mind out, but there are many who misunderstand.
In one of my strongest memories of a previous job, where most of my colleagues were men, I was in a situation where I thought of myself, and a woman who was older than me took me in my head – she was a cold leir that I had always been alive for – and pulled me out at once.
"Never let them see you crying," she said to me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sorry and they won because they made you cry."
Patricia Schroeder, who at the time was a congresswoman, a Democrat from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaign.
In 1987, Hart was taken into exile on a boat called Monkey Business, and withdrew from the campaign. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, thought she could just as well hold elections as president herself.
"I didn't really think through it well enough," she said to me while she was lo, 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates who made the choice, and the last one they needed was another candidate.
Someone calls the situation «Snow White and the Seven Dwarves».
Since the campaign had already taken place for a while, she had not collected enough money, so she promised that she would just keep quiet if she could collect $2 million.
It was impossible.
He discovered that her supporters who gave $1000 to men only gave her $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she asked.
When she declared that she did not come to vote, however, she was so emotional and full of gratitude to those who had supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to collect money and aim at the voices instead of the delegates, and think of gender discrimination, that she began to cry during the speech.
"You should have thought I had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder said about how the press reacted when she spoke.
"You should have thought Kleinex was my main sponsor.
I think I thought, what are they going to write on my gravestone?
"Ho Green"?"
How the US-China Trade War Can Be Good for Beijing
The openings of the trade war between the US and China were ominous, and while the battle continues, a rapture between the two countries could be an advantage for Beijing in the long term, experts say.
US President Donald Trump shot the first shot this year to tax important Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The battle escalated this week, with tariffs on articles worth over $200 billion, which in effect means that half of all goods from China to the United States are taxed.
Beijing has taken home and set tariffs at between five and ten percent of American goods worth $60 billion.
China is allowed to respond to each shot of the four of them, and the next largest economy in the world is most likely not to go down with the first.
To end Washington, China must do what the USA wants, but to go to the U.S. is too much for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing keeps its head cold, the American press may have a positive effect on the Chinese economy in the long term, by reducing the degree of dependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a sharp political decision in Washington or Beijing can get both economies to go under is more dangerous than people should have to admit before,” said Abigail Grace, a researcher focusing on Asia at the Center for American Security, a think tank.
Syria 'clear' for return of refugees, says the Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria says they are ready to accept refugees who will return voluntarily, and ask for help to rebuild the country destroyed after more than seven years in war.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that relations in the country are making progress.
“Today the situation on the ground is more stable and secure, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism”, he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists in order to regain normal areas.
All entry points are now in place for refugees to return voluntarily to the country they had to travel in from the ground of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that went beyond their daily life and bread.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million acids have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian government would like to help rebuild the ruined country.
But he pointed out that they would not accept assistance or help under the conditions of the country that sponsored the rebellion.
Europe ensures statements in Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won Ryder Cup 2018 when they beat the American team with a final score of 16.5 against 10.5 in Le Golf National outside Paris in France.
The United States has now lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe took back the crown in the team of the Danish captain, Thomas Bjørn, reached the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
The American star, Phil Mickelson, dragged most of the tournament. He hit the ball in the water from the tea at the hole 16, pair 3, and therefore gave the winner to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari did well in all its rounds and became one of four players who had received 5-0-0 since the tournament started its current format in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was turned off 5-4-4 by the player with the lowest ranking on the European team, Danish Thorbjørn Olesen.
Dustin Johnson, with the highest rank in the world, remained 2 and 1 after English Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The Spanish veteran Sergio Garcia, who participated in eight Ryder Cupar, became the winning European with 25.5 points in his career.
"I don't usually go, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
So grateful Thomas chose me and trusted me.
I'm so, so glad to get the trophy back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could help," said an emotional Garcia after the European winner.
He will pass the stick on to the countryman John Ram, who beat the American golf legend Tiger Woods 2+1 in a single game on Sunday.
"I know a great pride in beating Tiger Woods, I grew up looking at him," said Rahm (23).
Woods lost all four of his campaigns in France, and now has a merit list of 13-21-3 in Ryder Cup up through his career.
An interesting statistics from one of the world's best players, who has won 14 large titles and is only turned on by Jack Nicklaus.
The American team managed to find the fairway all weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who impressed with golf at a high level throughout the entire tournament.
Jim Furyk, the U.S. captain, said after a disappointing demonstration from his team. "I'm proud of these gutans, those fights.
There were periods this morning where we made it hot for Europe.
Shut up.
Hat off for Thomas.
He's a lone captain.
All the 12 players he played were very good.
We will regroup, work with PGA in America and our committee for Ryder Cup and move on.
I love these 12 guts and I'm proud to be captain.
One must remove the hat.

Update on diaphragms: Reduced concentration in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report by the Florida Committee on Fisheries and Animal Life (FWC) shows a general reduction in the concentration of dinoflagellates in the area around Tampa Bay.
Following FWC it is reported that there are uneven growth conditions in the areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and around Collier - something that suggests a reduction in concentration.
A growth of dinoflagellates extends beyond 200 km on the coastline from the northern Pinellas to the southern regions of Lee.
Areas with dinoflagellates are located about 16 km off the coast at Hillsborough, but compared to last week there are fewer areas.
Dinoflagellates have been observed in Pasco.
It has been reported about medium concentration in Pinellas last week, low to high concentration along the coast of Hillsborough, low concentration in Manatee, high concentration along the coast of Sarasota, medium concentration in Charlotte, high concentration in Lee and low concentration in Collier.
Airways irritation is still reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
Airways irritation was not reported northwestern in Florida last week.
