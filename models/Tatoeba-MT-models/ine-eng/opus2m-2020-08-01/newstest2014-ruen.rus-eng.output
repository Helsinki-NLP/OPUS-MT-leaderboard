In China and the area, two men committed suicide
Earlier, one of the hanged had already attempted suicide.
On 30 October, about 1-00, in the village of Lugova, the man of birth committed suicide by an increase in his residence in 1947.
It is known that he had tried suicide before.
What led a man to such a move is not known.
On 31 October, at 11-50, a 41-year-old man, a resident of China, died at the place of residence.
No signs of violent death were found, reported Chinese TV press service.
You got a black box in your car?
While U.S. road designers are trying to find money to repair the exhausting road system, many are starting to see a solution in a small black box, which is perfectly equipped on your car’s dashboard.
These devices, which track each vehicle miles and transmit this information to officials, are at the heart of a controversial attempt to modernize the aging system of the American highways financed by the Washington and State planning bodies.
Usually, the busy field of road planning suddenly gave rise to intense debates and colourful alliances.
The Liberians joined environmental groups in lobbying for the Government ' s right to use small boxes to track the number of miles you have spent, and perhaps even where you are going, and then use this information when drawing up tax accounts.
A conversational movement in shock.
The American Union for Civil Liberties is also deeply concerned and raises a number of issues relating to private life.
Although the convention could not be agreed, continued or not, several states were not expected.
They are thinking about how to move to a system where drivers pay for every mile of the road they travel.
Thousands of motorists have already tested these black boxes, some of which have a satellite tracking function.
This is really necessary for our country.
“This is not the issue we may have the right to choose,” said Hassan Ihrat, Executive Director of the Association of Governments of Southern California, who is preparing plans to start monitoring the authorities of the state by 2025.
There will be changes in how we pay these taxes.
There's technology for that.
The need for this is compounded by the lack of funds from the Government Road Construction Fund, which is financed by taxes paid by Americans in car repairs.
Americans don't buy as much gas as they used to.
Cars travel more miles per gallon.
The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased for 20 years.
Politicians don't want to raise the tax on even one cent at high prices for petrol.
“The gas tax can’t be saved,” said Li Mannic, an expert on transport policy at the University of Minnesota.
In his state, 500 tracking devices were recently installed to test the faulty pay system.
“This will be the best alternative in the long term,” he said.
It's called a wrong user's salary.
It is not surprising that this idea attracts urban liberals, as tax will change the nature of road and greenhouse gas emissions, for example.
The planned bodies in California are looking at this system as they develop strategies to achieve the targets set by the ambitious laws of this state to combat global warming.
However, a member of the House of Representatives Bill Schuster (Republican, Pennsylvania), chairman of the Chamber's Transport Committee, said that he also considered the system as the most viable long-term alternative.
The Free Market Commitments at the Reason Fund are also urging drivers to pay for every mile.
“It’s not just a tax that will go into the black hole,” said Adrian Moore, Vice President of Political Affairs of Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
This movement is also supported by two former U.S. Ministers of Transport, who in 2011 called for congresses to move towards the wrong pay.
The United States Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year involving some 10,000 vehicles.
However, the leaders of the House of Representatives rejected this proposal because of the fears of rural legislators representing voters who often have to spend many miles in everyday life to get to work or to the city.
Several states and cities, however, are on their own.
The greatest enthusiasm is seen in the state of Oregon, where 5,000 drivers are attracted to participate in the largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay the state for a mile away instead of a gas tax.
The pilot project has already been completed in Nevada.
It is being considered in New York.
Illinois will test it on a limited basis with the participation of trucks.
The I-95 coalition, which includes transport departments of 17 eastern coastal states (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is exploring how they can make these changes.
This concept did not receive universal recognition.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer cars were recently equipped with these devices, the drivers were concerned that the Government could track each step.
“The concern about the “great brother” and such things is a major problem”, said Alaudin Khan, who is responsible for strategy and efficiency management in the State Transport Department of Nevada.
It wasn't what people wanted.
When the tests went full, the United States Civil Liberties Union office in Nevada warned on its website: “It will be absolutely easy to turn these devices into full-scale tracking devices”.
There is no need to create a huge, huge technological infrastructure that will inevitably expand to keep records of the daily movements of individual citizens.
Nevada is one of several states where difficult research is carried out on low-cost technology, which would allow the state authorities to teach the miles spent by the car, but without information about the place and time.
If you can do that, Han said, the society will feel more calm.
The search for this technology has led some state agencies to a small young company in California called True Mileage.
Initially, this company did not assist in the collection of State taxes.
She sought to enter the developing car insurance market, where drivers paid on the basis of a run.
However, the devices it tests attract road designers because they do not use GPS and provide a limited amount of information periodically charged with modem.
“People will be more inclined to do this if you don’t track their speed and location,” said Ryan Morrison, Executive Director of True Mileage.
There were several major errors in some of these pilot programmes of the state.
There are much less expensive and less demanding ways to do this.
In Oregon, designers are experimenting with various options for drivers.
They can choose the device with or without GPS.
Or they can totally abandon the device by deciding instead to pay a fixed fee based on the average number of miles that all inhabitants of the state travel.
In other places, they hope to sell the idea of a cautious public, forcing the devices to do more, not less.
In New York, transport officials are trying to develop a taxing device that will also be paid by parking accountants, provide “pays as you travel” insurance and collect real-time speed data from other drivers that drivers could use to avoid sampling.
“Automobiles will be attracted to the benefits they will be offered,” says the city-building document.
Some transport system designers, however, wonder if not all of the wrong pay talks are simply a huge determinant.
In the city transport commission on the San Francisco Gulf, officials said that the congress could simply overcome the bankruptcy of the confidence fund for the construction of highways by raising taxes on petrol.
An additional one-time or annual tax could be taken from drivers of hybrid cars and other persons whose vehicles do not use a lot of petrol to pay their fair share.
“There is no need for radical surgery when everything you have to do is take aspirin,” said Randy Rentschler, Director of the Legislative and Public Relations Commission.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about their private life and many other things.
EU prepares Ukraine's support for Russia's economic pressure
The European Union has a gas reserve plan for Ukraine, as well as an agreement with IMF on an emergency credit if Russia takes any measures in response to the possible signing of an association agreement between the EU and Ukraine at the Vilnius Summit.
The IMF is negotiating a standby loan, and another EU official who is directly involved in the negotiations has added that their goal is to conclude an agreement in the near future.
In addition to the potential loan from the IMF, Ukraine could receive 610 million euros from the Euro Union itself.
Analysts questioned by Reuters doubt that Ukraine and IMF are able to overcome long-standing differences in funding conditions.
There is no possibility of any reform needed to receive assistance, and the international S&P rating agency, which reduced Ukraine's sovereign rating on Friday to one level, to "B" from "B".
However, EU representatives say that IMF can show flexibility in terms of credit, taking into account Ukraine's circumstances.
In addition to the country's financial support plan, the EU has a reserve option for providing Ukraine with gas, the bulk of which is now coming from Russia.
Maybe it'll be the North Stream gas or the reverse from Slovakia.
The latter, according to officials, is the most possible and acceptable way of “insulating” Ukraine.
Analysts believe that this method of reverse deliveries to Ukraine can only be used for a few weeks, and is likely to lead to a decrease in deliveries to other regions.
"There are negotiations between EU and Ukrainian countries on how to create favourable conditions for Ukraine to import gas from other sources, not from Russia or from the same source, but on other routes," added the Reuters source.
Russia without combating urban pollution by cars
Attempts to address the transport problems of large cities have been seen in most megapolises of the world since the second half of the 20th century.
Generally, it was either the refurbishment and expansion of roads or the attempts to reduce the demand for car travel, the number of cars and the time they were used.
Singapore is a widely known example of the strict quota of private cars and the right to purchase them is being purchased in auctions.
Its price can be twice as high as the price of the car itself.
European cities, including London, have introduced an entrance fee to the city centre.
In Germany, for example, in Hamburg and Stuttgart, the so-called green zones are introduced where only cars with a certain class of high-quality fuel (including biofuels or electric cars) are allowed to enter.
The Beijing Environment Agency, for example, adopted a five-year clean-air plan of around 250 billion yuan (about $40 billion) in 2012.
As stated by the Director of the Transport Pollution Control Division of the City Environmental Protection Office of Beijing Li Kunscheng, the main objective of the five-year period is to reduce leading air pollutants by 20-35 per cent by 2017, increase in private cars to a level of not more than 6 million (currently 5.2 million) and increase in fuel consumption by no more than 5 per cent per vehicle.
According to the Agency, road transport in Beijing is now responsible for 22.5% of total air pollution.
The main programme measures include limiting the use of motor vehicles and introducing additional taxes for car owners.
In addition, urban measures “green five-year” include an accelerated transition to the euro-fuel standards compared with the rest of the country, the introduction of the local eco-standard system and the marking of cars and fuels, the restriction on the entry of cars into the central part of the city, the prohibition on the use of obsolete vehicles (including the establishment of incentive financial programmes for the replacement of old cars into hybrids or electric cars), the development of electric transport (including public and civil) and the development of public transport (including high-speed).
Beijing ' s car innovations also include a ban on all private cars operating within the fifth transport ring (of which six were in the PRC) one day a week (the corresponding information is in the vehicle number) and the issue of registration marks for cars based on the lotteries (e.g. in 2011, the first year of lotteries, the total number of private car registration permits in Beijing was only one third since 2010).
According to the current 2012-2020 Environment Programme, the number of cities with high and very high air pollution should be reduced to 128 (in 2012 it was 138).
According to the Nature, in 2011 there were 41 per cent of the emissions of pollutants into the urban atmosphere.
In Moscow, for example, emissions from cars are ten times higher than those from industry, and in St. Petersburg, nine times.
The RF is still only beginning to think about the possibilities for limiting the control of cars on the streets of cities.
The Director of the Institute of Transport and Transport Economics at VSE Michael Blinkin believes that administrative and fiscal measures aimed at suppressing the demand for road travel are obviously unpopular and can only be taken by society on the basis of their full universality.
In the case of Moscow, there is a unique problem with the structure of its car park, where there are two clusters of people who are weakly sensitive to any regulatory effects - service and personal cars, as well as "privileged" users' cars with a total of at least 200 thousand (about 5% of Moscow ' s total car fleet).
In the days of urbanists from the centre of ECOM in St. Petersburg, a study was prepared to analyse the balance of urban areas between the residential structure, the road surface and the amount of road transport.
The main findings of the researchers: the city centre provides twice as much as required, and most motorists living in the centre do not use cars every day, leaving them on parks or just on the streets for a long time.
As a result, it is proposed not to build parks but car storage centres, not to expand, but to reduce the passage (to make the streets more friendly for pedestrians) and to limit the use and location of personal transport within the territory of the historic zone (a total area of around 3212 hectares covering a number of central areas of the city).
The penalties for unauthorized street trade in Volgoda will grow at once
In the opinion of the city authorities, the increase in fines would help to order the Volgoda and free the streets from natural tents and boats.
Most street traders do not pay taxes, the product they make is often not subject to corresponding health control.
This means that wet tissue health is under threat.
Thus, the lower limit of the fine for unauthorized trade for citizens from November will be six times, from 500 rubles to 3,000 rubles, reports the Volada Administration Press Service.
Goldman Sachs warned of risks to the Russian economy
Goldman Sachs warned of increasing risks for Russia's main driver of fragile economic growth - consumption.
This is mainly a non-payment crisis for unsecured consumer loans and massive reductions in workers.
Our main concern now is not that growth has slowed down, but rather that the structure of this growth.
Recently, it has been completely responsible for consumption, which is almost free of traffic," said chief economist Goldman Sachs of Russia Clemens Grafe, presenting a quarterly report yesterday on the Russian economy.
Now the nominal wage growth in Russia is about 10%.
If inflation is 6 per cent, it will be able to provide a future consumer demand at about the current level, waiting for Goldman Sachs.
But the profitability of Russian companies is falling, so it is likely that they will be able to optimize staff costs.
Today we see a significant increase in the share of wages in GDP: if wages grow by 10%, then GDP is only by 2%, Mr. Grafe explained.
The companies faced a reduction in profitability.
If it does not grow up, it can lead to unemployment and unemployment.
The Russian business cannot raise wages, says the chief economist Barclays Capital of Russia and the CIS Vladimir Pantushin.
Unemployment close to historical minima, competition for high workers.
Employers have to raise salaries in order to change or retain current staff.
Russia's demand for support is also fuelled by a very rapid increase in consumer credit.
In Mr. Grafe ' s view, because of the very high consumer interest rates, this type of credit does not have a multiplicative effect on the country ' s economy.
"The benefits for the economy from growing consumer credit have not been seen, the money is not spent on the economy, but is returned to the same banks as interest payments," said economist.
But the problem is, Goldman Sachs is expecting a rise in the time frame for unsecured loans.
They are taken mainly by poor people who have nothing to provide.
Interest on such loans is high.
As a result, they are not returned more often," said Mr. Graffe.
The second threat to Russia ' s growth is therefore a possible non-payment crisis for unsecured loans.
The Director of the Banking Institute of VSE Vasili Soladkov has already seen the signs of the emerging banking crisis.
Small credit organizations, without access to the cheap resources available to the hosbanks, were forced to attract high-percentage funds.
In response, the gosbanks went out on the battlefield and started to lower their credit rates, the economy continued.
Small credit institutions could not issue loans under the same percentage, otherwise they would have a negative interest margin.
If the gosbanks do not give up dumping, Russia is threatening the full banking crisis, according to Vasily Soladkov.
The withdrawal of a number of banks ' licences in recent weeks has been considered by economists to be a sign of mass corruption.
"The hosbanks themselves will not be able to cope with this situation: the system of investment insurance has not initially been taken into account in the systemic crisis," warns the head of the institution.
But consumption growth will slow down and without a crisis of non-payments, they rely on the investment bank, because of the refusal to index the salaries of employees and military personnel in the current version of the budget.
Partly the impact on consumption will be mitigated by the freezing of natural monopolies tariffs (and as a result, inflation reduction).
But only in part: if investments do not grow (and the prerequisite for this is not yet seen in the report), consumption growth will still slow down, as Goldman Sachs believes.
Vladimir Pantuchin of Barclays Capital has not yet seen a prerequisite for the implementation of pessimistic scenarios.
"The main risk is still falling oil price," he says.
According to him, Russia's economy would start to decline at a cost of less than $90 per barrel.
Goldman Sachs also noted that the CB is not yet able to reduce interest rates in the economy.
A paradoxical picture is being observed: inflation has declined, and banks have started to raise their rates.
This may mean they didn't believe the CB that announced the transition to inflation," Clemens Graffe said.
The Central Bank ' s interest rate policy does not affect market rates, only affects interbank credit rates.
"For the C.B., it's a failure of all hope," said Clemens Graffe.
Money received at CB auctions is used by banks not for crediting the economy but for managing their liquidity
As soon as the rate decreases, the exchange rate changes immediately, it means that the funds are trying to get away with speculation against rubles.
"In the morning or late, the CB will realize that this strategy is not working," said Mr. Graffe, and recalled that the State is planning to release the rubble into free navigation by the end of 2015.
But it will have to do so sooner or raise the key rate of CB (5.5%), he believes.
According to him, the ruble rate is now artificially high by 10 per cent.
There's only one way to do this.
But if the CB is going to hurt the financiers, even if it has doubts that the elimination of the currency corridor is not part of the policy of weakening the arm, it can break the arm much more strongly.
The second assembly of the peoples of South Ural was held in Chelabinska.
The Forum is dedicated to the Day of People ' s Unity, the 400th anniversary of the restoration of the Russian State and the 20th anniversary of the adoption of the Russian Constitution.
Delegations from all cities and areas, representatives of national and cultural associations, religious confessions, legislative and executive authorities, attended the conference.
The Forum's course is aimed at strengthening international agreement.
We can set an example here not only for other regions but also for other countries.
We don't have differences and differences.
"We live in full understanding," says Feofan, a metropolitan of Chelabinsky and Zlatoustowski.
The meeting considered a number of issues, including the development of patriotism, of cultural cooperation.
As a result, the Conference adopted a resolution.
The informal part of the forum continued in opera and ballet theatre.
The exhibition of the National Cultural Associations of the Chelibean Region was opened here.
Snowden is ready to “cooperate” with Germany on the issue of US intelligence
Edward Snowden, U.S. intelligence investigator, said he was willing to go to Berlin to give a witness to the German Parliament if the US National Security Agency and its Director, Keith Alexander, could not answer questions about their activities.
German Member Hans-Christian Strufhele met with Mr. Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was granted asylum to discuss his testimony in Germany.
In a letter from Mr. Snowden, who presented the media in Berlin on Friday, he said: “Although the outcome of my efforts was clearly positive, my Government continues to regard inconsistencies as a change and seeks to criminalize political statements by criminal charges that give no protection”.
But speaking the truth is not a crime.
In his letter, Mr. Snowden said that he believed that the support of the international community could convince the United States Government to renounce criminal charges against it.
The accusations made by the U.S. Ministry of Justice include the spying and stealing of public property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, German Minister of the Interior, told Time Online: “If Mr. Snowden is willing to talk to German officials, we will find ways to do this.”
The relationship between the United States and Germany was strained after allegations that AMB had heard the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Opperman, a MP headed by a parliamentary group that was pursuing intelligence, said that if there was an opportunity to hear Mr. Snowden as a witness, “without endangering his or her relationship with the United States in full”, it should be used.
Mr. Strfheil, Member of Parliament from the Greens of Germany, posted his photograph with Mr. Snowden on his Twitter.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Struffaele said that, according to the lawyer of the former AMB contractor, Mr. Snowden could not return to Russia if he had left.
If Mr. Snowden had given a witness in Germany, he would need assurances that he would be there “in safety”, the MP said.
Mr. Snowden said in his letter that he had faced a “hard and constant” campaign of persecution that had forced him to leave his home.
However, he said that he was encouraged by the global response to his “political statements”.
Citizens around the world, as well as high-ranking officials, including in the United States, have seen the disclosure of an uncontrollable system of prejudice to society.
The letter proposes to cooperate with the German authorities “when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation will be solved”.
Frontier Airlines will take the payment for the hand bet
Frontier Airlines plans to take from passengers to $100 for carrying a handhold on board their journey.
Frontier Airlines plans to start taking up to $100 for a hand deposit and $2 for coffee or gas, although their announcement on Wednesday stated that passengers would be able to leave the whole bank.
The new hand bet is spread to bags in the upper pockets, so the small bags placed under the seat will remain free.
Frontier said it would take $25, if the collection was paid in advance, and $100, if the travelers were to pay only when the landing took place.
The representative of Frontier Kate O'Malley said that the $100 pay should force passengers to pay early.
"We don't want to pay for it," she said.
The airline began to pay for the first and second bags in 2008.
Passengers attempting to avoid these charges are going as far as they can into the upper luggage compartments, so there is often no room in these sections.
Fees are one way to keep passengers on board less.
O'Malley said that this new collection really wasn't about making money.
The point is that the most loyal clients of Frontier claim that finding a place in the top pockets is becoming more and more difficult.
Passengers who buy tickets on the airline's website will not have to pay.
This means that one passenger in turn at the exit to Frontier can get the opportunity to carry the bag free of charge, while the next passenger in turn can pay $100 for the same bag.
O'Malley said that the change in procedures on the website and in Frontier's registration stands is intended to ensure that passengers will know about the collection before they arrive at the landing.
The new Frontier collection for the hand bet will not start until summer, although the date is not yet set.
Passengers often complain about luggage and other charges, but airlines love them.
They claim that the handling of luggage is worth money, and passengers who need this service must pay for it.
Many in Wall Street consider adding luggage charges to indicate that airlines take enough money to cover aircraft costs after several years of losses.
Most of them, however, were not involved in the collection for the hand bet.
Spirit Airlines Inc. introduced the first collection for the manual three years ago, and another discounter Allegiant Air later followed her example.
The only other airline with such a collection is Hungarian Wizz Air, said the airline consultant J. Sorensen, who is closely tracking the additional collection.
According to its assessment in the December 2011 report, the collection for the hand-cuffs is $50 million per year.
Sorensen, former top manager of Midwest Airlines, had recently flown Spirit, and he was curious that he would find out when passengers would meet the unusual Spirit collection by hand.
"The landing process was the smoothest of what I've seen in my airline career," he said.
I was hoping to see a toothbrush and a dragon emerge at the landing.
The plane was trapped, he said, "and the landing went very fast."
Frontier is also due for Spirit for payment of $2 for coffee, tea, gas or juice.
Frontier stated that passengers who receive gas or juice can leave the whole bank and that coffee will be delivered free of charge.
It will continue to deliver water free of charge.
US Airways had recently tried to pay for drinks in 2008, but had refused to pay for them seven months after passengers began to complain and no other major airline followed her example.
The Frontier initiative to pay for a hand bet when passengers do not buy tickets directly at the airline is its last step to attract customers to its website.
Air carriers pay online ticket vendors, like Orbitz, from $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This has encouraged all airlines to encourage passengers to buy tickets directly from them rather than to contact the tourist online agency.
However, Frontier went further in this area.
In September, she started giving twice as many bonus miles as a frequent passenger to customers who bought tickets through an online tourist agency.
On Wednesday, it cut the premium by up to 25 per cent from the mile of travel.
Yes, a trip of 1,000 miles from Frontier, acquired from an online tourist agency, would have been 250 miles.
In addition, passengers can choose their location in advance only if they buy tickets directly on Frontier.
Frontier has a loyal client base in her hometown of Denver, but her business is falling and becoming a loser.
The cost decreased by 9 per cent, and summer opportunities decreased by almost 13 per cent in the first quarter, according to the financial results published by the parent company Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
The Republic is trying to correct Frontier's finances as part of the airline's sales.
AnB is guilty of “internal error” rather than hackers to stop the site
On Friday evening, the co-secret national security agency stated that the termination of their site had caused a technical failure for several hours, not for hackers, as stated on the network.
“NSA.gov was not available for several hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during the planning update,” the intelligence agency reported in an official e-mail.
The problem will be solved tonight.
Claims that the breach was caused by a distributed attack of type “refused” [DDoS] are not valid.
Earlier this evening, the online server monitoring system registered that the NAB site had not been working for at least six hours, and the site was still unavailable for some users.
Earlier, ABC's representative reported that the agency's internal secret network “not yet” had been broken.
No confidential information was in danger, the representative said.
At least one online hacker group of activists stated that it was responsible for the withdrawal of the ANB site through the DDoS attack.
DDoS attacks have been developed in such a way as to stifle traffic on the target site until the servers are overloaded and the site is out of line.
The hacker tactics are relatively simple and attacks are not designed to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
Earlier, a super-secret AMB, once known as the “Net Such Agency”, had been at the centre of public attention and severe criticism in recent months following a series of revelations about its extensive foreign and domestic reporting programmes, all of which were a reaction to AMB's secret files stolen from the agency and published by AMB's disillusioned former staff member Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy around the agency has led to so much that today ' s incident was the result of targeted action by hackers.
Bombardier's income decreases by dropping supplies and number of aircraft orders
The Bombardier Corporation, a Canadian manufacturer of aircraft and trains, reported a 15 per cent reduction in net income on Thursday, with the impact of a decrease in the number of orders and delivery of aircraft in the third quarter and the problems with contracts in its railway unit.
In Montreal, Bombardier also published no data on the summer tests of its new CSeries aircraft and provided no new information on whether ambitious plans for the commercial operation of the aircraft would be implemented by next September.
After the first flight of an experienced aircraft, held about half a month ago, he only flew three more times, causing questions as to whether the schedule test was going.
The results did not justify the projections and resulted in a fall of more than 8 per cent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at the National Bank Financial, reduced his assessment on Thursday from “higher average” to “medium average” because of the belief that the increase in shares is limited in the next quarter or two.
“Although the reduction in the number of airships was generally predictable, we are of course disappointed by the arrival of the transport unit,” Doerxen said in his review of the fund market.
We believe Bombardier will receive new CSeries orders as the flight test program continues.
However, if new orders are not announced in the coming months, we assume that the market will become more skeptical about the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft family will be able to win its position in the low-cost segment of the market where Boeing and Airbus now dominate.
The first experience of the aircraft was presented in March and the first flight took place in September after several months of delay.
However, firm CSeries orders are not too much for 177, since potential buyers are waiting for the results of the summer tests to verify the company's approval of the fuel efficiency and potential economy of the new liner.
There are now 403 orders and arrangements with 15 clients and operators.
Chief Executive Director Pierre Boduan was confident that Bombardier would reach its goal in 300 solid orders by the time the first aircraft was launched for commercial operation.
On Thursday, the leaders also assured analysts and the media that the programme was moving forward.
“The aircraft test model did not remain on the ground longer than expected,” said Boduan during a telephone conference, adding that ground tests and software upgrades were planned during the flight.
All manufacturers plan different tests.
We decided to take the first flight and make a break for the update, so we did.
This will happen throughout the summer test programme.
The second of five test samples must be carried out within the next few weeks, and the rest will soon follow, as reported by the company.
However, the analysts are skeptical about the statement that the first client will be able to operate the CSeries plane 12 months after his first flight.
Bombardier stated that it assessed the time of entry into service and would provide new information within the next few months.
“This slow rate of summer testing, although apparently consistent with Bombardier’s internal schedule, supports our view that entry into operation will be transferred to the first quarter of 2015,” Doerksen said.
In the third quarter ending September 30, Bombardier's net income decreased to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, with $172 million, or 9 cents per share, last year.
The adjusted return on the stock remained at 9 cents.
Gross income decreased slightly from $4.2 to $4.1 billion.
Analysts expected 10 cents of stock and gross income of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The fourth world aircraft manufacturer reported that he had placed 45 aircraft per quarter, less than the previous year — 57.
The total number of orders fell from 83 to 26 aircraft.
The Airspace Division's portfolio of orders amounted to $32.9 billion as at 30 September, with no change since 31 December.
“The results in the aviation field were consistent with our objectives, but a small number of orders and common market conditions became an unpleasant factor,” Boduan said.
The gross aerospace income fell by 13 per cent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world's largest train manufacturer, reported that gross income in this sector increased by almost 11 per cent to $2.1 billion.
The Order Portfolio in the Transport Unit amounted to $32.6 billion per 30 September, which was slightly higher than 31 December.
The transport unit ' s income has been negatively affected by the implementation of several major contracts.
The Guide stated that a new development plan would be presented in the fourth quarter.
The shares of Bombardier, who also announced that the Chief Financial Director of Google Patrick Pichett would join the Board of Directors, fell by 8.5 per cent to P$4.83 in the middle of Thursday.
Brazilian company Embraer SA, the third world-wide commercial aircraft manufacturer and nearest competitor Bombardier, reported a 10 per cent reduction on Thursday.
Sony is counting on lower annual income
The Japanese electronics manufacturer, Sony, completed the last quarter with a net loss of 19.3 billion yen, or $197 million, reduced the forecast for the current financial year.
Sony's results from July to September 2013 were more striking than was expected to be related to the fall in demand for televisions, video cameras and personal computers produced by the Japanese corporation.
Sony's television business, the company's first operating profit of 5.2 billion yen in the second quarter of the year, fell again to 9.3 billion yen in the reporting period.
The Japanese consumer electronics market is experiencing difficult times, especially as a result of lower demand on television.
And while competitors are trying to find a way out of the difficult situation, Sony continues to focus on the consumer segment.
For example, one of Sony's main competitors, Panasonic, has recently shifted the focus on industrialists: sales are growing at high speeds, especially through automotive systems and clean technologies.
As a result of the end of the financial year, which will end in March 2014, Sony expects to receive 179 billion yen of operating income against the expected 230 billion yen.
However, according to Thomson Reuters, analysts estimated that this figure would be much higher and would amount to 221 billion yen.
In order to get out of the crisis, Sony is expanding the production line.
In the middle of this month, the sale of smart hours from a Japanese corporation was announced that would free itself from the need to deliver smartphones 100 times a day.
After Sony reduced the annual income and cost forecast, the company ' s shares in Tokyo in the morning lost more than 11 per cent of the price, falling to a level of 1668 yen per share.
Gene of speech has been a stimulant to synapse education
Scientists from the University of John Hopkins and the School of Medicine of Mount Sinai found a protein that enabled Foxp2 to perform its function by stimulating the development of new connections between neurons.
The study is published in Science, and its short content can be read on the journal website.
Gen Foxp2 is the first known gene whose function is directly related to speech.
His role was achieved in 2001 by finding a family of several people who could not properly speak and sometimes did not understand each other.
Scientists have found that family members have violated the work of the Foxp2 gene, but the way he performs his function has not been known.
In a new study, biologists have shown that at least part of their Foxp2 functions are as an incentive for the development of new brain synapses related to speech.
He does this through another gene, SRPX2.
The latter was found as a result of the search for factors that stimulate synapse education.
SRPX2 has been one of 10 such genes found by the authors, and only Foxp2 has been shown to be active.
The fact that SRPX2 really affects the vocalization that scientists have confirmed in the mouse experiment.
When the genes were artificially reduced in animals, they screamed less when they were separated from their mother.
If the gene has been restored, the frequency of the released sounds has also been restored.
Previously on the mouse was also shown a link to Foxp2's own vocalization.
The animals that introduced the human copy of the gene were more active and at lower frequencies than normal mice.
To date, however, scientists do not know whether Foxp2 is related to the work of the SRPX2 with purely "mechanical" sound education or more subtle processes.
A cocaine addict who warned the head of the criminal police investigation team that he was in prison
The 42-year-old Basharat Dieta provided information to the criminal authority of Nile Scarboro
The lawyer was afraid his secret drug addiction would be discovered.
He was sentenced to three years ' imprisonment by the Liverpool Royal Court.
The distinguished lawyer who told the drug baron about a major police investigation because he was afraid of exposing his secret drug addiction was imprisoned for three years.
The 42-year-old Basharat Dietta provided the criminal authority with confidential information about his investigation into illicit drug trafficking after being threatened by his cocaine addiction.
A lawyer who received a name from Bash and a criminal “fine lawyer” was arrested at his home in 2011 after a police operation on the Scarboro case he had previously filed in a drug-related court.
Officers noticed that 32-year-old Scarboro left three cocaine packages at the home of a lawyer in Blackburn County, Lankashire, while he was at the dinner of a lawyer's association with colleagues.
The consequence was that Dieta “regularly used” Class A drugs after tests showed traces of cocaine in his hair, in his paper and in his credit cards.
During the eight months from January to August 2011, he sought illegal information on the arrests of two persons under the command of Scarboro and one of his associates.
All four suspects were under police supervision at that time as part of a comprehensive investigation into the activities of the criminal organization for the sale of heroin and cocaine in Lancashire, Cambria, Mercisside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
They and 32 others were later imprisoned after the police had taken over a series of heroin and cocaine raids of £1.5 million and more than £200 thousand in cash.
The 42-year-old Diet was reporting information to criminals for fear that their cocaine dependence would be discovered.
Today, in the Liverpool Royal Court of Diet, which works in the legal company Forbes Solicitors, located in Blackburn, the Crown has been humiliated after his confession in two cases of intentional obstruction of justice by a three-week court in the Liverpool Court.
He admitted to holding cocaine at one of the previous court meetings.
The disbandment of the lawyer took place after the police investigating the activities of Scarboro found that he had been regularly talking to Diet on the phone since February 2011.
Two detectives tracked down the suspect and found out how he came to Diet's house in Blackburn and put 60 per cent of the drugs in a black ring for golf under the jurist's garbage boxes.
Soon after the transfer, Scarboro was several times summoned with Diet, who was at dinner at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium.
The lawyer came home for drugs; nine discussions took place between them.
The court found that Dieta was “regularly using” cocaine after the tests had found traces of Class A drug in his hair, his wallet and his credit cards.
The kid was later arrested, but he denied using cocaine, said he was talking to the suspect dealer because he was his client, and insisted that their communication was a “advocate secret”.
During his detention, Diett took his wallet and tried to extract several credit cards, but they were all confiscated, and he also had a hair sample.
In a police interview, he said he had a home office, and his clients came to him in legal cases.
However, it was known to the court that after major arrests, he called the major parties to the illicit drug trafficking, some of which he had previously represented in the court to tell what the detectives knew about them.
In the indictment, Anne White said, "If anyone knows that the law should not be violated, then it's a criminal lawyer."
Mr. Dieta was accused of abuse of his position as a criminal lawyer because he had become too close to certain clients.
The contact we're talking about is not just a drug dealer but a drug dealer providing his own lawyer.
Some of his conversations would certainly prove just because he was their lawyer.
However, this has significantly crossed the limits of the customary relationship between the lawyer and the client.
He prevented the police investigation as strongly as possible to enable these persons to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta didn't read his profession, he upset her.
He was too close to certain clients, particularly Scarboro, and allowed himself to doubt his non-interest.
Dieta did not confess the guilt and said: "If I were a corrupt lawyer that I am not, and I wanted to report information to Mr. Scarboro, I wouldn't wait 15 hours, I would do it right away."
But after the meeting, senior officer Li Holstead of the Lancashire Police said: “Mr. Dieta has turned from a criminal lawyer to a criminal criminal as soon as she began to acquire drugs with organized crime representatives”.
His addiction to cocaine made him hopelessly compromised and vulnerable for the main criminal groups who had commissioned him to obtain valuable information on police investigations.
Lawyers must adhere to the highest standards of professional ethics and build trust and confidence in society.
Mr. Dietta betrayed this trust and tried to hide his profession.
Mr. Diett ' s investigation led the Lancashire Department of Specially Dangerous Organized Crime, which had already been sentenced to three cases of cocaine storage, and now to the prevention of justice, demonstrating our desire to achieve just punishment for criminals.
Let this case serve as a warning to criminals that no one is beyond the reach of the law.
We will find you and bring you to justice.
Scarboro himself was sentenced to 14 years after he admitted his guilt in a speech to deliver heroin, cocaine and marijuana.
A further 35 persons involved in the machining were sentenced to 153 years for drug-related crimes.
On his website, Dieta organized an interview in the form of questions and answers in which he said that his dream was a lawyer representing clients with a death sentence in America, an ideal companion for him for dinner, Mohammed Ali, and motivation for work is inequality.
The stadium in Yaroslav is not ready for the reception of 22,000 spectators, police officers who were present today at the RFS CDC meeting.
They believe that the ticket programme is overdue about twice.
During the 1/16 match, the Russian Cup with Spartacus was only a thousand studios with a regulatory standard of nine thousand.
Spartacus patients had 2,200 seats, i.e. 10 per cent of the stadium's capacity, but according to the Moscow Club, they had sold 5,000 tickets.
These data were published by the head of the KDK Arthur Grigorianz.
The Americans listened to Japanese high-ranking officials
On Friday, 1 November, a representative of the United States Special Services, who chose not to disclose his name, said that the States had been listening to telephone conversations by senior officials from Japan.
The man confirmed that there were several points for hearing in the rising sun country.
He noted that the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, New Zealand did not engage in reconnaissance against each other.
He said that it was so during World War II when those countries were allies.
And here Japan, like Germany, despite allied relations with the Americans during the post-war period, are intelligence facilities, NHK reported.
This information has not yet been officially commented on by any of the parties.
Remember, news of United States Special Services surveying for the FWG was released last week.
According to German journalists, AMB has been able to listen to the Merkel phone for the past ten years.
The chancellor himself, according to some data, took notice of his interrogation very painfully.
She stated that allys, which she believed were FWG and the United States for decades, were unacceptable for such monitoring by the Government.
In the meantime, Edward Snowden said that he was ready to share details about the hearing of Angela Merkel's phone conversations with the German prosecutors.
Germany has specifically come to Moscow to meet with a former CIA officer.
Baschiria can exhibit grain on the market not before the beginning of 2014
Baschiria may sell grain at the market during public procurement operations not before the beginning of 2014, as Minister of Agriculture of the Republic of Nikolai Kovalenko.
To date, market prices are such that they do not encourage sales to the intervention fund.
As long as the price in the market is above, and there's a question.
"Maybe grain will be placed on the market after New Year," he said at yesterday's press conference.
The Minister recalled that in the current year, agricultural crops under the 2013 harvest had grown to 3.1 million hectares, including grain crops areas to 1.7 million hectares, which was 3.3 per cent more than last year.
Under the 2014 harvest, 550 thousand hectares (over 105,000 hectares in 2012) were planted.
Increased areas under winter wheat and triticale, the flower remained at the former level.
There is no Bratsky Circle group in the MDBs, to which Leps was assigned in the United States
The Russian band "Bratsky Circle" that Washington used as a singer for Grigory Leps does not mean anything.
As Interfax noted in the law enforcement bodies of the FF, following media reports of the submission by the US Ministry of Finance of Grigory Leps to the suspect lists of the Eurasian criminal union of the Bratsky Circle, all databases were checked, but no such grouping was found.
The dissemination of this information contributes to the maintenance of the myth of the so-called “Russian Mafia”, which is apparently operating abroad, is considered to be in force.
"Even in the name of the 'British Circle', there is some element of secrecy, there is a hint of a secret lie.
"It's all very like pier-action," said the agency's interviewer.
The United States Ministry of Finance announced on 31 October that it had entered its suspect checklists under the Eurasian Criminal Union of Arthur Badaljan, Gregory Lepsveridze, Wadim Lalina, Sergei Moskalenko, Jacoba Ribalski and Igori Słykov.
The persons listed here are suspected in connection with some Vladislav Leontiev and Gafur Rahimov, who are considered influential members of the criminal groups and are in the US sanctions lists since February 2012.
According to the American authorities, Gregory Leaps “is a courier for the delivery of money on behalf of Vladislav Leontiev”.
At Grigoria Lepsa's mall, they refused to comment on the U.S. accusations against the singer, calling them "bread."
In 2011, U.S. President Barack Obama referred to the Bratsky Circle as the “substantial transnational organized criminal groups” and commissioned the Minfin to “warn and rescue their global criminal operations”.
The inclusion of a person in the black lists of American mines involves blocking his assets in the United States and prohibiting business contacts with persons living in the States.
Scandal video got into the police.
The head of Toronto Rob Ford, known as his scandalous and openly unreasonable exits, fell on the smoke of the crack.
The Canadian City Police stated that they had a video record and were ready to start an investigation against the mayor.
He said he would not leave his post, reports CNN.
Information that the authorities have evidence of drug use by Rob Ford has appeared on the Toronto Police website.
Bill Blair, head of local law enforcement agencies, held a press conference on this issue.
The sheriff said that he was not authorized to share these staff with the public, but he was responsible for their existence.
According to Blair, Rob Forda's compromised video was discovered during an anti-narcotic raid conducted by the police in the summer of 2013.
The Canadian press had already written about the existence of this video, but there had been no confirmations until recently.
The mayor himself does not comment on this.
He just says that they don't blame anything and they don't get fired.
The video found by the police is one of the evidence in the case of a 35-year-old friend of Ford Aleksandra Lisa, who is accused of dealing with light drugs, demanding illegal income, and criminal talk.
Sometimes Lizzy did the job of driver Rob Ford.
The city’s inhabitants long needed to resign from their mayor.
He repeatedly fought with journalists, appeared in public in a drunken fashion, allowed himself racist and sexist statements.
The Rostovaeroinvest was recognised by German company Assmann Beraten + Planen as the winner of the tender for the selection of the object designer.
The amount of the contract in Rostovaero Invest is not disclosed.
According to the OAS Press Service, nine Russian and foreign companies participated in the competition, and under tender conditions the project was to be prepared and sent to the expert in spring 2014.
The winner is expected to design a new passenger terminal at the airport, as well as infrastructure facilities, internal roads and elements for the maintenance of the airport complex.
At the first stage of construction, the interior terminal area will be 50,000 square metres, and it will continue to increase.
The project documentation will take into account the prospects for the development of the airport complex: by 2025, the terminal will be able to serve about 5 million passengers and by 2035, 6 million passengers.
By the time the tender was completed, the architectural concept of the South Airline complex was defined, developed by British company Twelve Architects.
The main terminal project includes the idea of an air bridge between Rostov-Na-Don and other cities of the world.
Assmann Beraten + Planen has experience in major projects, the company designed terminals C and E "Seremetievo International Airport" and a new airport complex at Knevici International Airport in Vladivostok.
The South International Airport complex will be built in the Asia-Pacific region of Rostov and will replace the existing growth airport, which will be closed and integrated into the city structure in perspective.
The start of the construction of the air service complex is scheduled for 2014, the introduction of all facilities for 2017.
Politicians in Turkey declare hunger against the wall on the border with Syria
In mid-October, the authorities began building a separation wall in the area of the city of Nusaibin in southeastern Turkey.
Local residents and representatives of the PMD Procurdant Party strongly opposed the construction.
The mayor on the border with Syria of the Turkish city of Nusaibin Iche Gekhan announced a hunger strike protest against the construction of a separation wall on the Turkish-Syrian border, reported the RIA News in the press service of the Party of Peace and Democracy (PMD) on Friday.
The police have repeatedly disbanded protests.
Turkey ' s mid-term head, Muammer Guler, first rejected the fact of construction and then said that the wall was built to ensure the safety of borders.
"Mer Nusaibin Ayshe Hekhan, a member of the MPD, announced the hunger strike, thus turning his protest against the construction of the wall into a death struggle," said the party's press service.
The mayor of the city believes that the construction of the wall is designed to isolate the Kurdish population of two countries from each other, the Kurds crossed the border freely during the half-life.
"It's an inhuman situation that Kurds never agree with," he quoted the party's representatives as saying.
According to the press service, a meeting against the construction of the separation wall was scheduled in Nusaibin on 7 November.
Venezuela will set a currency course for tourists
Venezuela will introduce a special exchange rate for its national currency - Bolivara - with respect to the dollar for tourists.
This was reported by Bloomberg on 1 November with reference to government decree.
Foreign travellers will be allowed to exchange amounts equivalent to tens of thousands of United States dollars per year.
Venezuela will also allow tourists to sell up to 25 per cent of the buyers in the country at the time of departure.
A specific course of the Bolivaire for the dollar will be set at a later date.
In February, Caracas was forced to devalue the local currency to $6.3 billion.
However, in the black market, one dollar is estimated at 57 Bolivarians.
Since the beginning of the year, the bolivar has lost almost 70 per cent of its value.
In September, Venezuela ' s inflation was nearly 50 per cent.
The Minister of the Oil Industry and Vice-President of the Economy, Rafael Ramirez, said on 18 October that Venezuela had no plans to devalue the bolivar.
According to the informal information provided by the agency, Caracas may, however, decide to reduce the national currency rate after the municipal elections in December.
The policy of price restraint for products and goods of general consumption, as well as the high level of regulation of the Venezuelan economy, has led to the deficit of a number of goods and the functioning of the black currency market.
This spring, the media reported that there was a lack of toilet paper in Venezuela.
Andrey Belmach, Director of the Games, noted that it was difficult to say how long it would take to find a new top coach.
This post became vacant after Sergey Schepelev's resignation.
The resignation took place only a few hours ago, so to say how long it will take to find a new coach, I'm not ready - ITAR-TASS brings Belmach's words.
Maybe a day.
Maybe a month.
We're studying all possible options.
The priority will be given to the Russian specialist.
Although it's not just finding some coach, it's a person who works at our club for a few years and gets some results from it.
Kenyan press is upset by the provocative media law
“This is a terrible place, and there are grounds for the question: what could prevent Parliament from destroying the independence of the judiciary in the future?” the newspaper reported, calling the law unconstitutional.
“This law is very harsh and punishable, and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, Managing Director of Capital Group, CapitalFM, which includes one of the most respected independent radio stations and news sites in Kenya.
He said that the new judicial body on the media would “always be passionate because it is a continuation of the Government”, and the content and advertising restrictions would harm the situation of Kenya in the global economy.
“I hope the President will listen to us, and we ask him to reject the bill and return it to his deputies,” he said.
According to The Star, the new law would essentially allow the government to “take a dead hold of the media”, and The Standard reported that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya “have been hit severely”, and criticised the bill as “draconow”.
The adoption of the bill is part of the measures taken to strengthen national security following the September attack by Muslim terrorists at the Westgate Trade Centre.
The Kenyan media were angry with the authorities, broadcasting surveillance cameras, where troops who had been sent to the scene of the attack allegedly robbed a expensive mall.
David Kimayo, the police chief, responded to the challenge of two journalists and media officials for questioning, although the challenge was lifted after mass media protests.
Under the new law, publications may be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings, and individual journalists, up to one million with an additional risk of being “excluded from the lists”, i.e. getting a ban on official journalism accreditation.
The court shall also have the right to confiscate the property of the offender if the fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, “a single fine is enough to paralyze the work of most FM radio stations”.
She also reported that these measures could have a devastating effect on the so-called " revived blogosphere " of Kenya.
Politicians realize that by making the media shut up, they will be able to do whatever they think they are going to do without punishment.
“No one will ever know, ” wrote National journalist Mutuma Matthew, describing Kenyan media as a key source of restraint and balance in public life.
“The policies themselves will destroy the country and bring us back to hunting and gathering,” he wrote.
The Kenyan legislators were the target of public anger and in the past.
In May, they voted for the abolition of reductions appointed by the National Wages Commission and the restoration of their huge salary of about 532 thousand shillings per month, not taxed, one of the highest in the world.
A new line of expenditure will be made available in the municipal payments of crows, remunerated for the capital repairs of the house.
Approximately 100 to 400 rubles per month will have to be paid for the standard two-room apartment from the new year.
The Government of the region will determine the exact rules.
So when you take the trip, take the stairs or even replace the elevator, the occupants themselves will decide.
This law was approved by the deputies of the region.
Vladimir Kluchnikov, president of the Voronez Regional Word, said: "In this case, it is also necessary to lay down the order of the carpentry of houses, accumulate funds in non-governmental companies, which we often register in Moscow, or in Orenburg, or elsewhere, it will be the establishment of State control over the expenditure of funds collected by residents for the repair of multi-quarter houses."
Under the control of the State, now and on the left.
The law that protects against fraud is approved by the omnipotent in final reading.
The document was not born in an empty place.
In our region, 4.5 thousand people have been affected by dishonesty.
Most of the problems have been solved.
In fact, the new law prescribes rights and responsibilities for all parties to the construction.
Vladimir Kluchniki, president of the Voronez Regional Word, said: “It is not a secret that abuses in this area have also begun as a result of the same in the year 98 and the same in the year 2000.”
People began to work on it to cover the lasagna, including the two laws.
Under Vronez, it was decided to build a temporary residence centre for foreign nationals to be deported.
The regional parliament has adopted such a law not only under the strict federation.
Whatever the problem with illegal migrants in the region.
Yes, more than 100,000 foreigners were heard last year on the migration account.
But only every fifth of them issued an official permit to work.
Where the rest work and whether they pay taxes is a big question.
Vladimir Kluchniki, president of the Voronej Regional Word, said: "They have violated the law, but they are not criminals."
There's no court, but they have to be deported. They have to be contained somewhere.
Such a decision was taken by the Federation to equip such sites with regional means.
In the Vronez area, this place is definitely the Old Olshank of the Semiluk region.
Well, the regional Parliament has recently granted new benefits to multi-child parents.
First, families with 5 and more children are completely exempt from transport tax.
In this case, the budget is lost 3.5 million - but as many as multiple parents are saved.
Secondly, and this is the main one, those who adopt the 3rd and smaller will issue housing grants from the new year.
For each member of the family, the new law provides for 18 square metres, at the cost of 30,000 metres.
The family, for example, of 6 people, was a father, a mother, a child, and 3 were adopted.
For them, according to the rules, the State acquires a housing area of 108 square metres, of 3 million 300 thousand rubles.
For the left bank or the South-West micro-area is a completely acceptable option.
Well, you can buy a whole catheter in the garden for that.
Baumgertner nominated to the Board of Directors of Uralkalia
The current Board of Directors of the OAS Uralkalija invited the candidate arrested in Minsk, Mr. Vladislav Baumgertner, to a new board, reported on the website of the Russian company.
Bamügertner was among the 11 persons nominated to the new Board of Directors.

Baumgertner is currently under house arrest in Minsk.
While detained in August this year, he was charged with abuse of office.
Later, however, the President of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, at the press conference, said that Baumgertner's accusations were reclassified as “a kidnapping”.
Matt Dalton's "Nephthemic Gate" refused to comment on Vladimir Crikunov's withdrawal from the post of the Dutch teacher.
Golciper believes that the acting chief coach Dmitry Balmin enjoys greater authority in the players and will handle his duties.

I can only say that Dmitry Balmin will deal with his obligations - I have no doubt about that.
In the team he enjoys great authority, and this young specialist is definitely looking forward to a great future.

U.S. Secretary of State: special services sometimes “extended too far” when collecting data
The U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry acknowledged that, when collecting data and hearings, American special services sometimes “were too far away”, however, the politician noted that the media had reported that 70 million people did not agree with the reality of the hearing.
I assure you that innocent people did not get hurt during this process, but the attempt to collect information was.
Yes, in some cases it has gone too far and has been wrong.
I recognize that, as the President acknowledges... and we will see that this does not happen in the future," quoted the AFP Secretary-General.
Italian interns abandon the road to young people
Italian unemployment beats the record.
The media reported that 12.5 per cent of the country ' s population was now unemployed.
This has not been the case since World War II.
Among young people, this rate is several times higher.
40.4 per cent of the population aged 15 to 24 are out of work.
In the view of the Italian authorities, one of the solutions to this problem is the early retirement of older workers.
This experiment is already being carried out by the largest energy company in the country, and the laws adopted allow regional authorities to provide part of the early retirement pension for trainees.
Italy, on the other hand, is expecting the common problem of the ageing population for Europe.
And economists are not convinced that a delay in the early rotation of staff is justified.
What will lead to the construction of the TPF in Moscow
Each year, the capital authorities promise to build more and more transport-persadic towers (TSIs).
By 2020, it is planned to introduce 255 PDPs.
As far as the project is concerned, our correspondent understood it.
A few months ago, a construction plot was established at the "Smolensko-Pokrovski" metro.
The sign said that a transport peresading unit was being installed.
All this was very strange, because near Smolens there was no land transport to stop and, therefore, it could not be moved.
To reach the nearest trolleybus stop in the garden ring, you have to cross about 130 metres, including a land crossing through the Carmanic Strait.
It's almost over now.
The flowering lare disappeared, the paper stand was dismantled, and the asphalt was replaced by a brush before the entrance.
That's all the transport.
Transport-persadic knots are flat and capital, explained in the press service of the capital transport department.
There are no capital units yet.
The flats include the construction of parks, the removal of commercial facilities that prevent passengers from moving, the creation of small architectural forms and well-being.
In fact, flat-duty IT systems are not even used by vehicles, but professionals from Moscow's capital repair department.
The transport facility is not necessarily a complex structure, explains the Director of the Institute of Transport and Transport Economics of the Higher Economic School of Michael Blinkin.
Sometimes enough cover over the head and the board that announces the arrival time of the transport.
For example, the Yasenevo subway recently opened a fully-valued flat replanting plant.
Let it be unobstructed, but with catchers and a board indicating when the bus will arrive.
But in pursuit of the number of officers, they record everything that's going on.
In 2011, Mary planned to build all 151 of them, 59 of them with capital.
The plans now amount to up to 255 PDPs by 2020.
Half of them promise to surrender this year.
Although there is a programme for development of the PDP in the city, there is no qualitative criteria, notes Alexander Morozov, co-chair of the City and Transport Organization.
Counted by number of objects, but the quality of the replanting on each of them is often worse.
The criteria, according to the expert, must be two: firstly, a reduction in planting time, secondly, convenience.
First of all, it's possible to change the mode of transport without rain.
In Moscow, however, when the TPF is set up, it is sometimes the opposite.
A strong example of the VDNH subway.
Previously, suburban buses from the Yaroslav Show arrived in the square before the main entrance to the WVC.
Their stops were now transferred to the opposite side of Yaroslavka on the Cosmonaut Street.
Far from the subway, far away from the monoreals, so closer to the homes.
Because the residents did not really want a car under the windows and complained at all possible instances.
With the capital TPU in Moscow, it wasn't given up right now.
The first of them started building five years ago at Plannerna Metro.
The project was designed to be a model.
And indeed, a model of how a replanting facility dedicated to the purchase of investors is turned into a banal trading centre.
No, there's a bus wash here, not to walk off the subway under the rain, and three floors of the parking lot.
True, the chemical trolleybuses No.202 and No.203 in the Moscow TPU did not give place in principle.
They've been taken away from the subway.
That's why there's more places to trade.
There is only one 32 store clothes, and there are almost everything from zoos to car salon.
Actually, which one of the passengers of the bus is gonna have to buy a new car on the road?
When we build a capital mine, why do we always get a mall?
The situation had recently reached its logical conclusion when some of the motorists had decided to market.
Now on the third floor of the TPP Plannerna among those listed in the parking lot are boycotted trade.
Fruits, spices, Chinese jeans, Russian words and guards who look at our photographer badly.
The resuscitater finally turned into a market.
The point is, Plannerna was a market before, but they took it off.
And in the prefecture, the traders were sorry and let into the catchment area of the replanting plant.
Still, because of high prices, it's always empty.
It's funny that the market has been put down to build on its site... a new flat stand.
That's the rocking.
The Kaluzski metro distance from the west of the metro to the bus was 50 meters, says Alexander Morozov.
After the construction of the trade centre, allegedly the TPF, the distance increased to 170 metres.
To get on the bus, you have to go through the whole mall.
After 22 hours, when it's closed, it's going to be covered under the open sky.
However, the designs on Planner and Kalužsky will soon be shown by flowering.
In mid-September, the City and Land Commission of Mary adopted planning decisions for the first eight capital IPs.
Four of them will be 25-to-one, not considering two or three underground jars.
The main monster will grow at the Tushino Metro, with 418.7 thousand square meters of space.
Representatives of the RJD Railway Stations Directorate responsible for the construction of the metro terminals have already told reporters that future multi-storey shops, hotels and apartments will be located.
Officials are convinced that multi-story parking lots are worth a third to half of the area.
Take the example of "national" garages.
For example, the 258 parking garage, which was recently built on the International Street, has an area of 8015 sq.m.
So for a parking lot of 2.6 thousand cars in Petrovsko-Razomski, about 80 thousand "squares" will be needed.
It's less than a third of the truck they're going to build.
Let one or two floors go on every bus pass.
It remains at least 150 thousand square metres of commercial property.
And this, for a minute, is almost two guma.
If the station and train stations are built by railways, the rest of the sites will be occupied by the metro police.
They also promised that there would be many “functional objects”, including hotels, offices and even sportsrooms.
According to the Moscow City Property Department, journalists have recently been informed that they are drafting a draft decision that allows investors to apply for a TIP site directly to officials.
No contests.
Therefore, please, the transport issues for the city are a priority.
The ideal TPU is, for example, Harvard station in Boston or Spainna in Toronto, sure Alexander Morozov.
There the trolleybuses and trams descend underground at the level of the subway and the distance from the subway wagon to the tram is only 50 metres away from the street.
There's no trade around it.
But the Mosquean officials are going to the end.
Either we won't build anything or we're already robbing 25 floors with offices and apartments.
Eser proposes to compare extremism with insulting patriotic feelings
In order to protect the patriotic feelings of citizens against the provocations and insults of Russia, the Justice of Russia proposes to compare the patriotic feelings of extremism and punish for this for five years in prison.
As reported in the Newspaper, such amendments to the legislation prepared by the Energy Thought Committee by Oleg Miheev have already been sent to obtain a judgement in the Supreme Court and the Government.
Under the patriotic feelings of citizens, the author of the amendment proposes to understand the emotional relationship between a person and the country of which he is a citizen, characterized by love for that country, a responsible attitude toward her fate, respect for her history and culture.
According to Miheev, domestic legislation has sanctions for abuse of the formal signs of State authority - flag and herb.
However, according to the parliamentary opinion, the protection of Russians, whose feelings may be affected and insulted by State symbols, and other manifestations of disrespect for our country, Russian legislation has not been sufficiently developed.
As an example, he is leading the developing year-on-year Canon of the Victory Day of Discussion, when some media figures allow themselves to question the heroic rise of the people of the USSR in the fight against fascists.
Prior to the main national festival - Victory Day, May 9th - the present vaccanaly is being developed annually.
In practice in the current and "alternative view" of history, some publicists argue that, unfortunately, cultural Germans did not win the wild Soviet Union!
I find this absolutely unacceptable in a country where pride for history remains the main "spiritual strength" of the nation," says Oleg Miheev.
Furthermore, according to Miheeva, patriotic people in Russia are much more than religious, but the law is punishable by insulting the feelings of believers, while insulting patriotic feelings can be almost without punishment.
In the opinion of the people ' s electorate, it is necessary to compare the insults of patriotic feelings to extremist activities and to prescribe a corresponding punishment in article 282 of the Penal Code.
The bill provides for punishment for insulting patriotic feelings: from 100 thousand to 5 years ' imprisonment.
The magnitude 6.6 earthquake occurred on Thursday, 31 October, in the area of Cokymbo, in central Chile, the agency Reuters.
The earthquake was located in the ocean at a depth of 10.7 kilometres and at 54 kilometres south-west of the city, which is located on the U.S. Geological Service (USGS).
The plates were recorded at 20:03 local time (3:03 1 November in Moscow).
Victims or caused by underground thrusts of destruction have not yet been reported.
Remember, Chile is in one of the most seismic regions of the earth, so earthquakes of different forces are not rare.
One of the most serious events occurred in 2010.
At that time, the 8.8 magnitude earthquake and the tsunami caused more than 550 deaths in Chile and the destruction of 220 thousand buildings.
In addition, there was the most powerful earthquake in Chile in recent history: there was a 9.5 magnitude in 1960.
More than five thousand people were killed as a result of that natural disaster.
Dmitry Medvedev: the Greenpeace case will be considered fairly
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev reported on Friday that the case of Greenpeace activists would be dealt with strictly in accordance with Russian law.
France may have no doubt that the case will be handled in compliance with the legislation, and we will hear all the concerns.
"We can guarantee law enforcement," said Dmitry Medvedev at a meeting with French Prime Minister Jean Mark Ero.
Among the detained activists Greenpeace is a French citizen.
Pierre Pisan, like the other activists, has been accused of hooliganism.
"I asked if we could expect a humanitarian gesture against a detainee," quoted Mr. Ero as saying.
"Our country cannot support activities that can harm the environment, no one can break the laws," Dmitry Medvedev said.
He said that the activities of any structure that sought to influence technologically complex and unsafe processes, including energy generation, were dangerous.
He stressed that these objects were “like a vacuum cleaner” and recalled what happened in the Gulf of Mexico, conveying “RIA News”.
UN proclaims new goals to overcome poverty
The United Nations should immediately start working on a new set of challenges for the replacement of the Millennium Development Goals, which were formulated 12 years ago to address poverty worldwide.
Australian diplomats have played a key role in promoting the " Sustainable Development Goals" in the exchange of the MDGs, which expires in 2015, until the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, which began in Rio de Janeiro earlier in the evening.
They were included in the final version of the document, which would be signed by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Pan Ki-moon told the summit early in the evening that the time had now come for “to become more national interests”.
“I am pleased that the United Nations member states agreed to launch and monitor the process of establishing universal sustainable development goals, namely, R & D”, he said.
These LDCs will build on our progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals, which will be an integral part of the post-2015 development concept.
I will make every effort to use the powers given to me by Member States to embrace our vision of sustainable development goals that are based on the successful implementation of the MDGs.
Concern about security in Mozambique is growing as a result of the conflict of influential people
On top of the statue of Samara Mashel, the President-in-Office of Mozambique, thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo to scan the slogans of peace in one of the few demonstrations here.
“We want peace back; we want stability,” said Vanessa de-Sus, executive director of the investment company.
Fearing the future of her country, she changed the business suit on a soccer club decorated with the inscription “We Need Security” in Portuguese and joined the crowd on Thursday in the capital of Independence.
Within two weeks, almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo were received — one of the most brutal clashes since the peace was concluded more than 20 years ago.
Renom was once a well-known rebel movement that was initially supported by the white authorities of Rhodesia and then by the Government of South Africa during the apartheid era as part of the efforts to destabilize the independent Government of the country.
After the peace of 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country will hardly be able to recover from the full-scale conflict, but recent developments have made foreign investors and locals nervous.
High rates for a fast-growing economy, as opening huge greenhouse gas and coal reserves in the north-west can attract more than $50 billion as investments in the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the United States.
The ruling Frelimo party, which has been leading the political force since 1975, and the Renomo party have been accusing each other of the tension that has been created.
The Renom Party argues that the Government has become a closing point for recent clashes by attacking its members in the province of Sofala, the traditional area of Renom on 17 October.
The attacks on former rebels were then sparked when government forces attacked Renom's bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhakamu, the leader of the group, reported the Financial Times Fernando Mazanga, representative of Renom.
The Government blames Renom for initiating clashes, accusing the party of attacking soldiers.
The President of Armandu Gebuz tried to raise concerns about instability.
Gebuza told the French information agency, AFP, on Wednesday, that Mr. Dlakama felt “a failure”, who wanted to use “all that remained of his strength to try to prove that he could impose his own decisions on the Government”.
Both Frelimo and Renomo insist that they want to avoid war.
However, concerns were raised following the announcement that Mazanga had declared Renom ' s rejection of the 1992 peace agreement.
He informed the Financial Times that he had failed to comply with the Frelimo Agreement.
"Our goal is to return to the negotiations, but seriously," Mazanga said.
The previous negotiations between the parties did little to ease the tension, which had increased the number of clashes this year.
“These are two influential people (Gebuza and Dlakama), who have been hit with their fists,” said Joseph Hanlon, lecturer of the Open University and expert on Mozambique.
None of them are good negotiators and none of them are willing to make the necessary concessions.
The Renom Party, which is trying to achieve electoral reforms, has already stated that it will boycott the municipal elections scheduled for November.
The presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for the following year.
Some commentators interpreted this pressure as an attempt by the weaker movement to obtain concessions and financial bonuses from the Government.
The number of votes for Renom has decreased since 1992, while the new Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), founded by former Renomist, is expected to improve its performance in these elections.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Gebuza, who was due to leave the post next year, wanted to destroy democracy in the country.
"He doesn't want multi-party democracy, he doesn't want transparent elections, he doesn't want peace because he doesn't want to leave the presidency," Mazanga said.
It was not clear what opportunities Renom had, but it had already carried out devastating and urgent attacks on police stations and cars on the key highway leading north to the south.
Most of the contacts were held in the province of Sofala, which is located a few hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but includes Beirut, a port that mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, use to export coal.
In June, Rio suspended the use of railways about a week after Renamo threatened the railway.
Masanga was inclined when he was asked if Reno would repeat that threat.
The Renom Party wanted to “warn the international community that things are not going very well in Mozambique”, Mazanga said.
Insistence has increased the discontent of the Government, and many are also concerned about corruption, slow development and recent kidnappings, says Fernando Lima, head of the independent media company Mediacoop.
“People think that the government and the President are responsible for the future countries, which must find a solution to these problems,” he says.
Omar Sultuan, a part of the demonstration, said that people just want stability.
“No one cares about Renom or Frelimo; they just want to restore peace, they want free access to roads,” he said.
The Art Mainstream premiere series will take place in Moscow
The Art Mainstream film series, where viewers will be able to see one Russian and four foreign films within a few days of their release, will be held at the Rolan Film Theatre from 1 to 5 November, reports the RIA "News" with reference to project organizers.
Opens the program "Art Mainstream" by the French comedy director and actress Reim Kerichi "Paris at any price."
This is a story about the Maye model working in the French capital (Sam Kerichi), which is deported to Morocco due to visa problems.
In addition to the film, Kerichi will show audiences a new picture of the famous South Korean director Kim Ki Duk "Mebius", the melodramatic biopic by Oliver Hirshbigel "Diana: History of Love" (Diana) with Naomi Watts in the main role and the main film of the Cannes Film Festival "Vizn Adel" Abdelatif Cashish.
The only Russian participant, Art Mainstream, will be the winner of the film by Alexander Veledin's Geographer Globe on the occasion of the unique novel Alexei Ivanov.
The main role - the promising failure of the teacher Victor Suzkin - was to play Konstantin Habenski in the film, whose work was also marked by the "Kinotovar" award.
Children should study myths and legends as “models of life”, says the author.
The stories of Thor could show that “a harsh force cannot defeat the subtle wisdom” and the legends of King Arthur show how important it is to have a dream.
Speaking of the fact that many myths would appear to be “too wild, too scandalous and in some cases too rude to teach in schools”, Crossley-Holland advocates the “student selection” of texts of age.
“I think it’s great that in America myths and folklore are already part of education,” he said.
I voted for their introduction to the 20-year training programme.
He added that “excessive moralism” by the authors and teachers “is of interest” to children, and the main ideas “sublimated” in attractive stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beoulf from the English-Saxon language and wrote the Norwegian Myths Collection for Penguin and the British People's Stories, said: "Of course you may have intentions, but you better keep them with you."
Perhaps a major difference between an adult author who writes for adults and an adult author who writes for children is the need to feel some hope.
Not that everything should be simplified or brought to a happy ending, but that there is a need for a proper understanding of good and evil.
And this should be sublimated; revealed through history, not clearly formulated.
Old principle: to show, not to tell.
In the Vronez area, a football fan has been detained, smashing the window into the waiting room
At nine o'clock in the evening, on 29 October, two Moscow-based football fans were taken off the passenger train.
When they went to the game of their favorite team, the guys on the way set up a drunk decoy on the train.
Young people were delivered to an office at the police station in Georgia to draw up an administrative offence protocol.
There the fans were horrified by their anti-social behavior.
The police formed administrative material on them and fired them.
Young people bought tickets for the next train and were waiting for him to arrive at the train station.
In the middle of the first night, the fans left the railway station, but one of them, a 22-year-old boy, unexpectedly returned and broke the door into the waiting room.
A transport police officer and a guard of the RJD were on the broken glass phone.
They've been able to keep the villain trying to hide from the scene.
Russia's South-East LOU staff are conducting an inspection.
The issue of the initiation of a criminal case was reported by the Senior Rapporteur on the direction of information and public relations of the Russian SMU in the transport of Sergey Olhovik.
Vitaly Mutko: Watermelons?
I think we've been back 15 years.
Sports Minister Vitalie Mutko expressed his opinion on the riots in the tribunals during the Russian Cup of Shinnik - Spartacus.
I am in favour of all of this being held by sports events organizers: clubs, leagues, RFS.
But we can see that they took a position.
They're waiting for someone on the side to come and order.
It's a very good position, but it's not exactly right.
The sick should be organized, the clubs should invite their stewards, not leave the case on their own.
We have now drawn up a special Government decision on the rules of conduct at the stadiums.
Once it is adopted, we will address this issue in full.
But I will still have to invite all the organizers of the football process.
I read Leonid Fedun's interview.
State, please, give me the law faster.
It's such a feeling that the Bavarian sufferers came to Yaroslav and set it all up.
And we're foreign observers.
And it's terrible to see the tribe coming from the brandy.
And it's in the country that's preparing for the world's championship.
"I feel like we're back 10-15 years ago," Mutko said.
Snoudena can ask in Russia
Former U.S. Special Service Officer Edward Snowden will probably not go beyond Russia to give evidence of the hearing of German Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone negotiations.
As Interfax said on Friday, a well-known source of the situation, an American could respond to questions from the German Geno-Procurator's Office in writing or visually in Russia.
The departure of Edward Snowden outside Russia is virtually excluded.
"In this case, he will lose the refugee status and may be issued to Washington by US allies," said the agency's interviewer.
“However, in principle, the DG could send its representatives to the RF or forward written questions to Snowden,” added the source, adding that the issue should be handled at the inter-State level.
Former German Bundestag Hans-Christian Strebele reported that Edward Snowden was willing to give evidence on the case of the US-based negotiation services of the German Chancellor.
Snowden is willing to testify to the German law enforcement authorities either in Moscow or in Germany.
The former CIA officer made it clear he knew a lot.
Although the U.S.A. has blocked all its movements, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
However, this requires a clear definition of all the conditions for its arrival," Štrebele told Euronews.
Lawyer Snouden Anatoly Kucheren, commenting on an interfax source, said that his client could cooperate with German investigators, but when and how he would decide on his own.
A U.S. citizen of Edward Snowden, who worked for the U.S. National Security Agency (NAB) and the CIA, fled to Hong Kong in May 2013, after which he reported on the secret U.S. service operations related to the Internet.
Snowden flew through Moscow transit, but could not leave the airport because his passport had been cancelled by the US authorities, who had brought him serious charges, and remained in the Sheremiteovo transit area before August.
On August 1, Snowden received a document on granting him temporary asylum in Russia for one year and left Sheremiteevo on the same day.
Yesterday's American lawyer, Anatoly Kucheren, said his client was working in a "great Russian company".
German media reported last week about the AMB's report for Angela Merkel.
According to journalists, the US Chancellor's telephone negotiations began to open in 2002.
The tracking station was allegedly in the United States embassy in Berlin.
Following the publication of these data, the authorities of Germany stated that the survey of Merkel violates the laws and the sovereignty of Germany.
Ponomerev left "Just Russia"
A member of her office in Novosibirsk, Ilia Ponomrev, a Member of the State Duma from the Fair Russia party, filed a statement of departure from the political organization.
As the parliamentarian stated, he made a statement to the New Siberian regional office of the party.
According to her constitution, this automatically means that Ponomarev has left a number of "reveredros".
We'll sit down and have some tea...
"Why do many want to see the picture "Ilia Ponomrev puts on the table," but there's nothing so epochical about it," the MP commented on his decision.
Ponnamrev noted that good relations with the eser regional office remained.
However, Mr. Ilia Ponomarev ' s mandate was not to be refused.
He explained that despite leaving the party, he remained a member of the group and could not get out of it by law.
The announcements of Eli Ponomareva ' s intention to leave the Fair Russia party appeared on 30 October.
It was reported that Dmitry Goodkov and Valerie Zubov would leave with him, but the latter soon rejected this information.
Japan will discuss the conclusion of a peace treaty with Russia
The head of the Japanese MIDI Fumio Kisida met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to discuss issues relating to the conclusion of a peace treaty between the two countries.
“We would like to express our views on further development of political dialogue, discuss issues relating to the conclusion of a peace treaty”, said the meeting of Kisida.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Japan recalled that after Japan ' s Prime Minister Sindzo Abe visited Russia, relations between countries had become warmer and had become bilateral.
The Russian Minister, in turn, noted that the RF would meet Japan in the face of complex political issues, writes the RIA News.
The conclusion of a peace treaty between Japan and Russia implies a solution to the issue of the disputed Northern Territories.
In this regard, protests are taking place in Tokyo today, demanding the return of the country lost after the Second World War of the earth.
There are cars in the capital of Japan, from which the speaker says, "Return north territory!"
The police don't stop protesting, they're watching that there's no more noise.
Ben Greenman: Tenth anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: New Yorker
It can be said that New York is the birthplace of a stand-up comedy in America: almost a hundred years ago, an equestrian artist Frank Fay, a lecturer at the Palace Theatre in Broadway, began to talk about jokes directly to the audience in a conversational manner.
In time, the Fae's innovation was captured by others, just recently, the New York Comedy Festival.
An established and curated Caroline Hersh, founder of Caroline's stand-up club, is celebrating her tenth anniversary this year, with more than sixty shows in small clubs and larger theaters.
“Most of these cyclists started in Carolines, and then they achieved more success, reached the level when they were too famous to be at the club,” Hersh said.
We created this festival as a way to continue working with them.
This year the event includes the presentations by Vanda Sykes, Katie Griffin and Bill Mara, as well as the Standup for Heroes, an annual musical and comedy charity concert for military veterans in Madison Square Garden, where they will appear among other Bruce Springstin, John Stuart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
As the festival expanded, the world of comedy also expanded.
Several comedians participating in the festival this year have acquired popularity in a non-traditional way, for example through small television shows such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Croll was known for the role of a comedy show on a little known cable channel (especially the FXX FXX Fences League) and now runs his own skate show at Comedy Central.
Jenny Slett entered the actresses both on Saturday night in the direct air, and on the park and rest area, although she was most famous for the series of "Marcel's handkerchiefs".
Both Croll and Slate, as well as other young self-style comedians (surrealistly pessimistic Antony Jeselnik, a lucid focus on the racial theme of Kamau Bell), are the result of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the brightest moments of the festival will be David Steinberg's interview with Larry David.
Steinberg started out as a standup comedian, but then became a successful director on television and in movies, as well as an informal historical comedy.
From 2005 to 2007, he was the lead show on TV Land called Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg.
The meeting will be held in Town Hall, downtown Manhattan.
“This city is definitely the central element of Larry’s whole work,” Steinberg said.
He told me that when he came here, he sometimes played around in a corner between two houses, and he said, "If I remain without money, maybe I will live here."
Pakistani authorities initiated negotiations with local Taliban
The Pakistani authorities started negotiations with the Taliban.
This was reported by the Embassy of the United Kingdom, where the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Navaz Sharif, is visiting.
The Head of Government of Pakistan made a statement on negotiations with Islamic extremists during a meeting with British Deputy Prime Minister Niko Klegg, with whom he discussed Pakistan and India's relations, the world energy market and economic reforms in Pakistan.
“The Prime Minister reported that dialogue with the Taliban had begun,” says the statement by the Embassy of Pakistan in London.
- He said he hoped and prayed that dialogue would work in accordance with the Constitution of Pakistan," added the diplomats.
The Pakistani Taliban (Tehirk-i-Taliban Pakistan) are allies of a united Afghan movement, but they act independently in the north-west areas of the country bordering Afghanistan.
Pakistani Taliban are seeking to establish an Islamic State.
The Government of Islamabad had previously tried to start negotiations with local Taliban, but the movement had refused the dialogue.
It stated that negotiations would take place only if the authorities took the permanent deployment of troops located in areas where the Taliban were active and also released from the prisons of the arrested Islamists.
Navaz Sharif arrived in London at the World Islamic Economic Forum.
On Tuesday, 29 October, British Prime Minister David Cameron, head of the Pakistani Government and Afghan President Hamid Karzai held a tripartite meeting in London discussing the prospects of the peace process in Afghanistan.
The oil dropped to $96 per barrel.
The oil price continued to fall on Friday, when concerns about large stocks had become cloudy, indicating that China's energy-intensive manufacturing sector was gaining power.
The U.S. stock of ethanol was delivered in December at a cost of 14 cents, and its price was $96.24 per barrel at a later time in European times in electronic stores at the New York Stock Exchange.
On Thursday, the contract amounted to 39 cents, which amounted to a fall in October price of 5.8 per cent.
The rich oil stocks have influenced its value in recent weeks.
The Ministry of Energy stated on Wednesday that US stockpiles have increased by 4.1 million barrels in the last week.
In five weeks, more than 25 million barrels were filled.
However, on Friday, there was an indication of a possible increase in demand, according to two reports on the Chinese industry, which showed that its activity was under way.
This indicates that the recovery of China ' s economy may continue to take effect after the growth rate in the third quarter rose to 7.8 per cent after a 20-year minimum in the previous quarter.
The oil of Brent, also used by U.S. oil-processing companies, was reduced by 26 cents to $108.58 per barrel at the London Intercontinental Stock Exchange.
The main coach of Colorado Patrick Rua, explaining the decision to release Golchiper Semen Varlamov from the first minute of Friday's match with Dallas, expressed confidence that the recent night after the grid did not break his confidence in Russian, she handed over the SE's S.E.
And what we're waiting for, Rua said after the morning break, "Levin."
Of course, all of us are concerned, but we are confident of it and feel that it will be useful for him to go out on ice today.
We want him to go to the ice and show his usual level.
So you're absolutely sure the situation didn't say anything about the door conditions?
I'll see you today.
Surely our players will support Varley in helping him keep the door open, as it was in the previous match of this season.
Mainly, no one on the team is going to make any conclusions until the court finds out.
There's no need to be a vegan in Siberia: a warm tomato won't replace a mushroom
Why did vegetarianism not fit for life in Siberia, the correspondent of the RIA News found.
People who have completely refused products of animal origin should not live in Siberia.
They don't spend winter without losing their health, and no hot tomatoes compensate for them, they are considered by the New Sibia Dietologists and Doctors who have been questioned before the Vegan Day.
Five litres of oil
A strict vegetarianism, not only of meat and fish but also of milk, honey, eggs, becomes a modern way of life.
However, dietologists are convinced that in Novosibirsk and other Siberian cities, such strict nutrition standards are at least useless for health.
The complete rejection of animal products is harmful.
Animal proteins contain irreplaceable amino acids that are very difficult to compensate for.
It is necessary to include at least milk or eggs" - sure dietologist Marina God.
It is an example of fish containing the irreplaceable fatty acid of Omega-3.
The most rich of them is lignite oil.
"To need it in the quantities needed for man, we need to drink it in litres!" says the Dietologist.
The doctors are convinced that the inhabitants of Siberia should pay special attention to the winter.
In this season, vegetarianism is particularly dubious.
In our reality, there are high requirements for food.
In order not to freeze, increased calories are required.
"If a person restricts himself to animal products, then he does not take this calorie," says a specialist.
I agree with the doctor-dietologist Olga Poznjak.
She adds that fruit and vegetables are not an exit.
It is better to feed primarily on products grown in the region of residence or where they were born.
The genetic code is designed to improve the acceptance and counterfeiting of these products.
And the winter people want not to bite, but the hot sauce or something else," explains the doctor.
According to her, there may be vegans, which are actually useful for various plants, plants, beans, local plants, apples left in the winter, frozen berries.
But that certainly is not enough for a full diet.
In the opinion of a gastroenterologist, Claudia Arifulini, vitamin levels in the organisms are sufficient from mid-August to mid-September.
The full transition to vegetarianism in our harsh natural environment, when the temperature can change by 30 degrees per day and in May the snow is unintended.
The body needs energy for life, and this is, above all, fat," says a doctor.
Doctors note that violence is particularly harmful to children and pregnant women.
Children grow up, they need building materials, including amino acids.
And in keeping with the vegetarians, we give them to the underprivileged.
The pregnant women also need an increased level of protein, vitamins and micro-elements in the menu.
"The waves do not reach them," God says.
Arifulin says that an adult is willing to choose everything he wants to “play in the games he wants”.
He's got the body, the skeleton, the organs.
Still, children need to be fed properly.
If parents leave him some micro-elements or amino acids, choosing for him what he will be, it's just a violation of the rights of the child.
"The lack of any substance to develop the brain, the look, the bones won't recover again tomorrow," she says.
All the medical professionals in question are concerned about the low quality of winters grown in warmer plants and fruit and vegetables.
What is brought to us and grown up in the greenhouses contains less of the micro-elements we need than (made up) in the open.
"The quality of products is not that," says God.
Arifulin also notes that fruit and vegetable products and fruits are far from ideal standards.
At times, the desire of producers to harvest large crops is detrimental to quality.
"The apples don't become brown on the cut, the cucumbers are fast yellowing and dancing, the tomatoes tasteless and unrooming," says the medical examples, adding that they are probably consumed by an excessive amount of flavor.
And they become suppliers, not vitamins, but cells.
The Siberian Institute of Physics and Technology for Agricultural Problems, the candidate for rural science, Vera Petruk, does not agree.
She said that, with the right approach and compliance with all the standards and requirements in the boilers, it was possible to produce fully-fledged plants.
If they're trying to get bigger than a square meter, then of course, they're going to be more frequent, and they're going to feed the plants with mineral flavors.
For example, when too many nitrogen fertilizers grow rapidly, they are big but watertight and unsweet," she explains, adding that the quality issue is primarily dependent on the manufacturer's conscience.
The court suspended the enforcement of the “stop-and-search” practice in the New York Department of Police
On Thursday, the Federal District Court of Appeal suspended the enforcement of a judicial order requiring changes in the “stop-and-search” program of the New York Department of Police and removed the judge from the case.
The Court of Appeal of the Second District of the United States stated that the execution of the decisions of Judge Shira Shandlin would be suspended until the results of the city ' s appeal were obtained.
In August, the judge decided that the city had violated the constitution in implementing the street detention and interrogation programme.
The city complained about its decision and decision on corrective measures, including the requirement to appoint a controller to help the police office modify its work practice and its related training programme.
On Thursday, the Court of Appeal heard a debate by the parties on a request for suspension.
The Court of Appeal stated the need for the removal of a judge because it had violated the U.S. judges ' code of conduct and did not consider it necessary to avoid bias, partly because of a series of media interviews and official statements containing a public response to the court ' s criticism.
The judge decided that police officers had violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people, indisputably addressing black and Latin American people on the “stop-and-search” programme.
She appointed an external controller to monitor major changes that included policy, training and control reforms and decided to launch a pilot test programme on video cameras in police stations where most detentions occur.
In August, New York decided to terminate the practice of storing names and addresses of people who had been arrested after the police check.
The appeal for the city must take place after 14 March 2014.
The “stop and search” tactic has been criticised by a number of civil rights lawyers.
The search facility has been in some form for several decades, but the number of documented detentions has increased sharply with the administration of the independent mayor Michael Bloomberg, reaching an absolute record of 684,330 people in 2011, most of whom are black and Latin American.
In 2004, four people, all representatives of national minorities, filed a collective complaint.
The partners in the "stop-and-search" programme in the New York Department of Police said that these changes would put an end to mistrust, create a more reliable and effective police service and may influence how other police departments were implementing this practice.
Opposants argue that changes will reduce the military spirit of police officers, not the level of crime, lead to unnecessary money loss and do not address a more global problem of complex conditions in the police because of the decrease in officers for several thousand over the past decade.
The judge noted that she did not stop the practice of “stop-and-seek” which was in line with the Constitution, but changed the way the New York Police stopped people.
A pedestrian zone has been opened in the area of the Third World Gallery
A new pedestrian zone appeared in Moscow.
It is located in the area of the Tretijakov Gallery and is located two kilometres from Novokuznecka Metro station to the Bolot Square.
Street fairs, flower shops, fireplaces, urns and toilets have been established throughout the period, and there has been a lack of awareness and illegal advertising.
In addition to the Klimentov and Lavrushin Straits, which were already pedestrians, five streets were closed - the Ordinian Tupik, the Big and the Little Tolmachev Straits, the Kadashian Coastal and Bolota Square.
The transport movement on the streets of Maroseika and Petrovka is not limited.
On Friday Street from the Novokuzneck station to the Klimentov street, the conditions for pedestrians were created without removing and cutting the passage parts, reports newsmsk.com.
Within the walking area were the Third House, the Temple of Priests of the Clement of the Pope of Rome, the Museum, libraries, monuments, and other monuments.
Previously, the Twerk Pass, the Stoleschniks, and the Kuzneck Bridge were completely pedestrians.
The larger Dmitrovka, where the pedestrian zone was opened in early September, was determined to close the car on departures and holidays.
Coulson applied to break up the phone to check on a confidential message
The former editor of the newspaper News of the World Andy Coulson allegedly used “phone break, tracking and resistance” in an attempt to confirm false information about the novel Charles Clark, who was then acting as Minister of the Interior.
The prosecutor, Queen's lawyer Andrew Edys, told the Old Bailey court that in May 2005, the newspaper News of the World received an uncertain news that Clark was meeting with his “attractive special adviser” to Hannah Polby.
The newspaper ordered Private Detective Glenn Mulkair to break up Polby's voicemail and warn her at home to take an interview, but Coulson also called her and left her voicemails, the court heard.
“The accusation is that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not a man who will stand by someone’s house hoping to stay someone away, the man who likes to invite people’s history to see what they’re going to say,” said Mr. Eddy.
He said that the News of the World used three ways of investigating history: phone breaking, tracking, and resistance.
The editor is personally involved in the third.
Apparently, he knows about the second, about the footnote, he just has to.
What about the first?
Does he know about the phone break?
He says, "No. We say, "Yes."
Listening to the novel Clarke for the first time drew the attention of the editorial News of the World when a source of sexual interest in Ms. Polby said, “Don’t waste time, she and Charles.”
The cassette with voicemails received from her phone at least three times was taken out of Mulkair ' s house in August 2006.
The investigators also found records on the private detective's computer, in which Ms. Polby and her sister were represented as “Projects”.
During the period under observation, Mrs. Polby ' s grandmother and grandfather received anonymous phone calls requesting information about her, Mr. Edis said.
At that time, former chief reporter Neville Turlbeck and former reporter James Wezerap monitored Ms. Polby's movements.
Leaving her voicemail on 18 June 2005, Coulson said: “I have a story that we plan to publish tomorrow and that I would like to discuss with Charles very much.”
Mr. Edys said that Coulson's participation in this story was based on the same scenario as other influential people, such as former Minister of the Interior David Blancett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson had entered into a confrontation with Mr. Blancett about a novel with a married woman when he himself met Rebekah Brooks, who was then married.
Coulson and Brooks denied contact with other people to break telephones between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006.
Mulcair, Turlbeck and Weserap were admitted to the phone breach.
Snowden claims readiness to communicate with the FWG authorities in the case of interrogation
Former CIA officer Edward Snowden expresses his willingness to come to Germany as soon as he has the legal opportunity to do so and to meet with representatives of the FWG authorities, reports the RIA Novosti.
A letter from former CIA officer to the FRG authorities at a meeting with journalists in Berlin was presented on Friday by a deputy of the Bundestag Hans-Christian Strebele, through which Snowden conveyed the message to the German authorities.
Stribele had previously met Snowden in Moscow.
Four people were injured as a result of a fire on the Tver Street
As a result, four people were injured in a collection centre in Moscow, on Tver Street.
As Interfax reported with reference to the source in emergency services, one of the victims was hospitalized.
According to the source, passersby were affected during the fire in a suffocated underground passage.
As RIA Newty writes with reference to the head of the Pavl Livinski Fuel and Energy Department, electricity is now fully restored in all houses on the Tver Street.
A fire in the heat collector near the house 15 on the Tver Street took place on the evening of 31 October.
There was a strong smoke from the lignite canals, and there was a suffocation in the underground passage at the Armenian store.
As a result of the fire, 11 houses were destroyed on the Tver Street.
At 21:45 in Moscow time, the fire was extinguished.
United States dollars cut food allowance for the poor
Food allowance for a family of four is reduced by $36 per month
From Friday in the United States, the financial provision of product talents known as “Food stamps” is being reduced as the relevant public programme is being completed.
For the family's food allowance of four people, $36 per month will now be allocated to the family less than before, according to officials.
This will affect 47 million poorer Americans.
According to the Reuters Agency, in the financial year 2012, one person ' s allowance amounted to an average of $133 per month.
Food aid expenditures in the United States increased to $80 billion a year due to rising unemployment and food prices.
Approximately 14 per cent of Americans rely on free food aid issued under “Food stamps” bearing such a name from ancient times when they had the form of paper coupons.
When the current economic crisis began, the programme was expanded to encourage growth and help the poorest Americans.
However, Republicans in Congress need further reductions in the programme ' s resources, stating that it should be aimed at helping those in need more.
Food store owners across America are concerned that reductions will reduce consumer costs.
U.S. Congressmen continue to argue as much as possible about reducing the funding of the Government.
Blizzard released 19-year-old platform for free
Blizzard's studio released its Blackthorne platform on PC free of charge in 1994.
This is reported by the WoW Insider.
According to him, the game became available at Battle.net in the classic Blizzard game section.
However, some gamers note that only those users whose accounts belong to the American part of the service can now jump.
The game is still unavailable for Russian users.
As the media reports, the version that Blizzard has now released on the PC does not differ externally from the original version of the game.
The Blackthorn soundtrack was also unchanged.
Blackthorne platform, which Blizzard released 19 years ago, originally went to SNES consoles.
Its events unfolded on the planet Tuul, whose inhabitants were divided into dark and light kingdoms.
On one occasion, dark ruler Sarlak decided to kill the bright King Vlaros and become the only ruler of the planet.
The main hero of the game is the son of Vlaros Kyle, who was rescued from death and sent to Earth.
Twenty years later, he returned to Tuul to fight against Sarlac's rebels and protect the inhabitants of the planet from them.
The original Blackthorne was the first game the studio released after it was renamed Blizzard Entertainment.
Before that she was called Silicone & Synapse.
The publisher Blackthorne was an Interplay company.
New cars will appear in the Moscow metropolitan area.
But selling tickets to passengers will not be for money but for meetings.
A 30 ruble cost trip will be for a potential passenger at 30 meetings.
The number of meetings will be calculated by means of modern technologies, ITAR-TASS reports with reference to the press service of the Russian Olympic Committee.
The first apparatus will be installed at the Exhibit Station on 8 November 2013.
In the presentation of new ticket athletes, the president of the Russian Olympic Committee, Alexander Zukov, and the Olympic Championships, Alexie Nemov and Elena Zamoldčikov, will host.
The Agency ' s recognition of national security enhances the paramilitary corporation in respect of public observation
On a warm day at the end of August, the German police helicopter flew low over the United States consulate in Frankfurt, Germany’s financial capital.
Under instructions from the Federal Constitutional Protection Service (BfV), the German Internal Intelligence Service was tasked with photographing the roof of the U.S. representation building less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
The German media said that BfV was hoping to find antennas of hearing aids, and these actions resulted in negotiations between the United States and the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin.
James Clapper, director of U.S. National Intelligence, again assured in September that the U.S. does not use the possibility of external intelligence “to steal foreign commercial secrets for American companies in order to enhance their international competitiveness or increase their profit”.
But since Edward Snowden, a contract servant who became a disconcerting official, began publishing his secretaries of U.S. intelligence, European governments and company leaders are no longer convinced that the director can be trusted.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency has been monitoring the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and has been given access to data stored by US cloud service providers, including Google and Yahoo, have raised the paramilitary corporation caused by the State's survey to new heights.
The last drop was reported to have been heard by Chancellor Angela Merkel for perhaps about ten years.
If Europe's most influential person can become a target, then of course, potential targets are also business leaders.
Snowden has made clear intensive cooperation between U.S. intelligence services and companies.
I think this data is probably used with mutual benefit.
“Germany must wake up,” says Oliver Green, president of BITMI, which represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies are convinced that the United States is now at almost the same risk as China in the field of industrial espionage and data theft, according to a study published by the EY Consulting Agency in July.
In all the documents revealed by Mr. Snowden, however, there was still no evidence that the United States had transferred the commercial secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians expressed concern that the EU did not lack certain information technology and the Internet, and expressed the view that it should try to reduce its dependence on the United States.
Businessmen are skeptical about this.
Someone in the German Parliament says we need to create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
“This is not an option”, says Gasso Plattner, president of the German software supplier company for the SAP business.
If there is a need in the powerful European IT industry, it should not have been allowed to die more than 20 years ago.
All are subsidized in Germany: from coal to cars and farmers.
Everything but the IT industry.
Nevertheless, the coverage and technical development of United States spying agencies, known for the discovery of Snowden, have been a shock to some companies that previously thought that China ' s greatest risk was.
More progress is being made in cloud technologies where European company managers are better aware that the data stored in the United States are in the same jurisdiction and are therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a study conducted by the Trade Association Cloud Security Alliance, about 10 per cent of its non-American participants refused to use US-based cloud provider services after the release of an American programme for intellectual analysis of Prism data.
Jim Sneeb, one of the executive directors of the SAP, said: “We see consumers asking a new question that didn’t arise a year ago, namely: where my data is stored and can you guarantee that they will remain physically in this jurisdiction.”
Many German leaders claim that the latest messages are merely confirmations of what they already knew: powerful States want to steal their most valuable secrets, and therefore these data must be protected at any price.
What is happening is not surprising.
He always had a place.
“This has been the subject of discussion for many years and has not changed significantly in the current debate,” says Kurt Bock, CEO of the chemical company BASF.
The Americans are spying on us at the commercial and industrial level, and we are also spying on them, because it is in our national interests to protect our commercial businesses.
Corporate leaders usually do not like to take advantage of the responses they have taken, as this may give the enemy the advantage.
Large companies have long thought that taking a free bottle at the exhibition or leaving a laptop without supervision in the hotel room is at least reckless.
Ulrich Hakenberg, a member of Audi’s Board of Directors, says that it has been a standard practice for many years to collect mobile phones before government meetings so that they can not be used as hearing aids.
The Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution of Germany recommends that company managers consider using simple prepaid mobile phones during foreign travel due to the vulnerability of smartphones.
Prepaid mobile phones are subsequently released.
However, there is a fear that small and medium-sized companies will remain vulnerable to seizures and seizures.
In Germany, many such companies are leaders in the world market in their specific niche.
“Small and medium-sized companies often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets from unauthorized access”, warns the BfV report.
The United States has warned its own companies about economic espionage from other countries.
In February, the U.S. National Intelligence Survey put France and Russia and Israel together in a second series of offenders who are hacking for economic intelligence, after China, approves The Washington Post.
A member of the Board of Directors of the prestigious German company confirmed that when it comes to economic espionage, “French is worse for all”.
Bernard Scarsini, former head of the French Internal Intelligence Agency DCRI, reportedly said in an interview this month: “Services are well aware that all countries, even when working together to combat terrorism, are spying on their allies.”
Parents of a youth in Georgia who died by “an accident”, believe that their son was killed
Parents of a youth from Georgia whose body was found inside a courtroom in his high school sports room thought their son had been killed, said a family lawyer on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson of the city of Waldo, Georgia, was found on 11 January in a vertical mother lying behind the courts in his high school gym.
The Loundes County Sheriff's investigators concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, but the 17-year-old family objected.
“They are absolutely sure their son was killed,” said FoxNews.com Benjamin Kramp, a lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson.
They never believed he died as the sheriff says.
“They believe that this is contrary to logic, the laws of physics, and the sound sense,” Kramp said.
They believe that it is a cover for the protection of people or people responsible for the death of their son.
“They sent their son to school with a school bag and brought him back to the body bag,” he said.
American lawyer Michael Moore said on Thursday that he was conducting an official investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several key questions remained unanswered.
What is the cause of death?
Was his death a result of the crime?
Moore made a statement at the press conference on Thursday.
I'm going to study all the facts wherever they bring us.
My goal is to learn the truth.
“I believe that there are sufficient grounds” he said for an official investigation.
Mur told reporters that the initial revelation showed that Johnson died as a result of “positional asphyxiation”.
However, the second revelation, says Mura, showed another cause of death.
“There are several issues to be resolved or clarified,” he said.
Moore added that if he found enough evidence to require a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson's death, he would ask the FBI to conduct it.
The Deputy Chief of Staff of the County of Loundes was not available for comment when he was contacted on Thursday.
On Wednesday, the Judge of South Georgia ordered the authorities to publish all the video surveillance cameras that were being watched by investigators.
A teenager’s parents said they hoped that the videos contained the key to his memory of how he died.
Spartacus: For information on persons who have exposed the Fascist symbol
A statement by the Moscow Club on the appearance of a Fascist flag in Yaroslavle was made on the official Spartacus website.

Disease Control and Prevention Centres issued recommendations for schools on child allergy
In the area of disease control and prevention, a list of recommendations for control of food allergies in children in schools has been published.
This is the first list of such recommendations issued by the U.S. Government, while the number of children of school age with food allergies is increasing.
One of the 20 children in the United States now have allergies.
The disease control and prevention centres found that the prevalence of food allergy among children increased by 18 per cent from 1997 to 2007.
The guide contains information for schools on how to raise awareness of teachers and child food allergy service staff and how to assist in the event of an allergic reaction.
It also recommends that schools keep adrenaline stocks — most commonly used for injections by the EpiPen automatic syringe — to help with potentially fatal anaphylaxis.
State law has recently amended the regulation to enable schools to make adrenaline stocks with fewer difficulties.
The notification also contains a list of typical symptoms described by children with an allergic reaction.
Children may say, “I feel like something is going on in my language”, “I feel like I have a hair on my tongue” or “the tongue of a sticker”.
Parents of intersex children can choose “undefined sex”
Germany became the first European country to recognize the third half of children born with intermittent sex organs.
The newborn will no longer be required to assign a male or female sex.
The new law does not require parents to name a half of such children, allowing parents to refer to sex as “undetermined” or “unestablished” in their birth certificates.
The purpose of the law was to remove the pressure from parents who could make hasty decisions on the transfer of sex to the newborn and to prevent discrimination against inter-sex people.
One intersexual man, according to the BBC, said many years later, "I am not a man or a woman."
I'll be left with a doctor who's set up a hairdresser with blues and scarves.
About one in two thousand babies born each year are neither boys nor girls.
They have intersexuality, one of about 60 pathological conditions that are diagnosed as “sexalted development” — a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonadals (ionics or sperms) or unusually developed external sex organs.
Wallis Simpson may have been an intersex.
Gender identification has not yet been sufficiently studied, but most experts in the United States say that if sex cannot be determined, it is better to take advantage of all available information and assign it than to expect and monitor the psychological and physical development of the child before the operation, if at all.
The New York psychiatrist, Dr. Jack Dresser, who specializes in gender identification, said that the new German law “sounds like a good idea”.
Intersexual children create ethical dilemmas.
“Some people have life-threatening violations that require operational intervention, but most children don’t have them,” he said.
You can assign a field without surgery and then see how the identity develops.
Science about how a child develops any gender identity is not too accurate.
No one can answer questions about why.
It's a mystery why people are gay.
The report sent to the European Commission in 2011 describes intersex people as being different from transsexual or transgender, since their status is not gender-related, but their biological construction, which does not correspond exclusively to either male or female, but typically to both of them at the same time or not.
These characteristics can be seen in secondary sexual signs such as muscle mass, vulnerabilities, chest and body weight; primary sexual signs such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provides a general picture of discrimination faced by inter-sexual and transgender people in the field of employment, as well as on the level of prejudice, cruelty and prejudice crimes.
Now there's a special camp for boys with gender bias.
Australia and Nepal are already allowing adults to place male, female or “third sex” in their official documents.
In June, 52-year-old Norrie May-Walby became the first person in the world to be recognized as a “unemployed” man, held the right to remain “undetermined” sex for life.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, German passports will use the third symbol in addition to M and F - X, i.e. intersexual.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still at odds, according to a news release on channel France 24.
In 2011, dozens of legislators from France, this highly-expressed Catholic country, signed a petition for the withdrawal of “general theory” from school textbooks.
The American Catholic Online website also expressed disagreement with the German law, saying that “in a situation where the world is attracted to a new state where sex is the subject of choice and sexual activity is not, we are turning two more pillars of civilization.”
A mother of a newborn child from Maryland also reported on the Baby Zone website that she would prefer that the children should have sex at birth.
“It’s hard enough to raise a child without any further restrictions, especially if you don’t know your child’s half,” she said to her parents’ website.
Children need stability and confidence.
Historically, children born with male and female sexual organs were called hermaphrodites — in the name of a beautiful Greek god who had signs of both sexes.
And not more than ten years ago, the medical community considered the gender as a letter that can be read and then re-designed.
But now many are questioning the ethical grounds for surgery, knowing that gender identity is complex, and that doctors sometimes make a false choice, not knowing how a child will perceive the gender assigned to him when he grows up.
"In the middle of the 20th century it was called an emergency psychiatric case," Dresser said.
When such children were born, you did not call a psychiatrist — you called a surgeon.
The dominant theory of how to deal with children with intermediate genitalia was suggested by Dr. John Mani of John Hopkins University, who believed that gender was easily altered.
He introduced the term “Gender Identities” and argued that environmental signals, including social signals — how parents grow the child — interact with the child’s genes and hormones, determining whether man would be considered a man or a woman.
But in one case in 1966, known as John/John, his theories were questioned.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been damaged during the primordial cutting, to cast the child completely, also to remove his eggs, and to raise him as a girl.
“I presented the case as a successful example of the transition, but that was not the case,” Dresser said.
When the boy was about 15, he became a boy again and married a woman.
But at 38 years of age, he committed suicide.
Dresser said that some doctors are still “applying this model”.
But in the 1990s, with the arrival of the Internet, the survivors of these gender-change operations declared themselves “unsatisfied”.
That was the case with Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with XY male chromosomes, but with intermediate type genitals.
The doctor could not determine exactly whether he had a big clit or a small penis, and he was convinced that he would never be able to live a man’s “full life”.
Soon after his birth in 1976, therefore, Bruce’s external genital and eggs were surgically removed, and he was raised as a girl.
He was given female hormones when he was 12 years old.
“I knew I wasn’t a girl,” he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask questions.
At 18 years of age, he was appointed a vaginal plastic.
But when he was depressed and realized that something was wrong, he needed medical documentation.
What he knew was terrible.
I was sterilized when I was born, and nobody ever told me about it.
Bruce was born with a sexual development disorder that did not allow his body to produce enough testosterone for normal development of genitals.
When he learned the truth, he became a man again, receiving testosterone and removing his chest.
The operation made it fruitless.
Today, he is protecting others in an organization called the Interface Project, trying to bring people into the normal perception of intersexuality.
But Ann Temar-Mattis, executive director of the California Legal Association Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that the German law “stimulates the insertion of labels and stigma”.
“Many activists are concerned that the German law will encourage parents to make a quick decision and give the child “undefined sex”, she said.
We are afraid that he will contribute to the intervention.
We think it's better to assign a male or female sex and then wait.
But we have not yet seen how this law will prove to be, so all we can do is make assumptions.
Temar-Mattis said that her organization supported the Australian law because “it allows adults to make a choice for the third sex”.
“Agreed people should be able to make their own decisions about formal sex,” she says.
The German law refers to the birth of her.
It's a fight that little kids shouldn't get into this stage.
When they grow up, they will be able to make decisions about their own body.
But Dr. Arlin Barac, a Pittsburgh X-Mmmologist, who has a daughter with a sexual development disorder and who helps hundreds of others in the support group, said that the German law “supports” both parents and children.
The daughter of Barac, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but she has a sexual development disorder called “androgen insensitivity syndrome”.
Since her androgen receptors are not working properly, Katie's female signs have developed.
She's got a wet spot, but there's no mother and no eggs.
Now, at 29 years of age, Katie is married and is in charge of child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although barren, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or gestational surrogate motherhood.
“The law gives parents time not to make hasty decisions on their own,” Barac said.
He gives them time to do some analysis and to deal with the situation, as well as the interval before they write “man” or “woman”.
In such a case, you grow up to be a child, you love a child.
You have a wonderful child, and you have joy.
We don't have to do an operation that's irreversible.
“This allows children to take part in decision-making and eliminate the concern that moves parents because they do not feel what they are doing right,” she said.
In the end, the child will decide which sex he or she is comfortable with — and that is remarkable.
This enables children to decide on their own.
Cicago's hero Nikolai Habibulin stressed that he understands what should be played better.
According to a 40-year-old Russian, he will continue to work hard at training.
In the last two meetings, Habibulin first missed six shows from Tampa Bay and then four from Ottawa, and in the second game he was replaced after the fourth show.
We have to play well, and in the last two games I haven't been able to do this, says CSNChicago Habibulin.
- I need to find confidence in training, I guess, to approach them as a game, and try to achieve a better outcome.
You must study your past games and deal with those shortcomings that have been.
There are a few small components that I need to improve, but I feel quite comfortable with training.
But then, after a few heads, everything turns into a snowcomb.
Maybe I need some relaxation.
Gatekeepers don't think I'm the only one - always trying to play the perfect game.
If I miss four, five, six, I'm not in trouble.
It doesn't matter what happens in front of my doors.
I'm still working on myself so I don't miss so many shows.
It's good that my teammates support it, but in principle it's just that I have to play better.
Two games is not the whole season, but I wanted to spend them a lot better.
But it happened.
I have to put this aside.
I'll just try to win the next match better.
The bus to Altae was turned into a bus.

The bus followed by Rubzovska in Vishnevk was home to 12 passengers and a driver, all injured in various degrees of severity and hospitalized.
Eleven victims were delivered to the City Hospital No. 1 Rubzovska, two people were hospitalized at the RUB Rubzovska.
Medvedev estimates that the SSJ-100 aircraft will be deployed to Europe
Russia expects that, once the Latin American and Asian markets have been established, Superjet 100 will also be installed in Europe.
"We expect that, in general, we will get more than 170 aircraft of this type," says Russian Prime Minister Dmitria Medvedev, "interfax, which told them at the press conference with French Prime Minister Jean Mark Eiro.
The Head of the Russian Government noted that there was serious cooperation with French colleagues, since it was a joint project.
We have discussed some financial issues related to insurance today, but we hope that once this aircraft is strengthened in the markets of Latin America and in the Asia-Pacific region, it will also be provided to our partners in Europe.
"I hope he'll ever be placed in France," stressed the Russian Prime Minister.
SSJ-100 is an aircraft built by the "Citizen Aeroplanes of Suhogo" in partnership with Alenia Aermacchi.
Liner is developed on the basis of modern technologies and offers high quality and comfort standards in the 100 passenger seats segment.
Dneproperty Energy launched a unique rescue program...
In an old age, the peasants on the high pillar set up a bicycle from the telegy, and the heavy nest was well held on.
Such special support has long been lost, so the shafts of the electric transmission lines have been lulled down by the wires, which makes the real house sound.
Anja’s grandmother, near her home in the village of Ivanovka in the Petríkov region for 20 years, began to observe the nest in spite of all the efforts of its inhabitants.
The birds put new vets on top of them, and the lower layer is already in the middle of the line, and here it is.
Of course, it's a pity for the family of the atheists who have nestled in the yard every year, taken out and fed three or four birds for the summer, but they don't want to stay out of the light.
As soon as the birds flew to the warmest part of the country, Grandma Ana called the Imperial REC, which has the support.
And I didn't even expect them to react so quickly.
When our specialists arrived in Ivanovka, they were surprised that the nest was still holding, said DTEC Technical Director Sergey Berzesovski.
In fact, there has been corruption on the lines that have been found within a nest weighing between 150 and 200 pounds [150 and 200 kg].
At any time, the birds could have been killed by an electric power plant.
The locals were also at risk of being out of light because of damage to the pipelines.
The linear monters have therefore launched a nest rescue operation, and not the first time in our practice.
Ornithologists from the Dnepropetrov National University have helped develop a nest transport scheme.
They did training for local network staff.
A well-known dnepropetrov ornithologist, Alexander Ponomarenko, consulted the energy industry at all stages of the reconstruction of nests.
To begin with, it was estimated that there were more than 50 genuine “quarters” in the area of the accident.
Special metal platforms that remind the furnace were broken down for their reconstruction.
The ground was filled with grass, and the old nest was then carried there.
In the opinion of scholars, it is sufficient to lay old vestiges as a basis for birds to know nests and return to them.
Then they build their own apartment.
A month ago, the first nest was reconstructed in the village of Peschanka of Novomovsk.
A number of electricians put on a new iron pillar and placed on it a platform with an old nest already inhabited.
All the operations were carried out by the energy companies in nine thousand griffins.
The same was true in the days of Ivanovka Petríkov district in the Ani grandmother’s area.
Here the platform was secured in the former place, just hanging over the wires.
Ornithologists are confident that careful, conservative birds will not even notice the spring that their “quarter” has undergone capital repairs.
By the end of the year, the same reconstruction is expected to take place in four more nests in the Pokrov and Carican areas of Dneproperty.
As long as some save rare birds, others unhappily kill them.
During the days, the whole area was filled with sad news - in the village of Ust-Kamenk of the Apostolic Region, on the day of the hunt for the pheasants, the marriage mates shot a small family on the local river for entertainment.
The noble birds were not afraid of the people; the locals fed them and did not hurt them.
When the villagers heard the shots, they ran to the stream, four beautiful lees were already lying on the water dead.
Now the officers of the Apostolic Paradise of the militia find out who shot the birds in the Red Book.
The Russian march is becoming more popular
On 4 November, on the Day of People's Unity, Moscow will be held in agreement with the Russian March.
According to the Levada Centre survey, support for the Russian march is growing, with 40% of the citizens already agreeing to the idea of their implementation.
According to Levada-Central, 40 per cent of citizens have different approvals for the Russian marches: 11 per cent of these shares are definitely positive and 29 per cent are “pre-positive”.
The popularity of the Russian march is increasing, with only 14 per cent of Russians being welcomed in 2006 and twice as many citizens were supported in December 2010.
"Definitely negative" to "Russian marches" are only 7% Russians, "almost negative" is 19%.
35 per cent had not yet been able to formulate their attitude towards this action.
This year, Mary Moscow agreed to hold a Russian march of up to 15,000 people in Ljubljana, which is reported today by the head of the Security Department of the capital of Alexei Majorov.
This action by nationalists takes place every year on the Day of National Unity since 2005.
On the question of sociologists, "Did you hear that on 4 November, Russian marches were held under slogans of protection of Russian rights in Russia?" three fourths (75%) of the citizens responded negatively.
Only one fifth of Russians (20 per cent) now know about this action.
It is noteworthy that in December 2010 almost three thirds of the citizens were heard about the Russian marches (31%).
Let us remember that three years ago, on 11 December, a natural meeting of nationalists took place in the Managena Square, which had grown into massive riots.
Levada-Central also asked the Russians which holiday was celebrated on 4 November.
Two years later, the number of people who knew the right answer (People ' s Day) increased from 41 per cent to 49 per cent.
However, only 15 per cent of citizens gather to celebrate this holiday.
About the same amount (17 per cent) is planned to celebrate the October Day of the Revolution on 7 November.
Most citizens (62%) are not going to celebrate any of these holidays.
As Mary of Moscow agreed on "Russian March" in Ljubljana
On 28 October, the capital authorities agreed to hold the Russian March in Ljubljana on 4 November.
This was reported by the leader of the Russian Association, the organizer of the Dmitry Demushkin.
In addition to the six in Ljubljana on the Day of People ' s Unity, there will be a meeting and a rock concert of the Kolovrat group, also agreed with the authorities.
How the Russian March 2012 went
On the Day of People's Unity in 2012, nationalists passed the sixth from the Jakiman Coast to the Central House of the artist where the meeting took place.
The organizers estimated the number of participants in 20,000, the IMF called the number 6,000.
Communication: Obama's pre-election headquarters considered the exclusion of Baiden for Hillary Clinton
According to The New York Times, the immediate advisers of President Barack Obama secretly considered the possibility of replacing Vice-President Joe Baiden with Hillary Clinton in the 2012 election list.
This opening is the brightest sensation from all the expected book by Mark Galperin and John Heilemmann about the 2012 “Dual Rates: The Game Has Changed 2012”.
The Times received a copy of the book ready for publication and reported on Thursday evening that the next president's assistants had conducted “a large-scale study in focus groups and public opinion polls at the end of 2011” to assess whether Baiden's exclusion could help lift the hope of Obama's re-election.
According to political investigator The Times Jonathan Martin, the book provides a detailed description of the attempts made by senior pre-election officials and the White House, namely the former head of the White House Administration, Bill Daily, to assess the impact of the vote on the appointment of former Secretary-General Clinton as Vice-President.
The possible replacement was a secret, carefully guarded in the Chicago pre-election headquarters and the Oval Office.
Only six of the President’s closest advisers — including Dale, former Chief of Staff of Obama Jim Messin and former Senior Advisers of the White House of David Axelrod and David Pluff — knew that the replacement was being considered.
The book Posts Double claims that Dale was the initiator of an attempt to replace Baiden, despite their “close personal relationship”, but eventually declined this step when their data showed that the Clinton addition to the electoral list “will not significantly improve Obama’s chances”.
In an interview with Martin Dale, he confirmed that the Administration had indeed considered replacing Byden Clinton.
“I was actively talking about a lot of things, and that was one of them,” Daily said the newspaper.
You should remember that at that time the President was in a terrible shape, so we thought, "Oh, God, what are we going to do?"
Although Dale had described the study as “necessary verification”, Martin had told CNN Anderson Cooper that the pre-election headquarters had put enough emphasis on examining whether this step would bring dividends to the vote.
“Pre-election headquarters do not spend such money on surveys and focus groups unless they consider anything serious,” Martin said in AC 360.
It is not clear, however, whether Obama knew that his team had studied the possibility of replacement.
Martin told CNN that he asked Dale if his then boss knew about the possible transfer.
Although Dale said that he did not think that the president was in the course of a possible replacement, the former head of administration acknowledged that Obama knew that it was possible.
Martin added that the double rates did not provide a clear answer to the question whether the results of political sensitization had come to Obama's table.
Cooper asked Martin whether he seriously believed that Obama did not know about the study of the possibility of excluding Baiden from the electoral list.
"Possible," said Martin.
Do you want the light in the darkness of the frozen?
The British businessman created the world's first light in the dark, frozen with honey.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescent properties of the marine animal to develop the luminous food.
He came up with this idea by reading the scientific article about bears, and convinced scientists in China to re-establish a brilliant protein.
The frozen person reacts with the language of those who eat it, increasing the pH in the protein and causing it to light.
Chris says that since the frozen starts to light when it reacts to the heat of the mouth, that means the more you lean, the more light it becomes.
Charlie, the founder of the ice-cream production company "Lice me, I'm delicious," says, "It's an incredible thing, but still at the very beginning, if it's about production, so for £200 you'll get about 2 g of substance."
The white one that we use in ice cream is in reaction to your language at neutral pH.
So when your mouth warms up, it will increase your pH and the frozen will start to shine.
We tested it over the last few months, and it seemed to be ideal to introduce it to Halloween, because it creates such a remarkable bright effect.
This may be the most expensive frozen of what I've done, because the medusa's luminescence four times the golden road.
So every scarf is worth me about £140.
That's why it's nice enough to taste.
The experimental company Charlie, located in Bristol, is famous for its unusual tastes, including beer, cheese, cattle and the taste of social gold.
But his next creation must be even more ambitious.
He said, “I really want to develop something that is invisible.”
It's not possible to define it because of the crack caused by ice crystals, which are frozen, but I think we'll find a way to do this.
Frozen uses the fluorescent properties of medusa synthesized by Chinese scientists
Coach Avangarda Vladimir Chebaturkin, speaking of preparing his team to win the regular KHL championship against Salavat, said that the Omits had conducted a thorough analysis of the defeat of the Magnitagore Metallurgy.
The specialist stressed that Avangard needs to pay more attention to the defence game.
We've been watching a video match against the Magnitude Metallurgy, a website called "Avangarda" by Chebaturkin.
- They missed a lot of shows, not a very good time.
They have been missed because of their mistakes, because of their failure to perform the task.
We knew the rival had executives.
According to statistics, there were five onslaughts, three of them killed us.
Very good.
Have these errors been taken into account in preparing for today's game?
We and the guys each match understand very well, talk after the game we're ready for a new rival.
The main thing is for the installation to be carried out.
Everyone saw the first time against the Metallurgy.
The game was performed, and the account was 2:0.
They missed the goal "in the separation" - and in the third period they made a mistake.
Considering how difficult the game was, he did not see any sense in connecting the defenders.
Defend the whole team.
Now, Avangarda has a long home series, the gamers go through the day, and the team's tired?
All teams are in the same condition.
The main focus is now the realization of its moments and the performance of the task.
Hockey is an emotional game, if you run the installation, it's not that complicated.
As a result of the new rules introduced by Russian customs, hundreds of furs have been placed on the border with Russia for almost a week.
Today, Danish officials have promised to provide drinking water drivers and to establish biotoulets
Hundreds of furs were dug at border crossings when entering Russia.
This situation has arisen as a result of changes in the customs rules for the manufacture of goods.
Ukrainian border guards and customs officers confirm that the Russian side is in the process of setting up a Russian side that has not previously warned of innovations.
As of 28 October, the Russian customs authorities began to apply additional measures to ensure the delivery of goods, as reported by Deputy Chief of Eastern Customs Vladimir Denisov.
The new model document applies in countries that have acceded to the Convention on International Transport.
The dropout points work in a stronger way.
The FACTOV correspondent was on the border and was in contact with the hostages of the situation.
The prices in the street coffee shop at the Novoazovsk pass point are growing every day, as well as from the fur.
The rodents are located in several rows, growing about two kilometers.
The Customs Terminal Novoazovsk - Veselo Voznánka provides one of the most important transport routes south of Ukraine on the international highway.
From here, the goods are sent to Russia, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Armenia.
On Sunday before midnight, they were still released, and then introduced these rules, was complained about by a long-time fighter named Alexey Golovanev (photo), who was carrying transit goods through Russia from Turkey to Kazakhstan and had been in his car for almost a week.
Under the new rules, in order to cross the border, I need an additional package of documents and the payment of the cargo insurance.
The amount depends on the value of the cargo and the distance to which it is carried.
Minimum insurance is 4.5 to 5,000 rubles (about 1100 to 1300 rubles).
Those who travel nearby (e.g. Georgia, Armenia) with a cargo of up to $50,000 pay some 15,000 rubles and travel around.
And the rest of them are locked up. No one has the like of it.
You imagine that if the driver is carrying the cargo of all four thousand dollars, but in Moscow, he needs 90,000 rubles (almost 23,000 griffins) to pay for the transit!
The conditions for survival at the border are none, and they are set up by roadmen who are located near their cars.
In border stores and cafes and so on, but prices like here, we've never met!
The sellers were oriented and quickly tipped off: 15 griffin stands for the baton, seven griffins for coffee, 25 griffins for soup.
And coffee one.
And there's no toilet.
We're sleeping in the stage, and we're going to the bathroom.
We can't wash or take care of...
I can't get out of the car for a week, my wife's on the road.
A week ago, Victor Scottarenko, another coward, was comforting himself.
Is it just gonna get to my car in a week?
Why do you have half a litre of water?
It's 11 and 15 griffins.
What, the bottle of crystal or the water of silver?
We have coffee, not a store.
Take as long as there's anything else, the seller's on the line.
After the situation began to light up in the media, Ukrainian leaders drew the attention of the authorities to the plight of the region.
The management of the Ambrosian and Novosan Gardens Administrations has been commissioned to ensure that all those who stand in line at the Ukrainian and Russian border, drinking water, have the responsibility of President Sergey Dergunov.
There are now emergency emergency units in the dropout points.
Biotolls will also be established for the convenience of people.
According to the officer, the problem of order will be solved in the next few days.
According to the press service, 32 and 68 cars were suspended at the international crossing points of "Spanka" and "Novozazovsk" respectively, as at 31 October.
“FACTS” will monitor developments.
Vilnius suspects Moscow in an attempt to challenge the Lithuanian President
Russia intends to implement information provocations against high-level Lithuanians and Eastern Partnership countries - such a statement by the BNS agency has been made by the Republic Security Department (DGB).
Information on this is published on the DELFI portal.
According to the report, in particular, Moscow is going to “speak” of the Lithuanian President Dalu Grybauskait and publish falsified documents, allegedly found in the Russian Gosarchive, which relate to the facts from the biography of the Lithuanian leader.
According to the expertise, the Department of Public Management of the Russian President ' s Administration on Interregional and Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries is preparing an information attack.
The structure is headed by Evgenien Umerenkov, a visit to Lithuania and a participation in the Lithuanian People's Party.
Also involved in the operation is the staff member of Department B. Smirnov.
According to the Special Service, Smirnov, under the cover of scientific work by the end of 2012, regularly visited Lithuania and contacted local politicians, politicians and media representatives.
Smyrnov is now prohibited from entering the country.
The President of Lithuania, Grybauskait, had previously stated that he knew about the information he was preparing for it.
In her view, Lithuania's successful presidency in the Council of the European Union and “the country's ambition for energy independence” is the main reason.
The Lithuanian leader had previously not unanimously criticised the actions of the Russian authorities.
So she said that the Kremlin to Lithuania was "inadequately respectful".
In addition, Gribauskait accused the head of the RF Vladimir Putin of moving to Lithuania “only one requirement”.
Remember, in September, Rosuszor suspended the import of Lithuanian milk into Russia.
It was reported that the quality of the product did not comply with the health and epidemiological standards.
The leader of Lithuania then stated that if Russia did not take the ban, the Government would have to prepare a WTO call.
In the United States, the school principal shot adolescents.
The director of one of the U.S. secondary schools of youth has literally led to despair.
The man said he had to take the guns and start shooting.
An incident happened in Tennessee.
According to New York Post, minor hooligans left the house with a toilet paper.
As a result, the school director opened a shooting at adolescents, resulting in several injuries in the leg and arm of a 15-year-old boy.
Since the hooligans were not in the territory of the director ' s property, he was charged with assault under aggravating circumstances.
The man was released from prison in a bet at $125.000.
It is noted that shooting civilians in the United States is becoming a terrible rule.
A man literally opened a gun at the center of Ridgecrest in California, U.S.A., right across the street.
After that, the criminal took two random passersby hostages and hid them in the trunk of the car and tried to hide.
Earlier in Newtown's primary school, Connecticut was shot.
At school, Adam's mom worked, she was an educator.
Shooting in American school: wounded 14-year-old girl
A major shooting incident occurred at the American school on 31 January, this time in Anlante, Georgia.
Two people were injured: a 14-year-old student and a teacher.

Halloween 2013
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to have a confession, not to sleep late, but to set up a mask for our area.
Now I'm more like a cracker.
I haven't been asked in the last two years to place confetes in my apartment and I'm probably not going to stop this year.
However, statistics show that I am a white hero in Halloween.
According to the National Federation of Retail, the majority of Americans, namely 158 million, will celebrate Halloween this year and spend a total of $6.9 billion on confessions, costumes and decorations.
The only thing I'm waiting for every Halloween is trends.
The National Trade Federation predicts that the costumes will cost $1.2 billion from $6.9 billion.
This year, sexual harassment is on the verge of fashion.
Women are no longer obliged to represent sexual professions; they can also be sexual food, such as pizzas, burgers or carrots.
As for men, I think we're going to see a lot of zombies thanks to the Walking Dead, and I'm sure that the Daf Punk group-style cosmonauts will fall into our Instagram tapes this year.
According to Google, costumes that are most popular are zombies, Batman, pirates, and witches.
Please, there's nothing wrong with a traditional approach.
We ordered our dogs last year and, to my surprise, we were not the only ones.
Moreover, according to the National Federation of Retail, Americans will spend $330 million on domestic animal costumes this year.
That means a lot of funny dogs.
When it comes to confessions, we don't hesitate.
The Americans will spend $1.9 billion on them this year, according to Nielsen.
It's about 600 million pounds of Hershey chocolate, ice cream, Milk Duds Confectionery, Twizzlers Confectionery and Clark Bar Batons.
According to the U.S. Department of Trade, these are excellent news for 41 million children who are willing to submit to our districts.
Moreover, we will buy and — and not fool ourselves — eat 90 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.
The only thing we don't want to use is cookies in the form of corn grains; however, according to the National Association of Condiers, almost 35 million pounds are sold under Halloween.
It's about nine billion individual corn grains.
It's a mystery I still have to think about.
There's nothing like Halloween's essence. It's like a ghost house.
They have startling names, such as “Horse behind the walls” (which, by the way, are in this prison), “Way and scream” and “The House of Shock”.
In addition, according to American society, there are 1,200 officially recognized houses with viewers that generate about $500 million of income, as well as those amazing photos where you almost described that you put your friend on Facebook, and you can't get rid of it, and then that guy you like sees this photo and leaves a comment like "classic expression".
In conclusion, we'll talk about the guys.
Charlie Brown introduced us to Big Tikwa when we were kids, and cutting Jack's lamp is like decorating a Christmas tree, what we do from childhood.
Luckily for us, the fashion for the baby just started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up cutting off these guys instead of sitting in them.
According to the U.S. Population Census Bureau, this year the Americans will spend about $106 million per year.
Jack's lighthouse, slowly coming up on your wing, probably came from Illinois State, which raised 542 million pounds this year.
If you want to do more, visit Tim and Susan Mattisdon in Napa, California, and try to cut some of their weight by 2032 pounds.
Estonia's Mine Defense Site Rehabilitated After Ukrainian Hackers Attack
The site of the Ministry of Defence was restored after the early cyberattack, reports the department ' s press service.
According to the Deputy Chancellor of Mino Defence for Information and Administrative Affairs of Timer Petercop, it was a primitive attack, and the site was simply overloaded by a large number of requests.
Our experts quickly decided that by now the site had been restored.
"The damage done to the Ministry is minimal," Peterkop told Postimees.
According to Peterkop, as long as he spoke early about who organized the attacks.
"We will necessarily analyze the causes of the incident and make our conclusions, but it is impossible to prevent such incidents," he admitted.
On 1 November, the Anonymous Ukraine group launched a network that confirmed the hacker attack on the Estonian Minowan site and opposed the Ukraine and NATO partnerships.
We want the NATO leadership to hear our voice, the voice of the Ukrainian people.
We shouldn't be NATO servants.
Ukrainians do not want to die for the interests of NATO member countries.
Ukraine doesn't need NATO block.
Ukraine does not need the European Union.
Ukraine doesn't need Russia either.
Ukraine must not be a slave.
We are in favour of independent Ukraine.
"Hands away from Ukraine," says the Anonymous statement.
In the past, the Miniomborans of Ukraine reported that the mouth of the pechoto sea of the Feodosian separate Ukrainian pechoto sea battalion would participate in NATO's command post-level training of the forces' reaction force Steadfast Jazz-2013.
Several schools and hospitals had to be closed because of the violence
Four schools in the Zimbabwean province of South Matabeleland had to be closed because students were attacked... by goblins.
As the local elder said, the children panicked and continued their activities became impossible.
The story of goblins may sound like a child ' s invention for Europeans, but in Africa this is a very serious argument for closing school.
Adults are also afraid of unclean forces.
In the summer, for example, Zimbabwe had a hospital closed because the hospital was also attacked by goblins.
Release of the Land Rover series
Inside are slotted seats and six-point safety belts, as well as an internal communications system.
In addition, modernized brakes, a service package providing access to Bowler Works machines, logistical support and car storage between activities can be obtained.
Dr. Bowler, Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport, said: “The rallyers in Bowler have changed.”
Some of them are not experienced hunters, but people who seek excitement, adventure and access to world-class activities.
We are pleased to propose such a way in partnership with Land Rover and MSA, and we believe that this format offers a new way to try various disciplines of the UK and abroad, as well as to prepare participants to the difficult conditions and realities of the rally.
We were very pleased to design the Defender Challenge — a truly attractive championship.
In addition, Defender Challenge provides one day in February for training and testing, as well as an opportunity to participate in activities in the desert in North Africa and the Middle East.
Russian forces know nothing about the Bratsky Circle - New Reports
INTERFAX.RU writes about this with reference to an informed source in the law enforcement authorities of the FF.
“After media reports of the introduction by the US Ministry of Finance of Leps into the suspect checklists of the Eurasian Crime Union “Bratsky Circle”, we reviewed all databases but did not find such a grouping,” said the interviewer of the Agency.
In his view, the dissemination of this information contributed to the maintenance of a myth of the so-called Russian mafia, which was apparently operating abroad.
As previously reported, yesterday, the United States Ministry of Finance published on its website a list of alleged members of the Bratsky Crimes Unit.
Among them was the Russian singer Gregory Leps.
He's on the list as "Birth," they've put it before.
They match the data of a popular Russian executive.
The exact name is Grigory Lepsevride, creative pseudonym, place and date of birth.
In addition to Leps, there are five other people mentioned.
Two Russians, Israeli, Uzbek, and another member of the former USSR whose nationality is not indicated.
The United States is convinced that Gregory Leps, who lives on the island of Phuket, carried money for gangs on their orders.
A photograph of the singer has been attached to this communication and all its data are given that correspond to the validity.
Besides, Leps actually bought a house in Phucket recently.
The Bureau noted that they intended to impose sanctions on Leps.
The inclusion of a person in the American Minfin blacklists involves blocking his assets in the United States and prohibiting business contacts with persons living in the United States.
Assistant Lepsa Maya Serikov said there was no notice of the singer: “It is difficult to answer the question whether this is the Grigoria that everything is talking about now in connection with the US scandal.”
All Leps knows is media.
He had no personal information, although I did not know if they were in such cases.
"And, of course, that's all, on the one hand, funny, and on the other -- amazing and unexpected," she said.
According to her, Grigory Leps does not live in Phukette, but, according to the U.S. Minfin, he has a home on the Thai island.
She said that Leps was now on a long tour of the Far East and Siberia, and that news had left him during his flight to Blagoveschensk.
Escaped to the field in the Schinnik match
Some details about the identity of the fanatic who escaped the field during the 1/16th match of the Russian Cup between the Yaroslav "Skinnik" and the Moscow "Spartak".
As told by the head of the FRC, Arthur Grigorianz, referring to the MDD data, the patient is a mosquito.
He's under arrest right now.
"In addition to this, Grigorianz told us how the fanatic managed to break into the field: "It was found that this, called his viewer, had been quickly helped to accompany two viewers, referring to problems with the heart.
He came to the emergency room, and this was confirmed by the doctor.
Then he drove out two of his companions, and ran away to the field.
He fled from the corner of the East and South to the corner of the East and North.
He ran through all the fields.
That's what the studios are responsible for.
Prior to the entry into force of the Sports Act, this area of action of the Stuarts - the police cannot interfere with what is on the field.
He ran to the court, crossed through the Eastern court.
At that time, riots began in the Eastern Tribunal and on the escape routes," the head of the KDK said.
Recall that the decision by the KDK, the Moscow Spartacus, will bring the upcoming Russian 15th Tour of the Championship against Locomota and Zenita without spectators and will also pay a fine of 600 thousand rubles.
Fire squads were called to rescue the lost puppy, which stopped 50 feet above ground at a dangerous career.
Koker-Spanish Ruby ran away after she got into a small DTP
Three days later, a man who was stuck in his career noticed the dog
The firemen went down on a rope on a suspended slope to save the dog from imminent death
The dog was lucky to be rescued after the firefights were launched to lift him up and deliver him to a safe place, after he somehow stopped at a height of 50 feet at the dangerous exit of the hanging curtain.
The nine-month-old Koker-Spaniel Ruby escaped after her car crash on Sunday and spent three days alone before she was rescued from her career on Wednesday.
Her boss, 25-year-old Scott Alderson and his 20-year-old friend Becky Hall, were at the Fleppit career in Denholm, West Yorkshire, to join Ruby, and thanked the West Yorkshire Fire Rescue Service.
They searched for their missing dog and posted social networking sites after she had escaped from her career after a small accident.
About 14:15, in the middle of the night, a star dog observed Ruby standing at a height of 50 feet in a career.
The technical rescue team from the Klekhiton fire station rushed to the scene, went down on the ropes to save Ruby, and used the conveyor to lift her up onto the slope.
Rescue Officer Andy Clayton said she was in a dangerous situation.
It was right in the middle of the hanging curtain — 50 feet [50 m] to the top and to the ground.
She didn't move, and she didn't move a muscle while she was saving.
But now she's fine.
Then she'll eat some soup.
It was a very unusual challenge.
The fact that the dog was noticed is amazing.
Rescue Officer Peter Lau said, "Ruby's very lucky she was saved."
It was likely that she could have suffered a very serious injury or worse.
The rubies were taken to the veterinarian for inspection, and it was found to be all right with it, except for the evaporation and decommissioning.
Mrs. Hall of the Galifax, West Yorkshire, said, "Watching salvation was terrible."
I couldn't believe she was there at all.
It was amazing when she was back in our hands.
The veterinarian said that if she had lost consciousness, she would probably have fallen.
The fires were magnificent.
That was very courageous — what they did.
We are so grateful, and each one of them was absolutely amazing.
Mr. Alderson from Kitley added, "We were afraid she might fall, but she stayed there."
The fires were amazing.
I just can't believe she turned out there.
Mick Jagger says he didn't play with Katie Perry when she was 18.
During an interview with the Australian radio show this week, the pop star stated that she was a vocalist for Jagger's 2004 Old Habits Die Hard song.
Perry said she had dinner with a veteran rocker, and she said, "He was playing with me when I was 18 years old."
She said, “That was a long time, and he was very good.”
In a statement on Thursday, the representative of the 70-year-old Jagger said that he “categorically denies that he ever made a fortune for Katie Perry”.
He said, “It may be she will be misled by someone else.”
Perry was among the performers who appeared as guests at the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Her new album Prism won first place this week.
George Kerewan: break with Europe gives the Scottish choice
Another day, another terror of independence.
This time we are warned that the independent Scotland will have to join the pan-European area of free movement as a condition of EU membership.
There is a series of history of passport control in Bervik and the border with a line along Adrian's wave.
True, the Strathclyde newspaper pointed to the potential economic benefits of more free movement across the rest of Europe, although, as predicted, it did not appear in the headlines.
No one has also indicated that EU Member States are spending a lot of time reversing their formal rules as they are comfortable.
Since Scotland is not now part of the Schengen area, the continuation of non-compliance will be a cheap alternative for Brussels in return for what it really wanted from the Scottish people.
So it's not worth the story.
And so old that she turned into a rock: for the first time, I heard the “outbreak” that “independence means passport control” at least 40 years ago.
And yet there's an interesting moment lost in the old story.
Why should the independent Scotland at all comply with Europe's orders?
Why turn the London Yard into Brussels Yard, especially now?
This is European news: a great post-war plan to unite Europe has finally stopped.
With the Euro-crisis project "Europe" officially dead.
All over the European Union, the parties against the EU or for the abolition of the euro as a single currency are gaining force.
Even in Germany, the European Party of Alternatives for Germany, founded only this year, came out of nowhere and received nearly five million votes in the September federal elections, thus essentially pushing Free Democrats (along with our Liberal Democrats) from Bundestag.
There was always an internal opposition to the federal plan for Europe.
Nevertheless, the current economic crisis has become a turning point.
The harsh economies introduced by Berlin and the European Central Bank and the environment imposed on national economies by maintaining a single currency have led many people to believe that the Europe project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments working with excessive budget deficits, which was only fair for Greece.
In fact, the Eurosystem has blocked its members at exchange rates that benefit German exporters, which German policies and want to maintain.
Without the possibility of a devaluation of the national currency, southern Europe is in an unfavourable situation on production opportunities compared to Germany.
The only means of saving is to cut wages and public expenditures, which is actively supported by Berlin.
The current budget and currency problems are facing a deeper challenge to Europe's productive capacities.
As a result of the "green" energy package implemented by Brussels, the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times more for gas than for the US.
It's a paralyzing price disadvantage, as we've seen in Greenmouth.
No wage freeze in the world will stop the devastating defeat of US cheap solar gas over the European oil industry.
As a result, the rebellion, especially in France, is once the most angry side of the EU.
After the war, the French political elite viewed the EU as a way to control Germany and put Paris at one level with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a means of obtaining political legitimacy, and has already imposed its own economic policy on Europe by leaving France in a disastrous situation.
The result is a right against the EU Marin Le Pen National Front just won the decisive additional elections by dropping the ruling Socialist party to third place.
The Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 per cent votes — a timely warning to the British Labourers that there is no reason to assume that there is a right-wing gap automatically in favour of the left.
What does Le Pen do with his newly acquired popularity among the French white working class?
She wanted to use the EU elections next year to create a bloc in the European Parliament against the EU and against the single currency.
If - and this is very likely - the EU party will receive support in these elections, such a bloc will be able to take the dominant position in the European Parliament for the first time.
My opinion is that the rapidly growing attitudes against the EU and against the single currency in Europe are being undermined together to destroy the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will again become something like the floating “Europe (the sovereign) nations”, which liked General de Goll.
Germany and several economies that depend on it can save the euro, but France and southern Europe will restore their own currencies.
I assume that Britain is distanced from this project, hoping to get closer to the United States.
Nevertheless, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific indicates that Britain will remain unattainable in the cold of the Atlantic.
How does this leave Scotland?
We can choose to become a region (in fact) of England.
Or we can protect our own economic interests, which means, besides, sending Berlin and Brussels to hell.
I suspect that Scotland will be able to succeed within the framework of a more free European agreement, provided that we retain our currency.
Cooperation with other single countries will be easier in a non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider the possibility of repeating the experience of Norway and maintaining our economic independence.
The Government of the Scottish National Party in Scotland is, however, the most successful political movement in Europe, aimed at countering the harsh economic measures taken by the overwhelming majority of the votes in 2011 due to objections to the reduction of the costs proposed (and implemented) by the Liberian Chancellor of the Treasury by Alistair Darling and subsequently by the coalition of thoriums and liberals.
Scotland would now be reluctant to vote in favour of independence only in order to take action on the harsh economies imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early sexual congenitalization: early age
African American and Latin American girls usually reach sexual maturity earlier than their white peers show research.
Physical changes do not mean that sexual growth is close
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible.
Experts believe that the obesity epidemic may be one of the triggers of early sexual maturation
The tendency to early sexual maturity is not so expressed in boys
Former correspondent CNN Pat Etherage is a journalist who specializes in child health and family issues.
Should a mother be afraid if her daughter begins to develop the beginnings of milking iron and develops feces at 7 or 8 years of age?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, child endocrinologist Paul Kaplovitz explained that these early physical changes were fairly common among American girls and constitute a new norm.
“I spend a lot of time calming my parents — this usually doesn’t mean a quick onset of full sexual maturity,” Caplovitz said.
The obvious signs of development, such as growing breasts, skulls and muscle hairs and body smells, appear earlier in girls.
But there was only a slight shift in the age of menarche (first menstrual period) over the past four decades.
In the United States, the average age was 12.5 years and decreased from 12.75 in 1970.
“After the breast begins to develop, it takes at least two to three years before menarche,” said Caplovich, who is also the author of the book “Raining Sexual Confusion in Girls: How to Cope With this common problem”.
Time is the most accurate test of how sexual growth will progress.
A discussion is held on what constitutes the actual onset of sexual maturity, but it is considered “temporary” when breast enlargement is accompanied by a sharp increase of up to 8 years.
In most cases, the process will be delayed or halted — that the pediatrician can monitor closely.
More rapid progress could serve as a basis for an analysis by an endocrinologist to eliminate serious problems, such as swellings or cysts.
There are procedures to prevent early menstrual periods and to prevent another consequence: premature bone aging, which can eventually lead to slow growth and low growth in mature age.
The recommendations for medical or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child, the level of development, the rate of growth and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
She is careful with medication, but recognizes that “absorbing sexual activity can alleviate the behavioral problems and feelings of girls that they are different from those of infants”.
Another major problem is that parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have menstruation.
“They are concerned about the risk of pregnancy or even how they deal with hygiene,” Caplovitz said.
“It was a shock, ” recalls one woman who started menstruating at the age of 10.
Although there were signs and we were talking about menstruation, it wasn't emotionally ready.
She came home from school scared and upset that she was the first of her friends.
There are many advertising theories about the causes of early sexual mutilation.
However, there is no consistent evidence that hormones in milk or other foodstuffs, chemicals in the environment or sexual media are responsible.
Boys — like girls — have a predisposal.
The Captain argues that the prerequisite that has the greatest weight is an epidemic of obesity.
In 2001, he helped to conduct a study of girls between 6 and 9 years of age, which links the amount of fat in the body to the time of sexual growth.
Other data confirm this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In that country, African American and Latin American girls usually reach sexual maturity earlier than their white peers.
There are various explanations.
In the world, early sexual growth is likely to affect everything: from economic conditions and climate to genes.
A further mystery: While boys have hair on their face and on their jaws at a younger age, the tendency to complete early sexual convulsions is not as strong as that of girls.
Other doctors participating in the AAP conference confirmed the complexity of this topic.
The appearance of thin and thin hair is seen even in infants and children of childbearing age.
“We need to be careful about how we determine the true onset of sexual maturity,” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a child endocrinologist at the Gorieb Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not be restricted to receiving instructions from a pediatrician about how to talk to their child.
“It may mean earlier than expected,” Caplovitz explained.
If you remain calm, your child usually reacts well.
Girls who thrive early need to confirm that even when this is done before it is done, it is a normal part of life.
In China, American Boeing prepares for a trip
The observer flights under the Treaty of the Open Sky over the territory of Russia and the unplanned landing in China on Friday, 1 November, at 8:30 a.m., will leave the city's airspace.
The management of the airport allowed the ship to fly, and received the fuel money.
As reported at the airport, the plane will fly to Ulan Ude.
According to other data, he will be sent to the United States.
According to the report, a plane flying to Ulan Ude landed in the Zabaykali region due to a fog.
He was not released from Chita airport due to unpaid bills.
There are 30 people on board, including the crew, who spent two nights on the airport territory, reports ITAR-TASS.
As reported in the IDF, under the terms of the Treaty on Open Sky, people on board an aircraft are not entitled to leave outside the Chita airport, they can only pass border control at two Russian airports - in Cuba and in Ulan Ude.
An open-air treaty was signed in 1992, involving 34 States.
Observation flights take place over the territories of Russia, the United States, Canada, Europe.
The main objectives of the Treaty are the development of transparency, the promotion of monitoring of arms control agreements, the empowerment of crisis prevention and crisis resolution in the OSCE and other international organizations.
How much they earn in the late names of IC in the U.S.
The rating of living celebrities with the highest income in 2013 was led by Madonna, who earned $125 million.
But her late Michael Jackson, whose death income from October 2012 to October 2013 amounted to 160 million.
It is notable that others who have lost their fame who have “worked” several times less last year.
The second was Elvis Pressley, 55 million per year, and the next was the author of the Peanuts Charles Schultz comics, 37 million.
In addition, Elizabeth Taylor, a former leader (25 million) last year, and musician Bob Marley (18 million).
The list also included Marilyn Monroe, John Lennon and Albert Einstein.
In Moscow, Igorja Gulaeva's first match opened
On 23 October, the first flagship of Igori Gulyeva was opened in Moscow.
Designer Igorj Gulăev is famous for its magnificent luxury mecha products.
And now they'll be able to appreciate even more fashion fans -- in Moscow, finally, his first boutique was opened, about which the designer and set up a dolce vita-style party.
I'm sure the most beautiful girls in Russia live.
That's why I'm particularly glad I opened a store in Moscow.
It's not just an office, it's a place where there's really a part of me.
That's what Igori said. He cut off the red tape and invited all those who wanted to...
Manufacturers of reactive aircraft are hostile to the width of the seat when large orders are placed on the horse
Among the leading aircraft manufacturers, there was a heated dispute over the width of the travel class seats on the long-distance voyages, setting a tone for a severe confrontation at the Dubai Aviation Exhibition this month.
The gap is reflected in the width of the seats provided on non-major journeys by economic class passengers whose interests are not always at the centre of the attention of the airlines, while the amount of space allocated to them plays a key role in the claims of the effectiveness of the last aircraft offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
Airbus this week called for an industry standard that would have a width of at least 18 inches (46 cm) in the classrooms, but its major American competitor Boeing said it should be decided by the airlines.
There is a dispute when aircraft manufacturers compete in sales of larger versions of their two-engine non-major aircraft, and potentially record orders are expected for the events from 17 to 21 November.
The rear component of the aircraft — especially if 9 or 10 persons are in a row — is central to the declarations on the economic efficiency of new mini-aerobus projects.
Boeing claims that its updated 777X will replace 406 people based on seats in the economic class of more than 17 inches in width of 10 in each row.
Airbus said that the competing version of its A350 would carry 350 people in seats with a width of 18 inches 9 in a row.
Aeroplane giants are often replaced by technical punches through professional press advertising.
Now Airbus is addressing the public directly before the Dubai Air Force, where 777X is expected to become a leader with more than 100 orders.
She recently demonstrated what could be the start of a new advertising war, showing the financiers a slide depicting three people in a restaurant that is close to each other, entitled “Would you agree to that?”
“Boeing offers non-major flights on seats tighter than regional turbo-win aircraft,” said Airbus Director John Lihi.
With a change in diet, people take weights, but aircraft seats have not changed.
By the beginning of the 1970s, when Boeing 747 set standards for modern long-distance travel, and by the age of 40 to 49, the average American male weight had increased by 10 per cent, according to the United States Department of Health.
The size of the 21st-century average American male is 39.7 inches, according to the statistics of the United States Health Service.
Airbus claims that its competitor is in line with the concept of the 1950s seats, when the average coverage of the so-called “reactive audience” has already been.
Airbus said it had ordered a study that showed that an additional inch in the width of the seat would improve the quality of sleep by 53 per cent.
Boeing contests Airbus figures in sizes of seats and says that manufacturers are not required to interfere with decisions on how airlines balance tariffs and facilities.
According to her research, the comfort of the living room depends not only on the width of the seat.
“All in all, it is up to airlines to choose and do what they think they should do to achieve success,” said expert Boeing on Kent Craver.
They don't want us to decide for them what will bring them profit.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, there is an increase in the space on the side, but for suppliers this is becoming more and more a factor that may have an impact on profit.
The dispute is that aircraft orders estimated at at least $700 billion at catalogue prices in the coming decades are being run enough to change the ratio of American and European exports.
As the Reuters Agency first reported in July, the location of seats is what warms up competition in the fight between the latest reactive aircraft.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim a 20 per cent increase in profits per place in their latest two-engine remote-master models compared to market leader in this segment, the 365-local Boeing 777-300ER.
Boeing ' s stated characteristics are partly based on comparison of the 10-local 777X series with the original 9-local composition of the 777 series of constructive solutions.
Winning in a separate property is decreasing compared to the 10 local composition currently used.
“The reason Boeing does this is to press more places and make his plane more competitive than ours,” said Kevin Keniston, head of the Airbus Passenger Comfort Division in Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that salons with full 10 local lines for the existing 777s indicate that many passengers prefer a flat landing that can go hand in hand with lower tariffs.
“Sitting at a width of eighteen inches would be ideal for passengers, but the reality is that the Airbus proposal is a threat from the 777th model,” said Hall of Mary Kirby, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not provide chairs, but they offer a list of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
Reactive aircraft vendors travel around the world even carry roulettes to check competing plans.
In a comfortable manner, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with a very dense living room for budget airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers A350 with 10 local lines, but says she hasn't sold it yet.
Up to recently, Airbus stressed the need for further modifications of the salons, offering wider places for passage on some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern aircraft, experts say, its call for a new industry standard is unlikely to “flight” but may distract attention from the wave of sales of model 777X.
A new anti-incotin vaccine can eliminate the process of smoking pleasure
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotinic vaccine that could prevent smoking from satisfying.
One dose of the vaccine was able to protect the mouse from nicotine dependence for life.
Further tests are needed before testing is started, which will take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystall of the Well Cornell Medical College in New York said the first results were encouraging.
“We very much hope that such a strategy can finally help millions of smokers who have tried to quit by testing all the methods available on the market today, but have found their nicotine dependence to be strong enough to overcome it with these modern means,” said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been developed to provide genetic information for the production of antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the cells of the liver, which then begin to produce stable antibody flow.
The antibodies detect any nicotine molecules in the blood, neutralizing them before they reach the brain, preventing nicotine from getting a smoker.
In the tests, vaccinated mice, which were subsequently given nicotine, continued their normal activities.
The mice that were not given the vaccine were “depressed”, and this is a sign that nicotine came to their brains – the researchers say.
These experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
The previous tobacco vaccines were unsuccessful because they contained antibodies.
In order to maintain a high level of antibodies, the treatment had to be done so often that they were expensive and impractical.
But the value of the new vaccine is probably going to be much lower because it turns cells of fever into antibodies.
Professor Kristall said that if the future human vaccine was completely safe, it could be given to children before they would be tempted to smoke, preventing nicotine dependence.
But it's more likely to be used by smokers to quit smoking.
“They will know that if they start smoking again, they will not be satisfied with this because of nicotine vaccine, and this can help them get rid of this habit.”
British scientists said that the results were interesting, but warned that additional research was needed.
Oilseeds: Three-third of the rural settlements of Sub-Moscow
Vice-Governor of the Under-Moscow Yuri Olejnikov said that almost three thirds of the villages in the Moscow area were entirely supplementary
Total grants from the region's budget are received by 187 settlements from 288.
In 2013, 187 settlements from 288 received grants from the regional budget.
The individual grant weight in the income of 122 rural settlements exceeds 50 per cent and 83 per cent of the grant.
Some 25 billion rubles are sent from the regional budget," Olejnik said.
The Vice-Governor also noted that only three urban settlements -- Mitić, Odinzovo and Pušino -- had more than 1 billion dollars in 2013.
The income of rural settlements in many areas is less than 3 million rubles, “not enough”.
The cost of maintaining a local administrative unit in 88 settlements in Podmovsky is over 70 per cent, “with a reduction in the quality of services,” Olejnik noted.
Earlier, he had instructed the heads of municipal education in Sub-Moscow by the end of November to consider what settlements needed to be grouped, merged into urban districts or changed administrative administration.
These proposals will be drawn up by the end of January.
Prior to that, the Governor of the Moscow Region stated that the administrative reform in Sub-Moscow was planning to reduce the number of rural settlements.
In Mojaysk, Kashir, Solnečkirsk, Colomen, Lubertz and Kotelnik there is also a demand for a pooling of municipalities.
This issue will be discussed in the cities and regions of the region in November.
The President of Mosovda Igor Brennanalov also said that the forthcoming reform would bring together about 30 rural settlements in 12 areas of Podmovskia.
This is due to the fact that less than one third of the 178 rural settlements in Sub-Moscow have an "acceptable" financial base and 100 grants.
Diana Arbenina celebrated Halloween with her children
Diana Arbenina does not hide what great pleasure she gets from raising her children.
Although Arbenina now spends a great deal of time on creativity and public activities, she still finds the opportunity to travel with Martha and Artem, and not only spends time on their training, but also enjoys how she can.
In the last week, Diane was twice reported to her worshipers about her pedagogical talents.
First, she posted a photo on Facebook showing how she was teaching children to read.
And yesterday, she asked the fans, and I showed them how she ordered Artema and Martha to Halloween.
Our first Halloween is what Diana called a picture of her children dressed in holiday costumes.
Which is unwise, because they, like any other Russian boys and girls, are related to this holiday because they were born in America.
Germany introduces “undefined sex” in Europe when registering children
Germany will become the first country in Europe to be allowed to indicate “undetermined” in place of male or female gender when registering children born of hermaphrodite.
The parents of the child will have the right to leave the gender graph in the birth certificate.
Instead of “F” (female sex) or “M” (male sex) parents may write “X” (unspecified).
This decision is aimed at not encouraging parents to rush into a sex “exact” operation.
According to statistics, one of the 2,000 newborns in the world is born with a hermaphrodite.
Tripods deny that they are under the influence of Obedus
The former Minister of Labour of New South Wales Joe Tripody will be a figure in the investigation of the anti-corruption supervisory body of this state.
The former Minister of New South Wales Joe Tripody objected to the change in the rental order of marine facilities at the request of his political leader Eddie Obeida, secretly owned by the three properties on public land.
The Independent Commission against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its investigation on Friday whether Mr. Obeid had lobbyed several state ministers for extending the lease to Serküllar Ki, where the Obeid family owned two restaurants and cafes, without passing the tender after their expiry in August 2005.
She was now investigating allegations that Mr. Tripody knew the secret of Mr. Obeid ' s participation in real estate facilities, following the evidence given by the former Deputy Head of Administration, Mr. Tripody Linn Esspoul, on Thursday.
For several years of discussions that began in 2005, the Government insisted that the lease be offered to the public.
The tenants objected, as well as wanted longer terms for the rental.
In 2009, leases of companies to Serkular Ki, which brought the Obeid family about $2.5 million a year, were extended without an open competition.
Mr. Tripodi, Minister of Infrastructure and Transport from February 2006 to November 2009, was the first speaker of open competitions.
But he denied that the changes had been made at the request of Mr. Obeida, who, as Mr. Tripodi acknowledged, urged changes in the rental policy of the Government.
In August and September 2007, the IAC received a call for telephone conversations between Mr. Obeid, Mr. Tripodi and Mr. Steve Dan, senior officer who came to the Ministry of Ports after Mr. Obeid's work under the leadership of the Fisheries Division.
“Was the question discussed during these telephone conversations about the development of commercial lease policies?” asked Assistant Commissioner Anthony Willie, Mr. Tripodi.
"No," said Mr. Tripody.
I can't remember what was discussed, but it certainly wasn't.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obed.
According to the high-ranking officer, Israeli warplanes are attacking targets within Syria
The senior official of the Administration at Fox News interviewed confirmed that Israeli warplanes were hit for the purpose in the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday evening.
The officer didn't make it clear that it was a goal, but he said at least one.
The Associated Press reported that the aim was to launch the Russian production SA-125.
At least two times earlier this year, Israel was carrying aircraft on cargo with rockets inside Syria.
Foreign work on the visas of Class 457 may be tested for “extension”
The “deepness” test for foreign workers on Class 457 visas is under consideration by the Government, as it intends to increase repressive measures.
This test, if adopted, will be applied according to the criteria to prevent the use of Class 457 visas to fill unqualified posts or as a lasagna to move family and friends to Australia.
The paper submitted by the Government for discussion was published today, while ex-Leborist MP Maxine McKay criticized the Government ' s rhetoric about foreign workers, said it could offend the neighbours of Australia.
“The enormous “foreigners – at the end of the day” and “at first the work of Australians” are a very unpleasant reaction to the times when trade unions demanded a protected labour market,” she told the Institute of Australia — India today.
Historically, it meant that white labour had to be protected — and if some in the region had seen the echoes of this historical artifact, I would not be surprised.
The paper before the debate contains 12 measures that have previously been considered by the former Minister of Immigration Chris Bowen.
The Minister of Immigration Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he met with officials on human trafficking, has already made five of the recommended changes and the others are in the process of consideration.
If the “frequentity” criteria are adopted, the applicant for a visa may be examined as to whether “a true candidate is a relative or a close friend of the owner or person concerned with the financing of the enterprise”.
Enterprises may also be required to report on the number of holders of visas under heading 457, since prior enterprises intended to sponsor a small number of workers then had a hundred employees.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker died allegedly from a heart attack after arriving on a boat with refugees on Christmas Island this week.
The nine - year - old son of the wounded man accompanied him on his way to Australia, and since his father died in the middle of the night, he has been supported by a twin brother who was also on board the ship.
The Australian authorities quickly sent a man to the hospital on the island of Christmas, where he died.
Comrade Semen Varlamova stated that hockeyist suffers from alcoholism
His friend, Semen Varlamov Evgenija Vavrinuk, said that he was suffering from alcoholism, handed over by the Russian News Service.
“He has no idea how to stop drinking”, said, inter alia, a woman.
Recall that Vavrinyuk has been tried for the defeat of the gallciper of Russian assembly of Semen Varlamov, also a member of the Colorado Club.
According to her, the hockeyist ripped her off by the hair, and beat her--after the attack she had injured her hands, chest, life and neck.
Varlamov himself came from Denver police and confessed to the beating, detailing what had happened.
He was arrested, but later released at $5,000.
The court did not restrict athletes in movements throughout the country, but prohibited them from approaching Vavrinyuk.
He was also threatened with imprisonment for up to 6 years for domestic violence.
The UK Government announced a study aimed at increasing the economic impact for Scotland on the HS2 railway project.
The HS2 project envisages the opening of high-speed communications with Scotland and Northern England, with the beginning of the First Stage in 2026
Minister of Transport Baroness Kramer noted that the project “United Kingdom”.
The Minister of Transport of Scotland, Keith Brown, said that he was “in a hurry” from the perspective of work on the plan with the British Government.
The first phase will be to build a new high-speed railway between London and West Midlands.
When the Second Stage is completed, the lines will be extended to Manchester and Lids.
In June, the Government revised the estimated cost of building a high-speed line between London and the north of England from £32.7 to £42.6 billion.
The UK Government, which is negotiating with Transport Scotland, has entrusted HS2 Ltd with further improvements in the capacity of the railway and reduced travel time for North England and Scotland.
This should include the possibility of crossing the road from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London in three hours or less.
Baronessa Kramer said: “Our objective of HS2 is to create an existing national network that will make Britain and its city closer to each other.”
We're developing HS2 because the benefits it brings are huge.
Without it, we will face a crisis of ability on our rail network.
But it is also about urban transport; 18 cities throughout Britain, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, will receive better communication thanks to HS2.
Scottish Secretary-General Alistair Car Michael added: “Today’s announcement is good news for Scotland”.
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Kit Brown called on Mr. Car Michael to “consonantly” to support the inclusion of Scotland in the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: “The high-speed railway has every chance of bringing enormous economic benefits to Scotland, but also adds Scotland’s economic weight to the overall argument for the high-speed railway across the United Kingdom”.
We are therefore pleased to work in partnership with the British Government to consider options for building high-speed railways in Scotland, to create benefits for all and to continue the railway line of Glasgow, Edinburgh, which the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to examining the results of the study with the British ministers next year and to taking joint action on the following steps.
Tory is a new hope for nuclear energy?
Governments throughout the world continue to think about how to provide energy needs.
The burning of hydrocarbons (where they are found) has a negative effect on the climate.
Renewable energy sources require large areas for generation.
Atomic energy takes place without anything else, but leaves behind a lot of waste.
Scientists have recently drawn attention to the tornado, another radioactive element of the Mendeliev system.
He is meeting around the world and, according to experts, he does not leave waste that has to be stored for centuries.
Rules for the use of electronic devices on aircraft in Australia as long as they remain in force
Australian airline passengers will need to continue to exclude their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing, despite US mitigation measures relating to the devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has allowed American carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read electronic books, watch video or play games on their devices during take-off and landing, provided they remain in the Flight regime.
Passengers can already do this during the main part of the flight, but many are upset that they do not have access to their electronic books during the flight and landing.
Australian carriers are considering this decision, which requires American airlines to carry out a huge amount of work to meet new requirements, but have indicated that they do not plan to change their procedures in the near future.
The Civil Aviation Safety Office also noted that they were considering this statement, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical phases are still in operation in Australia.
“The safety management of civil aviation flights currently does not have special rules governing the use of electronic devices in aircraft,” he said.
The issue is governed by rules that require air carriers to maintain safety at any time and passengers to comply with the safety rules that members of the crew report.
Virgin, who had already discussed with the Civil Aviation Safety Office the expansion of use on board her entertaining system with Wi-Fi, was not against change, but stated that it would follow the direction of the regulator.
“We would welcome the review by the Civil Aviation Safety Office of the issue of allowing electronic devices to be used, because we really think it will improve the quality of customer service now that it is on our aircraft,” the press secretary said.
Qantas stated that the current rules would be adhered to.
“Our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing, and we are not planning to change them soon,” she said.
The FAA regulation applies to American airlines.
Nevertheless, we are always interested in regulatory changes that could benefit passengers, and we will certainly carefully examine the decision of the FAU and the reasons for it.
For U.S. carriers, the impact of the decision will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Vehicles will have to prove that their aeroplanes have radio interference resistance from mobile devices, as well as to review manuals, training materials, traffic regulations and passenger instructions.
“After checking and confirming the flexibility of its fleet, the airline may allow passengers to use portable, lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, electronic books and smartphones at any height,” said FAU.
In rare cases, the crew will give guidance to passengers to disable their devices during landing.
In addition, according to the group's recommendation, heavier devices should be located under the seats or in the upper luggage compartments during take-off and landing.
The head of Dagestana is heard in the Cuban gym notes of extremism
A football match between Anji and Cuba emerged into a political conflict between the Krasnodar authorities and Dagestan after the sufferers set the flag on fire, and the Cuban Gymnnasium sounded different.
The head of Dagestan Ramazan Abdulatipov invited Republican parliamentarians to go to court on Thursday, because the Krasnodar High School is allegedly calling for international differences, in particular for the war with the "Basurmans".
Take the Krasnodar High School, which has been approved in 1995.
It's a disgrace, and no one's doing it.
"Remembering here, as the mother of your family, as the enemy, we are going to the Basurmanina for a death battle," said Abdullah President of the Hizri Shissaid Parliament, "for which such words are to be recorded in the gymnasium, to persuade some believers to believe in others."
Putin obtained impunity for his friend Assad
And now, news from the ocean, namely, Syria, where, as we know today, Israel has hit Russian production missiles, which are reportedly intended for Hezbollah.
Today, Syria has fulfilled an important requirement to destroy its chemical weapons production by 1 November.
This was done within the framework of an agreement reached through Russia and allowing the United States not to carry out the military operation they had undertaken this summer.
More detailed about weapons and what all this means to the Syrian President, our chief international correspondent, Richard Angel, will tell us.
Washington said the Assad regime would be punished for this.
More than 1,400 peacekeepers, including hundreds of children, died of poisonous gas in August.
And the punishment came.
But not in the form of American bombings, but in the form of a deal set up by a friend of Asada Vladimir Putin.
Syria will give up its chemical weapons by the middle of next year.
And today is an important wave.
The Group of International Experts reported that Syria had removed declared factories for the production of chemical weapons.
The longer and more difficult task is to destroy tons of chemical weapons and its components.
As we understand, it's about a thousand tons.
Previously, Washington said the days of Assad were considered.
I think Assad has to leave.
The question is not whether it will happen, but when it will happen.
He's no longer a legitimist, and he has to leave.
But Assad remains.
And he feels even more confident.
Its troops continue to use artillery, rockets and firearms.
Its opponents are disbanded and badly armed.
His people are forced to leave their homes, and many are starving.
Some have to feed with leaves and baskets.
Many believe that Bashar Assad escaped punishment for mass murder.
The Chemical Weapons Agreement was called a success of diplomacy, the Inspectors were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and Assad himself gave the impression of a man willing to cooperate.
Today in Washington, U.S.A., the Syrian ambassador had to answer some difficult questions.
When a child is starving, his mother may not be much easier than not being killed by chemical weapons.
Assad will hold.
And it turns weapons into power.
President of the FF established a separate Ministry of Construction and the GCC
President Vladimir Putin of Russia set up a new ministry, which was responsible for the construction and construction of the GCC, and invited his ex-Governor of the Ivanov region of Mikhail Menu in the process of a private meeting.
The President met with Michael Mein in his residence in Novo-Ogarevo, and I did not refuse to head the new department.
The Russian President's Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov explained that all construction and CCH functions are moving to the new Ministry from Min Region.
Michael Menn, son of the famous Orthodox priest Alexander Mena, finished the Moscow Institute of Petroleum in the name of Gubkin.
Since 1995, his political career has begun - he has been elected to Moscow's District Duma from the Sergio-Posada region, a Member of the State Duma, the first Deputy Prime Minister of the Government of the Moscow Region, and the Deputy Prime Minister of the Government of Moscow.
From 2005 to 16 October 2013, Michael Menn was governor of Ivanov.
The Lombards in Singapore are doing well, while the middle class is experiencing difficulties
In a lobby at the Bendemir shopping centre in Singapore, Janani Amirthhaling is setting up a gold bracelet, ring and series to pay for his daughter's schooling.
"My husband and I just bought a house, so all my money is put in there," says Mrs. Amirthaling.
Although she earns S$3000 (2400) a month as an administrator and her husband also works, the monthly income of the family is not enough, she says.
Indeed, demand in various parts of South-East Asia — where household debt is growing — such that ValueMax, where it carries out its business, became the third Lambard registered at the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
It is not just a quick way to get money (S$1300 in the case of Ms. Amirthaling), but almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
Normally, Lombards in Singapore estimate an effective annual percentage rate of 17 per cent — over 15.4% proposed by the United Overseas Bank, a local creditor with a branch at the same mall.
Lambards, however, have the advantage that they do not require credit check or proof of pay and can issue credits faster than banks.
Therefore, millions of people across the region are being lobbyed because families are under pressure because of increased living costs and a rapid increase in household and consumer debt.
After five years of sustainable growth followed by the global financial crisis, and cheap loans that supported free monetary policy in developed economies, low- and medium-income families turned to the lobby to compensate for the decline in income as their economies slowed down.
This week, Standard & Poor's, a rating agency, indicated an increase in the family credit shoulder, mainly due to the increase in the mortgage, as a risk factor for the credit capacity of Asian banks.
It stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest ratio of household debt to gross domestic product in Asia.
Malaysia led this list with 80 per cent of GDP compared to 60 per cent in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which has barely left a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed a steady decrease in exports and a weakening of consumer demand.
“It is true that with rising prices, people in the middle and lower [income scales] will be looking for ways to fill their income wherever they can,” says Song Seng Won, CIMB economist, Malaysian bank.
The record of high prices for gold in the last two years has strengthened the urgency of people’s personal pursuits because they use the opportunity to obtain money for their family decorations.
In Singapore, about 70 per cent of the items placed in 200 Lombardy city halls are gold products.
People say, "The price for gold is good. Let's put on a golden string of grandmothers and get it back next month."
In Thailand, the largest Lombard operator, EasyMoney, has seen an increase of up to 20 per cent in the number of clients using its office in recent months.
Growth in a numbered business such as ValueMax, an office operator in Bendemire and 15 others in Singapore, is planning to expand not only in neighboring Malaysia, where it has four shops, but also outside Asia, says Yeah Li Ching, Executive Director of ValueMax.
The company will finance an increase of 60 per cent of the S$66 million involved this week as a result of the placement of shares on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some creditors were criticizing the fire for high interest rates, Mrs. Yeah said that Lambard not only offered cheaper tariffs than other creditors, it also did not increase the debt directly.
“Customers place items that they already own, and the montization of personal assets does not increase household debt,” she says.
The Foundation has gained increasing public recognition as a means of obtaining short-term, secure funding.
And this is not only the category of people who are in a difficult financial situation.
The rich people in Singapore also use the ValueMax offices by placing gold paintings or Rolex hours, which can give up to 60 per cent of their purchase value in cash.
We see customers from all levels of society.
“They include state-owned persons who need to make short-term use of money for commercial projects or investments, or small businesses that need to overcome temporary cash difficulties,” says Ms. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
The number and status of existing medical institutions are not important for the population today, but the quality of medical care provided.
The implementation of the Tula Health Modernization 2011-2013 programme, the reorganization of hospitals in our city will create an optimal health care structure for the population, including gynecological patients, pregnant women and the unborn.
Thus, after connecting with the cervical unit, there was still a great opportunity to attract close GHCB specialists from the GHCG to consult patients with various pathologies, to conduct additional hospital-based surveys.
During the implementation of the modernization programme, the logistics base of the home had been significantly improved, and modern equipment had been available to meet world standards.
In those years around 8 million rubles were allocated to the capital repairs of the premises, and 112 units of equipment were purchased for 42 million rubles.
The most modern equipment is an intensive post for newborns.
In the case of the cesarean cutting process, the Shell Saver machine is used to collect blood from the operating wound and to return it to its mother-in-law after special treatment, avoiding the transfusion of foreign blood.
Modern equipment is also equipped with a laboratory diagnostic office.
The women ' s consultation is conducted by an electronic registry, e-cards and patient history are planned in the near future.
As a result of the development of telemedicine, consultation was made with gynecological patients, pregnant women, infants and newborns with regional specialists.
Chechens beat and robbed 60 prostitutes in Strasbourg
Cechny's natives were arrested by the French police for suspected serious attacks on prostitutes.
The investigation has been carried out since March of the current year.
Approximately 60 women complained about the caucuses.
It is reported that the gangs ordered a prostitute in one of the Strasbourg hotels, and then they were beaten and robbed.
The gang leader was the 27-year-old Chechnya.
Bavarian Protector David Alba became Austria's best athlete in 2013, reports the official Bundesligi website.
In this dispute, he overcame the winter sports that are traditionally becoming the best in the country.
The second place was taken by the miner Marcel Hirschier, and the third was pulled on his shoulders with Gregor Schlerenzauer's tramp.
In the past season, 21-year-old Austrian Filipino-Nigerian champions helped their team win the League of Champions, Championships and Cup of Germany, as well as the UEFA Supercube.
Former wife of Archavin is resting with actor Andrey Chadov
The former civilian wife of Peter's "Zenita" Andrey Arshavin Julia Baranovski is on vacation with actor Andrey Chadov.
Julia is resting in Italy in the company of actress Anastasia Zarajni, her wife - figure Sergei Slavova and actor Andrei Chadova.
Photographs from a pair of joints are published in Instagram Anastasia Zarajni.
It's not Andrew and Julia's first joint photo.
On 5 October, Zarajni published a photo of the couple on the shore of the Finnish Gulf in Comarovo.
In mid-October, the Zenita Hubbek Andrei Arshavin admitted that he lived apart from his civilian wife, Julia.
To be sure, Julia Baranovski and Andrei Arshavin have been together since 2003, with three children.
It has recently been known that Archavin meets with the ex-model Alice Kazmin.
The new friend of Archavius was married to the top manager of the corporation.
Rescue package of $325 million for Tasmanian health
The Federal Government insists that the $325 million rescue package for Tasmania ' s weakened health system will be complemented by harsh conditions that guarantee that the State Government will not spend its resources in vain.
The Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth was taking “term measures” to prevent the crisis caused by the ageing of the island ' s population, the higher levels of chronic diseases and the constraints of the system.
A four-year funding decision was taken after the Government had consulted with the independent Member of Tasmania, Andrew Wilca.
“The Government has proposed a package of emergency rescue measures that we believe will solve the specific problems facing the state,” said Mrs. Plibersec today.
The $325 million package includes $31 million per target campaign for planned operations.
Another 2600 operations, including orthopedic and cataract removal operations, will help to overcome the delay.
There is also money for clinics that receive patients without prior registration, in Hobart and Loncéston, to improve the quality of after-station care, to train medical professionals, mental health services, and to implement personal electronic health card systems in local hospitals.
“These investments will be carried out by the excellent doctors on how best to help the Tasmanian health system,” said Ms. Plibersec.
The Minister insisted that the Government of Tasmania would work under strict accountability and responsibility.
The State would need to maintain current levels of funding to obtain the Commonwealth ' s money and to report monthly where it would spend those additional funds.
A three-person commission will be established to ensure that the staff provide services as effectively and as effectively as possible.
Mr. Wilky said today that $325 million would not be decided unless they were followed by a genuine reform that would put the Tasmanian health system on a more sustainable footing.
Nevertheless, he commended the Government for responding to his request for urgent assistance, with which he first addressed the Prime Minister in early May.
“I hope that the federal assistance package will significantly contribute to the conclusion of this state’s health system from a critical point of view,” Mr. Wilky said.
According to the State Government, these additional sampling procedures are largely offset by recent reductions.
But the federal opposition health representative, Peter Datton, believes that today’s statement is “a decision similar to that of the Laekoplaster”.
“The reason we are here is that the Lao Government has cut $430 million from the health system,” he told the ABC TV tele company.
When the State Government spends almost half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth invests 300 million, it cannot be assumed that this is good news.
Mr. Datton asked Ms. Plibersec to ensure that no dollar from the rescue package would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
The screenplay by Giom Nickle of the novel Danny Didro may boast an exceptional setting and historical details, but it is also more difficult than it should have been.
The film, which took place in France in the 1760s, tells the dark story of Susanna, a young aristocrat sent to her family monastery.
When she begins to rebel, she experiences extreme cruelty from the hands of the sadisticist and becomes an object of erotic fantasies for others.
The film never goes down until it's gone or felt — and that's the whole problem.
Because of its serious Christmas, the practice is likely to be a test for the type of inflamed and for the audience.
Syria destroyed its chemical weapons production facilities, the observer group said
Syria destroyed major equipment for the production of chemical weapons and gaseous ammunition, said the international monitoring group on Thursday, while severe collisions were being made in the north of the country, near one of the sites where toxic substances are thought to be stored.
Also on Thursday, the Syrian group of activists stated that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the beginning of the civil war in the country almost three years ago.
A statement by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons was made within one day before
the deadline of 1 November, established by the Hague-based organization for Damascus to destroy or “do away with” all chemical weapons and mechanisms to mix and fill chemicals with toxic gas.
The completion of what is essentially the beginning stage of destruction is an important milestone in the ambitious timetable that aims to destroy all chemical weapons in Damascus by mid-2014.
The destruction of equipment means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
Nevertheless, the destruction of existing weapons and stocks is still to begin in Damascus.
The country is estimated to have about 1,000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons, including gallant gas and nerve-paralytic gas.
This statement was made during the vicious wars in the city of Sapphira on Thursday, where, in the opinion of the experts, the chemical weapons production facility and its storage site are reported by the Syrian Centre for the Protection of Human Rights, based in Britain.
A group of activists who were tracking losses through the network of activists in Syria said on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Of these, 61,067 are civilians, including 6365 children, as reported.
On behalf of the Government, the group stated that 29,954 were members of the armed forces of President Bashar Assad, 18 678 were pro-governmental fighters and 187 were Lebanese fighters of Hezbollah.
Also among the victims, as stated in the statement, were 2202 military refugees and about 5375 opposition fighters, many of whom were foreigners.
According to the UN estimate of 25 July, 100,000 deaths in the conflict since March 2011.
Since then, this number has not been updated.
The conflict forced about 2 million people to flee the country.
Assad's troops fought in Sapphira several weeks with the rebels, many of whom were associated with Al-Qaida groups.
The Centre stated that there were victims on both sides on Thursday, but did not provide any specific data.
The battles highlighted the danger faced by chemical weapons inspectors, who were being pursued during the short term of their mission to release Syria from the toxic arsenal, in the midst of the ongoing civil war.
The OPCW statement, which works in close cooperation with the United Nations, said that its team was “now satisfied that it had checked and seen destroyed all the critical production and equipment for mixing/processing claimed by Syria”.
She added that “no additional inspection activities are currently planned”.
Earlier this week, the inspectors stated that they had completed the first round of verification work, visiting 21 of the 23 sites claimed by Damascus.
They were unable to visit two security sites, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, OPCW stated that both sites were, according to Syria's statement, “forgotten and... items of the chemical weapons programme contained in them were moved to other claimed sites that had been verified”.
It was not possible to determine immediately whether the site in Safira was one of the two places where OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, to be approved by the OPCW Executive Committee next month.
“I welcome the courage and courage that you have all demonstrated in carrying out the most complex mission ever undertaken by this organization,” said the Director General of the Ahmet Uzumju Monitoring Group, in a comment published by the OPCW.
For the third year, civil war has been facing the rebels, mainly Muslim Sunni, with the Government of Assad and its security forces, which are members of its Alawites sect, responding to Shiite Islam.
With regard to other events, the leader of Rami Abdurrahman said that there was a strong explosion in the environment at the PWO facility in the coastal province of Syria of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion is unknown, he said.
I'm angry about the condemnation of the bulldozers in Bali.
The remaining 202 survivors and relatives of the bombing of the bomb in Bali in 2002 reacted furiously to the sentence given to the last of the defendants who appeared before the court and stated that Umar Patek should be shot.
The Patek, who spent almost 10 years running as one of the most wanted people in South-East Asia, was sentenced to 20 years ' imprisonment for his role in the creation of explosive devices used during the attack.
He may be released for 15 years if he is granted a conditional release.
The 45-year-old defendant was found guilty of mass killings as a result of an attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, during which 202 people, including 88 Australians, were killed and tens were injured.
He was also found guilty of a number of other terrorist charges, including the explosions of churches throughout Indonesia in the canon of Christmas in 2000.
The prosecutors required a life-time, although they could insist that a person who was known as a “drumper” for his reputation as an explosive device manufacturer should be sentenced to death.
This decision exacerbated the painful memories of the mother of Pert June Cortin, who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in the attack by Patek and his associates almost ten years ago.
She could hardly hold back her tears and said that Patek had to be sentenced to death.
“I really believe that he should follow the steps of other men.
He must appear before the firing squad," said Ms. Cortin AAP.
“I have to live every day, knowing that I will have no grandchildren anymore, and I will not see my daughters.”
The Sarai Club was destroyed when a massive explosive device was put into service outside the van immediately after 11 evening on 12 October 2002.
Peter Hughes was at the Paddy Bar, where the death bomber blew up a rifle that was launched by an explosion just 20 seconds earlier.
After that, he fell into a coma for a month and “dead” three times, being connected to the life insurance system.
Mr. Hughes said that Patek should share three other members of the Jemaa Islamia terrorist cell, responsible for the bloody battle, including Amrose, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra, who were punished four years ago.
Indeed, this guy deserves the death penalty most of all.
Keep him alive, well, there's no reason to keep him alive.
Getting 20 years after killing 202 people and wounding hundreds is not so much.
The patch is the last of the parties to the attack in Bali brought before the court.
He hid for almost ten years, but was finally detained in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where US troops killed the former head of Al-Qaeda, Usama Ben Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, the FBI agent showed that the intelligence data showed that Patek had been in Pakistan to meet Ben Laden in an attempt to restore relations between terrorist groups in South-East Asia and Al-Qaida.
"He didn't give up," said Mrs. Cortin.
Until recently, he has not regretted how sorry he has been for others.
Sentenced in advance of the 10th anniversary of the attack, which will be observed later this year in Bali and Australia.
“There will be a lot of tears this year,” says Ms. Cortin.
The Patek can still appeal his sentence.
FAU: "Air passengers can now use boys on aircraft (but don't call from a mobile phone)"
Air passengers will be able to use their electronic devices throughout the flight to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music, but not speak on mobile phones, according to the long-term new guidelines published by the Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday.
But passengers should not expect changes to take place immediately.
As quickly as this change takes place, it will vary depending on the airline, said FAU Administrator Michael Warta at the press conference.
The airlines will need to show FAA how their aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they update their flight crew training manuals and device layout rules to comply with the new guidelines.
FAU stated that it had already received plans from some airlines to increase the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue were among the airlines that had already presented the plans.
“ Depending on the state of the plan, we could approve an increase in the use of electronic devices very soon,” said FAU.
Passengers are currently obliged to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft door is closed.
They should not be re-launched until the plane reaches 10,000 feet and the captain will not be “good”.
Passengers must switch off their devices again when the aeroplane is lowered to land and not include them until the aircraft is on the ground.
In accordance with the new guidelines, aircraft whose aircraft are adequately protected from electronic interference may allow passengers to use these devices during take-off, landing and rolling, FAU stated.
Most new aircraft and other aircraft modified to allow passengers to use Wi-Fi at high altitudes are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Shipowners, welcomed these changes.
“After the new policy has been successfully implemented (and we are going to work in close contact with the carrier to achieve this), it will be an unforgivable option,” Glading said.
We have made it clear that we are “in school” when it comes to this issue.
However, the Agency reported that the connection to the Internet for Serfing, Exchange of e-mails, text messages or uploading of data would still be prohibited at a height of less than 10,000 feet.
Passengers will be invited to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices into aircraft mode.
Thus, there is still no “Words with Friends” — an intellectual online game in which actor Alek Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011, when the case was the case: the actor was taken off the American Airlines aircraft for refusing to turn off the device at the time the aircraft was on landing.
And more heavy devices, such as laptops, will still have to be put in the trunk since they can hurt someone if they fly all over the living room.
Phone calls in the flight will also continue to be banned.
The regulatory authority on telephone calls is owned by the Federal Communications Commission, not by FAU.
FAU may remove the ban on some electronic devices during take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transport Safety Board, the National Transport Safety Expert CBS News, said that hundreds of phones were still at risk.
“The telephones are really a problem, not only because they can potentially create interference with navigational devices, but we know because of the FCS that they can create interference with the above communication when the aircraft is in the air,” Rosenker said.
The Industrial Advisory Committee, established by FAO to study this issue, recommended last month that the Government allow more use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, pressure on FAU has increased in order to weaken restrictions on their use.
Critics, such as Senator-Democrat from the state of Missuri Claire McCasquill, claim that there are no major security-related reasons for bans.
Compliance with restrictions is also becoming increasingly difficult, as the use of devices has become widespread.
Some studies show that up to a third of the passengers forget or ignore instructions to disable their devices.
FAU began to restrict the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1966 in response to communications about interferences for navigation and communication equipment when passengers began to carry FM radio receivers, high-tech girls at the time.
New aircraft are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by FAU as electronic interference.
The airlines have offered passengers the use of Wi-Fi at cruise height for several years.
Airplanes modified for the Wi-Fi system are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of lines have been adapted to improve the use of electronic devices in accordance with the new guidelines, Warta said.
Today ' s electronic devices usually emit radio signals much lower than previous generations of devices.
Electronic book reading devices, for example, remove only minimal signals when listing pages.
But signals become more powerful when devices load or send data.
Among those who sought to mitigate restrictions on the use of electronic devices were Amazon.com.
In 2011, the company's representatives loaded a whole airline with their devices for reading Kindle's electronic books and flew on it to check for problems, but did not find them.
The members of the Advisory Committee of the FAO expressed mixed feelings as to whether the use of devices posed a risk.
Douglas Kidd, of the National Air Passenger Association, said that he considered the mixes of devices to be real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other committee members said that there were only individual pilot communications confirming that devices could create gaps for aviation systems, and most of them were very old.
Nevertheless, the Committee recommended that FAA allow pilots to require passengers to switch off devices during landings on devices under limited visibility.
The group of representatives of the tourism industry welcomed these changes, calling them a healthy step forward for passengers who are now using many technological devices.
“We are pleased that FAU recognizes that the comfort of passengers is not incompatible with security and protection,” said Roger Dow, Director General of the U.S. Tourism Association.
Car schools will be able to conduct examinations for driving rights
Exams on driving rights will be able to accept private companies that own their own computerized car.
This is what the Commissioner writes about with reference to the draft Government's decision on the authorisation of vehicles.
According to the newspaper, there are currently about 30 such cars in Russia.
Students of such "privileged" cars are expected to count the results of the internal test.
In doing so, the Gosavto inspection will monitor the submission of examinations every six months.
If it becomes clear that more than 30 per cent of the theoretical exams and more than 20 per cent of the student's area are not given away for the first time, such a school will be deprived of privileges for half a year.
The technical requirements for motorways contained in the draft Government decision enter into force as of 5 November 2014.
The project also contains requirements for the management of two-wheel technology.
From 1 January 2015, the owners of motorcycles for category A rights will have to pass a city-wide examination.
Moreover, as of 5 May 2014, companies will not be able to hire foreign-right drivers.
Such workers would have to receive Russian rights after the examination.
A bird transported by air to a safe place from a stormy plant in the North Sea is released back into a wild environment
After being found in an exhausted state on an oily high in the North Sea, the bird was released back into the wild.
This waterthirsty was placed in a helicopter headed to Aberdin last month and was then taken out by the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Animal Abuse (SPCA) at the rescue centre in Alloa.
The manager of the Colin Seddon Centre said: “This waterthirsty shepherd is probably the winter migrant from Northern Europe who fell into a strong wind zone over the North Sea”.
It seems that the bird has been suspended and has been able to find refuge on the oil floor.
He said, “She was unable to fly again, so she came back to us with help.”
The watertight shepherd was healthy and in good condition until he was released.
Is the elite of Europe ready to do business with England?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with an obligation to gather business representatives and determine what changes British welfare and jobs designers want to see in relation to the EU.
To this end, we have ordered the largest and most complete survey of British business leaders, asking them to express their thoughts about Britain, business and the EU.
YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 business leaders who represented a wide range of business across the UK in sizes, sectors and regions.
The findings of the survey will prove unexpected to many.
We have found that the vast majority of businesses are now looking for export opportunities beyond Europe, paying particular attention to countries that are modernizing and growing while the EU countries are on hold.
They want the Government to give priority to new trade relations with countries such as China, India and Brazil, rather than waste time on the long and difficult process of reforming the EU institutions.
When asked about their views on specific political issues, from anti-monopoly regulation to product laws, most business leaders felt that the control of these key areas of competence should be returned to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the single market, with business representatives saying that the cost of regulation from Brussels now outweighs the benefits of finding a trading area in Europe, with even 40 per cent of large enterprises traditionally the most pro-European of all companies.
Last but not least, our survey of business leaders has found that the obvious majority wants Britain to take a course on treaty change and on trade-based relations with the EU rather than politics.
This result, which was seen among all sizes and major business groups, shows that the business is insisting on a "significant change", which will return power to Britain.
The high rate is the achievement of changes in the treaty and more favourable conditions for Britain to ensure a 16 per cent vote in order to remain in the EU.
There should be no doubt in the Prime Minister: this survey shows that the British business supports its plan to review the conditions of UK membership in the EU.
It also shows that the business expects the revision to lead to a significant shift in the current balance of forces back to Britain.
The better conditions for British business are possible and becoming increasingly necessary as the Eurozone enters the path of closer economic and financial union.
Priority should be given to jobs and economic growth in Britain, and, as the results of our survey show, this means a strong focus on trade and fundamental changes in Brussels ' s normative activities.
U.S. Special Service Listens to the Pope's Personal Phone
The Vatican's activities are under the supervision of U.S. Special Services.
The new documents from the Edward Snowden collection show that the U.S. intelligence led to the hearing of all the negotiations of the previous Pope Benedict, and now the Pope is closely caring for France.
His phone began to be heard before he became the head of the Vatican.
The election process of the new pope was under surveillance.
What was of particular importance in the United States.
The special service was connected to hundreds of cardinals who were gathered in Rome to pick up the Pope.
The residents' phones were also heard where the conclaves lived.
The U.S. spies had heard all the main applicants on the papal throne to prevent it from appearing undesirable to Washington.
The magazine "Panorama" writes that the "large ear of the United States" continued to hold talks until the conclusion of the conclave on 12 March.
It is confirmed that since 2005, the Argentine archbishop of Bergolio has been designated as the future Pope of Rome.
The American Intelligence also held talks on the election of the new President of the Vatican Bank.
The Italian magazine writes that in the United States Embassy, a secret group of CIA and AMB operatives who are receiving information on policies and financial flows continues to work.
In turn, the Vatican has peacefully declared that he does not care about the American “student”, even if it happens.
There are no secrets from the leadership of the United States fathers.
Snowboarders for the Olympic Cup have been specially photographed
On Wednesday, the Bank of Russia issued a monumental note about Sochi, where the Olympic Games will be held this winter.
The buyer's name is 100 rubles.
But bloggers are already actively ironicizing about the memory banknote in the network.
After the presentation of the Olympic Cup on 30 October, they pointed out that the picture of a banknote boat could be found in the photo banks.
In particular, in the free StockExchange photo store, where this photo is dated 2005.
The same photograph is used in the Photoshop lesson published on the Russian website MegaObsor on 18 January 2011.

The Olympic banknote is carried out in blue and blue gamma.
On the one hand, a snowboarder flying over Sochi, on the other hand, is a type of Olympic stadium and the Jara bird.
Author of the Banknote Design - Pavel Bushuev, who won the competition among the students of the St. Petersburg Academy of Art in the name of Repina.
The presentation noted that several types of sport were considered, such as gornologic, fristal and trampline, but that they had chosen a snowboard because it was relatively young.
According to the source of the "Reports" near the CB, the regulator’s view of the wide distribution of the image of the shipyard from the Olympic Bank is not indistinguishable and is now studying the situation.
And there's not too much concern about the noise around the Olympic banknote.
The Press Service Manager, Mr. Natalya Nikiforov, said "Reports", that all discussions about plagiarism were ridiculous.
The snowboarder at the bank will return to the right, on the photos in the network - on the left - clarified Nikiforova.
A person in a photo session to create a cupboard was taken from different points, then a final image was chosen, with a character outside a snowboarder.
She also noted that copyright laws did not apply to the Olympic Banknote, since the artist had received salary for work.
In the opinion of the experts, the discussion of the image at the Olympic Cup is positive.
The image awareness -- plus for its advancement -- is considered by NP Executive Director RusBrend Alexei Popovicev.
It is quite difficult to prove the percentage of images on the computer and in the photo banks, so claims to challenge intellectual property on this image are unlikely to occur.
For the first time, the Olympic Banknote appeared in China - the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing.
Russia has decided to support this tradition.
Laws have forced Russians to drink less beer
Russian brewers have a bad mood.
According to their claims, the consumption of beer in the country will remain at the previous level in the future year, and that is best.
Although businessmen were initially expected to grow.
For the current year, sales have fallen by 7 per cent.
All of this was led by one of the largest beer companies in the country, President of the Council of the Union of Russian Beers Isaac Sheps at the Third Annual Conference of the Adam Smith Institute of Daily Demands in Russia, which had just ended in Moscow.
It was discussed by the public regulation of the market.
From 2008 to 2012, the Russian beer market has already fallen by 18 per cent, as in recent years there has been a significant increase in the regulation of the beer industry in the production and circulation of alcohol-free beverages, has been reported by Sheps.
No country in the world has such a strict restriction on the beer market, the unpredictable introduction of all new and new non-logical prohibitions that are justified by the fight against alcohol abuse.
brewer visited that many legislative prohibitions aimed at reducing alcohol abuse did not have a special impact, but all new initiatives were constantly emerging.
All the beer producers were hurt by the ban on the sale of alcohol in kiosks this year.
"We have lost 35,000 consumers immediately," said Isaac Sheps.
For the next year, beermakers have two predictions.
The optimistic one that Sheps spoke about: sales of alcohol remain at the former level.
Pessimistics will drop by 2-3 per cent.
In order to keep their profits, businessmen are forced to leave the classes that are expected to be the "premium" class: beer will become smaller, but it will be expensive.
In the meantime, the radical effects of the fall in sales with a small amount of alcohol have not yet been seen.
"In my opinion, the level of alcoholism remains about the same level," said Dr. Alexei Sotniki.
It is true that the proportion of those who use strong drinks sorghum, as well as those who have “sucked” on alcohol containing tonicating drinks such as Jaguara, has increased, while ten years ago, alcoholism prevailed.
In September, 600 people were fired from the Ford car factory in Wiswalozke.
As the trade unions say, all fired have received compensation.
However, where more than the problems of workers are concerned, there is a reduction in production in the region.
A deputy from ZakSa Aleksey Etmanov said at the meeting that some 600 people had been reduced in the Ford plant in Wiswalozke.
He said that this had happened in September: at that time, about 600 people had left the factory with the trade union.
“Golden parachutes” were proposed by the workers who decided to resign on their own initiative for several salaries.
As a result, the vast majority have left their jobs on their own.
However, according to Etmanov, this number of people is a whole night shift.
I don't think that's gonna be limited.
However, the authorities in the next two years do not plan to adopt any programmes of support for disadvantaged regional enterprises," he explained, adding that when the budget is adopted, the Government does not take into account stagnation in production in the region and a large reduction in jobs.
In Ford, this information is not rejected or confirmed.
We expect the company to respond, and as soon as it appears, we will have to publish it.
Talks about the reduction of workers at Forda plant in Wiswalozke have been going on for a long time.
For example, in September, 600 people became aware of the company's plans to fire.
The plant had previously declared that the production of cars was suspended.
The factory was called a fall in demand for Ford cars in Russia.
According to Petrostat, the volume of industrial production in Lenoblasti decreased by 5.4% after nine months in 2013.
The production of vehicles and equipment decreased by 11.5 per cent.
Mobiles will be available in the United States during take-off and landing
New rules for safe use of mobile devices during take-off and landing are approved in the United States, reports the BBC Telecommunication Corporation.
It is expected that US airlines will allow passengers to use smartphones and tablets throughout the journey, new rules will begin to operate by the end of 2013.
However, the Internet connection to receive and sending e-mail will be prohibited during flights less than 3 kilometres.
Due to the danger of interference with aircraft radio equipment, the hundredth voting link will remain under ban.
Thus, air passengers are allowed to read electronic books, play games on boards and other gadgets and watch video during internal and international flights.
Before the rules are adopted, airlines will be required to check the safety of the use of electronic devices during the flight.
In addition, airlines will have to convince the U.S. Federal Civil Aviation Administration that they are able to cope with the alleged impact of mobile aircraft and aircraft controls.
According to this source, such as the United States, Britain may also review the current standards of use of electronic devices in flights.
For the Russian Mafia in the U.S., a new name was finally established - the "Bratian Circle"
This week the black list of Russian mafia in America was filled with new names and four companies.
The United States Ministry of Finance introduced three representatives of Russia, two citizens of Uzbekistan and an Israeli.
One of the Russians was a well-known singer by Gregorio Leps, whom the United States suspected of carrying money to members of the group.
However, in the blacklist of the United States, 22 participants in the Bratsky Round and six affiliated organizations.
However, many experts question the existence of such an organization.
"The 'Brat Circle' statement is more of an attempt to unite the various criminal groups," said an expert on organized crime and Professor Mark Galeotti University of New York.
In his opinion, the Bratsky Circle reflects the popular perception of the Russian Mafia.
"I have not met anyone in Russian law enforcement bodies or anyone else who would confirm the existence of such a criminal organization," says Mr. Galeotti, American Centre for the Study of Corruption and Organized Crime.
Mr. Galeotti agreed to Professor George Mason Liz Shelly.
"If they are working together, it is more like a criminal network, but not an organization," says the Centre for Research on Corruption and Organized Crime.
In the middle of last year, Mark Galeotti suggested that the Bratsky Circle unites more closely the Russian gate of Aslan Usoyan, known as Dad Hassan.
The criminal authority was killed in January of this year.
The activities of Lashi Shushanashvili and Zahariya Kalashov, who completed the 2012 list, were closely linked to Grandpa Hasan, and another participant in the list, Temuri Mirzoev, came to Santa Hasan as a nephew.
However, Mr. Galeotti noted that some individuals were not related to Usoyan.
In his view, they were all united rather in the common financial and criminal interests, such as the supply of drugs from Afghanistan.
Meanwhile, the scandal surrounding the inclusion in the "Bratian Circle" by Gregory Leps, the favorite singer of Russian President Vladimir Putin, drew Kremlin's attention.
Of course, we expect us to receive more detailed information from our American partners, which led to such a decision as to why it was made on such lists, said the Secretary of State, Dmitry Peskov.
In any case, he (Leps) is a citizen of RF.
As well as the interests of all citizens of the RF, its interests will be protected.
Head of Gasprom Alexei Miller says the pipeline in Bulgaria marks a new era in the gas field
The construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of the largest energy projects in Europe, said Gazproma.
“Today is a landmark event: the construction of the Bulgarian Southern Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, began,” said President Gazprom Alexei Miller in his statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element of energy security throughout the European continent.
The South Stream is intended to diversify Russia's export routes across Europe.
The dispute between the Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, where there is a large proportion of Russia ' s gas destined for Europe, increases the level of risk for ordinary routes, officials say.
Miller stated that the direct connection with Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries were “always” removed.
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from the South Stream at a reduced price as soon as the whole project begins to work in 2015.
Gasprom stated that construction should begin in other countries further along the pipeline by the end of the year.
The annual pipeline project capacity is 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.

Two YMCA officers were charged with sexual offences even before charges against Jonathan Lord, as reported by the Royal Commission
Two YMCA staff members were charged with sexual offences against children before charges were filed in 2011 against a childcare establishment in Caringbahe, Jonathan Lord, reported to the Royal Commission on Sexual Violence against Children.
But the commission’s opening statement stated that it “never dealt with cases of sexual violence against children within its organization”.
The Chief Executive Director, Philip Haira, was asked about one case when YMCA was accused of child pornography offences and another case when the instructor was deported to YMCA Caringbah Hall for sexual offences against children under his supervision in 1991.
Mr. Hayer told Gale Ferness, a lawyer who assisted the commission, that he knew about the first case, but didn't know about the second.
He recognized that YMCA also allowed introductory remarks for the Commission to be inaccurate, arguing that “there were external tests of YMCA that recognized that YMCA was at the top of children’s safety”.
The commissions presented the evidence that YMCA had been notified that it had received a second from the end of the four possible evaluations resulting from the quality audit carried out by the Department of Education and Communities in August of this year.
Mr. Hayer, who entered YMCA when he was 21 years old, acknowledged that he and his management had let go by hiring Lord, and that staff had not been able to ensure clear understanding of their obligations regarding reporting violations of children ' s security policies.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual crimes against 12 boys for two years at YMCA.
He's been in prison for at least six years.
But Mr. Hayer rejected the assumption that the corporate ethics of YMCA had prevented staff from reporting the violations of Lord in children's safety.
Officials testified that they observed violations, including the fact that Lord was alone with the children, that he had personally treated them, that he had put them on his knees, that he loved one of them, and that he allowed them to play with his mobile phone.
Daniel Oakwell, who was under the leadership of Lord and asked for her protection because she was concerned about his behavior, testified that Jacky Barnath, the guardian of the YMCA Children's Office in Caringbach, who was the leader of Lord, was “an alarming and often difficult accessible sight”.
The Executive Director said that he did not provide an explanation to staff that it was not easy for them to report the situation to their superiors.
Rather, he said that their friendship with the Lord led them from the point of view of the need to report it.
Mr. Hayer said that he had presented to the Council of YMCA of New South Wales his opinion that the lesson from the “accident with Jonathan Lord” was not “information provided” by the staff and the Council agreed with him.
Mr. Hayer said that the decision to force staff to sign confidentiality agreements soon after the indictments had been made by the Director-General of YMCA on child care, Liam Whitley.
He said that this was intended to prevent the division of evidence, but “resurrection” was being made and the decision was not implemented.
YMCA of New South Wales was not safe for children by the organization during its work, Jonathan Lord from 2009 to 2011, reported to the Commission by Professor Steven Smallboun of the University of Griffith.
He said there were “serious problems” in the recruitment, selection, training, training and monitoring of staff.
The hearings are postponed until 20 December.
It's a fashion week in San Paulo.
She's not just a model. She's a present-day star.
Despite the fact that Giselle Bundshen had for some time left her job on maternity leave, she came in particular during these days and this week's parade.
The lack of months did not prevent her from keeping her place on the floor and on the sidewalk.
Giselle remains the highest-paying supermodel of the world.
This time she took part in the Callche brand definition.
The final week of fashion is usually the most interesting shows.
It's kind of what the Stylist Lino Willaventura organized.
The brand is more than 30 years old, in parallel with the pre-port production of the luxury class, the model is active in theatre and cinema, making spectacles and making costumes for many famous paintings.
In general, over 30,000 companies and companies that are related to the textile and fashion industry and the world participated in the final week of fashion in São Paulo.

Tony Blair said he would take the chance to return as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, but admitted that the return was unlikely.
Earlier this evening, in an interview on the fifth anniversary of his retirement, 59-year-old politician expressed his views on various aspects of domestic policy.
Since his resignation in June 2007, after ten years of leadership, Blair has largely avoided discussion of British politics, limiting most of his comments to foreign affairs and his role as ambassador in the fourth quarter of the Middle East peacekeepers.
Responding to the question whether he would return to the position of Prime Minister, Blair, according to the London Evening Standard, said: "Yes, of course, but it is not possible, so ... "
Major Coach Milana, Masimiliano Allegry, expressed regret about the no-show result of the 10th round of the Italian Championship with Lacio.
The expert also noted that failure at the start was due to a series of injury to leading players.
I'm very sorry that we couldn't win, Tmw brings the words of Allegry.
The team played a good match, creating 3-4 good chances.
In the first time, we didn't allow Lacio to do anything.
The second Roman was added, but I can't tell you that we lost our concentration.
We had to win.
Last season, we did our job at the League of Champions.
Now we're off the schedule, but this is due to the whole series of key football traumas.
Rami and Honda?
These are very good games, with character.
But now our composition is good.
Look at Koka, who's held a high-level meeting.
Contestants attending Cardiff to fight for the prize of the Year Lošad, knew that competition would be very high.
But no one was ready for three-year-old Fonton Kirkland.
Not even a schoolboy, only a few months before he took his first steps, this kid with his stupid Shetland Lady Toffi's rice slipped through three tours to easily take the main prize, leaving 30 adult rivals far behind.
This undisputed couple — the same growth — received high grades of appearance, behavior, and style in the annual competition conducted by the Sannibenk horse sports center in Radri near Cardiff.
When he went out to look at men and women in the background in the finely dressed wheelchairs, he pushed his hat aside and proudly held around two-year-old Toffi.
The judges praised Fonton for his not having developed the ability to handle horses for years.
And Toffi has received a high grade of externality and character.
Fenton was donated to Toffi on his third birthday in March last year, and since then he has been dealing with the Shetland pony every day.
His 30-year-old mother, Donna, said, "Fenton and Toffy are a great duet."
They had a lot of rivals, but these two went off with a golden cup and a rose.
It was just his second speech with Toffi, and we were all in a hurry when he won.
Perfectly unknown people in the arena considered him so phenomenal that they wanted to photograph him.
This boy from Nantiglo village, near Ebwell in South Wales, is walking at his aunt Sharon Howels, who has been riding horses for more than 10 years.
Mrs. Howels said, "The whole audience was defeated, and everyone was shouting for approval.
He ran through the sand all along the arena and, although he looked so tiny, he did a wonderful job.
He loves horses, tractors, and farms, and he has two whom he will take care of.
As he began, soon he will be participating in the Loshadi Year — and I am sure he will do well.
The representative of this annual horse show said: "Fenton is only three years old, but he knows how to address his dog."
They're a great team together.
The judges noted Fonton and Toffi for their appearance and for how they introduced themselves to the show ring.
They appreciate the harmony of the pony’s speech and the magician — Fonton and Toffy were the best in the ring.
I'm sure Fenton helped him with his attractive outfit, he really looked good in his role.
Published by the Chinese newspaper “Reorganization”
The Chinese newspaper, which issued the first call for the release of the defendant in the complainant ' s slander, must be reorganized, reports the press regulator.
The newspaper New Express, published in Guangzhou, made an unexpected public statement requesting the release of journalist Chen Junzhou.
But Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he had taken notes for writing false articles about a company with a public share of property.
Now the New Expression must pass through a “full bug correction process”, according to the regulator.
The “error management” order came from the Government of Uganda in the areas of press and publications, radio, cinema and television.
The preliminary investigation showed that the Yangcheng Evening News Group of the New Express published several false reports about Zoomlion's stock exchange between September 2012 and August 2013.
“The Guide to the New Expression was disoriented,” said the regulator.
He reports that a decision has been made to “apply an administrative recovery to Chen Junjou in the form of a revocation of his reporting licence”.
He also “instructed Yangcheng Evening News Group to make complete correction of the errors in the “New Expression” and recommended that it conduct an investigation into the situation of the newspaper’s responsible persons and to immediately amend the “New Expression” guideline”.
Mr. Chen wrote a number of articles for the New Express, in which he reported financial violations in the company ' s construction equipment called Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, his paper issued two calls for his release in the first field, claiming that he supported his journalistic activities.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on public television, recognizing that he had published false money articles.
“In this case, I have damaged Zoomlion, as well as all the news industry and its ability to earn public confidence,” he told CCTV’s public broadcaster.
I did this mainly because I wanted money and fame.
I realized my guilt.
After his confessions, Mr. Chenya “New Express” issued an apology for the first field, stating that the paper had not been able to properly verify his reports.
A few high-ranking suspects have recently been admitted to television.
Experts say that China ' s recognition practices are still widespread despite recent amendments to the laws prohibiting the authorities from forcing anyone to talk about themselves.
U.S. Tunnel — Mexico for drug processing equipped with its own railway
One of the most complex drug-trafficking tunnels between the United States and Mexico has been found equipped with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail systems.
The U.S. authorities described this four-foot-long tunnel as one of the most complex secrets ever discovered.
This tunnel, which has a zigzag length of nearly six football fields, connects warehouses near the city of Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
This area is filled with unmarked warehouses, which facilitates the hidden loading of drugs in the truck.
The tunnel had been closed before any drugs had been overhauled, as the authorities had stated.
According to court documents, law enforcement confiscated eight and a half tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine when the tunnel was discovered.
Three men who, according to law-enforcement, had been charged with the possession of marijuana and cocaine for distribution.
In the event of conviction, they are threatened with 10 years ' imprisonment.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers use extensive underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passage in San Diego since 2006.
Several major tunnels were found in Central Mexico following the harvest of marijuana in October, which posed a difficult challenge for drug users to quickly deliver their products to consumers.
In 2010, about 700 yards long, equipped with railways, which went from the kitchen of one of the houses in Tijuana to two San Diego warehouses.
In Belarus, pensions have increased since November

As a result of the recalculation of November, working pensions by age will be increased by an average of 5.3 per cent.
The average age pension is Br2 million 295 thousand.
The increase in pensions refers to 2.4 million people in the Republic.
The expenditure of the Social Protection Fund of the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection of Belarus on the payment of increased pensions from November of the current year will be increased by Br274.3 billion per month.
At the same time as recosting labour pensions in November of this year, minimum and social pensions, allowances, increases and pensions will be recosted due to an increase in the living minimum budget per capita.
BPM for the period from 1 November 2013 to 31 January 2014 was approved by the Government of Br1 million 47 thousand 530 per cent higher than the period from 1 August to 31 October.
Accordingly, by 2.1 per cent from 1 November, minimum pensions, social pensions and allowances, increases and pensions will be increased.

British Police issued an extradition notice to Assangu
The British police today issued a notification of the release of the founder WikiLeaks Julian Assang, who hid in the Embassy of Ecuador in London and sought asylum.
In Scotland-Yard, they said they had handed over to a 40-year-old Australian “official demand to surrender” with a requirement to appear at the police station, adding that in the event of failure to comply, he would continue to be arrested.
Assanju was threatened with extradition to Sweden on charges of sexual offences after he exhausted his opportunities under British law when the Supreme Court rejected his appeal for extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would pass his US, he hid in Ecuador ' s embassy in London on 19 June, requesting political asylum from that South American country.
Scotland Yard “has given the 40-year-old the official requirement to surrender, which obliges him to arrive at the police station on the day and time of our election”, according to the press secretary.
He is still in violation of the conditions of bail.
The Embassy refused to comment on the notification of the police.
Assang is afraid that he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States to be charged with spying after the publication of more than 250,000 US diplomatic posts on the WikiLeaks website.
Driver with a speed of 130 miles per hour with a hot drink between his feet, fined £1000
The driver was fined £1000 for driving up to 130 miles an hour (210 km/h) with a hot drink held between his feet.
35-year-old Andrew Howy of Tiptri, Essex, was observed following his Mercedes Benz track A120 in Braintri on May 27th.
When the police stopped him, they found a drink for him between his legs.
In the world court of Colchester Howy acknowledged the charge of leadership without due care and attention.
The addition to his driving licence of seven criminal cylinders led to a six-month driving ban.
Howie also had to pay costs of £90 and an additional charge to assist victims of crime of £100.
Tax on foreign real estate owners will lead to London’s bubble rolling
The Treasury has carried out a preliminary assessment of the capital increase tax measures, but is awaiting a final decision by Mr. Osborne, who introduced in the 2012 budget a rate of public tax of 7 per cent for houses worth more than £2 million and annual payments to buyers who decide to own homes in society rather than as individuals.
At this point, the property house in the Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea areas, which amounted to 708 million pounds in the 2012/13 financial year, has already exceeded the total amount taken together in Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the north-east, northwest, Yorkshire and Hamber.
Mr. Cook said: “After increasing hospitality to expensive homes and introducing related legislation against abstinence, it is very difficult to argue that taxation of expensive property is reduced regardless of the impact of the outdated municipal tax system”.
“But this may lead to some foreign investors reluctant to buy real estate in London or its current owners will not want to sell it,” he added.
The value of the first-class property, above 5-10 per cent of the priced housing market, grew by 11.8 per cent last year in the rich South West Bank of London, which extends from Fulham to Wimbledon.
According to a study by Savills, prices in central London continued to show a steady growth of 5.6 per cent per annum, but they were blocked by the rapidly developing “home market” with a rising price in the south-west, in the north (7.4 per cent) and in the east (6.5 per cent) of the city.
Scientists have shed light on how the movement of the dog’s tail is related to its mood.
Early studies have shown that satisfied dogs are turning their tail to the right (from the dog’s point of view), while alarmed dogs are turning their tail mainly to the left.
But now scientists say that other members of the dog family may notice these subtle differences in tailing and react to them.
Professor George Vallortigara, a neurobiologist at Trent University, says: “It is well known that the left and right parts of the brain participate differently in the formation of drivers that cause positive or negative emotions.”
This is where we tried to look at it in other ways.
He added that like man, the right part of the brain controls the left side of the body and the reverse, and two half-storys play different roles in emotions.
In order to learn more about how dogs react to the various fertilizations of other dogs, researchers observed animals when watching films about other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the animals and analysed their behavior.
Maybe we'll find out soon enough why their tails sometimes go to one side and sometimes to the other.
Professor Vallortigar said: “We showed dogs video with dogs — either naturalist versions or silhouettes to get rid of any other discriminating factors, and we could manipulate the tail movement and drive the tail more left or right.”
When the animals saw that in the rest of the unexpressed dog was driving the tail to the right (from the point of view of the dog’s tail), they remained completely relaxed.
But when they noticed that the tail had shifted mainly to the left (again in the direction of the dog’s tail), their hearts were touched and they looked anxious.
Professor Vallortigara said that he did not think the dogs were deliberately interacting with each other through these movements.
In fact, he believes that dogs have learned from their experience what movements they should be concerned about and what is not.
He notes: “If there are several meetings with other dogs and the spread of their tail on one side is often related to more friendly behaviour, and the right side gives less friendly behaviour, the dog reacts on the basis of this experience.”
Researchers say that these results can give owners, veterinarians and trainers a deeper understanding of their animal ' s emotions.
An expert on the behavior of dogs John Bradshaw, an invited scientific officer at the University of Bristol veterinary school, said that this was not the first study to check whether dogs were relevant to the left and right of the parties.
Last year, a group of scientists from Lincoln University found that dogs were turning their heads left if they were looking at an aggressive dog and right if they were looking at a pretty dog.
And in another scientific work at Victoria University in Canada, he reported: “The dogs were more likely to approach the dog at work when its tail was thrown to the left rather than to the right, instead of becoming alarmed, the opposite behavior toward Italian research.”
He said that the differences could have been because dogs in various studies did not fully perceive animals in films or dogs as dogs.
He explained that it could be useful to study how dogs respond to these dogs.
“While there is sufficient evidence to show that two half-livers of the brain are used for various purposes, many details are still to be clarified and the dog is not an exception,” he said.
However, given the ease with which their conduct may be recorded, we will likely soon learn why their tails are sometimes directed on one side and sometimes on the other.

Pope Francis called the first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will bring in the new cardinals of the Catholic Church's dream for the first time for his term of service on 22 February, as the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the supreme clergy in the Catholic Church after the pope, and that is why they choose the pope, so France will appoint its first group of people who will eventually participate in the election of his successor.
There are now 201 cardinals.
However, after reaching the 80-year-old cardinal, he could no longer participate in the pope’s election, which is the prerogative of the group of 120 “cardinal electors”.
In announcing this news, the Vatican press secretary, Father Federico Lombardy, said that a meeting of all current cardinals, known as the Consistency, would be held before the dream ceremony.
“Dad Francisk decided to inform in advance of his decision to convene a Constituent in February in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings with Cardinals from different corners of the world,” Lombardy said.
Jack Valero of the Catholic Voting Organization said that by February the number of cardinals was likely to fall.
He said that he usually called the cardinals as much as it takes to bring back the number of cardinals to 120, as well as the number of cardinals over the age of 80 as he wished.
The Consistency will be of great importance next year because it will be the first since France was elected in March of this year, according to Valero.
At present, there is a kind of bias in favour of Europe and in particular in favour of Italy.
“It will be interesting to see if the new pope appoints Cardinals from other regions of the world to restore the balance”, he said.
Forty per cent of Catholics live in South America, but they are represented by no more cardinals.
These will also be the first selected cardinals since the formation of the French Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world, to seek ways of reforming the church.
In the past, Dad made up his mind.
"Now France has chosen eight cardinals to help him," Valero said.
He said that “it is possible”, that France would refer to the cardinals for advice.
But we were not in that situation before — all of this for the first time.
Valero said that the popes were usually brought into the office of cardinal bishops from large incomes, but France “is a semi-suppression, so we don’t know who he is. ”
GM withdraws a number of new U.S. peaks to finish back seats
General Motors Co reflects almost 19,000 completely new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra models 2014 to address the problem of manual adjustment of seat backrests, as reported by US regulatory authorities on Friday in the field of road safety.
At some of the peaks, the front seats may have a defect in the backrest.
As a result, seats do not comply with the federal safety standards of motor vehicles by head restraints.
“With a car hit behind the head restraint, the driver and passengers may not be properly protected by increasing the risk of injury,” says the National Road Safety Administration website.
Those models were produced from 1 August to 10 September.
GM pickups started in June and is the most important car launch for the leading American car manufacturer since its restructuring due to bankruptcy in 2009.
The GM informed the owners of pickups of the defect in the first half of October.
The National Road Safety Administration could not consider notifying the owners of the 16-day termination of the Government, which reduced the increase in car sales in October.
The sales of Silverado and Sierra pickups, which were modernized for the 2014 model series, increased by approximately 20 per cent over the first 10 months of this year, as GM stated on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado pickups and 16,503 Sierra pickups.
GM shares at the New York Stock Exchange increased by 1.4 per cent on Friday until $37.47.
The desperate cry of Obama's electorate
I voted in favour of President Obama twice, sharing the hope of change
He said that Obama had allowed the obstruction of the Republicans to exert no praise.
Obstacles cannot serve to justify problems with the website reformed by Obama's health system, unmanned attacks
The 2008 Obama campaign memoirs are a sad reminder of what could happen
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second student at Harvard University Medical School.
I'm reading a terriblely sad book these days.
I thought that this book would inspire me during my second degree in medicine and give me a sense of hope.
It is called “Dearness for Victory”, and it is a memoir of the 2008 Presidential Campaign of Barak Obama.
When I finish writing reports about my patients and lying in bed at night, this book brings me back when politics inspired millions of people and speeches could catch the spirit.
The election victory was impressive, and the leading news programmes were taking a break to understand this historic moment.
My classmates cried out for joy, and my parents kept all the newspapers they could only find.
A young team of strategies had to come to the White House, and the people were ready to change.
At the time of Obama ' s entry into the post in 2008, his support rate was 82 per cent.
Then I close the book.
The return to the present is a gross awakening as a withdrawal from the dream.
It is hard to recall those days of optimism — they seem to be a distant memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I dropped my first ballot, the changes have really happened.
That's what I couldn't even imagine.
I commend Obama for his great and diverse achievements, from the adoption of the law on available medical assistance to the withdrawal of our troops from Iraq, the repeal of the rule “Do not ask, do not speak”, the murder of Usama Ben Laden.
Furthermore, I believe that party obstructionism has blocked too many attempts to move our country forward: immigration reform, the choice of public health and the closure of the Guantanamo base among others.
But after a number of times, when I was on the side of Obama's administration, protecting her from colleagues and conspirators, I ended up explaining what I could provide.
I've reached the point of political despair.
Obstacles to Republicanism cannot explain the permit to interrogate foreign leaders or to strike innocent children in other countries.
It cannot explain the collection of data on the private life of Americans by the National Security Agency or the persecution of disclosors who reveal wrongful acts of the Government.
He cannot explain the murder of American citizen Anwar al-Avlaki without a court and investigation or non-compliance with the limits of public funding and expenditure during presidential campaigns.
He cannot justify the conclusions of the report, which states that the White House's efforts to keep the media silent are “self-aggressive... since the time of the administration of Nixon”.
And he has recently been unable to justify the failure to develop a simple website for more than three years after the signing of the accessible medical care law.
I don't know if I should have expected that.
Did I have to understand, at the age of 18, that leadership could be contrary to the political campaigns that preceded it?
It is clear that the work in the election is not a predictable programme of action, as our public dialogue will be formed by an opposition political party and by events such as the coup d ' état in Newtown.
Nevertheless, all the examples listed above show that they were largely their own choice of administration.
And that's what worries me most.
I again voted for Obama in 2012, but not because I was a prisoner of enthusiasm for his candidacy.
Mitt Romni was an inconceivable and rude alternative, and he did not seem to be able to decide on his own policies or views.
I thought that, in my second term, Obama, out of the pressure of future elections, would justify the hopes we had heard for such a long time.
However, when Obama's rating fell below 45 per cent this week, it became much more difficult to return in 2008.
That makes me do many of the promises that have come true.
This week, I read that part of the book that describes how Clinton beat Obama in the initial elections in Pennsylvania.
At a meeting to analyze the causes of failure, he told his staff that they should return to normal and remain faithful to their goal.
"I want us to return our attraction," he said.
“We must remember who we are.”
It's been five years, Mr. President, and I totally agree with you.
The views expressed in this commentary belong exclusively to Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims that Mr. Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in the issue of childcare leave.
Deputy Billionaire Clive Palmer said that Prime Minister Tony Ebbota had a conflict of interest in the issue of childcare leave, because his daughters could get pregnant and benefit from it.
This mining industry magnet, which has an unresolved carbon tax dispute of $6 million, made this statement when he tried to get away from the issue of whether he had a conflict.
The Joint Party of Palmer may control up to four votes in the Senate, which may be crucial in deciding on the abolition of carbon taxes and mining activities.
But Mr. Palmer claimed that the conflict of interest could only be with the ministers, and said that Mr. Ebbot's daughters would prove themselves to be more successful than political measures.
“He has a major conflict of interest when it comes to childcare leave, because if any of these daughters get pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether they get leave or not,” Mr. Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the Electoral Commission officially announced Mr. Palmer as the winner of the position of the Fairfax Electoral District in Sanshin-Costat, with 53 votes in favour after the recosting of the votes.
Mr. Palmer called for a review of the counting of votes in the elections to accelerate this process.
The daughters of Tony Abbott Francis and Bridget.
Should a decision on these elections be taken two months after we voted?
“We need a better system,” he said.
Why don't we have to have this system so we can come in, put your data on the computer, immediately vote and get the result at 18:30 the same night?
Mr. Palmer also criticised the use of the Carandas for markings in the bulletins.
That's because they can beat the outcome if someone doesn't like it?
The use of karanda in our time seems strange.
The Electoral Commission is considering the possibility of an electronic vote and has recently published a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.
Mr. Palmer, 59-year-old, said that his programme included an international airport for Sanshain Costa and that he would be “very serious” about his new work.
The State office is a public service.
“We do not get any awards except through history because at a critical moment we can serve this district,” he said.
RBS removes two currency traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland temporarily removed two traders from its currency operations unit, according to the information provided by two people familiar with the situation, which is another confirmation that the global verification by regulators of alleged manipulations in the currency market is rapidly gaining momentum.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they cooperate with regulators in investigations involving the world's largest financial market, with a daily turnover of $5.3 trillion.
These two traders will be the first employees of RBS to be removed during a roll-out investigation, which is linked to the LIBOR interbank manipulation scandal.
In refusing to comment on the removals, the bank confirmed that it had received requests for information from the regulatory authorities this month.
“Our ongoing investigation continues, and we are fully cooperating with FCA and other regulators,” the bank reported two weeks ago.
Last month, the informed persons said that RBS had sent e-mails and instant messages received and sent by its former trader to the United Kingdom Authority for Financial Control (FCA).
This trader, Richard Asher, left the RBS in 2010 and was granted leave for his current position as head of European spot exchange trading in JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trading in Citi, went off this week, while Matt Gardiner, the former senior currency dealer in Barclays and UBS, was removed from the work of the Standard Chartered Bank this week.
None of these traders were charged with any violations.
Mr. Asher ' s group of instant communications included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, according to informed persons.
The UBS bank reported this week that it had taken action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator Finma said it was investigating alleged manipulations in the foreign market in several Swiss banks.
At least six world regulators — the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Antitrust Authority Weko, FCA, the U.S. Ministry of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Office — are considering claims that banks have become at odds with the impact on the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse also started internal checks or received requests for information from the regulatory authorities, said familiar with the situation.
Banks are looking for instant communications and e-mails for several years in search of offences.
The news of the verification has prompted traders in the field of activities that have been one of the major sources of income of investment banks' trading units in recent years, but this year has faced difficulties because low currency volatility reduces favourable opportunities for buyers.
Some bankers have tried to reduce the seriousness of the situation, saying that it is virtually impossible to manipulate the vast and highly liquid currency market, but the senior traders say it is not always true.
According to the senior trader, despite the huge volume of daily trade in the currency market, the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and the wider use by banks of their domestic platforms means that “you can start to influence the market at a very low price”.
This news came the same day that Credit Suisse announced that he fired one of the traders of his London Stock Exchange department this week after it had caused losses of nearly $6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank immediately informed the relevant authorities and cooperated with its regulators.
“We are sure that the trader was acting alone and that the issue could be located,” said Credit Suisse.
The Supreme Court supported the Obama Health Act
The U.S. Supreme Court today ruled that the Barack Obama Health Act is constitutional, which is a major victory for Obama ' s administration.
In voting against 4, the judges decided that certain provisions under the Law on the Protection of Patients and Available Health requiring citizens to obtain medical insurance before 2014 or to pay a fine were constitutional in accordance with the authority of the Government on taxation.
The President of the Supreme Court, John Roberts, joined the four more liberal members of the court, while the judges of Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy opposed.
The Court also upheld the remaining sections of this 2700-page law and further ruled that the requirement for a health law to increase compliance by states with the Medicaid programme, otherwise losing all the federal funding of the Medicaid programme, was not unconstitutional.
The bill was blocked by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law strongly opposed each of the major Republican candidates in the Presidents during the 2012 primary election season, including the alleged candidate, Mitt Romni.
Soccer is the reason for the difference?
Within the framework of the Open Tribunal, politicians and experts spoke about how to maintain national peace in Russia.
Among the proposals was the ban on football in the North Caucasus, because of this, there were some scandals and divisions.
Speaker Sergey Narishkin recalled the recent developments in Biruleve and said that policies and media should be adjusted in order to reduce the “level of tension in society”.
He must have been referring to a recent scandal with Vladimir Girinovski, who in one of the broadcasters threatened to surround the Caucasian cobblestone with a provocation if they did not want to limit birth...
All speakers also spoke about measures to regulate migration from CIS countries and measures to harmonize relations between the peoples of Russia, which contributed to the discussion.
Maxim Grigoriev said that the events in Biruleva were "the model conflict that could have been predicted", but "we have too many people and institutions to answer these questions" and seven children without an eye.
The concept of multiculturalism, which for a long time has been practiced by migrants in Europe, has, in the opinion of the public, failed and needs to find its way.
The historian Yuri Petrov placed great hopes in a new single textbook of history.
"It is still necessary to create a cultural guidebook for the peoples of the country, so that schoolchildren in Tatarstan know that they live for people in Dagestan, and vice versa," he said.
Gennadius Zuganov suggested that he be given criminal responsibility for "calling for Russian disbandment": "If you say on the radio that you must give up Alaska Russia, you will be arrested and sentenced to 20 years in prison!"
Vladimir Girinovski tried very hard not to burn.
As usual, he accused journalists of all kinds who posed painful and severe national problems to the public debate: "In the middle of the debate, there is little to say!"
The leader of the "One Russia" group, Vladimir Vasiliev, here advised journalists to close the "paper" and agree to have discussions on this subject in a precise manner and then make the same commitments.
We have adopted about 30 laws governing migration, and Mr. Vasiliev has generally said.
As an example, he introduced a law that entrusted regional and municipal authorities with responsibility for international peace in their territory.
But Ludmila Andricenko did not share her point of view on this law: she had no clear idea that it was an adaptation of migrants, its mechanisms and limits.
Thus, the entities will deal with different levels of these powers.
In addition, municipalities do not have the necessary staff to deal with so many complex issues, nor do they have the means to make use of the methodological recommendations they could use.
Gajimet Safaraliev, Head of the Committee on Nationalities, has proposed the establishment of a special department called “Ministry of National Security”, which would deal with national policy issues.
However, Valerie Tiskov, who was head of a similar agency in the 1990s, subsequently abolished, objected.
It is enough to have a special person at the federal level, “Minister without a portfolio”, to whom one could refer if so.
"We are going to the edge, the snorkels are coming together, it is very important for the representatives of different ethnic groups and religions to speak together against provocations, and this work should receive decent information support," said the representative of the RPC on relations with the society of Wizvolod Chaplin.
No State neutrality with regard to dangerous ideologies, including religious ones, should, in his opinion, not be.
Here, Oleg Nilov led the discussion to an unexpected move: "More talented people than in Chechnya or Daguestan, to seek yet needed, but they are not pushed on that path, not on that path," he said.
"Not the road" is the development of football: "The football player beats the whole crowd, the flags are burning, the friends are throwing stones at each other...
Maybe we don't need that kind of football?
There's another kind of sport. It's called...
"There will be no equal in the world for them in this form of sport!" said the horrid speaker.
There's no one to play in the reggae at Caucasian!
You're still giving them a ride!
We need to know the national features, but it's just like offering the truck "The Fireman"...
In Yaroslav, the presence of representatives of the Moscow Club was marked by the wild conduct of the tribunals during the local club.
Football is gonna have to ban all over the country...
The head of the RFS disciplinary committee, Arthur Grigorianz, reported that "Cuban" was fined 500 thousand rubles, handing over from the House football correspondent "SE" Philipp PAPENKOV.
Such sanctions for the Red Club are applied to the flag of Dagestán by the painers on the tribunal during the 14th round of a home match against Anji.
The meeting was attended by representatives of both clubs, a person from RFPL.
We've examined all the available materials.
For the wrongful behavior of the Cubans, 500 thousand rubles are fined.
Against Google, Samsung, Huawei patented applications for Nortel
A group with thousands of former Nortel patents filed a whole series of patent claims against mobile phone producers on Thursday, including a Google company, at which it was awarded an auction on Nortel bankruptcy.
The Rockstar Consortium, which bought $4.5 billion of Nortel's patents, filed claims for violation of patent rights in the U.S. District Court in Texas against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies.
Rockstar is owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
These patents cover technologies that help compare key search words on the Internet with their advertisements, which is the basis of Google's search business.
The representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were unavailable and did not comment.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC are making phones working on the Android operating system from Google, which is fiercely competing with mobile products from Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011, Google offered an initial price of $900 million for Nortel patents.
Google has increased the proposed price several times, finally offering a total of $4.4 billion.
He lost his patent case with Nortel Rockstar consortium, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, in which the patent library of Motorola was a factor.
“In spite of an unsuccessful attempt to acquire patents for the subject matter of the application, Google has violated and continues to violate them,” the court says.
Rockstar calls for an increased recovery of losses from Google, since he claims that the violation of Google's patent rights is intentional, as claimed.
In Egypt, the first freely elected president takes an oath
Muhammad Mursi took an oath, but his birthday would hardly mark the end of the political struggle in Egypt.
Islamist Mohammed Mursi promised “new Egypt”, when he made his oath, to become the first freely elected president of the country, replaced Hosni Mubarak, who was defeated 16 months ago.
At its inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi also became the first freely elected Islamic President of Arab Peace and the fifth head of State in Egypt after the monarchy was defeated about 60 years ago.
He took an oath before 18 judges in black robes in the building of a court on the banks of the Nile, built in the style of the ancient Egyptian temple.
“We are looking for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic,” said Mursi at the ceremony shown in the live air on public television.
“Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundations for a new life — absolute freedom, genuine democracy and stability,” said Mursi, a 60-year-old American educator from the Brother Muslims, a fundamentalist group, which was most of the 84 years of its existence as a banned organization that served as a target for harsh actions by changing governments.
The building was guarded by hundreds of soldiers and policemen when Mursi arrived at a small court shortly after 11 a.m.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered at the courthouse to welcome the new President, and unlike the Presidential Pump Mubarak time, the movement was stopped only for a short time to miss his bus stop on the usually reinvigorated road connecting the city centre to the southern suburbs.
Although Mursi was ridiculed as an uncharizmatic “defence wheel” of the Brothers, his personal prestige grew sharply since his victory and Friday speech, in which he tried to introduce himself as a candidate not only of Islamists but also of all those who wanted to bring to an end the cause of the resurrection in 2011 against authoritarian Mubarak.
“Egypt today is a civil, national, constitutional and contemporary State,” said Mursi, dressed in a blue business suit with a red tie, to the judges in the covered wooden panels of the hall where he took his oath.
Later, Murcy went to Cairo University, where he had to deliver his opening speech.
He was given an official reception with an army orchestra that had completed the State Gym, during which he stood “slow”.
There was a military officer, Field Marshal Hussain Tantavi.
His arrival was met with the slogan “Army and People — One Hand”, which blackmailed hundreds of students gathered in the main lecture hall of the University.
The University of Cairo, founded in 1908 as the district of secular education, became the district of Islamic student groups in 1970.
Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday at Tahrir Square, where there was a rebellion that had ended the authoritarian rule of Mubarak last year, and promised to restore the powers of the President, whose office had been deprived of his position by the military council that had taken action by the defeated leader.
But having agreed to take an official oath before the court, rather than before the parliament, it was in accordance with the will of the military, and it was a sign that the struggle for power would continue.
The word Morsi on Tahrir Square was filled with theatrical populist gestures.
The main meeting of the Association of Tumeni Motorists was held on the basis of the Yalutorov automotive plant.
The event introduced a new line for the production of steel wires.
As the business director of Denis Gribanov told us, a marketing study on the steel market in the Tumeni area was conducted in 2011.
It has been found that the region consumes more than 50,000 tons of electrical pipes per month.
Thereafter, it was decided to change the production profile of the plant and to install equipment on it for their production.
More than 7,000 tonnes of production have already been downloaded this year.
Investments in the plant amounted to over 120 million rubles, said Denis Gribanov.
In October, a new state was launched, which would increase the range.
The plant is made up of both a small tube profile, which is used for heating, small forms of construction and in the furniture industry, and a large one for the construction industry.
We plan to reach the production level of 50,000 tonnes a year, which will account for about 10 per cent of its consumption in the Thumenese region.
Despite the transition to another type of activity, the number of staff at the enterprise has not decreased, now being 157, in plans for the purchase of new equipment, an increase of more than 50 staff.
The company is retraining and the necessary specialists are selected from already available.
The following year, a new long-lasting cutting unit is planned to be introduced at a thickness of up to five millimetres, which will reduce the cost of the product and another condition, with the production speed of up to 47 meters per minute.
By the end of 2014, companies are going to develop the emissions of pipes used in housing and utilities.
The company ' s management is tasked with closing up to 70 per cent of the need for the Tumen area in this product.
The Deputy Director of Investment Policy Department, Leonid Ostroumov, addressed to production managers, advised more attention to modernization of machinery industries.
This is also the form of State support for industry, which includes the reimbursement of interest rates on loans for the purchase of new equipment and the cost of its leasing.
For these purposes, 150 million rubles are planned for the current year, two thirds of which have already been spent.
The last commission, which will consider grant contracts, will adopt documents from enterprises until 15 November.
In addition, the budget reimburses the costs for the participation of local producers in international brands.
For the coming year, the budget has a budget of 150 million rubles, which can be used to compensate for leasing payments and loans for new equipment.
5 million will be allocated to the fairs, 3 million to energy conservation programmes.
There are reduced to 72 million rubles for the recovery of ordered and paid equipment in the south of the Tumen area for the oil complex.
According to Leonida Ostroumov, this form of support will in future be discontinued, as it was the reason for its introduction that compensation was paid to the oil companies in the area budget.
They are not currently doing so and subsidies are becoming the region ' s direct cost commitments.
In view of this, the Government considers the priority area to be the direct support of industrial enterprises rather than the financing of the oil industry through them.
Budget assistance will be linked to investment projects that will be implemented in production.
Many business leaders expressed concern about the oil situation.
The grant for their equipment is a competitive advantage for the South Tumen region industry, and it will be difficult to compete at the price of the Russian average band, where the labour force is cheaper.
In addition, it is unclear whether the new TNC-WR owner is a Rosneft company, which has not yet placed its orders in the Tumeni companies.
The agreement on the implementation of the Uvatian project expires in 2013, and no applications for its extension have been made.
South-area enterprises specializing in equipment for the oil sector are currently unable to form a portfolio of orders for the coming year.
There is still an open question whether taxes from the region ' s oil source will be paid in the region ' s budget or will be paid at the place of registration of the new owner of the oil.
Tomich works 240 hours for the extremist role in the siege
Tomska, the Lenin District Court sentenced the city's community to 240 hours of compulsory work, which had put extremist video media on the social network, informed the RIA Novosti on Friday of the district court's press service.
According to the court, in March 2013, a man posted a video on his website on the popular social network, which was included in the federal list of extremist materials.
In this regard, a criminal case was initiated under the article of the FC FC “Acts aimed at incitement of hatred and hatred, and at the humiliation of human dignity committed in public”.
“The Lenin District Court has dealt with this case in a special manner and has recognized the man guilty of the above-mentioned crime by appointing a 240-hour sentence for compulsory work,” said the Agency ' s interviewer.
She added that the man fully admitted his guilt.
Azarov promised Ukrainians to cover the price of goods after the signing of the association with the Euro Union
Ukraine's Prime Minister Nikolai Azarov is convinced that the country's prices will decline significantly after the country signs an association agreement with the European Union.
He said so in communication with readers of his page at Facebook.
I can certainly say that prices are determined by a large number of factors, including customs payments.
Thus, following the signing of the Agreement and the entry into force of the Free Trade Zone, the level of customs duties on imports of goods from the EU will be significantly reduced.
And that would mean that prices should also be reduced.
"This is about goods coming from EU countries," Azarov wrote.
As for other products, the effect of the agreement on prices will not be so direct as to be channelled.
However, there must also be no price increase.
Therefore, reports on billboards that have recently shown enough in our country, that association with the EU is an increase in prices, not at all, or if more precisely - not at all," said Azarov.
Investigators are checking information on child abuse in Biscay
On 29 October, the media reported that the educator of one of the children ' s gardens of the city of Biyska had locked the child in the basement for educational purposes.
The investigators are currently identifying all the circumstances, and legal evaluation of the actions of children's staff is also being made.
After the indictment of Evgenia Vasileva's stupidity,
The Evgenija Vasileva, a person nearly a year with a close attention to the media, has not yet commented on numerous publications in the press, both on theft in Minombo and personally, on relations with former Minister of Defence Anatoli Cardukov, her poetry and on greed for valuable things.
On 1 November, however, a figure in the Defence Service case violated silence.
In an interview with Life News Vasileva, he said, "Of course, the task was to get out of me any negative information about the former Minister of Defence."
There was a scandal that I had to testify, otherwise I would be put in prison.
To this day, these threats have been halted.
We're going to court, we're going to prove our innocence.
We're 100 percent confident in victory.
In this interview, it can be concluded that Vasilèv was the first to say that she did not care about the taste.
It is likely that the statement by the official representative of SC F.F. Vladimir Markin that there were counterfeits in the painting collection, which was collected in the case of the Defence Service.
Among the assets seized are a number of paintings that the owner, being convinced of his deep knowledge of art, acquired as the masterpieces of the world’s paintings.
However, the artistic expertise appointed by investigators after the arrest of these paintings has found that they are of no artistic value and, in simple terms, are cheap counterfeits," Markin noted in early October.
Some of the paintings stolen from the Ministry of Defence...
Then they admitted that they weren't stolen from Minombo, and they said I had a bad taste.
Who has the right to discuss my taste, to discuss some personal moments?
I think it's just unlimited," says Vasileva.
On the issue of whether she admitted her guilt even in one of her 12 criminal episodes, Vasileva said, "Of course not.
To admit nothing at all.
Moreover, there is no harm to the Russian Federation.
They're just misleading people, that's all.
In addition, in response to today's statement by the FC, that Vasileva is turning away from the study of criminal matters, a figure lawyer stated that he and his client “does not let the investigator know the facts”.
What has been the cause of the revelations under Vasilev’s house arrest, which have not yet been reported in the press?
Perhaps how could a woman not respond to the accusation in a bad way?
Or is it the rights of the journalists of Komsomolki, who claimed a few days ago that she had “falled into an even greater trance under house arrest” due to reports of the reconciliation of Anatolia Serdjukov with his wife and his return to his family?
The well-known military investigator "KP" Victor Baranec in his article "Serdjukov has returned to his wife?" wrote: "Followers do not rule out that after such a shock, she may become more talkative in questioning."
In the past, Vasileva had been charged with some of the illegal sale of the property of Mino Defense.
Premise guys.
What to do in the garden before freezing
From the fungicides in the autumn, it is best to select the intermediates, such as 1 per cent board mix or Abiga-Pick, Oxich, Ordan, etc.
Do you think the tourists have gone to the past with the Internet?
The Flight Centre seems to have a reverse trend.
The company has updated its forecast for the full year and expects record revenues from vacationers in Australia and the United Kingdom.
This tourism company now expects its main full annual income to be from $325 to $340 million, compared with its previous forecast in the range from $305 to $315 million.
If the current guidelines are achieved, this will be a 12-17 per cent increase compared to the record profit of $290.4 million received in 2011/2012.
The Managing Director, Grem Turner, said that Flight Centre had received 8 per cent in the first half of the year and started the second half with good indicators, especially on weekly trips to Australia and Britain.
“From the beginning of the year, we have been working on the profits of our 10 countries, and some of them are expected to be high in the full year until interest and tax contributions are deducted,” he said.
“This is Australia and the United Kingdom, which usually brings us the biggest gains.”
In Australia, business in the field of long-term in the second half of the year has been restored, which has compensated a slightly weaker internal market for corporate travel.
Similarly, in the United Kingdom, the Flight Centre business in the area has been doing well, while corporate customers have spent less.
Her business in the United States compensated for the losses suffered during the seasonally weak first half of the year and was expected to receive income for the third full year in a row.
Yesterday's Flight Centre stock grew by 3 cents before $38.20.
On 31 October, the Barnaul police found two playrooms.
The first one worked in the Industrial Area on the Street of Flight.
At the time of the check at the facility, there was a game.
There were 24 cars in the club.
Another club was found in the Lenin district on Anton Petrov Street.
20 slots were used here.
Russian IUDs on Barnaulu report that administrative material has been produced under the article “The Illicit Organization and the Commodity of Gambling”.
Technique's off.
In the near future, the evidence will be sent to the courts of the Industrial and Lenin districts of the city.
In Ekaterinburg, a criminal killed two sisters and burned their bodies
In Ekaterinburg, the police are investigating a criminal who has brutally dealt with two sisters.
After they were murdered, their bodies were burned.
As reported to the "New Region" in the press service GU MVD RF on Sverdlovski, two women were found dead bodies in the area of the city of Ural in the early days following the fire in a three-room apartment located in a residential house on Uralski Street.
The persons of the deceased were soon identified.
It was found that this sister, one of them, was a resident of Ekaterinburg 44 years old, the second was a 33-year-old resident of the Orenburg area.
They took off the burning apartment a few days ago.
His investigation was under personal control by the chief police officer of Michael Borodin.
The internal affairs authorities are developing different versions of the murder, checking the alibis of previously convicted citizens and persons who are prone to such acts.
In addition, the purpose of which women had removed the apartment and where they had lived before what they had been dealing with was established.
Schools called for greater attention to mathematics, orphography and grammar
School courses in English literature will require students to study at least one piece of Shakespeare, the 19th - century novel, the romantic poetry, and modern British literature since 1914.
The examination will also contain “out-of-programme texts” to encourage more extensive reading.
The joint course of English literature and language will be abolished.
From 2015 onwards, students will be required to submit a separate language exam, with strong recommendations for selecting English literature as a separate exam.
The Department of Education should issue new training programmes on English and mathematics tomorrow, the first subject subject to radical revision.
It will make changes to other main items next year.
The separate regulatory body in the field of OFQUAL examinations will present the revised structure of secondary school graduation exams, with a new evaluation system and a lower level of course work.
Speaking in summer, the Minister of Education Michael Howe said that there was “a broad consensus that we should reform our exam system to restore public confidence”, insisting that school graduations would be “more complex, more ambitious and more stringent”.
Studies show that English schools spend less time on mathematics (116 hours a year or 3 hours a week during the fourth period) than in most countries.
For comparison, Australian schools provide an average of 143 hours a year and students in Singapore take about 138 hours.
Although the formal requirement to spend more time on the math schedule would not be available, the coalition sources said that large school graduations on mathematics combined with an increased rating rate would most likely serve as an incentive for schools to provide additional training on this subject.
The training plan will focus more on “real life challenges”, including financial mathematics.
Tickets to Haye will be held by tourists in 2,200 rubles
As soon as tomorrow comes from Blagoveschenska in Haye, the tourists will begin to drive the ships on the air cushion.
For those wishing to travel to China, this means additional routes
The ticket on the puma is traditionally much more expensive than the heat.
As reported in the AmurASSO reference service, the average ticket cost is 2,200 rubles.
A walk through the comfort room will cost 2,800 rubles.
In fact, during this season, tickets did not travel: at the same price, the pumas drove tourists and last spring, and the year back in the autumn.
Dmitry Medvedev: GDP growth rates are insufficient for the development of the State
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev believes that the growth rate of GDP is insufficient for the RF and is confident that the situation can be improved by simplifying business lending conditions and changing the structure of the Russian economy, focusing on innovation, Reuters reports.
This year we planned to increase GDP in the region by 3%, perhaps even more.
It'll really be less than 2%.
In the background of the recession in a number of countries in Europe, it would not be very bad, but it is little for us, because the economic base is not as powerful as in a whole number of countries, and in order for it to develop, it must be at a higher rate.
It is now very important for Russian companies, Russian business, to receive normal loans at the normal price, which is the first thing that must be done," stressed the head of Government.

Journeys on land, rivers and jungles to provide free medical assistance
Dr. George Bwelle provides free medical care in rural areas in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team run almost every exit, taking hundreds of patients
Not so many doctors in this West African country — only one per 5,000 people
Vote here or via your mobile device
Dr. George Bwelle is one of the top 10 heroes of CNN 2013.
You can vote for him or any of the other 10 main heroes to make him the Year of CNN.
This person will receive $250,000 to continue his outstanding work.
During the 21st year, George Bwelle saw his father return to life and returned to unconscious state, swimming on hospitals that were not properly equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle suffered a car crash in 1981 near Yaounde, Cameroon’s capital.
At first, he had only a broken arm, but the infection spread to the brain and caused a germ that reminded him of himself for the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," said George Bwelle.
If we had the money, we'd get him out of Cameroon.
Instead, for years Bwelle accompanied his father to crowded clinics and hospitals, receiving any treatment they could receive.
"It's not easy," said Bwell.
- You can leave home at 5:00 a.m., go to the hospital to be the first, but you're not the first.
There's a lot of patients.
Some may die because they have to wait.
The situation has not changed much since Father Bwelle died in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, only one doctor per 5,000 people in Cameroon.
For comparison, the ratio in the United States is one doctor of 413 people.
And even if the Cameroonians could contact a doctor, many of them wouldn't be in the closet.
Two out of five people in that country live below the poverty line, and almost three fourths of the cost of health is private.
“ Their only problem is poverty,” Bwelle said.
“And because of poverty they cannot enjoy their lives.”
Seeing the suffering of his father and many of his companions, Bwelle was determined to do something about it.
Last year, Dr. George Bwelle and his team of volunteers conducted 700 free operations.
He became a doctor himself and worked as a forensic surgeon at Yaounde Central Hospital.
It also established an ASCOVIME non-commercial organization, which organizes rural travel on departures to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have assisted nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people are loaded into the vans, tied to the roofs by medical supplies, and went to the crossroads to visit those in need of help.
They don't always have luck.
Suddenly they had to push cars through rivers and debris.
But when they come, they meet them like these heroes: this is a holiday with songs and dances and the best rooms that locals can offer.
Free health care in these villages is indeed a reason for the holiday, and Bwelle, with its wide smile and unlimited energy, is more than happy to join in.
The next morning, the brigade starts taking hundreds of patients.
“We take 500 people on each trip,” Bwelle said.
They come from all the districts within a radius of 60 kilometers from the village, and they come on foot.
Each of these day-end clinics provides various medical services.
Many people are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites, and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may receive bones, donated eyes, or free birth certificates — the documents needed for a school that many poor families simply cannot afford.
At night, the brigade carries out simple operations under local anesthesia.
Operations are usually carried out in a school building, a municipality or a house; after the procedure, patients stand up and go to the post-operative zone to free the next person.
Using the generator to light up the operation and sanitation of the equipment, Bwelle and his volunteers work until morning morning.
This is a slow pace, but the brigade’s zeal usually helps to support rural musicians.
"They've been beating the drums all night, so that we can keep up and keep working," Bwell said.
On Sunday, the Brigade members return to the city, tired but proud of their work.
This group, consisting of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students, conducted 700 free operations last year, and they know that their assistance can be of great importance to those they assist.
One man explained that his free care operation would allow him to work again.
"This will change the future for me and my family," said the man.
In addition to these clinical admissions to the exit and hospital, surgeon Bwelle also works nights at private medical clinics around Yaounde.
It is this second work, he said, that provides 60 per cent of the financing of his non-commercial organization; the remaining funds are covered by private donations.
"I don't even know when he's asleep," said Katie O'Malley, a medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia, volunteering at Bwell.
He was always in the hospital or was trying to make money for the organization so that these campaigns could continue.
For future doctors and nurses, such as O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join Bwell in their tasks, this is an opportunity that they would never get home.
“We have had the opportunity to assist in operations where we helped to remove Friday’s blood or keep the instruments for Dr. Bwelle,” O’Malley said.
As a high school student, you would never have had such an opportunity in America.
Voluntary students usually pay for their trip to Cameroon, often coming with donated medication.
But when they arrive in Yaounde, their food, transportation, and training are paid by Bwell.
"He's a hero, no doubt," said O'Malley.
He gives his life to this organization, and his desire to help the people of Cameroon is endless.
For Bwell, the almost permanent load of work is not a difficult test.
To help others live a happy life, to fulfill this promise to their father is what brings him great joy.
"I'm so happy when I do this job," Bwelle said.
- And I think about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I'm doing this to make people laugh to ease their pain.
Go to ASCOVIME and see what you can do to help.
Snowden agreed to give evidence of Merkel's interrogation.
Ambassador Gans-Christian Strebele met with Edward Snowden in Moscow.
During the discussion, the question was whether Snowden could be questioned as a witness to the FRG's Office for the possibility of hearing the phone of the German Chancellor by U.S. Specialists.
Snowden was willing to give the necessary evidence.
The meeting could take place either in Moscow or in Germany.
He made it clear, said Hans-Christian Strebel, that he knows a lot.
And despite the fact that the National Security Agency led by Kitt Alexander has blocked all its movements, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
However, all conditions of his arrival must first be clearly defined.
Meanwhile, American legislators are beginning to take action in response to the scandal surrounding US spy programs.
Yesterday's Senate Intelligence Committee approved a bill introducing additional restrictions on the activities of the American Electronic Intelligence Authority.
Belarus and Turkey are interested in developing and deepening relations in all areas and areas.
This was reported to reporters by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Belarus Vladimir Macei at a press conference with Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, correspondent for BELTA.
We are very pleased that our Turkish colleagues and partners at all levels are interested in developing and deepening the Belarusian-Turkish relations in all areas and areas.
Belarus is also interested in this, so we agreed that the two countries' government authorities will provide broad support and support to entrepreneurs that establish direct trade and economic contacts," said Vladimir Makay.
He stressed that the Government of Belarus would create all the necessary conditions and provide maximum assistance.
The Minister also reported that there was a regular 8th meeting of the Belarus-Turkey Joint Intergovernmental Economic Commission in Ankara, resulting in the signing of the protocol.
The Parties have drawn up a road map of Belarus-Turkey cooperation, which, according to the head of the Belarusian foreign policy department, aims at deepening bilateral cooperation in trade, economic and investment areas, industrial cooperation, transport, agriculture, energy, as well as finding new forms and means of interaction.
"The protocol of the last meeting was fully implemented, and I am convinced that the current protocol will also be implemented, because Belarus and Turkey consider each other as reliable partners," he said.
Turkey ' s Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, in turn, reported that during the negotiations, the heads of foreign political agencies of the two countries decided to further develop mutual cooperation and implement various projects.
Trade between Belarus and Turkey, in the Minister ' s view, needs to be increased and brought to $1 billion.
Turkey is also an important partner in the area of investment cooperation, which needs to be further developed, since there is no use in this area, he believes.
There have always been very warm relations between our countries, and we hope that they will be further strengthened and expanded.
All necessary conditions will also be established for trade and economic linkages and for the successful work of Turkish companies in the territory of Belarus and Belarusian enterprises and organizations in Turkey," Ahmet Davutoglu noted.
Obama renounces his words of health
In the midst of a storm of criticism, President Obama went on to a sudden and frequent promise that “if you like your health insurance plan, you can keep it.”
As hundreds of thousands of people are being notified of the termination of their services from their providers, Republicans have recently criticised the President for misleading the American society.
Yesterday Obama made a few changes to his original public promise.
“Most people with medical insurance who work can keep it,” he said in his statement in Boston.
Referring to the fact that he referred to the “renewal of the news” regarding the termination of services, Obama called on those receiving these notifications from the Americans to look for other options on the market.
Most people will be able to obtain better comprehensive health insurance plans at the same price or even cheaper than expected.
He said, "You'll get better conditions," he said.
The Administration stated that no one should be surprised that 5 per cent of the people who buy insurance on their own might be forced to change their plans because their coverage did not meet the new standards required by the available medical care law.
“Let me tell these Americans directly: you deserve the best,” Sibelius said in a statement to the Energy and Trade Committee of the Chamber of Representatives in Washington.
Sybelius, who is a smoker for the implementation of the accessible medical care law, said that the launch of the internet sales site was going “fearingly bad” since October.
“I’m upset and upset, ” she said.
“I really want to return your trust.”
The angry Sibelius defended this phrase, which he captured by an included microphone sitting behind her at yesterday ' s hearings in the Chamber after a heated debate with a member of the House of Representatives of Billy Long, a Republican from Missouri, on whether she was obliged to enter Obama ' s health programme herself.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long urged Sibelius once again to say why the “architect” of the accessible medical care law had not voluntarily renounced the Government-sponsored insurance for the acquisition of the plan through HealthCare.gov, which it now imposes on millions of Americans.
The Rosbalt Agency has denied media status for non-censored defence.
On 31 October Mosgorsud decided to accept an invalid licence for the registration of the Rosbalt Agency, which is written by Lenta.
The lack of media status agency insisted on Roskomnaszor - for systematic and gross violations of the media law.
An unpleasant precedent was established during the trial: the court considered it possible to close the media, in fact refusing to issue a counter-arguments.
What's "Rosbalt"
The Rosbalt Information Agency was established in St. Petersburg in 2000.
In the following years, the Agency opened the second headquarters in Moscow and a number of regional units.
The agencies also have representations in the countries of the former USSR.
Since 2001, Rosbalt has developed and functioned as a federal information and analysis agency.
By the mid-2000s, the agency had been included in Russia's most well-known private media.
However, Rosbalt has always been quite specific: the core of the agency's exclusive publications was (and still are) notes referring to sources in law enforcement.
Discussions on the proximity of publications to force structures continued throughout the agency.
Although Rosbalt had an extensive source base in various departments, it was also said that the head of the project was Natalie Chaplin, the wife of Victor Churchess.
However, the role of Chaplin in the Rosbalt leadership is unclear: it is often called the project manager.
The Director-General of the Agency is Larissa Afonina, editor-in-chief Nikolai Uljanov.
In recent times, Rosbalt has not been included in federal media ratings, either by quoting or by audience.
In October, the Agency took the 25th place in the Russian media website review on LiveInternet.
According to the same LiveInternet, the average daily audience on the rosbalt.ru site is about 150 thousand unique visitors (and up to 500 thousand visits), a monthly audience of about three million unique visitors.
Among the most popular materials in the past five months were notes of Kremlin's insanity in relation to Ukraine, the death of a soloist from the King and Shot group, the riots in the capital city of Birulev.
The conflict with Rosbalta began in July 2013, when an amendment to the media law against non-censored protests came into force.
The notice found a prohibited lecture in two video agency websites ("Jigit from Krasnodar" and "Pussy Riot defiling oil heights").
The other parties describe a variety of ways.
On the basis of the video material found, Rosbalt accused him of a gross and systematic violation of the Media Act and appealed to the court for a licence from the agency.
In Rosbalte it was claimed that the agency's claims were incorrect: first, the roles were not editorial materials, second, the mother's words were masked in them, and thirdly, immediately after the role was warned, they were removed from the site.
Representatives of the agency complained about the claims of Roskomnaszor in the world court - and when Mosgorsud accepted the request of Roskomnaszor on 22 October 2013, these complaints were still pending.
However, 25 world judges have already taken a decision not in favour of Rosbalt: editor-in-chief Nikolai Ulianova was found guilty of violating the Code of Administrative Offences and fined 20 thousand rubles for every role.
Obviously, this prejudged the outcome of the hearing in Mosgorsud, if you refuse to think that the outcome could have been prejudged earlier.
On 31 October, the court decided to accept invalid evidence of the registration of Rosbalta, depriving the media agency of its status.
It can't be said that Rosbalt remained alone during this resistance.
The Agency supported the representatives of Gosmunda (the statement on behalf of the Head of the Russian Federation, Alexander Jarov, signed 26 deputies on 10 October; the document itself was submitted on the initiative of the CRC).
The publication was not properly closed by the head of the Union of Journalists of Russia Allevold Bogdanov, President of the Moscow Union of Journalists Pavel Gussev and Head of the President of the Human Rights Council, Mikhail Fedotov.
Moreover, according to Bogdanov, the Roskimnadzer's leadership even provided him with some assurances that the case would not come before the licence was withdrawn.
The Rosbalt Court has shown that the media in Russia is more secure under its jurisdiction today than ever before.
Syria destroyed weapons equipment
Syria destroyed all declared chemical weapons production capacities, recognized the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.
This first phase of disarmament was completed by the day before the deadline.
By 1 November, Syria had to destroy production and other support facilities for the preparation of combatants for use, transmitted by the BBC.
The destruction of the toxic substances themselves or their chemical components should be completed by mid-2014.
According to the representative of OPCW, the poisons are currently in sealed containers.
International inspectors went to Syria after more than 1,400 people died during the chemical attack on 21 August.
The main task of the inspectors was not to waste time, not to allow the Syrian authorities to produce more weapons, but to destroy the infrastructure for mixing chemicals and ammunition.
These production capacities will now be closely monitored to prevent their relaxation.
The next wave is mid-November: by this time, OPCW and the Syrians should agree on a detailed plan to destroy existing stocks of toxic substances.
There's a lot of questions here.
Where will they be destroyed?
Who will provide this equipment?
All Syrian statements will be carefully checked by Western intelligence.
They are willing to advise inspectors on new inspection facilities if there are grounds for suspecting that Damascus has not been fully opened.
It is estimated that the shooting was carried out by regular troops.
Syria and Russia insist that this is the case of the Syrian rebels.
The world community has demanded Syrian leadership, in accordance with the agreement reached through Russia, to destroy or render ineffective all the capacities for the production of gas and liquid pollutants and for the filling of these substances.
Now that this phase has passed, the next step must be the destruction of the already existing Syrian arms.
This arsenal may contain more than 1000 tonnes of nerve and paralytic toxic substances, each natural greenhouse gas and other prohibited chemicals stored in several tens of different locations.
To destroy it, it is necessary for the OPCW and the Syrian authorities to agree on a schedule of action to begin, which takes two weeks.
The Director of Field Operations of OZHO Jerry Smith stated that his inspectors had been "personally monitoring the destruction of equipment".
"They now have no possibility of further production or mixing chemical weapons," he said.
The OPCW statement states that the inspectors have visited 21 of the 23 sites in Syria and have been convinced that the production plants are either destroyed or rendered uncomfortable.
The remaining two objects are too dangerous to carry out an inspection there, says the paper, but the equipment has been transported and checked by OPCW specialists.
According to Smith, the destruction of the chemical-producing infrastructure was “incredibly difficult”, as work had to be done in the context of the ongoing conflict.
At the beginning of October, OZHO received the Nobel Peace Prize, but Smith said that it was time for inspectors to celebrate it before it was found - they were too busy at work.
John Kerry says in his unprecedented recognition that the United States espionage “has gone unfavorably far”
John Kerry demonstrated a reduction in the protection tactics of United States tracking programmes, making it clear unparalleled that in some cases the United States espionage “has gone unfavorably far”.
The Secretary-General also acknowledged that it was guilty, along with Barak Obama, of being “in the autopilot” at the time of Edward Snowden's massive disclosures about AMB's spy activities.
These leaks of information have put the U.S. Government at the centre of a diplomatic scandal with its allies.
Speaking on video at an open governmental conference in London, Mr. Kerry said: “There is no doubt that the President and I, as well as other members of the Government, have actually seen some of the things going on in the automobile because such an opportunity has already existed — both during the Second World War and in the very difficult years of the Cold War, and, of course, 11 September”.
He then became the first high-ranking member of the United States Government to recognize that the United States had gone too far, but stressed that no rights had been violated.
He said: In some cases it has been unpleasant to him.
And the President is determined to shed light on the issue and explain it to people, and he is now conducting a thorough analysis so that no one can feel abuse.
I assure you, there is no injustice to the innocent people in this matter."
Mr. Kerry insisted, however, that the AMB acted out of good motives and that his follow-up operations saved many lives.
He added: "We are working in a new world where people are willing to explode.
There is radical extremism in the world, unreasonable and complete determination to kill people, explode people and attack Governments.
What if you were able to catch it, stop it before it happens?
We've actually prevented plane crashes, building explosions and killings because we've been able to learn about these plans before."
In the meantime, American legislators will be sent to Europe to help resolve the issues of alleged espionage abroad and convince Europeans to continue joint anti-terrorism activities with the United States, said the Chairman of the Senate Sub-Committee on European Affairs on Thursday.
The Senator of the State of Connecticut Chris Merfi said that he had been interviewing with members of the European Parliament and other persons this week and was concerned about their threats to stop their participation in anti-terrorism organizations because of disappointment over the report by the National Security Agency.
“For the interests of U.S. national security, it is really important for Europeans to remain our supporters regarding our common counter-terrorism efforts,” said Murphy, a first-time democracy and chair of the Subcommittee on International Relations of the Senate on European Affairs, in an interview from Washington.
“And I am going to Europe to let them know that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, despite their anger over these AMB programmes.”
News that the ANB had collected millions of phone calls in Europe had deteriorated relations with some US allies, although the agency's head said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected a lack of understanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and shared with the United States.
Other disclosures included documents published by Snowden showing that AMB had been monitoring the mobile phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, as well as some 34 other world leaders.
National Intelligence Director James Clapper has protected spying against allies as necessary and said it is a normal case on both sides.
In the background of this forest, Murphy said that his office was organizing a visit to Congress, which is expected to take place this year, and that he hoped that members of both parties and chambers would be included in the delegation.
The names of other participating legislators should be heard in the next few days.
He said that the travel programme was still under development.
Although Murphy said that the purpose of the trip was to promote better relations, he said that some degree of “hardness from the best wishes” would also be manifested.
He said that European leaders should be honest with their people in what spy programs they used themselves for many years.
“While we can change our monitoring programmes to better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also agree that we are not the only people involved in reconnaissance,” Murphy said.
In the meantime, Mr. Kerry should be sent to these outposts in the Middle East and Poland to address the hostility of the United States strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as US intelligence activities.
The influence of prisoners on new public observation commissions will be increased
Today, the Board of Public Chambers (OPs) can adopt new compositions of public observation commissions (OICs) in 43 regions of Russia.
If the option to vote is adopted, lobbyists will increase their influence.
ONC is a public structure that controls the conditions of detention in places of detention.
In the case of Sergei Magnitski and Leonida Razozzeeva, the riots in the Copier colony - that is, through the UNC - have been exposed to most resonance incidents on the network.
There is a struggle between human rights defenders and lobbyists.
At the OPC working group meeting, I proposed to make the selection of human rights experience a criterion.
"They didn't accept it, they made lists, they didn't create criteria," says Valerie Borschev.
Borštov, the current Chairman of the Moscow Observer Commission and the Association of Independent Observers, is a fully-fledged structure of human rights defenders in prison.
In his address to Mr. Gosmora from Apple, he had drafted a law governing the activities of the UNC.
The Board of OPCs should vote in favour of the membership of the OPC in 43 regions of the country.
At 1800 vacancies, fewer than a thousand applicants were claimed, and in Ingushetia and Cabardino-Balcaria, the competitions were unable to organize due to the lack of candidates.
OP promises to organize a selection of vacancies.
OK Moscow is one of a few competition commissions, despite the fact that there will be 40 participants instead of 20 in the new one.
According to Borscheva, in the current composition of the capital commission of 11 human rights defenders and 9 rapists, and in the option at the vote in the OA, the ratio changes by 17 to 23.
At the same time, 30 human rights defenders wanted to be placed in the chair.
Hence, the representative of the God's Brotherhood may be re-entered into the new composition.
He was a member of the ONC for three years, but never visited the prisoners.
Borštov believes that force forces, by appointing their chairman, will be able to make the work of human rights defenders unbearable, so human rights defenders do not exclude a collective departure from the commission.
In their view, the movement of soldiers is coordinated by the member of the ONC Anton Tsvetkov, headed by the "Officers of Russia" - an organization that advocates the interests of force agencies.
"I don't eat babies on every track," said RBC Daily Anton Flowers.
He denied that he was lobbying for any lists and said that he was not going to prevent human rights defenders from visiting arrested opponents.
According to Zvetkov, he was not even interested in what list is now voting in the O.P.
The publication of Borshew information is considered a form of pressure.
Possible success of human rights defenders is the planned change in leadership of the Chelibrian ONC.
Her former leaders will be removed because of last year's copious riots.
In the Public Chamber, it was concluded that the management of the local commission had ignored the problems of prisoners.
And here's the ONC Rostova-na-Donu can move from human rights defenders to rapists.
Out of the new lists, the human rights defender of the local commission was missing, so one of his opponents turned out to be, despite the fact that in May 2013, the Federal Court of Public Affairs excluded him from non-ethical conduct.
The lists of the Moscow and Growth Commissions of Borschev are considered "a place for Copenhagen".
The Revelations of the Hope of Tolokonnik did not affect the ONC Mordov, which they considered “strong”: the new entity wanted to become only one human rights defender, and it did not even adopt documents for the competition.
A member of the OP Council, Nikolai Svanidze, told the RBK daily that he voted against the proposed list, as he was upset by the situation in Moscow and Rostov-na-Donu.
He sent his position to other members of the council.
His colleague on O.P. Paul Gussev said he had voted in favour because he liked the proposed Moscow list.
He co-ordinated the development of the UNO lists by Deputy Secretary, OP Vladimir Grib, also a member of the FSIN Research Institute.
Gryb told RBK Daily that he did not consider it appropriate to divide candidates for human rights defenders and rapists and did not agree with the fact that the chairman of the commissions had sufficient authority to impede the work of its members.
The Bishop is not required to predict the outcome of the vote of the Board of Directors.
If the proposed list is rejected today, an amended option will be put to the vote in the next few days.
Australian woman appealed against a prison term in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney who was sentenced to 15 years in a prison in Phuket Island for claiming that she had been attacked by a taxi driver, appealed for a sentence and was released under bail.
Steve Rochelle Bemford was initially recognized by the Phucket Provincial Court on 15 June after the Thai police reported that a local taxi driver had attacked the night of Sunday, 10 June, while two other men had held her.
However, the video surveillance cameras later found that she had well returned to her hotel after the breakup with her Australian boyfriend.
The Phucket police questioned Bemford for two days before she recognized that she had made this story.
Before the trial, she was held in local police chambers.
Bemford was sentenced to a 15-day prison term in the centre of general detention in the province of Phuketa, not in a female prison for adults.
She is a daughter of the former Australian League of Peter Tanks, who approached the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra with the help of her daughter.
Tánks told the Sydney Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was “very concerned” about the well-being of their daughter and was waiting for her return to Australia.
“It’s obvious that this was an alarming time, but we hope that she will return home as soon as possible,” Tanks said.
Bemford appealed to his sentence and was released on bail at 50,000 bats.
According to reports in Australia, she is currently on vacation in the Krabi resort in southern Thailand.
The legal sources in Thailand reported that Bemford was currently a local lawyer in Phukette, but warned that the appeal could lead to an increase in the sentence of two years and would require her to be held in adult prison.
However, after the recent murder of the Australian tourist Michel Smith in Phukete Thailand, he could also seek to restore his damaged tourist image, which would lead to a justifiable sentence.

Remember, his novel became the finalist of four awards: "The Clear Field", "The Russian Bucker", "The National Bestseller" and "The Big Book".
And last year, the author of this book was awarded a prize by the Government of the Russian Federation in the field of culture.
Roman Senchin is undoubtedly the leader of the current 30-year-old and forty-year-old proseaut.
Practically every publication of its hard stories and stories based on contemporary life is a source of heated disputes among critics of various directions.
It can be argued that the joint articles on the process and publicism of Sancina, its book reviews and magazine publications have created an interesting and unexpected landscape of Russian literature since the end of the 1990s before the beginning of 2010.
In the discussions on the works of “one of the most controversial contemporary writers”, critic Sergei Chuprinin says that it is said that its participants understand the word “literary” as they see not only the present and future of our word but also our life.
Unfortunately, the volume of the book did not allow most of the articles and reviews from regional media and blogospheres.
Analytical and review articles are generally given in the reduction in the section “Absaces...”
