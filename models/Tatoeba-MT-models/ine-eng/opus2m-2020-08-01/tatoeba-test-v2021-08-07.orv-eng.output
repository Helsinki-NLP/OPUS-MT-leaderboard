I've been looking for you.
I'm sorry.
I'm quiet and I'm tired.
I'm still voting.

Look at home.
Look at that.
Are they cats?
What are they?
All cats?

I'm eating this!
You fixed what we can do.
I can do it again.
I'll give it to you.
Give me your son-in-law.
Even though it's snowing.
I don't know. I don't know.
Kena has two cats.
Oh, Kena is a cat.
