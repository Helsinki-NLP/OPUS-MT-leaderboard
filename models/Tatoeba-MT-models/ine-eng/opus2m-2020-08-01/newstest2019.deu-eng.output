"Beautiful Munich" 2018!
In the afternoon a surprise awaits our candidates: they will not fight the romantic Candlelight shooting before MY SOLARIS alone, but on the side of Male-Model Fabian!
Hvar - Flirting, cooking, seducing - no simple tasks for our girls.
Especially when a friend is waiting in Germany.
Nevertheless, the nine "Beautiful Municher" candidates deliver at the shooting with people photographer Tuan and meet wind, rain and rain like a real profession.
The romantic shooting takes place in the video:
DFB-Chief Grindel sees no basis for Özil-Comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel is currently seeing no basis for a return from Mesut Özil to the national team.
"That is a question that of course depends on one's going to talk to him once, that you also talk to him about why he obviously felt it as it is in his statement," said Grindel in the football podcast "Phrasesmähr" of the "Image-Semination.
Despite the recent months' debate on the photos of Özil with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regretted the retreat of the 92-fold national player Özil.
"I would have liked if Mesut Özil had continued to play for Germany.
I also assumed that this would be the case until a certain time," Grindel said.
The 29-year-old had declared his resignation from the DFB team in July and also argued that he had not defended the grid against racist enemies during the WM.
The DFB leader reiterated his criticism of Özil that he was not prepared for a conversation with Bundestrainer Joachim Löw and Team Manager Oliver Beerhoff.
He doesn't want to build any pressure, but he knows it from football so that if "you leave a team or change a club that you talk to his coach about it and I find it a pity that this conversation has not yet come to an end".
Linz: Garden cabins burned in Schrebergartensidlung
At 2:13 p.m., the Linz Firearm was alarmed to a fire in the firehouse.
Because a high-voltage line leads directly over the Schreberger species settlement, danger was delayed.
The firearm broke out and found the cabins in full-branded when they met.
The roof had to be removed practically to the full and fire protection was removed to the necessary extent.
According to the owner of the burning garden hut, he had a battery to charge at noon.
That might be the brandy.
In any case, according to firearms, the charger was in the area of the highest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire still needs to be determined - as well as the fire.
However, it should be significant because the owner had many collector pieces in his garden.
Angry mother resists: Lindsay Lohan attacks refugee family on the open street
What led Lindsay Lohan to this extremely remarkable action?
She apparently wanted to enter a supposed refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Fullly Loaded") has even streamed live as she apparently wants to enter a family in Moscow.
This reports the U.S. portal "TMZ" and publishes a partial medium of the stream.
Here you can see "Fucking Good luck" with Lindsay Lohan
The clip shows how Lohan rises out of a car and goes to a possibly homeless family who wanted to make her out of Syria as a refugee family.
When the family flees right before the actress, Lohan persecutes the parents and their children.
She has the right to engage in adult child trafficking.
For all of this, she doesn't deliver any evidence in the clip.
"The whole world sees it," Lohan is listening in the video, as she continues to follow the family along the street.
Apparently she's trying to separate the children from her parents.
Sometimes, however, it seems to be enough for the obvious angry mother.
It looks like she's turning around and Lohan's missing an earring.
Under tears, the actress will appreciate how shocked she is - and she will hold on to the wave.
What Lohan has moved to this action is now completely unclear.
Landing on Ryugu: This task has "mascot" on the asteroid
The probe "Hayabusa2" started in December 2014 in Japan.
It should approach the asteroid Ryugu so much that it can absorb material from its surface and bring it to the earth.
The lander "Mascot" will stay on Ryugu.
Foreign Ticker: The number of dead on Sulawesi rises to more than 400
After the severe earthquake of strength 7.5 and subsequent tsunamis on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, at least 420 deaths are reported.
The number of victims could continue to rise.
The rescue teams have not yet moved into the desert and cut off from the outside world.
Elon Musk resigns as Tesla Supervisory Board
At the beginning there was a second.
At the beginning of August, Tesla-Chief Elon Musk was worried about the stock markets when he announced a withdrawal of the car manufacturer.
The U.S. stock exchange supervisor complained to him about fraud, but now both have agreed.
Tesla and Musk have to pay, and the Tesla Chief withdraws from the Supervisory Board, but he may remain the Chairman of the Board.
Party of British Conservatives
sharp watch - the party day of the Tories
Birmingham is going to be the stage of a power struggle.
This is about foreign policy, trade and development policy on the part of the party, but the four-day conference of Prime Minister Theresa May and Brexit hardliners is overestimated, at the forefront of former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson.
Referendum for a new national name
The Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Macedonia (right) and Greece have agreed
Macedonia is a state on the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been arguing over these names for years.
Now they have agreed.
The state of Macedonia is going to be called North Macedonia in the future, and this is what the population is talking about this Sunday - is it okay?
Protests in Brazil against legal populists Bolsonaro.
"Ele Nao" ("Don't") - Jair Bolsonaro is meant.
A week before the presidential election in Brazil, the mood was split in the country.
Thousands went on the street in several cities to protest against the law-enforced Jair Bolsonaro.
The "Trump Brasiliens" is an anti-system candidate and is therefore ahead of the polls.
His strongest competitor is Fernando Haddad from the Left Workers' Party.
Audi: Dieselgate processing takes longer than planned
"The Diesel Task Force still exists," said development director Peter Mertens to the industry's "Automobile Week".
The arrested and authorized head of Audi Rupert Stadler announced in December 2017 that the task force will soon be dissolved.
"In the first quarter of 2018 all engine/engine combinations were likely checked," he said at the time.
Mertens now said: "At the beginning of July we have achieved an important goal in the development of the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analysis of our VTDI engines.
The Task Force was established in September 2015 after the discovery of the diesel canal at the Audi-Mother Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the carmaker had made "graving organizational changes" so that such a scandal would never occur again.
The VW Supervisory Board had postponed a decision on Stadler's future on Friday and wanted to continue to discuss this Tuesday.
The investigating authorities shall submit to the head of the hearing to allow the sale of diesel cars with wrong exhaust values after the gas fraud has been reported.
He knew about the manipulations or ignored them.
The company is currently headed by the sales board, Bram Scott, as the head of the board of directors.
Due to the change to the new WLTP exhaust and consumption test standard, there are production accidents in Audi, the "Heilbroner Voice" said.
In principle, he sees a decreasing demand for limousines such as the Audi models A6, A7 and A8 produced in Neckarsulm.
"The segment is difficult," he said.
Shot puts on electromobility.
For the e-tron, the first Audi electric car, there are already 15,000 reservations.
Grid seeking re-selecting - Lahm to DFB Bureau
Mainz (dpa) - Reinhard Grindel, despite criticism of his person after the WM-out and the Özil affair in the coming year, wants to re-apply to the office as DFB President.
"I do my job and try to make it as good as possible," Grindel said as a guest at the ZDF's "Current Sports Studio" early Sunday morning.
You have to try again and again for a re-election, I will.
And then you have to see if the support is there.
According to his own words, the union chief found it "remarkable", if after the award for the football-EM 2024 he didn't have the "lust to work on the future project".
Grindel has been the successor of Wolfgang Niersbach, a member of the Association Manager of the Sommermärchen-Affair.
In autumn 2016 he was elected for a first complete term of office of three years.
The next vote will take place on the DFB-Bundestag on 27 September 2019.
The future EM Chief Organiser Philipp Lahm will work with the DFB Bureau, according to Grindel.
"I would be pleased if my colleagues in the Bureau agreed that in this role he was also in the Bureau with advice and then of course was warmly invited to make his experience available on sporting issues," Grindel said.
He did not want to participate in speculations as to whether Lahm could be his successor as DFB chief.
As a consequence of the affair around the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the wish that in the future a national player without migration would become DFB's integration messenger.
Currently, this office of native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic has family roots in Cameroon.
"If a person with no migration background clearly affects society and football and says that "the issue is important, then we need to take care of it," it would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our associations on the spot where integration needs to work," Grindel said.
Remove correctly with half-circuited weight
I've owned a new toy for four weeks.
A weight that not only measures my weight, but also the body fat part.
Musculoskeletal and bone mass can also be shown.
The Body Mass Index also calculates the thing, but it is rather for the worm.
But he doesn't say anything about whether I've replaced fat with muscle.
basketball-Bundesliga: Clear performances for Berlin and Oldenburg
Berlin - ALBA Berlin is launched with a clear victory in the new season of the basketball Bundesliga.
Against Science City Jena, the Vizemeister won without difficulty with 112:55 (52:31) and offered over 40 minutes a convincing party.
Rokas Giedratitis was a 20-point top scorer of the dominant Berliner.
The national player Johannes Thiemann (18 numerators) committed to Ludwigsburg also showed an attractive performance before 9113 spectators in his performance.
Ex-master Brose Bamberg won the performance debut of Coach Ainars Bagatskis with 84:80 (39:37) at S.Oliver Würzburg.
Augustine Rubit was a 24-point best seller with guests.
Würzburg-Profi Gabriel Olaseni arrived at 14 counters.
Last year's playoff semifinalist MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg forced the Fraport Skyliners from Frankfurt with 83:76 (41:34).
New national player Karim Jallow was the 24-point best shot at Coach John Patrick's team.
The EWE basketball Oldenburg started the new game time with a clear success.
At the basketball Löwen Braunschweig there was a clear 100:64 (48:30) and the first two points.
The new gamemaker Will Cummings exceeded the old bourgeoises with 25 numerators.
The Braunsweger, in which NBA-Star Dennis Schröder is the majority owner since the beginning of the season, disappointed after a good first quarter.
A 26:1 tour of the basketball quickly ensured clear conditions.
Opens the world of mosques in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened the Ditib mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdoğan had previously met with Chancellor Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier on his three-day visit.
Criticism in Germany
In his opening speech, Erdoğan called on the German government to provide supporters of the Golden Movement living in Germany and to take action against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens - no matter where they live.
We will not allow supporters of the PKK or the Golden Movement to intimidate our citizens and damage the German-Turkish friendship," he said.
For the opening of the Ditib mosque, the Cologne city was partially closed.
Thousands of policemen were in use - including sharps.
The Ditib Islam Association is in criticism because it is regarded as an extended arm of the Turkish government.
"Global Citizen Festival": music against poverty: Stars, Buhrufe and Seconds of Fear
Musicers such as Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have spent more time at a joint concert in New York Central Park in the fight against poverty and disease.
"Involves you wherever you can only," Mendes said at the festival on Sunday night before about 60.0000 spectators.
Thank you for coming here, that's a dream.
Cardi B appeared in a red outfit with French and golden microphone.
I'm nervous, I'm sweating, but it's okay, because I'm here and ready to change the world.
Actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and relief organizations showed themselves at the stage during the multi-hour show.
In the meantime, however, there was a moment of fear when many spectators felt the sound of an overwhelming metal barrier for shooting, getting scared and trying to flee.
A short time ago panic broke out, people separated.
Seven spectators were slightly injured, said the organizer Hugh Evans.
The New York Police and the musician Chris Martin then calmed the people out of the stage.
"No one tries to hurt anyone," said Martin.
You're all safe.
Tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were available free of charge on the Internet like every year.
Those who wanted to get caught up in the Internet had to read and distribute texts, photos and videos about the global fight against poverty and disease.
For the numerous musicians and actors there was the audience jubel and Applaus - Buhrufe, however, for the Republican Senator Jeff Flake.
He spoke with his democratic colleague Chris Coons on the stage for more equality between men and women.
On Friday, however, Flake spoke on behalf of the U.S. Senate Justice Committee for the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as a judge at the Supreme Court and thus hit many women in front of the head.
At least three women have raised allegations of abuse until attempted rape against Kavanaugh, which it rejects.
Flake called for an FBI investigation of the allegations after two women who, according to their own data, had experienced sexual abuse on their way to the committee meeting in a row.
"You can also come up with me at any time," Flake now told the audience at the New York concert.
Freedom of the press: Federal government defends journalist's draft
Government spokesman Steffen Seibert defended the draft of a journalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
In the office, the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had crossed a T-shirt with the Turkish and German inscription "Freedom for Journalists" and had gone into the first row.
The T-shirt, if it wasn't the problem, said Seibert the picture on Sunday.
It was an interruption of the press conference.
The action of the journalist has caused a great unrest, which is not acceptable.
That's why he caused personal protection to take out the man.
Seibert said it was not allowed to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Office.
This is entirely independent of whether or not it is a legitimate concern.
The rules are the rules.
Many journalists are in prison in Turkey.
Many of them are subjected to alleged spying activities or to support or membership in prohibited parties or the Fethullah-Gülen movement.
The Turkish leadership is responsible for the failed Putsch trial on 15 July 2016.
Some of the accused journalists threatened several decades of detention.
Also foreign journalists are not safe before the Turkish authorities: At the beginning of September, the Austrian journalist Max Zirgast was arrested.
Recently, the cases of the arrested journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel had provided for surveillance.
They came free and were able to return to Germany, but in Turkey there are still processes against the two.
Munich: Florian David Fitz completely drunk with Ina Müller
His fans usually know him so fresh and well: Florian David Fitz.
You have to look twice: Yes, that's really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The talk show "Inas Night" produced by the NDR is known for wet-frequent conversations at the Theke of the port of Hamburg.
Moderator Ina Müller meets with her guests on some beer, some wine or even higher drinks to catch up on the mood and tongue.
There are not few promises to drink for the mandatory singing facilities.
Another result of the popular talk show was recorded on Friday.
This time: The actor Florian David Fitz is known for films such as "men's hearts", "Terror - Your Judgment" or "The Goldenest Day".
The Municher got the trip to the high north but didn't get well.
On Saturday he posted a selfie - his face is completely zerknauts, the eyes just two small cuts.
The bed-selfie shows a completely enchanted Florian David Fitz.
But he's not sick, he only has a powerful cat.
Towards his fans he posted some - perhaps not quite serious - findings he has now won: "Rule one: do NOT go to Inas at night.
Rule two: never drink the black sauce.
And a syringe.
And the round egg liqueur, which throws about three and a half inches away, also leaves.
Alcohol consumption is really written in the face of the 43-year-old.
His fans posted a few tips to fight the waves at once.
They are full of instant bread, fish bread or - probably the most targeted - headache tablets.
Others were just amused by the view of the normally attractive kinostar.
As Ina Müller has survived the nightfall, it is not known so far.
Since she's been moderated the TV fun at the teke since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be much more tempted...
On a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa has to fight vandalism and inadvertentness
The entrance to the 36 km long railway in the Red Pocket Country in Treysa is difficult to find and melt.
Recipes against fatifying vandalism are being sought, but solutions are hardly available.
Scherben, Cigarettes, Mull and Unrat, demolished mills and currently dismantled signboards - this is how since the longer the entrance with a seat group has been presented on the Haaße-Hügel in Treysa.
There is more than an unparalleled view on the railway track in the country of Rotkappchen.
The issue involves members of the ADFC local group Schwalmstadt, but also others for a long time, according to Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The problem has already been addressed in the Radiation Board.
There's no solution.
The proposals range from the removal of the seat group to the regular disposal of the waste containers and the cleaning of the areas at the entry point.
"I think the last would be the order of the hour - regardless of possible further activities," says Deserthagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that the topic has also been brought to the council.
Not only is the garbage driving bikers and residents around - the sitting group is at weekends regular meeting point to celebrate.
It is not only often loud, the stocks are also destroyed: dusts are torn from the ground, dusters are demolished, painted, furniture is painted.
Volunteers had already cleaned up more often, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
The actions, however, are only the verbal drops on the hot rock.
They are upset that the rust place on the bike in Treysa meeting point is for storage.
"During the entire cycle, there is a clear focus on the Haaße hill," confirms the bicycle traffic officer, who now takes care of the new railway station in Ziegenhain, which will be opened today.
"If she suffers the same fate, it will be quite expensive."
Another idea was video surveillance at the hill: "Perhaps this makes the threshold significantly higher to reach the community.
However, this would require a police raid to take place in time.
In principle, desert hagen wants a development of the Haast hill.
It should be more attractive.
With the frequency of the cycle so far, you can be very satisfied.
The tourist market is still comprehensive.
Our bike route is very high quality compared to others in Germany," says the ADFC members.
As an extremely critical danger site ADFC member Susanne is considering the situation in the Ascheröder Straße in Treysa.
There's no absconding on the Haat hill.
In the case of traffic, it may happen that bicycle drivers must wait in the middle of the road between side traffic flows," she explains.
This is not a problem for sports drivers, but for older people and especially for children.
Music Contest in the Cultural Station: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the Lake
The first call to the music contest was a success, creative and intertwined.
"D is a song for Hiltrup", says the call of the district offensive Hiltrup, in the "Music Contest for Large and Small, Young and Experienced Musicians".
A contest "with eyelids in the sympathetic helptruper family", as Karl Franke formulated.
In fact, it was soon a family meeting with coffee and cakes from the honorary officials of the cultural railway station.
Seven formations took place, from the one-man band to the large ensemble: Alvin Jasic with Pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long-lived albachtener in Hiltrup, nine of the "Hiltrup Star colours", three members and three generations of the families Trenkamp and Claus, an ensemble from the children's garden of Lummerland and finally Rick Weßling and the neighborhoods.
This contest, said Mayor Joachim Schmidt, was a novelty.
We haven't experienced this in other parts of the city.
Where did the textiles come from?
The Hiltruper Lake and the Marktallee were particularly frequently mentioned at the sites.
Rolf Ihmig wrote the Allee in his striking song "Kö von Hiltrup".
The cultural railway station was also honored.
It was always about the experience of each other in these places, especially at Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke experienced the short refurbishments with short interviews with the interpreters or clues to their creation.
It was learned from Humberg that he actually studied chemistry, but now he also teaches guitar.
From the sound technician Stefan Schemmelmann, Frank knew that he had recently appeared in Ludwigshafen - at a large event of BASF with Barclay James Harvest in the program.
And Alvin Jasic has placed everything on youtube.
"It's not about winning," Frank said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from the Hiltuper Gastronomy.
However, there was something special about the favorites of the jury - so that others can hear their songs.
An entire CD can be played by Alvin Jessica and his pianist Marcel Untied with sound technician Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Ihmig with his Hiltrup drummer, the Franke especially impressed with his musicality, and the "lummerland-Rudel": "a very beautiful performance" with ten children and two educators at guitar and Cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tolle.
Like all of them, the kids went to the finals once again - and even without electronic support, they sound "very good", as Franke said.
The jury was led by the originality of the aspects, reference to Hiltrup, the entrance of the melody and the value of recognition.
The jury included Gisbert Keller from the West Fälische Schule für Musik, Andreas Klomfaß from the KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the Economics Association as well as Jan Kaven, president of the district offensive.
The urban offensive had brought the event to life on account of its ten-year existence.
She valued the event as a complete success.
Everyone was "very satisfied", and "the atmosphere was good" in the soon very full cultural station.
The word to use: "decrypt" in the game
The players form two teams that meet each other.
For each side there is a visual display containing four cards with keywords that can only be deciphered when inserted - the old trick with the red foil.
In this way it is ensured that the opposite side can read nothing from memory.
Then on the cards stands for example, to read from left to right: "1. Renaissance.
2nd window.
3. Pumps.
4th party."
These are the terms that should be used to encrypt for the time being.
Because the terms should not be considered here, but codes.
By contrast, one player per team is the key.
He gets a code card that maybe "3.4.2." is on.
"Decrypto" should not be considered the terms behind the secret film, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case: He should describe - in this order and in this example - the terms "Twice", "Fest" and "Windows" - and in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team is not possible; for this wins the party if it manages to break the code twice.
Thus, the keykeeper notes and reads aloud: "Throw" for the cubes, "lose" as opposed to the party; of course, here would be as much possible as "party" and "Prag" because he's been watching the school and knows the window crash there.
That's how it goes round for rounds, team for team.
Although one does not know the terms of the opposite side, it can be better combined with any indication the cipher gives there.
Maybe mysterious, but not to be reversed, so the inscriptions should be, otherwise you make it unnecessary for his team.
Unfortunately, the most cryptost on "decrypto" is the rule.
The players are likely to have to study it for quite a long time and in detail until they can finally play.
The explanation video under decrypto.info on the network makes it easier.
But whoever has just released will be fascinated by how much feeling lies in this invisible game.
Overall, however, "decrypto" is not as crucial as predecessors and genre-primus "codenames", which also pushes an agent theme into a game of less words, but it is much better to play in small groups.
And who is only about advice and not about winning points, it can also easily find a version for two.
Kulbach: Man shows police Hitlergross and insults guests in the kneip
A 48-year-old man employed the police inspector Kulbach twice the night of Saturday on Sunday.
Only in the upper city did he show Hitler’s pride to a passing police force, and later he also fell into a trap in the upper city when he harassed other guests.
After he did not comply with the police's notice of alcoholism, he had to spend the night at the Kulbach Police Inspectorate in the prison cell.
In the immediate state, he must also be criminally liable for the use of signs of constitutionally opposed organizations.
Works Pressig was home to the school block
The railway operation in Pressig was the turntable in Frankenwald for decades.
In 1991 a piece of railway history ended.
"When buffers broke into buffers, you heard it all in the press," recalls Georg Dinkel, who records the history of the place and the railway station.
It didn't set anyone up.
The brakes were still still there, and the wagons were slammed.
It was just a railway.
Statements that make sense for thoughts at home.
Nowhere in Frankenwald was such a place marked by the railway.
Here was the starting point of the steep mountain range north, which, after an increase of about 220 meters, has its starting point in Steinbach am Forest.
In order to deal with this, earlier train and shoe blocks were needed, which had their home in the press.
In 1901 the Bavarian Landtag approved the construction of a railway workshop with 21 lokschuppen, teaching workshop, driving and train mastering.
"Herzsztück was the turning disc that after a conversion in 1899 had a diameter of 18 meters," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, railway historian and 47 years of professional travel.
From the railway works (BW) Pressig, which was signed in 1968 Bamberg, Loks was also operated for the adjacent Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalben.
On July 15, 1950, the "People's Sheet" reported a staff of 160 men; 13 steam- and eight Elloks were then stationed in press.
The electrification of the 1939 route has already minimized the need for train and school blocks.
Since 1977 they were only used in freight trains.
Up to 1991, at least 10,000 weights were ranked in the month.
In 1982, parts of the plant, the rest of 1991, were cut off.
Heidrich: "It is regrettable that you have not made better use of the site, even in the point of goods transport, in the eye".
Even at Pentecost 1989, the Nuremberg Railway Directorate celebrated the anniversary of "50 years of electrification Nuremberg - Saalfeld" in Pressig.
"There were 10,000 enthusiastic spectators here," recalls Georg Dinkel.
A little later.
On June 1, 1991, the last 30 men were withdrawn, the Ranger Station Pressig was history.
"The Rangers and Humschühlers did the most difficult work on the train," Dinkel recalls.
Any mishandling would have had fatal consequences.
Why the Pressig-Rothenkirchen Station has led to the conversion of the hierarchy of both places and many other historical and current images are found here in the infraredPlus article.
Kerber with performance success at China Open
Beijing (dpa) - Wimbledonsieger Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have reached the second round at the tennis tournament in Beijing as Julia Görges had previously.
Kerber defeated the Chinese Open 6:2, 6:2 against the Frenchman Kristina Mladenovic.
The next opponent of the World rankings is either Julia Putinzewa from Kazakhstan or the Spanish Carla Suárez Navarro.
Siegemund led 6:3, 4:2 against Darja Kassatkina, when the Russian assigned to number 13.
The Schwäbin now has to do with Anett Accountveit from Estonia.
As part of the "Art and Enjoy" series, a special exhibition was opened at the weekend in Midehrenbach.
With great relief, the eventers and visitors were looking at the ideal weather when the special display "Windspiel-Performance" was opened in the open area of the estate Dahlmann-Smidt, Mittehrenbach.
It takes place under the roof of the tourism club "Round around Walberla" in the "Art and Enjoy" series.
It opened its doors in the 15th year.
A great visitor's statement showed the fascination of the exhibition.
21 copies of 20 artists are now to be visited in central bank.
Hausser Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists to open the painting.
He's been doing it himself since the first hour.
Like Volker Hahn, who became the main organizer and artist in the same way.
A little surprised, however, Hahn announced his retreat a few days ago.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, however, he placed his task in proven, young hands with a good perspective for the future.
Both have already been active in the past in selecting artists and in designing flyers.
Also this year there is once again a 70-cent special letter brand designed by Kunst & Genuss, available at every art station.
There, too, this year's poster "Betzn Astanzen", by Volker Hahn, can be purchased for eight euros.
Hahn was pleased with the high commitment of the special exhibition.
For the musical framework Max Marcus Stadler could be won from Nuremberg.
When walking through the generous garden, the visitor will quickly find out that the title "windgame performance" formally challenges the artistic imagination and ultimately expresses it.
It is made of metal or ceramics, often with colored accents.
Already at the entrance of the presence, the visitor is expected on the right side of the "happy tree" by the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It is a tree trunk, colorfully lit, playful with 20 windmills, 24 Hufeisen and 24 Alu tubes provided as soundpiece.
With the sun shining through the bushwork in the background, the object seems to be maiming and invites to stay.
From Ekental comes Barbara Washneck, which is dedicated in three dimensional letters to the event 15 years K&G.
There are many parts in the wind in motion.
On the half-way Siegrid Frey from Eckental has exhibited her work "The Wind the Heavenly Child".
And at the end of the area, Folker Hahn shows his colorful fantasy paintings of tone, cement and stainless steel.
The theme "Windspiel-Performance" is to slide through the diverse art exhibition.
The special exhibition can be visited until 31 December 2018.
50 years MGV 68 Albacht: Singers celebrate 50th birthday party
1968 - that was the time of the protest and the student movement.
And at that time the followers of Al-Masjid-al-Haram (the pious - see V. 2:105).
At least five of them.
They didn't want to find out everywhere that after the dissolution of the church choir "Cécilia" there should be no more singing life in the area.
It has now become a legend: At a bank in the Tinnenbusch, they lifted the MGV 68 Albachts from the baptism.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary was celebrated large in the "House of Meeting".
"It will be full today," said President Jürgen Holstige, and he should keep right.
150 guests there was a real success for the Albanian singer.
It was for the anniversary that they had reinvigorated the foundational feast.
For years it was a tradition, then there was only one break.

Volleyball: 3. League of Women: USC II wins high-class derby against BW Aase
The elevator marches.
Three games, three wins - the reserve of the USC Münster under the control of Axel Büring is right right in Liga three.
No trace of scheu or fracks sauces, the independent do their thing.
And that's good at 3:0 (25:15, 25:23, 26:24) against the city rival BW Aasee.
"That wasn't clear, but we've already left the impression," says the somewhat satisfied trainer.
BWA-Coach Kai Annacker immediately obliged him: "This is a defeat with which we can live very well.
We are not unhappy." On the contrary.
In the evening at a subsequent birthday party of Ronja de Boer, the mood was good, the game was cut off.
Yes, the result is actually an optical deception.
In the third sentence, the guests had a satzball.
"If they bring it to the goal, such a game can be played once," Büring knows from years of experience.
Finally, the USC with its routine forces made everything clear and brought the full exploitation to the goal.
"We all know who's in such a derby on the other side.
That doesn't break our genetics.
I have gradually seen quite good volleyball," Annacker did not have the 0:3 - and immediately went over to the agenda.
Where the trip goes for the independent, it does not seem noticeable after just three playing days.
"It's too early for that," says Axel Büring.
Only in one feels he confirms: "The third league has an incredibly good level.
This is not nearly comparable with Regionalliga volleyball."In the fourth league, they do not want to take their views down any further.
If the west isn't contaminated in the next few weeks, they have to look up.
However, a first balance can only be drawn after ten or eleven parties.
On Saturday, it'll only go to Emlichheim.
Aasee will be in Essen on 14 October.

About her marriage to Hans from Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
On the dream ship Heide Keller became the star.
Now she openly says that the series could have been guilty of her marriage to Hans of Borsody.
Her role as headmaster Beatrice of Ledebur on the "Treamship" made Heide Keller (76), but on January 1, 2018 she went on board forever.
The series that she left for the star could be co-responsible for her failed marriage to Hans of Borsody (1929 - 2013), with which she had been married for ten years.
"That could also have been a reason.
Because I was raised with this work, traveled alone with a suitcase around the world, and many of my admired colleagues took me for granted," Keller told me in a conversation with the "Image on Sunday".
At first, she was always only "the wife of Hans of Borsody", but that changed with the dream ship.
Because now the journalists only called at Heide Keller.
"If he liked it so well, I don't know."
She considers it possible that her husband at the time might have been quite necessary, but "how many men also shot Hans's conversation about problems and feelings".
Keller has always tried for Hans of Borsody "to be the only right person and he wanted to know my fears, not my weaknesses.
That means good German: I understood," she further explained.
She always felt like, "not good enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman who I was never really, even though I sometimes appeared on stage rude and courageous.
I wanted our love to be forever."
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller once again said yes, "although I was afraid that it might happen again a second time".
On the day before the official wedding, I sat quietly in the wardrobe and wanted to give up everything.
The marriage of Borsody also broke up.
Why didn't it ever hit the men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller showed love at the time "as in the film.
Unfortunately, this vision is not daily.
I'm too naive to go to love."
The nightfaller, who regularly explores the nightlife of the city in the NZZ resort Zurich, has this time stood up to the ZFF opening party.
Our trap is not a motte, but a little light.
And the gray glow in which a green carpet is dipped on the sex screen blinds it over the fee.
But it is still film festival, where more or less famous people want to be sunflowered.
So on this late Thursday evening, he wanders over the place to make it easier in the Aquaclean-WC-Oase.
This is what is called the public toilet facility sponsored by a large sanitary company, which celebrates its premiere at the festival: The need facility in the partnership of a new pavilion has a lot of work to do to foster a luxurious environment.
On this evening, however, it stinks in the Lord's Oasis for some reason.
So get out here, across the other side of the street: Glady guests who have just held the opening film "Green Book" in the cinema next to the best level celebrate the start of the festival every year with a party in the three-stop shop.
His name fits perfectly to this film festival: The works shown are known to come from all over the world.
What should not be allowed to interfere with an article about this festival in order not to fall into auction for its 190 partner companies.
The fold binds a band around the sensors that gave him a good foot, and two bullish doorkeepers are actually kicking him in a generous way.
In the middle of the night, the chargers are forced to dance far after midnight to live music or can be presented by DJ rhythms to which they cry each other, and wash exquisite hippies down with Cüpli.
In the delicate shop in the basement, Austria waits for sparkling lips, next to which the unparalleled raw sugar Culatello di Zibello is freshly cut, a chocolate fountain is gushing.
And the hammer is: All the sales rules are full of exclusive products have not been cleared for the occasion.
That's how it's been for years, so it seems without a big loss to work.
You must love this country!
The folder studies the shield at the escalator: "Put on a long dress, please be careful on the escalator".
If these two are separate instructions, he's gone to the dress code.
But it is rather a conditional construction, and it has saved some lives.
In the upper floor of the department of household goods, the bird picks up a cocktail prepared by Espresso called "Golden Eye", suitable for the festival award.
The price for the best drink is not compulsory for this mix, with which a capsule manufacturer presents itself.
And George Clooney, who's been working for the promised brand for years, isn't here at night either.
However, between local prominence, cassette and kitchen articles, there is a face that appears to the observer: Peter Farrelly, the director of the opening film.
It should not be far from his main contractor.
And really: Just like Viggo Mortensen, with almost sixty functioning like a chorus, walks through the crowd.
He won't get hurt, he won't get caught, he won't steal the most.
Just for this detention, like to be misunderstood as hypocrisy, international stars love this film festival.
Maradona celebrates victory in Mexico with Cumbia dances
Trainer and former football star Diego Maradona is delighted with the victory of his team.
Argentina's football legend Diego Maradona seems to have been well-informed in his new home Mexico.
After a 2:0 victory of his club Dorados de Sinaloa, the 57-year-old coach danced with a player in the cabin at Cumbia rhythms, as seen in a video already published on Saturday.
In the 15-second clip of a team member, Maradona dances in the yellow triangle, fuelled by the players.
The Mexican Second Light had won the Liones Negros with 2:0 on Saturday.
After the game, Maradona called in a TV camera "Always with my boys, always".
The 57-year-old is training the Mexican club since the beginning of September.
Handball: Bondsliga 1: USA Send to Last-Minute-Pleite "to the ground destroyed"
Swen Bieletzki, coach of the U.S. Handball League Lister, could hardly take it: "So a bitter defeat." His guards were "destroyed on the ground" after the unfortunate 29:30 (12:14) - Pleite - the fourth in the fourth game - on Saturday night at LIT Germany 2.
They had not played bad, as in Steinhagen, as against Hüllhorst, over many phases, the transmitters.
Only the initial phase "we've completely slept", the U.S. trainer was upset.
Soon the houseowners led with 8:1 even the early time that Bieletzki had taken did not fruit first.
"But then suddenly a back went through the team," Bieletzki joined the second quarter hour.
For a break the remaining was only two doors.
In particular, the Best Mission, Marius Hintze, met at the stage about another time.
After the change, it became even better from the visitor's point of view.
After 33 minutes, David Ernst left at 15:15, then the staff changer almost passed.
Four minutes before the siren, the lead was still apparently relaxing three hits (29:26).
And then?
The Unpartisans take part in the events.
Bieletzki usually avoids looking for fault with others.
But: The 120-second time penalty that Steffen Mühloff dropped, "was a joke".
LIT had a good laugh and met four more times until the end - while the decimated U.S. also broke in the last attack.
The boys fought great, even behind them stood well against seven men and threw them on the empty gate all the time.
Only they can buy little for the compliments.
"Now a damn victory has to come," said the restless servant Bieletzki.
U.S. Tower: Nineth (9), Ernst (6), Schlagl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühloff (2), van de Paul (2).

Bayern: Woman missing for 30 years - Police digs by body parts
More than 30 years after the disappearance of an 18-year-old from Naila (Landkreis Hof), the police are looking for the dead remains of the woman.
On Saturday at Marxgrün, employed forces dig up a road.
In this regard, the road cover and several layers have been laid down, as the police and public prosecutors have jointly communicated.
According to new findings, missing persons may not have been buried far from their place of residence at that time.
The woman has disappeared since 4 November 1986.
At that time, the investigators did not exclude a crime.
Since last year, the criminal police have been working closely with the state prosecutor again in the case.
Together with scientists at the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian Memorial Office, the investigators stood on a level radar on the street near Marxgreen.
With the help of a dog trained on the smell of human bones, the officials limited the place to a few meters.
The results of the excavations should be announced during the afternoon.
The hacker attack on millions of Facebook users shows what dangers lie in the network.
However, users can also provide additional security.
Instead of complicated letters, users should use preferred passphrases to secure their accounts on the network.
In addition, security updates, such as for Windows, should be installed immediately, and it also does not harm to equip computers with anti-virus protection.
Elon Musk, the founder of the Tesla electric car manufacturer, has been removed as the head of the billions of heavy companies.
He and the U.S. stock exchange supervisor SEC extrajudicially contributed to a legal dispute over misleading Twitter news in which Musk could have lost permission to run listed companies.
As part of the comparison, Musk and Tesla pay every 20 million dollars, and Musk gives off for three years the office of the Chairman, a position comparable to that of the German Supervisory Board.
On the other hand, he may remain the head of the board.
In the comparison, which neither must be confirmed by a court, neither musc nor Tesla's misconduct was allowed.
The SEC had complained to the world-famous manager before the U.S. Federal Court of Manhattan about fraud.
Musk, also presented by SpaceX, is the public face of the lost electric car pioneer who is currently rated at the stock exchange with more than $50 billion.
Musk is not guilty
Musk explained that he had done nothing wrong and was sad and disappointed about the complaint.
He has always acted in the sense of truth, transparency and investors.
On August 7, Musk wrote his more than 22 million Twitter followers, he might take the company from the stock exchange and pay $420 per share to secure the financing.
This would have cost Tesla a total of $72 billion.
Later on, the musc reinvigorated: Tesla stays at the stock exchange.
After the agreement, Tesla now has to find a Chairman from outside, appoint two independent board members and set up a committee to monitor muscle communication.
Football: Sturridge Rescued Liverpool: Klop Team 1:1 at FC Chelsea
The FC Liverpool came to a 1:1 at FC Chelsea.
In the top game at FC Chelsea, the trainer Jürgen Klopp just provided an inverse attacker in the 89th minute for the 1:1 (0:1).
After six wins to start, Liverpool fell back to place two.
Chelsea stays third, the new knight is Manchester City.
In the 25th minute, Eden Hazard took care of the Chelsea leadership with his sixth season meeting.
After that, the Klop team missed the compensation several times.
National player Antonio Rüdiger explained after a solo by Liverpool's Torjäger Mohamed Salah on the line (31.).
Shortly before closing, Sturridge released the reds with a slender in the corner.
Recordmaster Manchester United has been working ever deeper into the crisis since the worst start of the season since 1989.
The team of the contested coach José Mourinho at West Ham United deserves 1:3 (0:2) and only remains with ten points after seven days in the middle of the table.
The pressure on Mourinho will continue to grow before the Champions League match on Tuesday against the FC Valencia.
The former Leverkusen-Torhüter Bernd Leno came after an injury from Petr Cech to his first Premier League.
In front of the Champions League game in 1899 Hoffenheim won Manchester City on Tuesday through Gate of Raheem Sterling (29th) and Sergio Agüero (65th) 2:0 against Brighton&Hove Albion.
Leroy Sané prepared the 1:0, Ilkay Gündogan did not use the new top rider.

Joachim Llambi must have separated himself from his wife Ilona.
The dance expert was known by the RTL show "Let's Dance".
After 13 years of marriage Joachim Llambi (54) and his wife Ilona (45) are now separated.

Enquiries: 46 percent do not want Merkel as chancellor until 2021
After the sources of the last few weeks, the GroKo will drop several survey bottoms.
The SPD is in a survey behind the AfD - Angela Merkel is seen critically.
Berlin - The AfD first captured the SPD in the Emnid Sunday trend for the picture on Sunday.
In the weekly survey of the Opinion Research Institute, the AfD adds a count to 17 percent, the SPD gives a point in comparison with the previous week and ends at 16 percent.
CDU and CSU also lose a counter and only get 27 percent.
This is the lowest value for the Union so far in the Sunday trend.
Greens reach 15 percent, left 11 and FDP 10 percent.
On Sunday's federal election, the government parties SPD, CDU and CSU would receive only 43% of the votes together, according to Emnid.
Thus, the great coalition has lost the majority in the Sunday question at all major research institutes - with the exception of Allensbach.
The government parties reach 43% to 45% of the votes (Allesbach: 51%).
At the 2017 federal election, they received 53.4 percent.
For the other parties, the bandwidth is also large: the AfD, in several surveys the second-largest party, is 15 to 18 percent.
Greens reach voting rates from 12.5 to 17 percent.
The left is on average 10 percent, FDP 9 percent.
For statistical reasons, such polls have an uncertainty of 2 to 3 per cent up and down depending on the vote.
But also the detention of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in the population has been significantly reduced since the federal election in 2017.
Currently, only 48 percent of the citizens find Merkel is the right person in the office, as Emnid's inquiry on behalf of the BamS came to light.
Only every second (50 percent) wishes the survey today that the large coalition holds up to the next regular federal election in three years, 41 percent are for a new election.
In a further survey published on Saturday, there were also significant awards of popularity for brand.
The Germans also assessed whether Merkel should again be running for the CDU presidency in December.
47 per cent are according to Emnid, 44 per cent on the other hand.
As a result, 64% do not wish for a candidate, 35%.
Absence at Aldi: Reduced price for love happiness
Does Aldi become Tinder 2.0?
Who says that in times of Tinder there are no more romantic acquaintances stories - that should be discussed with Aldi on Puten meat.
Munich - In times of digital "Fastfood dating" through Tinder and Co., the supermarket as a know-how place for great love almost turns out to be anachronistic romance.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced cane meat, boxer short snacks on the wharf table or the favorite pudding is in doubt still a better story for the later single children than a simple swivel to the right.
The App Tinder is called to be less a contact, but rather a sleek stock exchange.
We have warned the test: How do women react, but in the first message they don't talk about the hot width for long?
Here's the amazing result.
The right-wing Hollywood Lovestory potential has then been provided with an out-of-the-eye lost-and-recovery plot.
If the type is also registered under the e-mail address bio-puttenfleisch@gmx.de with its suppliers, then it sounds very good after Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and consorts - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
In this way, the author of this ad in an unknown Aldi branch is to wish that she will also find her dreamer, with whom she has had a short time about the "30 percent bio-reduced Puten meat".
For her belief in the magic of analog learning, she earned her Happy End à la Hollywood anyway.
Picerbeck: 500 covers for a life without paragliding
Since the beginning of the new school year, the Ludger School has been participating in the action "Coffel v. Polio - 500 Coffel for a life without child injury".
Polio is the abbreviation for poliomyelitis, a disease caused by polio.
The disease referred to in German as child leprosy leads to death from leprosy.
In Germany, polio is considered extinct, but there are three other countries around the world in which the disease occurs.
The cause of poliomyelitis, the polio, can only be suppressed by vaccines, as is the case in a press release.
Football: Reus and Zorc demand rest for Gods
Leverkusen (dpa) - BVB Sports Director Michael Zorc and Captain Marco Reus have called for an end to the public debate on Mario Götze's form and fitness.
"We should stop thinking about Mario.
That's not good for the boy.
And that's not good for us," said the giant who was friends with God after the 4:2 victory in Leverkusen at the TV show Sky.
Zorc had already stressed before the game.
For him personally, this is not a simple situation.
Football: Eberl: No eye when negotiating with Hecking
Mönchengladbach (dpa) - Manager Max Eberl of the Football Bundesligist Borussia Mönchengladbach does not see any signs of possible extension of the contract with Trainer Dieter Hecking.
We have not yet talked about a treaty.
There's no fixed date when we do that.
"But it will certainly give us the moment where we sit and talk," Eberl said on Sunday evening in the TV channel Sky.
Football: District League: Researchers' appearance of the VfL Wolbeck against the SC Altenrheine makes courage
There were moments in this still young season when Alois Fetsch went to court with his hard-heartedness.
Wordscarg he gave himself to the coach of the football district director VfL Wolbeck, only (insidely) withdrew to meditate on the lack of performance on the green.
It's all history.
In the meantime it's running around the Brandhoveway again.
Taufrischer Beleg is the 1:1 on Sunday against the SC Alterrehine, in the past season only skin thin on the rise.
Yeah, I'm very happy with the performance.
"We made the rooms tight and put pressure on the ball.
This could be seen," Fetsch praised his boys and looked up every single one of them to say "thank you" just for so much opposition against the ambitious guests.
The coach had to make a system switch after 26 minutes.
After the injury of Nico Frerichs (muscular problems) - for him came Luca Rehberg - it almost ran smoothly from the 4-4-2 into a 4-2-3-1, in which Niklas Thewes waited in front of the balls.
Wolbeck had significantly more play parts in the first section.
And chances.
But Frerichs before his ex (17th), the changed Luca Rehberg (26th) and Jan Schroer (38th) missed the lead.
Almost would have imagined this when the SCA in minutes 41 twice in person by Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbäumer appeared dangerously in front of the Wolbecker box - Tormann Damian Hallas proved to be the master of his trade.
After the break, the VfL took full control.
Thewes of 18 meters barely broke.
Schroer also came too late after 58 minutes at the time of thewes.
With the replacement of Miles Geske, Fetsch missed the left side again a fresh cell course.
When old-fashioned Chris Naberbäumer fell in the 70th minute Robin Westhouse, 18 meters before the guesthouse there was an indirect free pass for the locals.
The Foulte himself attacked and demonstrated its danger with standards.
Westhouse's thing with the right shoulder struck at the bottom left from the point of view of the shield - 1:0 (71.).
20 minutes to be damned.
And then this: VfL-Captain Florian Quabeck flew the leather in the 80th minute unfortunately to the hand.
Judge Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the point.
Jannis Schneider did not leave the gift (79.).
Bange minutes had to pass Wolbeck in the final phase before Geske in the 87th minute of 12 meters but still had the victory hit on the rifle.
Maybe it would have been too much of a good thing.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75th Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26th L. Rehberg), Westhouses, Vielmeyer (66th Geske) - Thewes

Entrance Frankfurt wins 4:1 against Hanover 96
Baseline: Four points after five days - this was not possible for Coach Adi Hütter.
In response to Hanover 96, Entrecht Frankfurt finally wanted to ensure the first home victory.
Stormer Ante Rebic, who was first injured in the beginner, should help.

Hubscrew in Kottingbrunn
At the landing, there was an accident at the airport.
The four insatisfactions were easily injured.
At 2:00 p.m. on Sunday at the airport in Kottingbrunn, there was a drama.
At the landing of a helicopter, there were turbulences as confirmed by the police against oe24.
The heli was captured by a windbow, hit the ground and came to rest side by side.
Immediately police, rescue and firearms were identified.
With a big offer, the forces came to the scene of the accident.
The ÖAMTC notary screwdriver was also called for caution.
Insets only slightly injured
Luckily, everything turned out to be largely unharmed.

Report by the Allbright Foundation: Women in business councils remain rare
Thus, only 8 percent of the presidents were female until 1 September, as the report entitled "The Power of Monoculture" presented officially by the Allbright Foundation this Monday and submitted to the German Press Agency.
"The companies will have to behave differently, otherwise the international competitors will move over them," said Founding Business Manager Wiebke Ankersen.
In the United States, the United Kingdom or Sweden, only male management teams - with few exceptions - can no longer be thought of.
The remainder makes the German competitors less diverse, innovative and future-oriented.
It's another corporate culture.
The small increase in women's share among German stock exchange companies is also due to positive incentives for medium-sized enterprises (MDax).
Even according to Allbright data, only 6.8 percent of the board members are female.
However, in the previous year the value was still 3.8%.
In the 30 Dax companies - in the previous years, the women's share was stagnated.
At last 26 women worked in the boards.
"I am sure that the Dax companies will recruit consistent women again next year - in their own interest," Ankersen said.
The only RWE and Heidelberg Cement had signaled that they would not continue to commit themselves to increasing the share of "zero percent" so far.
Another picture is found in the Supervisory Boards: On 1 September, the women's share was 30.5 percent - 45 women more and 68 men less than a year ago.
"If you recruited as many women for the board every year, 40 percent would have been reached by 2023," says the report.
Some even make mises: Luxury cars: Which manufacturer deserves most per car?
Ferrari deserves the best.
The Italians take 280,000 euros with each Ferrari sold and make 69,000 euros operating profits.
Big cars, big profits: This slogan still applies - in most cases.
Who makes the most gain per cart among the noble-supply suppliers.
Munich - Ferrari, Maserati, Bentley: How much are the luxury manufacturers per car they sell?
With this question, "Autopapst" and economic professor Ferdinand Dudenhöffer have been involved.
His study shows that the differences are massive.
Ferrari made its first half of the year with each car sold 69,000 euros operating profit - Jaguar Land Rover, on the other hand, only about 800 euros, Tesla and Bentley are very strong at every car.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are well in the race with prices ranging from 33,000 to 38,000 euros per car and about 3,000 euros before interest and taxes EBIT.

Falcon to open the 60th wine festival
With a faux train, the foreign transport association opened its wine festival session in Abtswind.
For 60th time, the association will set out the wine festivals, which will take place every Saturday in October at the big feast on the Rehweiler Street.
At the start of the anniversary, the responsible men went through the place to the fortress under the sounds of the playwright from Wiesenbronn.
In the already self-fulfilled fortress, the president of the Association of Foreign Transport, Wolfgang Starz, Mayor Jürgen Schulz and Princess Lisa Kursawe welcomed the guests. "60 years of doing something like this - this is a crazy performance for a small town with 800 inhabitants.
You can be proud of that," said Starz to all the helpers.
The wine princess Lisa II later came symbolically with the guests from the stage.
"It's nice that so many have found the way to us again after the wind is gone." Later, "The Troglauder" gave way to mood.
On Sunday, which was also celebrated by the Abtswinder Kirchweih, the association for the occasion of the anniversary had set the drinking prices as 60 years ago in the afternoon.
A festival evening for the 60th wine festival will take place on Friday, October 5, in the guest's house, before a day later in the feast goes into the second round.
In Bonn: Notarztauto power in Taxi
A notary car is badly damaged next to a road.
In the collision of the vehicle with a taxi, a 27-year-old passenger was killed.
When notaries are called, they should help - save the best lives of people.
Such a rescue journey took place in Bonn a deadly end for a 26-year-old.
Bonn - A 26-year-old pedestrian was killed in Bonn during the collision with a taxi.
The taxi driver, the notary and their driver were seriously injured, as the police reported.
The 46-year-old driver of the Notarzttoo had passed a red lamp on Saturday afternoon with Blaulicht and Martinshorn.
He then boarded a cruise with the taxi that drove at Green.
After the collision, the doctor slid against an ampelmast and a tree.
He picked up the passant who died in the accident.
Driver of the notary and taxi driver seriously injured
The 62-year-old taxi driver and the driver of the car were seriously injured in their vehicles and had to be released from the operating forces.
Also, the 29-year-old sufferer was able to free himself, but she was unable to help.
Another experienced notary tried this - but without success.
The three serious injuries were brought to hospitals.
The police, in close agreement with the Bonner Public Prosecutor, determine who is responsible for the accident.
Manchester United loses again, for Maurinho we find it uncomfortable
After the Blamable Out in the Ligacup Manchester United is now also lost in the 7th round of the Premier League.
Against West Ham United is subject to ManU 1:3. The way of defeat should still be discussed.
The scene was meaningful in the 74th minute, in which the reborn Marko Arnautovic shot the 3:1 for West Ham; only three minutes after Marcus Rashford had allegedly brought the Red Devils back to play.
Since they suspected an offshore pass by Mark Nobel, all of Manchester's opponents remained, and Arnautovic left the ball at David de Gea's without help.
This was the negative point of an already far-reaching lack of performance.
It's quite different at the moment.
The citizens trained by Maurinho's great competitor Pep Guardiola came against Brighton & Hove Albion to an undamaged 2:0 victory.
After half an hour, Raheem Sterling broke through for the home team for the first time.
Sergio Agüero made sure after a good hour and a double pass with the former torso for securing the sixth victory in the seventh game, thus also for the jump to the table top.
Liverpool no longer a table leader
Three days after the 1:2 defeat at the League Cup, Xherdan Shaqiri fought with Liverpool in the Premier League an 1:1 against Chelsea.
Like at the Cup-Aus, the Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man in London.
The 27-year-old hit in the 25th minute remained until the final phase of the only hit of the game.
Shaqiri, who came to the field in the 66th minute for Mohamed Salah, missed the compensation after 70 minutes.
It was better done by Daniel Sturridge in the 89th minute with his Schlenzer.
So after the reds were started with a smooth balance of the week, Chelsea was not to be beaten for the second time.
First, the Londoners eliminated the team of Jürgen Klopp in the Cup, then through the Remis in the League, the Blues Liverpool now also collapsed from the table top.
Like City, the two London City Clubs Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford) also celebrated 2:0 victory.
The fans of the Gunners who played Granit Xhaka, however, had to endure the surprise team from the Hertfordshire County until the 81st minute of success.
Nine minutes before the end, Watford defender Craig Cathcart knocked on a door of Alex Iwobi unfortunately to his own door, just two minutes later Messut Özil and his third season hit the decision.
Arsenal went through the fifth victory in the wake of Watford and is back immediately behind the great rival Tottenham on rank 5. A strong impression continues to leave up Wolferhampton under his Portuguese coach Espirito Santo.
At 2:0 against Southampton in the League, the Wolves remained unbeatable for the fifth time and held the 8th place.
VW core brand missing: Pariser Automobile Salon in sign of Diesel debate
The Paris Automobile Salon takes place every two years in exchange with the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially no topic and yet quite general: the Diesel Candal and the ring for bans and equipment should not be released by the German Autogroup even when meeting the industry in Paris.
At the 2018 Automobile Salon, they show their news from next week together with the competition from all over the world in the French capital.
Diesel doesn't really play a big role anymore.
However, the possible exchange and transfer offers for Diesel Owners in Germany, which are still to be negotiated with the government in Berlin, should be at least an important topic behind the brilliant scenes of the fairs.
A great name is missing in Paris: The Volkswagen Group is with Audi, Porsche and other daughters, but not with the core brand VW itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are there and have, among other things, their first pure electromodels: the e-tron of Ingolstadter is to come to the market at the end of the year, the EQC of Stuttgart 2019.
Both were officially presented.
The next one from BMW is due to start in 2021.
The new 3rd is centrally located in Paris.
A total of more than 250 exhibitors are represented this year from 4 to 14 October.
In addition to car groups, motorcyclists as well as numerous mobile and software providers are present in their own rooms.
The fair, which celebrates its 120th birthday this year, takes place every two years in exchange with the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016 a million visitors were well received.
In the severe earthquakes and the following tsunamis, at least 380 people died on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Dozens are still missing.
In addition, there are more than 500 injured.
The island was shaken by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first wave had the strength 5,9 and the second had the strength 7,4.
Communication and transport connections are damaged, enormous damage has occurred.
The Tsunami broke into the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal town of Palu, hundreds gathered at the beach for a party.
It is feared that the sacrifices will still go up significantly.
So far, the numbers have only come from Palu.
However, there are also many other municipalities - along Sulawesis West coast.
Some 150 bikers celebrate God’s service in Verdohl
Motorcycle Pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated the final service for the motorcyclists in the Church of Peace in Eveking on Sunday.
Werdohl - The place before the Peace Church in Eveking belonged to the motorcyclists on Sunday.
At the same time, the final Goddess service for the bikers was on the program.
Frank Schröder is the Motor Pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and thus responsible for the soul-surgical importance of the PS-strong two-wheeler.
Between April and September, on the last Sunday of a month, the traditional motorbike service (MoGo) will always take place at the house Nordhelle.
The end of the season is traditionally celebrated by the bikers in the Church of Peace in Eveking.
There, about 150 bikers gathered there on Sunday to do anything but God’s service.
From 10 a.m., the bolides were set up in front of the church entrance gate.
First, the biker breakfasts stood on the program and it was possible to be strengthened with coffee and cakes or even with a delicate currywurst.
In addition to the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach, were also among them.
During the biker good service, the sermon was held by Pope Dirk Grzegorek.
The singer-songwriter Valerie Lill provided for the musical understatement.
"Although the biker prefers the Blues-Rock, Valerie Lill prefers poetic and quiet sounds," said Father Frank Schröder.
This too was certainly a novel in the history of the Motorcycle Goddess Service yesterday.
Weighttorfer Heimatverein celebrates a great feast: After the apple comes the milk
And also on the actual day of action, Borisch was active.
She provided her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg was also of great interest.
He had his apple press in his pocket and showed his stupendous viewers step by step the process from mature apple to apple juice.
Then and when Hartmann-Niemerg left the children the field and let them fill the apples in the great drawers.
With a little muscle strength, the apples became a finely trimmed mass.
Still, not many of the children could imagine how a delicious drink should be made.
However, this important step also allowed them to take a look at this late Friday afternoon.
Packed in shapes and covered with nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked the slightly hazelnut apple pieces layer for layer.
Thanks to some technical support, the last step of work was no longer so difficult.
The freshly pressed juice went into a large vessel.
However, the farmer also had already completed specialties.
Thus he opened his "schatzboxe" and presented the older visitors with the latest feathers whites.
The demand for the good drop "Made in Füchttorf" was great.
In a cozy atmosphere, the parents came to the conversation, while the children could not only follow the apple press process, but also the built-in Hüpfburg discovered for themselves.
Also the assets of the Wechttorfer comradeship of former soldiers engaged in the party and invited some stations to play for a while.
Also in the coming year, the home association will offer an action day.
However, as Gregor stressed, Krützkamp will not be the home in the heart of the savings village of the place of the event.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also due to the topic on hand: then it will go around the milk.
1:4 against Frankfurt: Hannover with the Fourth Seasonal Pleite: "Sudden situation"
Frankfurt/Main After the fourth Bundesliga defeat, Coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed professional from Hanover 96 and spoke to them courageously.
However, many positives were not seen at 1:4 (0:2) of the last table at the event in Frankfurt.
"It's a fucked-up situation, but you have to get out of there as a team," said 96-footballprofi Príncipe Schwegler and went on to say, "It's of course disappointing, because you always get a lot ahead of yourself."
The further secluded Lower Saxonys, for which only Florent Muslija (86.) joined, are down with two counters and are a candidate for retirement in their current constitution.
On the other hand, as mentioned by ante Rebic, Frankfurt celebrated the first season home victory.
Evan Obite Nicka, in the 36th minute, Rebic (45+1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59th) and Luka Jovic (89th), before 46,300 spectators reached the door for the DFB-Pocal winner, who, following the successful general test for the European League game against Lazio Rome with seven points in the middle field of the table.
Croatia's Vize-Worldmaster Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous offensive of the Hessen and never got caught by Hanover's defense.
The storms that followed the WM long showed with its pace and capacity for implementation, why it was so valuable for the event.
In addition to Rebic, the Brazilian Allan loaned by the FC Liverpool was the first time in the early formation of the Frankfurters, which began smoothly.
One of Lucas Torró's headballs on the tower brought danger for the first time.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was stopped at the last moment of the 96-war around the Brazilian Felipe, who replaced Kevin Wimmer (Rücken) in the short term.
The leadership for the houseowners fell almost compulsorily and fully deserved.
Filip Kostic picked up the ball after a protected corner in the Strafraum, Haller extended by head before the door where Ndicka only needed to keep his foot.
It was the first federal match for the French second-class opponent AJ Auxerre in the summer.
And Frankfurt remained before the break.
This time Haller fit his storm partner Rebic, who could think through and 96-Torwart Michael Esser did not leave a chance.
In the mid-term, Hanover-Coach Breiterer responded to the weak image of his Elf and brought two new offensive forces to Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt.
The Lower Saxonys now played something more courageous forward, but burning ideas remained out until shortly before the end of the attack.
The Hesses were much more efficient.
After a short hour, Rebic started a solo and then placed a cross on De Guzmán, who had to push the ball just into the empty gate.
The rest was only for the Frankfurters against overreached guests, and Jovic also met a minute before the end.
Morlaix Square Becomes Party Mile
Würselen Despite cold temperatures, good mood prevailed at the October party in the city centre.
The Munich Mayor Dieter Reiter created it before a million people when he opened 185.
Munich Wies'n last week with two hits.
Geisingen: Geisinger Christian Celebrations Holy Cross-Fest
The Geisinger Catholics celebrate the Holy Cross festival on September 14th or Sunday thereafter.
The feast service takes place in the City Church, then is a procession to the Holy Cross Church with the final blessing.
The Holy Cross Church is home to the wounded Christ who comes from the war of the 30th year and is supposed to have shot the legend after a Swedish soldier.
Then blood flowed out of the gunshot wound.
From this a great welcome developed to the shot Christ, who then also led to the construction of the Holy Cross Church.
This is not finished until today, only the old room stands, the missing longhouse is indicated by the trees.
In his sermon, Pope Adolf Buhl reminds us that the cross is a sign of hope, comfort and life.
Despite the importance of the Geisinger parish, the ministry was bad.
After the service of God the procession took place to the church of the Holy Cross and with the conclusion the church was finished.
For many years the Catholic Church has been inviting still to the world part of the festival to the Catholic parish.
The members of the choir provided the visitors with warm meals and a wide selection of cakes and the weather adapted, farm.
In the afternoon, the parishioner also offered guides around the city church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmidt-Best informed visitors on behalf of the parish about the damage to facade, roof, sandstones and windows, as well as the forthcoming construction measures that will continue until next year.
After the storm has been in place for some time, the damage could be determined more precisely and the individual tenders were more specifically prepared.
It is certain that the renovation is more expensive than planned, because the damage already existing several years ago has become larger, but it has also been more determined, which was only possible by the appearance of the eye through the storm.
The socks are finished, before winter is still to begin with the natural stone works, and we hope that half of these works can be completed this year.
Dedication: New residence in the Neu-Ulmer Münsterblügstraße
Donau-Iller's life support opens up a new residence for disabled people in Münster.
The fact that "a very special house" is now handed over in the Münster Blüblübstraße - that is where all those present agreed at the time of the dedication.
Finally, the 12 wheelchair drivers who have been living in Donau-Iller's residence for some time have been dedicated to the special architecture of the new building.
Wider corridors, floors and doors, larger rooms and barrier-free access for all areas have been taken into account by architect Rudolf Bader in his concept.
The first plans began about eight years ago when the former U.S. Army military building was put to the test for the residents with the phonecap: "The house had come into the years and no longer been equipped on time," Bader said in a retrospective way.
In 2016, the bakers called to demolish the house.
The new building should be made as friendly and bright as possible so that its inhabitants can feel well, says the architect.
Life support Donau-Iller opens new residence
Around €4.6 million was spent on life support in the new building.
The state of Fres state spent 2.4 million euros, the province of Swaben 450000 euros.
According to Architect Bader, the construction works remained within the planned framework - both time and financial.
He was also grateful to the manager for his life support, Jürgen Heinz.
The spagat between a barrier-free and at the same time fire-proof construction has not always been easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen had set up a home with the many standards that would allow the inhabitants to experience freedom to move even without foreign help.
Similarly, the head of the Social Administration of the Schwaben District, Gertrud Kreutmayer, said: "The house focuses on the special needs of its inhabitants who need the means to be mobile".
The habit and functionality have been well combined, Kreutmayer said.
And further: "The property in this situation is a real fortune, because it is no longer to be acquired in the present situation".
Overall, the new residence on the Münsterblüblstrasse offers a space of almost 1500 square meters for 30 people with disabilities, which are divided into three housing groups.
Pride is the life-help business leader Heinz to the eleven full-time forces who are all employed by tariff.
Germany: Swiss complaining differences between East and West
Berlin - Prior to the day of the unity, SPD Vice-President Manuela Schwesig appealed to all the people of the country not to deal with the disadvantage of East German.
There are differences that hurt unit after almost 30 years.
With these differences we cannot satisfy ourselves," said Mecklenburg-Vorpommern's Prime Minister to the "day mirror on Sunday".
The goal must remain to create the same living conditions throughout the country.
It is unacceptable that East Germans worked on average longer than people in West Germany, but 15 percent less.
"I can't explain this to anyone almost 30 years after the German unit," Schwesig said.
North Korea: Does this powerful dog end the Korean conflict?
The one-year Pungsan-Jagdund is supposed to smooth the roads between the two Koreans.
In an effort to relax relations with Seoul, Pjöngang has made his gift to South Korean President Moon Jae In two North Korean Pungsan hunting dogs.
As Moons announced on Sunday, the two old dogs reached their recipient for about a year already on Thursday.
They then crossed the border of Panmunjem along with three kilograms of dog feed to facilitate the "integration".
The dogs with thick white fur, sharp ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They belong to the national cultural property of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
At the third summit this year between Moon and North Korean powermaker Kim Jong Un in Pjöngang in mid-September.
Both countries also agreed to join together in international sports competitions such as the 2020 Olympics and to apply together for the release of the 2032 Olympics.
In the course of the mutual approach, Kim also agreed to include the Tongchang Ri test facility for rocket engines.
Austria's moved history in mirror of 99 documents
What is Austria?
The 100th anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated for almost ten months in the meantime, has been published in numerous new books, most of which answer this question in terms of the past hundred years.
In other words, Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and director general of the Austrian State Archive, is being added to the famous "Imagerbuch" Austria, which will appear on October 1.
New Week, New Chance for the Government
Back to work - the informal motto for today's working week of the Great Coalition.
Almost an interview, hardly a speech in which the Chancellor and his ministers from CDU, SPD and also from CSU have not mantraically complained about the "return to work".
This may have led some artisans, doctors, cashiers and otherwise employed citizens in this country to the legitimate question, which is actually the difference between work and work, but be it.
If the Federal Government is now so far to devote itself to its task again - to the government - it should not stop it from being debated.
Whether the Union and the SPD can actually bring something together after the provocations and blasphemous of the last few weeks may be shown on Monday.
In the evening, the Heads of Government will meet with the Coalition Committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel will now call this round regularly to resolve conflicts early; a lesson from all the disputes.
First, however, there are conflicting issues on the agenda with the Diesel upgrades and the Professional Immigration Act.
CSU Minister of Transport Scheuer wants to make the car companies come forward with exchange premiums, SPD and CDU see manufacturers in the obligation to refurbish older diesel.
While an approach has been drawn up over the weekend in the diesel crisis, the Union and SPD are still far apart from the planned Professional Immigration Act.
The SPD calls for a life perspective for rejected asylum seekers who work or do training.
The Union is strictly opposed to the "change of track" from the asylum system in the labour market.
So there will be another conflict among the coalition partners - and how should it be different?
Not equal and equal has joined the GroKo, but three partners with partly very different company figures and priorities.
The dispute is good.
Without a dispute, a society that is so diverse, with conflicting interests does not emerge.
In order to be constructive, however, dispute must not be raised again for party reasons on the question of his or her identity.
It's still about politics, not about theater.
Union and SPD are to fight - but always have the reality of people's lives in view.
What is makeable and useful to many?
With this guide question, both diesel and track change issues can be pragmatically clarified - and thus confidence can be regained.
Above all, people's parties must fight now.
Pilz checks working hours at Hartinger
Minister in Visier
Does the Minister of Labour count against the applicable service law?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look at this.
"True day and night" her legislators had been working on social insurance reform, one overcrowded social minister reported on the presentation itself two weeks ago.
In the case of Liste-Pilz-Mandatar Daniela Holzinger, the statement by Beate Hartinger-Small (FPÖ) is surprising - she is now bringing the matter to Parliament through request.
They argue that "the minister only wanted to express her enthusiasm for the use of her team and not to announce any violations of the applicable service law in front of current cameras".
Still, she now has questions to be able to "freeze her tongue from any suspicion".
Police are looking for women's bodies on the road
Marxgreen - Lange didn't want the police to express themselves.
Now there's a confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning, it has been buried on the state street between Naila and Bad Steben.
The route is still blocked in the Marx Green area until Monday.
The investigators had previously used an archeology dog.
The dog specially trained for the smell of old human bones, together with its leader, was able to limit the relevant place to a few meters in multiple use.
In addition, a soil anomaly was discovered in conjunction with scientists at the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian Supreme Memorial Office in the area of the so-called road section.
For more than a year now, state prosecutors and criminal police have been working on the missing.
Again and again a bicycle road was blocked at Marxgrün and examined with sonar devices because the investigators suspected that there might have been a tightening of the body 30 years ago during the new construction of the state road.
Colour powder and eggs: Crawlle in Barcelona before Catalonia-Yearday
On Monday, the controversial independence referendum in Catalonia is the first time.
But it's already going to come to Krawalen.
The separatists have not forgotten the police effort since the fall of 2017.
Barcelona - Shortly before the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum of October 1, 2017, there was a clash between separatists and the police in the centre of Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked by the independence advocates, among other things, by paint powder, when they wanted to prevent them from approaching a demonstration by the National Police and the Civil Guard.
Some 3,000 police officers wanted to honor their colleagues, who were in use last year at the referendum in the polls as illegally classified.
In an attempt to prevent citizens from paying their vote, violence had also occurred at that time.
The Catalan police had formed a chain to keep the demonstrations of separatists and the central government security forces separate, reported Spanish media.
Some of the approximately 6000 separatists would have tried to break the police chain by force, and the officials would have thrown away, among other things, color labels and eggs.
Six persons have been arrested, 24 others have been slightly injured, it called on the authorities.
For the first time on Monday, the independence referendum will take place.
Following the vote and a subsequent decision to split the prosperous region of Spain, the central government in Madrid had placed Catalonia under forced administration in autumn 2017.
The then regional president, Carles Puigdemont, fled to Belgium for exile.
Other politicians also moved abroad.
On the other hand, several ministers of the then regional government and other separatists are still sitting in U-Haft.
New elections were held in the region in December.
Following the entry into office of the new Catalan government in May, the forced administration was terminated.
But also the new Regional President, Quim Torra, consists of the "right to self-determination" of Catalans.
Football: Oberliga Westfalen: Collected advicelessness: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen separate torlos
Red-white ahlen continues to appear.
Also at FC Gütersloh it was only a 0:0 decision.
The final light and the third one opened up to 438 viewers at Heidewald Stadium as gathered-in-a-breath.
The first half was observable from the entertainment factor arg.
So anyone who wanted to get a beer or a toast could do this without concern.
There was no danger of passing a torchance because there was virtually no.
First shot after half an hour
Nick Flock was responsible for the first (unharmless) torso of the whole party in the 28th minute.
The best - and in principle the only real - option was that the Ahleners were forced to take a parade after a 32-minute shot from the penal border.
Even worse were the hosts.
Their most effective action consisted of an early change.
Stormer Lars Schröder had to be replaced with an injury condition, for him came Sinan Aygün.
After the change, both teams decided to do something against the ever-increasing delay.
In the 48th minute Sebastian Mützel targeted almost 18 meters above the house and after an hour the goods were also the first to appear offensive.
After a baller control by Matthäus Wieckowicz, it was fixed.
The currently presented counter about Sinan Aygün "kronte" Nick Flock (62.) with a sharp shot into the arms of RWA-Torwart Bernd Schipmann.
They also played with a head ball from Wieckowicz (66.) after an Eckball by ex-Ahleaner Tim Manstein.
RWA-Interim trainer Angelo Daut responded, first brought Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60th) and a little later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70th).
It worked - nothing.
More than optical superiority thanks to its own initiative, the Ahleners did not stand.
Only in the 91st minute did Cihan Yilmaz have the last chance, but it also didn't bring in anything.
Angelo Daut then tried to add the positive: "I like that we played to zero". Unfortunately, the zero was ahead too.
"This time we were not as dangerous as we were against wooden wickers and although our opponent had no desire to play here," observed RW Ahlen's Interim trainer.
Offensively "put it all in such a bit" against a team that "just wanted to defend it.
At least I didn't feel like we could get a opponent," Daut said.
However, as an observer, he did not feel as if his team could shoot a door.
The idea was too clever.
Reckenfelder Ertedankmarkt: Luckily there are enough Kreimers
The happy Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfelder Table edition for which these donations are intended.
The Honorary Officers assure: "These donations remain in Reckenfeld as well."
At the opening, the sky appeared brilliantly blue, and the space was still empty, but this should change during the day.
Because, "Here's so nice to have, that's why we're here today," said one visitor.
The organizer of the Feast Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed the guests in the Kiepenkerl-Outfit as always with a proper price humor.
For the Brockmann married couple, who should actually be weighed down against food, Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer broke in in in the short term.
Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) became ill.
But there are enough creamers.
And the "resistance" was not allowed to entertain the increasingly musical visitors.
It was so good that a few folk songs were played later.
"Simply great," Marcel Kreimer rejoiced.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to put the opening deadline in his schedule this time.
He is pleased with the many assets with their stands, including mainly associations.
"In fact, there shouldn't be something like a table," he thanked himself for the action of the Men's Choir.
Andreas Hajek praised the use of all those who were in use at the stands and also included the other parties held in September and the "Clean up" action.
Our garden city has a colourful anstrich - here's what goes.
Then the maikranz was removed from Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück with the help of the firearm and brought to the winter quarter.
It has been worked on many stands for physical well-being.
From sweet to heartfelt was all to have.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who only lived in Reckenfeld for a year, was created on his decopier saw.
Fine work, beer cover with rickshawl motifs and some more he had on offer.
A specialty was offered by three record fields Immer: "Reckenfelder Honig", accompanied by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buchschlüter.
The last one has a specialty.
Honey cake in glass, of course with honey from my own production.
Then the little Elsa had to access again and again, as good as the cakes.
The sociality is that the visitors stayed for long to evening hours, even without a stage program which is not available at the autumn party.
Smuggling with local political message: No successful advertising for skatesing
In Lengerich, unknowns have in a very unlikely way been used for the construction of a skate plant.
In a number of places there are corresponding skirmishes, says Jürgen Kohne from the city administration at the request of the WN.
At least one case has been reported to the police for damage to the case.
In large letters, the three words "Sketch Park for Lengerich" are engraved on paintings, among other things at the Gempt Hall and the Old Town Hall.
Michael Rottmann, Hall Manager, reports that after the trade fair on September 19th, a corresponding suit was discovered on the billboard at the climb to the Gempt-Bistro.
Since the short message was apparently "only" left with an Edding, they could have been removed without problems.
"Just a few days later, it was there again, this time, it was blown up," said Rottmann.
He assumes that the corresponding advertising order must be replaced.
A special note is given just in this case by the fact that several large companies from Langerich are also mentioned on the table.
If the skate plant is built, their realization should also be made possible by sponsors.
Promises already exist, explains Jörg Hesselmann from the city's school, sport and culture area, without names.
However, it is possible that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies that are on the table.
For years local policy and administration have been dealing with the issue of skates.
After the old one was demolished at the LWL clinic, after some time the search began for an alternative location.
Finally, the Council spoke mostly for the Firearms Park.
This sentence was not implemented - too many factors apparently spoke against a construction at this place.
At the end of June, a turnaround followed.
The members of the Main and Financial Committee now voted unanimously for the Gutenberg School area.
Jürgen Kohne says that the administration is currently in the middle of concrete planning.
The last word is the city council.
He leaves a decision this year so that a positive vote could be built in 2019.
Angpass when you're safe gets even worse
Frankfurt/Hamburg After the European air traffic chaos in the summer, the German air carriers do not see any signs of improvement in the coming year.
"This year we had wind, 2019 we will have strong wind and then the storm will come," said the chief of the Aviation Safety Agency, Matthias Maas, the German Press Agency before the Air Force Summit on 5 October in Hamburg.
An important reason for the numerous delays and delays in flight is the long-known staff note for European aviation insurance, for which there is no quick solution.
"The airlines and airports can achieve rapid improvements for the coming year, but the training of new lots takes four to five years," said the trade union officer.
The market for pre-trained lots has become empty throughout Europe.
In the centre of Karlsruhe alone to monitor the upper German airspace, about one hundred people were missing.
Maas again criticised the fact that various air transport unions were not invited to the summit.
On Friday, representatives of the feds, the countries, aviation security, the airlines and the airports come together to address the causes of the delays.
"If you want to talk about additional job closures and overtime, it will not go without us," said the head of the GdF, who has many members in the Federal German Aviation Safety.
Maas once again made the EU Commission's provisions responsible for the Lotsen-Egypts.
The traffic forecasts for the regulatory period running until 2019 have been too low.
The cost estimates and staff savings resulting from these operations are now fully focused on the operational business.
Maas appealed to Federal Minister of Transport Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to apply in Brussels for regulations that "do not cut down the air yet".
At present, the EU requirements would be harmonised by 2024 and there would be further exacerbations to be feared.
The EU has been exposed to continuous lobby printing since the airline.
"Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary and his colleagues have now picked up exactly what they have been sitting on themselves in recent years," Maas said.
He hopes that the high cost of delays in airlines will lead to a rethinking.
The GdF will only be involved in improving the situation if the German Air Safety (DFS) offers a "vote training and future pact", Maas said.
So far, the announced admission of 120 Lotsen students over the next five years is sufficient to compensate for the old-age dropouts.
The necessary staffing is not yet connected.
Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board agrees for Group Building
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board voted unanimously for the plans to rebuild the Group.
According to the will of Thyssenkrupp-Interim Chief Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed chairman of the meeting on Sunday, the critical group is to be divided into two independent companies.
Both companies should have their seat in food and be listed on the stock exchange.
There should not be any additional staff reduction beyond the already known reductions in the administration.
After two withdrawals, the control body has only eight heads on the capital side.
Ten representatives of the employees are against it.
The final decision, however, is expected to be a major meeting in 2020.
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG is intended to include, among other things, the 50 percent share of the merged steel business with the Indian partner Tata.
In the second company Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG the business is to be combined with lifts and deliveries.
Barcelona: Violence against the demos of politicians and Catalan independence advocates.
In two simultaneous demonstrations by Spanish policemen and Catalan independence advocates in Barcelona, there have been violent clashes with many injured people.
According to the city administration, about 3,000 police officers from all over Spain gathered on Saturday, as well as about 6000 independence defenders.
The Catalan police tried to keep the two protests away from each other with a big offer.
According to the authorities, however, independence advocates repeatedly tried to break down the security barrier.
They would have attacked the officials with paint and throwing.
There were also indications of rank among the participants of the various protests.
According to rescue forces, 24 people were injured.
The police said there were six arrests.
Better payers and respect for colleagues
The policemen wanted to honour the colleagues who had held a referendum on independence banned by the Spanish central government almost a year ago in Catalonia.
At the same time, they demanded better fees.
Members of the Spanish police and the Guardia Civil feel that it is wrong that Catalan and Basque police officers deserve much more than they do.
The demonstrators felt as a provocation that the Spanish police officers had shown up in Barcelona.
"Why did they come here to protest?" asked the 55-year-old Catalan Demonstrant Manel Perez of the AFP News Agency.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they ruined us a year ago.
A 31-year-old police officer from the Balearicians, who wanted to mention his name only with Daniel, showed the rejection.
"Of course we want to support our comrades who did only their duty last year: defending the law," he said.
But the demonstration is about exercising our rights and we do it in Barcelona because this is a great European city and there is more echo here.
He and his colleagues have "not come to provoke," said the police officer.
Panne permitted access to personal data of British Minister

According to British media reports, several ministers received calls from strangers after the panel was announced one day before the Tory party in Birmingham.

Football: Juve-Trainer Praises to Top Party: Ronaldos best game
The Portuguese Star Storm has "played the best game this evening together with the half hour of Valencia", Juve coach Massimiliano Allegri praised after the 3:1 (1:1) - victory of the record champion against the SSC Naples.
For the coach, the expensive purchased star was also without its own gate the decisive man in the important party against the persecutor.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and did good," said Allegri.
Even when we started with tactical errors, Ronaldo was very good at our first door - and from the moment we grew up.
Thanks to the three towers of Ronaldo, Juve turned the game after the early retreat by the hit of Dries Mertens (10th minute) and hung the most angry pursuer first.
The Torjager brought up by Real Madrid first laid down the former Federal Professor Mario Mandzukic, who provided a double package (26/49.) for the management.
And Ronaldo also carried out the preparation for the meeting of the head of the protest leader Leonardo Bonucci (76.), who had to move just before the torline.
"He has many templates," praised the trainer.
But of course, Allegri also wants to see gates from the attacker who is both in the Champions League and in the Portuguese national team of the record shields.
"We need to get even better into serving him," the coach asked.
Best Juve-Torschützze is currently Mandzukic with four hits - Ronaldo has three on the account.
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than EUR 100 million, the overpower of Juventus seems to be even more oppressive.
Seven wins in seven games is the free series in the series A. At 21 points the master of the remaining seven years has already six counters ahead of Naples.
The table range trained by former Bayer coach Carlo Ancelotti was not a chance against Turin.
But not later than after the notice of place of the already warned Mario Rui (58.) the top party was decided.
The Portuguese had to enter too hard against Paulo Dybala with yellow red from the square.
"We have played well against a good Naples," commented the Turner Coach.
The defendant was also allowed to feel Emre Can.
The German national player went through Juve.
The professional who came from the FC Liverpool was used by all seven league parties.
The middle field doctor also played in the Champions League party against Valencia, which Allegir meant with the "half hour": Ronaldo was flying out of the square at the 2nd victory of the tournaments and was locked up for the home game on Tuesday against Young Boys Bern.
Kanye West changes its name
With a particularly scurrying performance, Rapper Kanye West has taken care of the US TV show "Saturday Night Live" at the weekend.
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump in a mineral water costume provided guidance and questions for the audience.
In addition, the 41-year-old announced a change of name in order to publish his new album.
For then, you can only call him "Ye", says the musician.
"The being that was once known as Kanye West," he tweeted to the deceased singer Prince when he rejected his artist names.
However, the pseudonym is no news.
The 10th album has already appeared under this name.
In an interview with the radio broadcaster KRRL, the artist had explained that "Ye" had religious significance for him.
"I believe "Ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there it means "du"," says the rapper.
Football: Circle A1 Pattern: Final!
Done!
Hoetmars Trainer Averhage did not succeed in his disappointment.
That was a weak game of us today.
The opponent was just more aggressive, we've put him as well as never before in trouble." Accordingly, the list of Hoetmar's possibilities is clear.
Grade once two torso chances in 90 minutes, so that only rare games can be positive.
A1: SC Hoetmar is subject to SG Sendhorst with 0:2 (0:1) Photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
The SG also had only two options in the first pass, the first but used Mike Krause from the top angle for early leadership (7.).
In the 43th minute, Steffen could have increased, but after great preparation of Krause, he stood free.
The hosts had only a double chance when Moritz Höne first fired at Torsteher Jos Schuhmacher and also found his master in the post-supply Jan Blome in the broadcaster Keeper.
After the break, the guests became even more dominant and had a number of good chances.
But Uphus (49.), Julian Turl (61.) and Heinz Linnemann (69.) all issued.
A traffic meter - Louis Kortenjann had saved on the torline with his hand and saw red for it - also Niklas Eilmann could not use for the guests (75.).
Only when Nils Berheide pushed the ball over the line was the party decided (81.).
"We had been criticizing ourselves hard before, that was different today than in the last few weeks," said Florian Kraus.
Sendhorst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77. Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90. Leibig), Turl.
Doors: 0:1 Krause (7.), 0:2 Berheide (81.).

Football: Circle A2 Pattern: Spectacle football in Albacht: GW Albersloh is subject to Concordia with 3:4
"I don't even know what to hold on to," he said.
"We didn't even get access to it," he said, "and he probably meant the flying song with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but also all the other green whites that had a collective offensive.
Still, he could laugh: "A fucking victory," he said still, bubbling hard and pulling his players from there was the relief to note that they had pulled three points out of the deal.
Well known, after a duel of two teams, one of which, namely the Albachts, plays for the championship and the other, the Albersloh, fight for the classroom.
With understandable mixed feelings, GWA coach Sven Lewandowski looked back at the 90 minutes behind him.
"That was our best season performance," he says.
"As we came back after 0:2, as we held against one of the top teams of the League all the time, it was already really phenomenal".
The more bitter it is that you have to go home with empty hands.
The host with his 12th season meeting led Lars Zymner (24th).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this door.
The 2:0 he placed on the left side for Fabian Fröhning (39.).
We knew that, but such a player can't keep completely out.
"It was already crazy what he had done," Lewandowski recognized the quality of the opponent's needless.
Shortly before the page shift, his own Elf managed to compensate: McGills's left-hand walk between Hövelmann and Concordia-Torhüter Hinkerohe passed through to the long Toreck (45.).
After the page shift, it was McGill again who achieved the compensation (59.).
Then it went on and on.
It was a clever action-loaded game.
Nübel shocked Albacht again (64.), only five minutes later Patrick Horstmann (69.).
Despite too many, Albersloh was no longer able to counter the last Concordia hit (80.) again.
We now have to focus our full concentration on Wednesday.
"The game against the creature, that's what we need to win now," Lewandowski said.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolf, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87. Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87. Barexai).
Doors: 1:0 Zymner (24), 2:0 Frehning (39), 2:1 McGill (45), 2:2 McGill (59), 3:2 Nubel (64), 3:3 P. Horstmann (69), 4:3 Jülkenbeck (80).
Yellow-Red: Atlan (74./Albachten).
Football: TSV Straßberg Fights Point against Primus
There was no winner in the Landesliga-Duell between the TSV Straßberg and the FV Biberach.

Media: Total Bureau of Dynamo Dresden
The entire presidency of football secondaryist Dynamo Dresden has returned according to media reports.
Several media agreed to a joint letter from the Sachsen Board in the evening.
First, there was no confirmation of the association.
The reason for the withdrawal is to be internal power struggles with the former federal listist.
Erdogan in Germany: Politics instead of Pomp
Good thing he's gone again.
There are only a few state guests whose departure in Germany provides as much relief as those of Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
For three days the Turkish President in Berlin and Cologne was a guest, and many thought he would not be invited.
Evangelical Academy Tutzing: prominent guests and new offers
The Evangelical Academy Tutzing offers around 80 meetings by the middle of next year.
This is why French President Emmanuel Macron has signalled that he is personally seeking to collect the Tolerance Prize in Tutzing.
For Christian Wulff, the time was too short: he was not in Tutzings Evangelical Academy.
But before and after, Wulff was there to visit.
This was how he was counted, when he proudly said, "All the presidents of the Federal and Chancellors were already with us." That at the Academy in Tutzing Castle again appeared prominent, but there was also a theme at the presentation of the annual programme.
At the end of October, Singermaker Konstantin Wecker took part in a meeting on spiritual experience in philosophical perspective, on 29 September the writer Frido Mann is at a meeting on his grandfather Thomas Mann.
Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron has also promised: He wants to personally receive the "tolerance price" awarded to him by the Academy in Tutzing, which he also receives in another category by television moderator Dunja Hayali (we reported).
The approximately 80 meetings until mid 2019 have been held.
"The rent is just not safe!" stands in a meeting title.
"SOS on Europe's borders" - the Academy describes the "risky and deadly route across the Mediterranean".
"And at a meeting about Syria: "Barbaria without limit."
Weapons, destruction, torture, death - the war hinders every human idea".
From structural racism in society over the scarcity between arms and empire to the radical change of work through digitization, the spectrum is sufficient.
Academie Director Hahn was convinced: "Free democracy needs places where a civil society can come together to look for solutions or at least partial solutions".
At a meeting of 200.
Karl Marx's birthday will soon be waiting for a more visitor of the direction of capitalism criticism, the others rather a tendency "from the left to the middle".
How does it look with neutrality?
"We are indeed 100 percent daughter of the Evangelical Church," said scholar Dr. Ulrike Haenderel, "so we are not 100 percent neutral".
Music Cabaret: Gender understanding with heart - Wolbeck - Westfale News
"Both for adults and for men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on the Friday evening in the hall of the Christichure in Wolbeck.
As a cabaret, Tebner came up with sexual understanding, not only with humor and warmth for the (sympathetic) woman and the (sympathetic) man, but also with music.
The mini guitar she put in and also mastered her violin.
On the wing was Ben Suvrup.
He is one of the male savings partners, who also comes to the end of the sentence, to the other a true pianist: So congealed harmoniously accompanied by suvrup Tebner that some have wished for a solo.
It was also with Beethoven and Chopin, but otherwise, as it was suitable for the red thread of the evening.
There, Teubner had introduced a paradoxon: satisfaction comes to the man if he has a partner, but this does not open the door.
On the other hand, a closed door without a partner does not bring any benefits.
The piano solo now demonstrates itself: What would come from composing Mozart, "the Nannerl" would have opened the door unexpectedly?
In this way, the convulsions in improvisations, from Bach's "O Head Full of Blood and Wounds" to the "Song of Death", and from Mozart's G-Moll symphony into a playful dance.
There was great applause and "Bravo" from the full room.
Flowers were handed over by Karlheinz Kleinje, the Society's treasurer, the Chansonette.
However, the President of Heidemarie Markenbeck did not accept any additional thanks.
She had the idea of giving the duo in addition to performances in Stuttgart and Frankfurt also one in Wolbeck.

Handball: Women's Landing: Ahlener SG keeps against TV Wattenscheid near the white West
The women had problems, especially with the third-party player Caroline Stallmann, who had only ten hits.
"In fact, I was well satisfied with the defense, only one player has made too many doors.
We didn't get them in the grip," says ASG-Coach Dogan Ayodogdu.
But he was more upset about the many opportunities left out.
The concentration finally left his team missing this time.
Therefore, the ASG went back almost until the end of a retreat, was on the break with 11:12 and later with 15:18 (45.).
Only by the end did the wider bank of the guests become decisive.
In addition, Ayodogdu put Merle Clement back on the left side, which then "extremely clevered the crucial door" (Ayodogdu).
ASG: Buschkötter, Bolte - Bruland (2), Pump, Exner, Clement (5), Colbatzky (5/3), Drewes (1), Schlautmann (1), Deventer (6), Baer (1), C. Fitzek, Ruschhaupt (4), S. Fitzek.
Volleyball: 3. Liga Women: Top performance of the BSV Ostbevern at the VC Allbau Food
Thanks to a top performance in the top game, the Volleyballers of the BSV East Bevern have again established themselves in the top group of the 3rd Liga West.
At the second stage of VC Allbau Food, the blue whites won with 3:1.
"That was a huge step for a cool season.
It makes Lenz play in the top third of the league.
We have now worked this out," Trainer Dominik Munich was pleased to see his team's nearly untallable performance at the crashing table guide.
The first pass almost dominated the guests by popularity.
Over 4:1, 16:10 and 22:12 he went with 25:15 to the viceroys of the previous year.
Food has been accepted in the twin line, but has not come into play.
We took good care of them.
Our opponent has hit high-risk but also produced several driving cards.
In the second sentence, the BSV already led by 12:8. "Food has switched the assumption on three lines.
We couldn't hold the pressure.
Eating has gone high, and we've got a bit of an intruder," Munich continues.
At 18:17 the volleyball women from the corner had the nose.
At 19:24, Ostbevern refused four more sets, but the fifth attempt found his goal.
"The game was now a better class," said the exercise leader to the rising level.
Mike Rüdingloh and finally Wiebke Silge contributed significantly to the fact that the BSV turned the sheet in the third section from 14:16 to 25:21.
Munich: "That's where we've played consistently and quietly".
Over 7:3 and 15:13 the blue-whites brought four with 25:22 on their side.
Vera Horstmann was chosen as the most valuable player, but also Maren Flatmeier had won a previous day.
BSV women: Egg house, Rüdingloh, Lea and Anna Dreckmann, Auen, flatmeier, Mersch tailor, Silge, Horstmann, Roer.
International: Turkish municipality: Moscow opening as missed chance
The Turkish municipality in Germany (TGD) has criticised the way in which the large ditib mosque was dedicated in Cologne by the Turkish President Recep Tayyyip Erdogan.
"The mosque opening in Cologne has left in the German-Turkey relationship a scrapper that can only be returned to arduous," said TGD president Gökay Sofuoglu, Germany's editorial network.
Both the Turkish and the German sides would have missed the chance of a common, conciliatory appearance.
"Set aside with German top politicians to underline the membership of the Muslims to Germany, Erdogan has used the term for his purposes," Sofuoglu complained.
The major exclusion of the German public has "enhanced many reservations".
Heimatverein Nottuln: Offer has already been established
After the long summer break, it's finally a folk meeting time again.
On 18 October ( Thursday) at 7.30 p.m., the Heimatverein Nottuln will hold its fifth Nottuln People's Meeting in the fireplace room of the Old Office.
It is only on the day that it is a year that we have held a public meeting for the first time.
In the meantime, this event has become an integral part of the musical calendar of events in Nottuln", says Hanns Moormann, president of the Nottulner Heimats Association.
I wouldn't have thought of our meeting so quickly in Nottuln eta.
No matter whether stormy Friederike in January or heatwell in July, the fireplace room of the official was always full.
"The program at the next People's Meeting is as always a colourful mix of German folk songs, hiking and seamen, folk songs, evergreens and old drummers," says Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who is always invited by friends to Nottuln.
Klaus Spellmeyer promised his accordion to the first folk meeting "Birthday".
He was a member of "Gaitling", a group from the neighbouring district of Steinfurt, who played music with German texts.
Now he's on his way with an Irish folk band.
The composer of the People's Meeting remembers the last event in the summer when Christoph Schulz from the Emsdetten People's Meeting with his international version of the song "Frösche in the Night" thrilled the listeners and sent them home with an earworm.
"We count on many happy guests to once again spend a pleasant and humorous evening," it says in the invitation of the home association.
Anyone who plays an instrument and wants to actively participate is invited to join.
Since the desired seats are always displayed quickly, it is recommended to be there in time.

China approves planned merger of Linde and Praxair
For legal reasons, all open questions must be clarified by 24 October.
FrankfurtLinde and Praxair are taking another step on the way to the largest industrial gas group.
The Chinese Competition Authority approved the proposed merger, Linde announced on Sunday.
In this way, the approvals in South Korea and - as the largest - in the United States are still valid for the billionth anniversary.

For legal reasons, all open questions must be clarified until 24 October in order for the merger to succeed.
From Pure Fruits to Ecology
With a gala in the Dr.-Stamberger Hall, the 125-year-old association for gardening and land maintenance was celebrated.
On September 29, 1893, with a fruit show at the Kulbacher Association House, the last impetus was set for the district association for gardening and land maintenance Kulbach, and just 125 years later he celebrated a great anniversary in the Kulbacher Stadthalle on Saturday evening.
In 1893 he was raised from the baptism by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa.
The purpose of the fruit-building association was also different from today's work - it was actually about fruit-making, flowers and garden-building that nobody thought about at the time.
"At that time, in the era of enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favorite child of the elites," said circuit overseer Günter Dipold in his speech.
Fruit trees should sow remote roads, so-called industrial gardens have been built in schools.
The Ostanbau is still the task of the 55 gardening associations in the district of Kulmbach, which include almost 7,000 members.
But that doesn't make the spectrum far out of reach.
A natural gardening, biological plant protection, village decoration and nutrition play a major role as well as the media of knowledge, healthy nutrition and youth work.
The members of the Hutschdorf Youth Group "Maulwurfes" on stage show how varied the tasks of a gardening club are.
"Youth work is especially necessary in the digital age," said President Günter Reif, and also OB Henry Schramm stressed how important experiences in nature are for life.
The Kastaniens collection was a huge matter for us children, I doubt that you can collect much joy with smartphone & co..
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with Landrat Klaus Peter Söllner for the anniversary.
"Where are they to stand?" added Landrat Söllner and highlighted the special importance of the garden associations for the villages.
The association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green areas in the village.
The fact that this is a real concern of the many gardening associations in the county also left no doubt about it.
He led many visitors with a photo presentation through the long history of the circle and reported, among other things, the need for self-sufficiency after the war.
Earlier everything came out of the garden, for which it was ingested.
At the end of the 1950s, however, the garden became a zoo and living garden.
"Natural has existed, she was already there before us and we have to guide her," pleaded the expert for fruit and nut trees.
Therefore, there is the urge for the garden builders not to leave behind so that our home remains beautiful and valuable.
This includes welcoming the new citizens in our associations, the President of the Bavarian Association, Wolfram Vaitl, added.
"We have to stop the splendid decline in insects, which we owe our children and grandchildren," concluded Günter Reif the successful feast, which was celebrated by the Turbulents of the Thurnau Music Association.

Priority on Nafta talks: Canadian Foreign Minister Submits UN Speech
Mexico's government wants clarity in the matter of Nafta: they provide the two trading partners with an ultimatum for an agreement.
The Canadian Foreign Minister is now giving absolute priority to the Trade Agreement - and is shifting its speech from the United Nations to the United Nations.
As a result of the press release of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Naphta) with the United States and Mexico, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland moved her speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Instead of this Saturday, the minister will speak only on Monday before the United Nations Full Assembly, she told Adam Austen.
In the meantime, they focus on the renegotiation of Nafta.
Mexican Economic Minister Ildefonso Guajardo had stated on Friday that Canada's negotiators and the United States had 48 hours to agree if Canada actually wanted to join the trade agreement already reached between his country and the United States.
In August the United States and Mexico agreed to a renewal of the Regional Free Trade Agreement on Nafta.
US President Donald Trump pointed out that Canada could be excluded from Nafta in the future.
The talks on a new edition have been going on for over a year.
Until Sunday evening (location time) they will be brought to an end, Trump's government wants to present the agreement to the US Senate before 1 October.
In the case of a failure of the negotiations, Mexico's appointed President, Andres Manuel López Obrador, announced on Friday to seek a bilateral agreement with Canada.

Protests against presidential candidates Bolsonaro
The Brazilian presidential candidate, Jair Bolsonaro, who was injured in a mass attack, left the hospital.
The right-wing ex-military wanted to fly to Río de Janeiro, where he lives, after a report from the newspaper "O Globo".
After his release, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will have public appearances in the South American country in the last week before the presidential elections.
At the beginning of September, the politician was attacked on an open street during a campaign in southern Brazil.
Meanwhile, thousands of people went to the streets in several Brazilian cities to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele no" (in German: "The Not") women's associations had called for protests against the former military.
In the social networks too, the associations made racist and women-respective statements against Bolsonaro.
Thousands of demonstrators were expected in the São Paulo economic metropolis.
In the capital of Brazil, the protests mixed with the announcement of the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Workers' Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.
He joined the post of former President Inácio Lula da Silva, who was sentenced to 12 years in prison because of corruption and therefore cannot apply.
The presidential election in Brazil is on 7 October.
As a former mayor of the millionaire city of São Paulo, Haddad was still far behind the right-wing candidate Bolsonaro.
Although the "Trump Brasiliens" has been involved in politics for a long time, it presents itself as an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates in the first round reaches the absolute majority, there will be an election on 28 October.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro is not going to come out of this - no matter who he goes against.
Bolsonaro is known for hating homosexuals and blacks and for glorifying military dictatorship (1964-1985).
He's always shocked with verbal decoupling.
Another time he said the followers of Lula's left working party should be shot.

After a long illness: Danish rock legend died
The Danish rock icon Kim Larsen is dead.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 after a long illness, his producer Jörn Jeppesen shared on Larsen's website.
In prayer, Larsen was surrounded by his wife and six children.
The musician has been in treatment since the beginning of the year for prostate cancer.
Larsen was known for the band Gasolin, which was extremely successful in the 1970s in Scandinavia.
Their songs were influenced by international music sizes such as Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
After the release of the band in 1978, Larsen was successful as a solo artist.
He sold around three million plates in Denmark.
His 1983 album "Midt om night" is still the most sold album in Denmark.
On Sunday, Lars Lökke Rasmussen, Danish Prime Minister, praised Larsen as "a street boy", who was "against everything, but in all hearts".
The chief of government also recalled that the monarchy opponent Larsen was performed on the 70th birthday of Queen Margrethe II of Denmark.
Rock night in the shoe factory: volume at pressure chamber level
"Here we stand, take the Knoxes and burn a concert evening with the strength of a tiger." Only the band names of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonsaw" and "The Ignition" lay such a description of the rock live music experience on Saturday evening in the room of the Citizens Centre shoe factory: Hardrock pur from three other friends.
After the sound check and shortly before the start of the concert, the musicians even take time for a group photo.
There's no sign of lamp fever.
After that, the rock protagonists from Ahlen and the surrounding area – all in conjunction with the Booking Agency "Mosquito" from Oelde – are thrilled to see their bands the approximately 120 visitors of the "Mint Mosquito" rock night.
The Quartet "Tiger Bonsaw" with Frontmann and Guitarist Dennis Hadrika already knows how to perform the concert even with the latest, unknown pieces of their own feathers and the next CD.
In front of the stage, the band is danced at the performance to the vocal and pressure-filled interplay.
Although "Tiger Bonsaw" calls are not to be heard, "Your Bonsaw" then leave the stage to the trio "Here We Stand".
The hardrock is not the same hardrock as guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich at the bass and drummer Kai Hölscher with their alternative, sometimes in classical rock of the 1970s.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers" comes with "Here We Stand" in addition to the guitar rock, also a synthesizer.
Not only is the eye-sight, just-balled "Take Me Home" not only comes through the change of melodic passages to the guitar-ridden rock riffs of the multilayered songs.
The Quartet "The Ignition" from Tonnish Houses has, however, played a special level of popularity since its establishment in 2005.
Full of agility, the band presents its hard rock on Saturday.
The fact that "The Ignition" with its performances before the big audience - recently documented in a movie by Max Meis about the 2017 Tournee in China - has special stage experience is obvious and unsurpassed.
Singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann, in conjunction with the band, also puts his own accents on the only covered song of the evening, "Word Up" by Cameo from the 80s.
To the feeling of even more controlled sound than before, guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivers a jubilant solo while running through the audience.
A certain volume is, of course, part of such a hardrock concert: At Mint Mosquito's Rock Night, the team's knowledge of the mixpult team at the three concerts of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonsaw" and "The Ignition" is at about 98 decibels.
This is, for example, at the level of the press air chamber, but it is still clearly under the control of the "Wacken-Festival" on the "The Ignition" on its website.
Hearing 120 decibels in düsentribute strength as usual in the northern part of the Republic, the Ahlen audience does not need this rock night.
After almost four hours, the three bands of the tougher rock gong have convinced along with their sovereign, virtuoso game and their own compositions.
"Here we stand, have taken the bones and burned a concert evening with the strength of a tiger," all three groups, freely in the transferred sense, can say at the end.
And especially enjoy the great appeal of the visitors.

A fatal accident in sailing aircraft at Essen/Mülheim Airport
At Mülheim/Food airport there was a fatal accident.
On a parking lot at Mülheim/eating airport, a sailplane is crashed on Sunday.
The pilot died in the accident.
Near Mülheim/Essen airport there was a fatal accident on Sunday.
As reported by the "West German General News", a sailplane was crashed at the fairground at the airport.
The pilot was killed.
As the "WAZ" reports further, the pilot was alone on board - the pilot should be an intruder.
The aircraft has already been on the ground at the time of the accident.
The crash site is just around a stop at the airport.
But there's been an October party since this weekend.
Mülheim/Esen Airport is located at the city border of the two Ruhrbeit cities and directly on the road to the 52nd motorway.
From the parking lot there is a park&Ride offer at large events in the dining fair or the Gruga hall in Essen.
Trump says to Kim, "And then we fell in love."
The fact that North Korean President Kim is perfectly well-founded despite the nuclear crisis is not a secret.
Now Trump has made his colleague a regular declaration of love.
It also has to do with Kim's "beautiful letters".
At the age of 72, the married president of the United States became known as a new flame.
The Tragic: It's a remote relationship.
In all the public, Donald Trump made an unusual statement of love on Saturday to North Korean powermaker Kim Jong Un.
In front of supporters in the U.S. state of West Virginia, Trump found almost tender words for the half-old spear of the Pjöngang dynasty, even though he was carrying nuclear weapons around North Korea as close as he was.
"I was crazy, too, and it went between us," Trump reported.
And then we fell in love.
Okay?
No, really.
And not only the conversations with Kim would have caused his heart to melt.
He wrote me beautiful letters, it was great letters.
Their personal connection also bore political fruit: Trump referred to the stop of all atomic and rocket tests announced by Kim, even though critics have so far seen little more than lip confessions.
That the tendency for the "Rocket Man" - so Trump's nickname for Kim - should not be to everyone's attention, seemed to be quite conscious to the US president.
In any case, he took the criticism he expected when he appeared in a large spa in the city of Wheeling immediately: "Donald Trump says they've fallen in love".
How terrible, how terrible is that?
This is so unpredictable.
But he cared very little, Trump explained and directed his finger to the multitude of people: "I have always told you it's so simple to be president."
But then we wouldn't push 10,000 people out there into this prall-filled arena, but we'd only have 200 people out there.
Octoberfest attracts many guests to Baesweiler
Baesweiler Bests visited, excited as well as above hearted by the sun: Very varied and with a good shot of October festival flair, Baesweiler's city of downtown has emerged on Sunday.

Refugees thanks to video from Libyan prison
Nigerian refugees have pointed to their catastrophic prison conditions in Libya by means of a mobile video, enabling them to be saved.
The group had turned the shooting into a cell in the coastal town of Savija in July under life-threatening and spread online.
"They refuse to send us back," said one man in the video message.
We suffer here, we die here.
The recording was sent to the website "France 24 Observers", whose editors warned the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
Finally, at the end of August, the refugees were exiled to Nigeria.
"Without the video, we probably wouldn't have been able to go back to Nigeria," said Ef Ef Ef Oneyek, who had recorded the video, the AFP News Agency.
The 25-year-old was arrested in Libya in an attempt to get across the Mediterranean to Europe.
With the video, he put himself in danger of life, according to his own statement.
One of his rivals was nearly beaten to death by the guards, Onyeka said.
In general, the conditions of arrest have been catastrophic: "They all beat us with pipes and sticks."
They gave us nothing to eat, we had to drink from the latrine.
The IOM organizes the voluntary return of refugees who are beached in Libya.
Some 2,700 migrants from Nigeria were sent back to their homes this year with the help of the program, said IOM spokesperson in West African country Jorge Galindo.
The case of the Nigerians now saved is not exceptional in view of the poor conditions of detention in Libya.
But he hasn't heard from a phone video support yet.
International organizations have been criticising the situation in Libyan refugee camps for a long time.
The North African State, which is dominated by many parts of the militia, is the main transit country for migrants on the way from Africa to Europe.

German was caught in his own car for days
A 75-year-old has had to spend several days and nights in his car in a forest area in the middle of France after he fixed the car outside all the forest roads and blocked the car door.
Rescue forces discovered the Pkw on Saturday afternoon by accident near a stretch and released the missing since service night, the police informed him on Sunday.
The 75-year-old from Pleinfeld was according to the information in spite of the cold nights and the long time without care in good health.
He agreed to look forward to his home.
The pensioner was reported missing by his family after he had not returned on Tuesday from a ride with his field car over the local meadows and fields.
Despite intense search, the remains of the man remained unclear for days.
Laschet points to the rule of law in Turkey
Cologne NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU) has encouraged the rule of law in Turkey in talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
The relations between the two countries are currently "overestimated", Laschett said on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne Airport.
This concerns, in particular, detention waves, press and freedom of religion.
He therefore made it clear to Erdogan that if relations are to be normalized in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, that rule of law is a very important condition for them.
Laschet also reportedly referred to the cases of Germans who are in prison in Turkey.
He formulated the expectation that freedom of opinion should be respected.
Erdogan then again stressed the independence of Turkish justice.
The conversation between Lasket and Erdogan was short-term in a building of the Federal Ministry of Defence's flight preparedness at Cologne Airport.
Originally, it was supposed to take place at Wahn Castle - but the castle owners had refused it out of political conviction against Erdogan.
Erdogan went on to open the Ditib mosque in Cologne after the conversation.
Laschet had cancelled a joint performance in the building.
But he said, "The Muslims who go to this mosque are also citizens of our country."
And we are also their contact partners - and not the Turkish President.
Lack of confidence in the United States: North Korea is demanding equipment
While US President Trump is not tired of stressing the success of the negotiations on the denuclearisation of North Korea, the Ostian regime is closer to the relationship.
Foreign Minister Ri is calling for a settlement of Washington.
North Korea Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has proposed that the U.S. government at the UN General Assembly debate block negotiations for an nuclear-weapon-free Korean peninsula with its continued sanctions.
"The latest stop is therefore that the United States is building on forced measures that are deadly to confidence-building," Ri said in New York.
An armor is indispensable for North Korea under these circumstances.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security and under such circumstances there is no way that we will disarm ourselves as the first," said the North Korean diplomat.
The fact that North Korea could impose sanctions on the "knee" is "a dream of people who don't know us".
In order to build confidence, however, his country stopped its nuclear and rocket tests and destroyed an atomic test site, raised Ri.
On the US side, however, there were no "responsive reactions", criticised the Minister.
Because of North Korea's nuclear and missile programme, the UN Security Council alone decided three times last year to impose sanctions on the international isolated country.
US President Donald Trump and his Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo have in recent days urged the United Nations to strictly comply with the sanctions.
At the same time, the US government is working on an approach.
In June Trump met for the first time North Korean powermaker Kim Jong Un.
After the first summit in Singapore, the President of the United States is seeking a second summit with Kim.
In October Pompeo will again travel to Pjöngang to discuss the end of the North Korean nuclear programme.
The HoT is served: New kitchen with donations from the municipality
Because they were actually in a youth meeting, many visitors to the house of the open door HoT got nothing from it: White blankets and flower jewelry on the tables and a large buffet were waiting for the guests after the Erdedank Goddess service.
The young people of the HoT were delighted to have the buffet with spices from different countries in the new kitchen.
The institution was financed by donations from the municipality, for which the young people wanted to thank themselves for the food.
It was not easy to start with the new facility, as Henriette Westbuer, the leader of the HoT, recalled.
We had filled our refrigerators before the summer break with food and ingredients and were best prepared on the big day.
But then on the first day after the summer break came the evil surprise: a power drop had put the huge, two-part refrigerator out of operation, the food was ruined and had to be disposed of.
"Now we had to start from the outset: we had a lot of support from friends and neighbors, but the children and young people wanted to create it alone," says Westbuer.
And that's how everyone packed it.
The result could be seen, the guests were thrilled.
"Better can't cook it either," praised a visitor, while Hokkaido sausage was served or allowed to serve the guests at Quiche, liver cheese or cakes.
"It's really great what the children and young people have put on their legs," said Father Frank Beckmann, while Magician Stephan Lamben with cartoon tricks and other pieces of art for surprises.
Jürgen Sator leaves the national board NRW of the table
From Frost about criticism from its own ranks, the head of the Essen table, Jörg Sartor, has given up his posts in the national association.
Sartor became known throughout the nation because the Essen table had introduced a stopover for foreigners.
He had already retired in July as vice-chairman of the NRW tables, said Sartor of the "World on Sunday".
There's too many of us in the back.
The head of the NRW Table Country Association, Wolfgang Weilerswist, expressed his understanding of the decision of his long-term deputy.
The sharp criticism has taken Sartor.
"I can repeat his step - because people who didn't know exactly why the Essen table did it."
But Sartor is still active for the Essen table - "six days a week, then nothing changes," says Weilerswist.
In the "World on Sunday", Sartor again criticised colleagues from other tables.
You must not pursue the approach, "without us people are starving in the city".
It is the task of the State to ensure that people do not starve.
At a conference of the tables on Friday in Berlin, the Essenes did not participate.
"That's where I'm told too much sweet dirt," he said.
There are all these social fussies that have criticised me at the time.

Lucien Favre's team had acted against Bayer Leverkusen until the break, but in the 2nd half time, it was still 4:2-victim.
Jacob-Bruun Larsen (65th) and Marco Reus (69th) are equal to a doublet in four minutes, Paco Alcacer, who was replaced by Favre in the 63rd minute, provided with another doublet in the final phase (86th/94th) for the crowning of the performance increase after the break.
The VfB Stuttgart also won the first victory.
Against the backdrop of a yellow-red card against Milos Veljkovic, the Stuttgarts had to be frightened in the meantime before the break.
Bornra Sosa and the unattainable Gaulie Ron-Robert Objectives made a curious throw-in owner that helped the guests in the 68th minute to compensate.
Seven minutes later, Gonzalo Castro won the VfB for the first time.
In Wolfsburg Michael Lang did not experience complete happiness, but also failed debut for Borussia Mönchengladbach.
The gladbachers who joined the Swiss Quartet Yann Sommer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and Lang gave a lead twice, played 2:2 and were still waiting for an outdoor match in the VW city since 2003.
For Wolfsburg's compensation to 1:1, Renato Steffen was responsible for his second federal agent.
At the 20-metre flat shot of the Aargauer, Yann summer was powerless, as was the second meeting after an hour.

Although Stuttgart Defender Borna Sosa and Goalie Ron-Robert Zeiler brought the brakes back to play by a curious intruder (68.) a quarter-hour before the end, Gonzalo Castro shot the in too many Stuttgarts back on the winning street.

Macedonians agree on new national names
In Macedonia, some 1.8 million citizens today agree to change the name of their country in northern Macedonia.
In one case, the nearly three decades-old conflict could be resolved with the neighboring Greece.
Athens had survived a name change because of its same-name northern province and blocked every approach to Macedonia to the west.
The voters therefore also decide on future Western integration.
The United States had announced that the country could soon become a NATO member at a positive end of the referendum.

SPD Politicians: Johannes Kahrs married his friend
Almost a year after the marriage came into force for all, SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-standing friend Christoph Rohde.
On Saturday, they both gave themselves the jaword in Hamburg.
If a registered life partnership did not fall for them, Kahrs had previously said the "image" section.
"If we marry, then we're right." He's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a political speaker of the SPD Bundestags fraction and one of the spokespersons of the Seeheim Circle, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage for homosexuals, Kahrs had performed an irretrievable survey on 30 June 2017.
He had thus proposed to the Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) that he be "stealed" on the subject.
"That was your Schabowski moment," he said, in response to the accidental announcement of the DDR frontier opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since 1 October 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
They had been able to register their lifelong partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example in the law of adoption.
Garden day: 400 meters hedge cut
There was a lot of work to be done before the members of the Association of Citizens of Children's House and the Society for Leprakunde.
For about 400 meters of hedges should be cut around the gardens of the people of the friendly house.
Supported by the inhabitants, it went to work for about 12 supporters.
"We are doing this to reduce costs," said the president of the Citizens' Association Walter Schröer.
And so did some of them.
Because of the hot summer we're late this time, but luckily it's just a cut.
Because already in the spring, you've already kicked the heck once.
The following breakfast at work is also a long tradition.
"It should also remain with the forces," said Walter Schröer.
World Championship in Rio: Hannes Aigner holds gold at the Canuslalom-WM
Augsburger Hannes Aigner won the Gold Medal in Rio de Janeiro at the end of the Canuslalom World Championship.
The 29-year-old set up a perfect course on Sunday on the Olympics.
Two years ago he had missed Olympia Bronze for three hundred seconds.
I was well prepared, I had enough rides here on the plant and it all fits today," said the Olympia third of London 2012.
To this end, he threw his paddle away from joy and pulled both arms safely to the height - well aware that it would be at least for a medal.
Always had your start number four.
However, the six remaining launchers could not reach their Fabil time of 89.69 seconds.
Second, the Czech Jiri Prskavec became an egg before the Russian Pawel.
The police inspector Gauting mentions the first attempt to break up this autumn into a single family house.
Luckily, the perpetrators failed.
The days will be shorter - this is what breakers want to make use of.
So the police inspector Gauting reported yesterday the first attempt to break up this autumn.
The fact that there has been a trial at the Single Family House on the Kingswiss Street is due to the alarm system.
That was when the criminals laid their hands on Friday just 20 hours ago.
The offenders knew that the residents were not at home.
However, the alarm was apparently surprised by the fact that they took refuge without delay.

Pleite at Hertha: Taken from the reality: Bavarian against Ajax required
The predicate is unbeatable: The defeat in Berlin wants the FC Bayern "not to be liked".
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first intermediate phase for the office of Niko Kovac.
The first small part of the performance under the new Coach Niko Kovac should not at any rate increase to the highest autumn depth for the Munichers.
"One week ago you still had the impression that we are invincible.
Now we got a little bit of reality," Thomas Müller found after the winning 0:2 defeat at Hertha BSC and demanded a reaction for the Champions League duell with Ajax Amsterdam.
Whoever knows us knows that we're really upset and that's why we're gasing on Tuesday.
For the first time since more than a year outside, no own gate has been shot, like at the same time of the previous season two duty games in series without winning, the table run in the football league first lost Borussia Dortmund.
Although the overall situation is not as dramatic as the final phase of the failed Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, the recordmaster needs to be warned.
The FC Augsburg at 1:1 with its run-off male counter-man tactics and the Berliners, through their playful needle stick across the outside, have delivered in three days the same two blouses as the last-everly dominant Bavarians.
"Those who know the FC Bayern know that we don't like it and we will do everything we can to make us successful again," Kovac stressed.
On the other hand, he and his losses in his hometown were surprisingly mild, and his first defeat as a Munich coach merely focused on the again lacking treatment of opportunities.
A victory against Amsterdam and against Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would lead to a positive outcome before the country’s break the first intermediate phase of its term of office - otherwise the sound would probably be tightened.
In this way, Kovac did not take exceptional measures before the second King's Class performance of this season after 2:0 at Benfica Lisbon.
After the day of the free Sunday begins as planned the short preparation for the second preliminary game against Ajax, which had also sovereignly bound to AEK Athens for the performance with 3:0.
"Now it's got us in two games, but we'll make our doors again," said National Team Captain Manuel Neuer.
As after the lost pokalfinal against the arrival of Frankfurt at the same place, Joshua Kimich Nadaxt spoke in particular.
The lawyer acted as a mahner.
"I don't think this is all bad, we have to work it out again because we don't make the many chances and make the mistakes behind," stressed the 23-year-old shortly before leaving the Olympic Stadium.
On the seventh playing day of the previous playing time, even the Bavarians were already with five counters behind Dortmund, which has now taken the lead again with a point of precedence.
And thus Kimich assessed with a eyelid positive that the public debate on the allegedly unbeatable Bavarians has now ended.
"Yes, that's good," said the national player.
It's a good time for the league.
DFB Boss in Shossline: Özil-Cousa: Sharp Attack of Erdogan on Grindel
With heavy objections, Turkish President Erdogan launches an extension of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany.
Although DFB President Grindel sees errors, he defends the alliance line.
Now a new post should be created.
Berlin - On different stages Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought for the height of the controversy in the permanent theme of Mesut Özil.
After the Turkish President of State strongly criticised the handling of the former world champion in Germany of the opening of the large Ditib mosque in Cologne, the DFB leader defended the alliance line.
On early Sunday morning, the personally severely attacked grid at the Mainzer ZDF "Sportstudio" announced the consequences of the cause.
"In the future - because we also have many players with migration backgrounds in the U-munitions - we have to draw very precise conclusions that something does not happen," said the 57-year-old and wants to win a national player without migration background as further integration officers.
At the same time, Grindel reiterated that Erdogan did not stand for the values of football and DFB.
With sharp words, he had launched racism against Özil and Ilkay Gündogan.
Our born and raised Mesut Özil and our Ilkay in Germany.
They have excluded them from this society because they were allowed to photograph with me in England," Erdogan said on Saturday in the Domstadt.
To be honest, as your President, I could not deny that our two young men who have risen to the German national team have been excluded.
Grindel referred to Gündogan's statement that he felt "reasonably treated by the DFB" by photos of the two of them with Erdogan.
At the same time, he announced that he wanted to present himself to players in the future.
That someone says, "If I win, I'm German, if I lose, I'm migraine - it's not going to work.
"That he has such an impression, I'm very sorry," Grindel said.
We'd have had to defend more in the middle of the day, I've always said that.
A basis for a return of Özil to the national team does not seem to him either.
As a follow-up to the native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, who has family roots in Cameroon, will now be called an additional integration officer.
"If a person with no migration background clearly affects society and football and says, "The issue is important, we need to take care of it," it would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our associations on the spot where integration needs to work," Grindel said.
Despite the criticism of his person after the WM-out and the Özil affair, he wants to run again for the office next year as DFB President.
"I do my job and try to make it as good as it is," Grindel said.
Yearly builds three accidents within three hours
Coburg/Rödental - As reported by the police, the 75-year-old caused the accident on Friday between 10 and 1 p.m.
At first, the 75-year-old driver was approached by a lady at the red lamp in the area of Lauter's height.
She told the pensioner that he was driving against her car.
However, there was no exchange of staff as the 75-year-old couldn't find the lady in the parking lot anymore.
A short time later, a telephone message went to the police about a driver coming off the street and driving against a traffic jam.
According to this, the man didn't want the police on the spot and then drove away from it.
Then the redhead drove home.
However, the tenant in his residence, where he has lived for decades, has made procedures and when turning a construction vehicle.
Finally, the police were able to find him and stop him.
His car showed obvious accident damage.
The 75-year-old made a wrong impression and couldn't think of many more.
The damage is around 1300 euros.
Moorbrand in Meppen: Still almost 1000 use forces in use.
About four weeks after the outbreak of the Moorbrand on a federal fire site in the Emsland, 980 active forces are still engaged in the work of destruction.
That was shared by the German army on Sunday.
As the situation continues to be stable according to a speaker, 70 honorary helpers have been withdrawn.
Another reduction in the number of active forces is planned, it says.
On the night of the sunday, an outer-earth fire was discovered and destroyed.
Last week the disaster was lifted, which was well called out a week before September 21st, because it was feared that the flames would endanger forests and settlements adjacent to wind and radio flight.
On Thursday it was said that an overcrowding of the fire on neighbouring congregations was no longer a threat.
On-the-spot attempts were made to get more than 1500 fires under control.
The Air Force continues to support the work on the Federal Defence Test Station at Meppen with a transport screwdriver.
There are also reconnaissance flights with drones of the Federal Defence.
On 2 and 5 October, according to the Bundeswehr, "Tornados" is scheduled to take off again.
The fire had been triggered by tesracets that had fired airbus technicians.
The smoke flag of the Moorbrand was temporarily up to 100 kilometres across northwestern Germany to Bremen.
On Monday, the Federal Defence will set up an action that takes away the damage messages.
First claims for damages had already been announced by hotel owners and holiday owners.
SPD Politicians: Johannes Kahrs married his friend
Johannes Kahrs (SPD, r) and his husband Christoph Rohde leave after their wedding the main church of St. Catherine in Hamburg.
Almost a year after the marriage came into force for all, the politician married his long-term friend in Hamburg.
They've been a couple for 25 years.
Hamburg - Almost a year after the marriage came into force for all, SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-standing friend Christoph Rohde.
On Saturday, they both gave themselves the jaword in Hamburg.
If a registered life partnership did not fall for them, Kahrs had previously said the "image" section.
If we get married, that's right.
He's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a political speaker of the SPD Bundestags fraction and one of the spokespersons of the Seeheim Circle, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage for homosexuals, Kahrs had performed an irretrievable survey on 30 June 2017.
He had thus proposed to the Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) that he be "stealed" on the subject.
"That was your Schabowski moment," he said, in response to the accidental announcement of the DDR frontier opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since 1 October 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
They had been able to register their lifelong partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example in the law of adoption.
Referendum started in Macedonia on new national names
In Macedonia, the tense referendum on a new name for this small Balkan state has begun.
Around 1.8 million voters will decide whether their country will be called North Macedonia in the future.
This is due to its equivalent northern province of neighbouring Greece.
As a means of printing, Athens had for almost three decades blocked any approach from Skopje to the EU and NATO.
If citizens are to agree with yes, they will also give the start-up committee for the Western integration of their country.
Elie Wiesel - The author who saves the Shoah from forgetting
The Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel would have become 90 years old on September 30.
The 1986 Nobel Peace Prize winner dies in the United States in 2016 and leaves behind a work that preserves the horrors of the Shoah for the neighborhood.
Switzerland launches electronic register for organ donors
The registry is intended to facilitate organ donation and relieve family members from stress situations.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs are still allowed to be taken with express consent, stressing Swiss transplantation.
(dpa) Switzerland starts an electronic register for organ donors this Monday.
This should facilitate organ donation and relieve family members from stress situations.
People who want to make their organs available in the event of death can register there.
Your wishes are then available in the case of Swiss transplant.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs - as in Germany - can only be taken with express consent - are still allowed to be taken up by Swiss transplantation.
It is assumed that 15 percent of Switzerland has a donation certificate, says Franz Immer, Director of the Swiss Transplant Foundation.
But only in five percent of the cases will a map be found at the crucial moment in possible donors.
In more than 60 percent of the conversations, the relatives do not know the wish of the deceased.
"Then they have to decide in the sense of the deceased, which is often very burdensome," says Always.
A similar registration system exists already in the United Kingdom.
In Germany there are considerations to store information on the possible organ donation on the hospital card, as stated by the spokesperson of the Federal Center for Health Education, Marita Völker-Albert.
"There is no register in which people can enter their wishes - pro or counter organ donation -," she says.
Federal Minister of Health Jens Spahn spoke for the reorganisation of the organ donation.
According to his proposal, everyone would first be considered as an organ donor unless he or his family objected.
Among other things, the Catholic Church denies it.
14-year-old student is a world champion in the mind-blowing
The 14-year-old student Tomohiro Iseda from Japan is the world champion in the field.
He spent the weekend in Wolfsburg against 39 competitors.
Martina Flame-Jasper shared it with the Science Museum Phaeno, the venue of the competition, on Sunday.
The 16-year-old Wenzel Grüß from Germany took the third place.
The youngest WM participant was a twelve-year-old Japanese student, the oldest 74-year-old pensioner from France, as chief judge Ralf Laue said.
The computer professor from Zwickau (Saxon) organizes the competition every two years.
For example: 14.130 214 x 17.981.82 or 57.809.355 + 28 x 16.448.333.
Since spectators were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon, with participants coming against guests from the audience with pocket calculator.
Wenzel's greeting from Lastrup demonstrated how he holds a ball with his head in the air when calculating.
He is one of seven Germans in the competition.
A total of 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for the competition.
Congratulations were two years ago when 14-year-olds were in Bielefeld.
With terms such as superhair, genius or wonder child, organizer Laue can begin little.
"He can train," he said.
Many participants practiced several hours a day.
In India or Singapore, there are even competitions targeted at stadiums.
The disciplines include, for example, the square rooting of six-digit numbers.
In terms of diversity, candidates receive surprise tasks for which they need to quickly find a solution strategy.
Here the Germans also had good chances, said the chief judge.
Otherwise, Asians are often in favour because they are already learning more intensive and with other effective methods in early childhood.
Intangible appeal: video with naked Serena Williams: It's about breast cancer early recognition
Tennis-Ass Serena Williams is shown by her emotional and sensitive side.
The 37-year-old wants to highlight breast cancer with this video and make herself strong for early detection.
It is about life and death, but also about courage and enlightenment.
Serena Williams sings up without the song "I Touch Myself" from the group "The Divines" - only their hands cover their own private places.
The singer Chrissy Amphlett died.
The emotional video is part of the "I Touch Myself" project, where breast cancer early detection can save life.
Serena Williams himself would have died almost a year ago.
At the birth of her daughter Alexis Olympia there were complications.
An emergency OP was initiated to save the baby's life.
Then blood clots were detected in Serenas Lunge in a subsequent CT.
Just in time...
Government wants to ban more extremist symbols
Vienna - The Federal Government plans a clear extension of the ban on the use of extremist symbols.
Next week, the Turkish-Blue Coalition will send a corresponding bill to the so-called "symbol-law".
This will clearly extend the number of terrorist or comparable groups that are included in the ban.
Polar cold air brings to the mountains in the West Neuschnee
For the first time in the West, Mrs. Holle protects her beds for the first time: Polare Cold Air arrives on Monday Vorarlberg, North Tyrol and Salzburg.
According to the meteorologists of the Central Centre for Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG), the snowfall limit falls at the beginning of the week to 1,500 to 1,200 meters - in narrow valleys it is able to cut down to about 1,000 meters by strong intensity, it said.
From the Bregenzerwald to the High Towers, it is estimated to be over 2,000 meters with 20 to 40 centimeters of neuschnee.
The road conditions are therefore wintered on higher roads (Arlbergpass, Timmelsjoch, Bieler Height, Bilnerpass, Gerlospass, Felbertouren, Großglockner Hochalpenstraße).
Farmers are allowed to start on Monday with the annual maintenance of the knick
Schleswig-Holsteins Farmers are allowed to begin their annual Knickcare on Monday.
The unique "green waves" in Germany have characterized the landscape of the Federal Forestland for about 200 years.
The trees and shrubs up to five meters wide are the last retreat spaces for many animals and plants.
Knicks connects living spaces scattered as corridors, over which the exchange of organisms can still work, as said by the managing director of the National Conservation Union of Germany (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwichowski.
Knicks are live snakes
The Knicks were arrested on the basis of a command of the Danish king Christian VI in 1766, who ruled over Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living branches" were not only fields and pastures, they also provided the farmers with firewood and bales for their trade houses.
From that time also comes his name "Knick": Through "Knicken" the eaters could develop the dense, hasty boundaries.
Today, between the North and the East Sea, some 45,000 kilometres of the hedges and give a picture of a woody, multi-structured landscape.
According to the NABU, they are currently used as a replacement living space of around 7,000 species.
In a kilometer of Knick, they could live up to 1800 different species and break up to 30 pairs of birds.
However, its ecologically important function can only be fulfilled if it is properly maintained in winter.
Otherwise, he cares for a light tree range that includes the wind protection effect in addition to species, Ludwichowski said.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, Knickcare may only be carried out outside the working hours of October to March.
After Tsunami on Sulawesi Indonesia talk about the situation on site
The local Radika Pinto describes the situation on site on the island of Sulawesi after earthquakes and tsunamis in the interview with the German Redaktions Network (RND):
Were you on site during the Tsunami?
No, I was just in Jakarta on Java Island.
When the earthquakes were, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I learned about Tsunami, I immediately made my way back to Sulawesi.
There I arrived on Sunday morning because I had to drive more than 20 hours after a flight, since the airport at Palu was closed at the time.
How is the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport so that supplies can also be imported.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast that were completely destroyed.
Our "World Vision" office has also been destroyed, but we have temporarily set up something where we have also brought other people.
Where do the people who live on Sulawesi stand now?
Many are surrounded by surrounding hills, on which they are still afraid of another tsunami and earthquakes and where they do not have access to water and food.
Some stand up in front of their houses, there are still neighbors.
Because many food shops and even the tanks are completely closed, people are partly food and gasoline.
The public service is completely downgraded, and the national government is helping.
A prison has also been destroyed, the prisoners are partially free and the search for them is difficult.
There are still many bodies around, many people have not yet been found and are missing.
How is communication and information provision going on on the island?
At the moment we received a phone call, but before that did not work and we only got information on the radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbors and others, from whom they do not know whether they are living and where they are staying because people were not at home during the earthquakes, but for example at work.
The Tsunami warning system did not work properly.
Do you have any information about this?
We don't know the reasons for this, but when the warning came, many thought "Okay, no tsunami" and then he came.
In other regions not hit by Tsunami, there was the lack of information that a Tsunami hit the region and they are driven to the surrounding mountains.
Is not an island like Sulawesi on the Pacific Ring prepared for earthquakes?
But there are earthquakes every day, but this was the worst.
We normally know how we react to earthquakes and also train evacuations.
But the complete infrastructure is broken down, the earthquake has hit a lot of people.
Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: VfB has to give up long on Aogo and Donis
Anastasios Donis and Dennis Aogo will miss the VfB Stuttgart with severe muscle injuries for a long time.
At 2:1 against Werder Bremen on Saturday, Aogo pulled a muscle fiber in the back of the left thigh, the football leaguer shared with him on Sunday.
At Donis, the doctors diagnosed a muscle fission in the upper jaw.
Both players are definitely no option against Hanover 96 on Saturday and will probably miss even after the following country game break.
The VfB Stuttgart did not give up a forecast of the fall-off time.
A muscle fission usually heals within six to eight weeks, a muscle fission usually heals somewhat faster.
Triumph of Hyperrealism at the San Sebastian Film Festival
San Sebastian - With the film Festival of San Sebastian closes the rains of the most prestigious European festivals annually.
All ties to the cinema can be summed up: 2018 was a remarkable year for the film.
After a convincing competition in Cannes with strong contributions from Europe and Asia and a Venice that could draw much attention to Oscar candidates from Hollywood, San Sebastian also provided one of his best competitions in recent years.
On Sunday morning, the firefight Olching tried to catch an injured entrapment.
However, the action went on for some time.
Even a boat came to use.
Olching - Walking walkers at the Olchinger Lake fell on a white, injured duck on Sunday morning.
She stopped at the water station.
To help the animal, the passengers called the police and the firearm.
However, the first attempts to catch the ent went wrong.
Despite the injury, she was able to avoid the forces again and again.
At the end, she ran off to the lake.
With a rescue boat, the firearm was able to circle the animal and push it back to land, where it was then stowed into a transport box after almost an hour by a fireman with a controlled grip.
The duck injured on the breast was then brought to the animal clinic of the LMU to Oberschleitsheim.
But according to the first estimates, their chances of survival are less.
Biathlet Julian Eberhard plays the WM Medallion
The place was four at Olympia Biathlet Julian Eberhard long in the stomach.
In the coming winter, the Saalfeldener wants to imitate the missing precious metal at the WM in Östersund.
The last shot cost the 31-year-old in the Pyeongchang Olympics the one near the medal.
Seven decimal seconds were missing at the end of bronze.
"I have allowed me consciously time to process this," says Eberhard when opening the MyGym fitness studio in his hometown of Saalfelden.
A medal was the goal, I was in top shape, but it just didn't want to be.
More motivated is the pinzgauer to imitate the missing precious metal in the new season: "The goal can only be to return with the Constitution to a major event to win something.
Sometime you'll have to guess.
The WM loop in Östersund (SWE) is located in Eberhard: "I've already closed the track to my heart," he recalls with joy at his fourth world Cup place in the individual race last year.
Immediately after Olympia, he celebrated the only single victory for Austria in the mass launch of Kontiolahti (FIN) in the last world Cup.
With the staff he went to Oslo (NOR) on rank two.
Brett Kavanaugh: FBI investigation in the turbo tempo
The time is extremely short and the number of planned acquisitions is severely limited.
With an FBI investigation into the turbo tempo, the Republicans in the US Senate want to secure the thin majority for the court candidates who are in dispute about the need for proposals, Brett Kavanaugh.
President Donald Trump has set a deadline for the investigators until Friday to clarify the relevant events that are more than 30 years away.
The latest turning in the drama around the call of Kavanaughs accompanied by a cultural struggle was triggered on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing of Kavanaugh and the first prosecutor Christine Blasey Ford, in whose course the lawyer was angry against the opposition democrats, the Senate's Judicial Committee should free the way for the final confirmation of the juror's conservative judge at the U.S. Supreme Court.
The majority of the Republicans seemed secure when Senator Jeff Flake suddenly declared against his original announcement that he would agree, but requested an FBI investigation.
After a tumultuous scene, his friends agreed to join him.
President Trump, who had still referred to the heavy performances on Thursday as "Beschiss", first saw further attacks on women and said, on the contrary, "Happiness in the Unhappiness".
In this way the last doubts could be cleared out, he said.
Later, Trump attacked the Democrats in an election campaign because they refused to say, "They are trying to block and destroy".
Trump ordered an FBI investigation in the case of Kavanaugh
The White House has also extremely limited the powers of the investigator.
One will aim to investigate the well-known allegations of two women, no longer, said a government representative to the Wall Street Journal: "They don't go on a fishing trip".
According to the "New York Times", only four witnesses are to be heard.
The mobile radar device installed in a "civil vehicle" of the town municipality of Ried for monitoring the Tempolimitis is stationed on the garden street according to the city municipality from Monday, 1 October.
There is also the Federal School Centre.
The municipality also operates several fixed-installed radar boxes.
FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: You've felt the fear
Trainer Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated the first season victory against Mainz.
The relief on Schalke is great after the first season.
Nevertheless, against Mainz, the time factor also played a role.
Gelsenkirchen - Meanwhile it is well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist in football games.
That was no different in the home game against Mainz 05.
"I've seen every ball inside.
And there were many corners and lots of balls in our penal room," said the sports director of Schalke 04 and breathed.
Finally, the King's Blue was still able to bring the almost 1:0 against the Rhines over the time and thus bring the first season victory under roof and branch.
It could have been different.
After the leadership by Alessandro Schöpf 11 of the team of Chief Trainer Domenico Tedesco had given security to Tedesco: "In sum, the first half was good, both playful and pressuring".
Don't actually create a headball reminder
"The last ten minutes have felt like two hours," Heidel said. "If the team was only half as nervous as I was on the bank, I can understand that."
The boys were afraid to give it out of their hands and therefore kept retreating.
And defend with man and mouse against Mainz.
To save the first three counters of the season.
"We all liked a huge stone from the heart," said the Creator, who did not share in it with his headball hit: "I am actually the worst headball player in man's creation."
But in the end, it's only the victory.
The relief was felt throughout the arena, of course also at Tedesco.
"We wanted to start printing in the initial phase and make a firework out of it," Schalkes chief coach said.
The victory was important.
Finally, we can enjoy a few hours.
I'm very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We have played intelligently, quietly and courageously, so we have to deal with parties in 90 minutes
The probably biggest lack of afternoon: King's Blue missed it, rather for a clearer relationship to worry.
The possibilities for this were finally there, for example by the strong Yevhen Konplyanka, which twice hit the latte 59./72. or Amine Harit 62.
"Then it wouldn't have become a sitter," said Tedesco, "you've already felt a little bit of fear."
That's why I'm glad we won.
So he wasn't the only switch.
Fishbachau: Smoke column in Leitzachtal 2 km visible
The smoke wasn't to be overlooked.
From about two kilometers away, a hiker in the Leitzachtal observed a fire on Sunday at 1.30 p.m.
Now the police are finding out.
Fishbachau - The Causes Found Police and Firearms Soon: An unknown man had set fire on a two-square-meter area on the Gschwänner Berg Müll.
According to the police, it appeared that he had been watching the fire for a long time, but left the mud unattended.
And that near the forest.
30 Fish bachauer firefighters were engaged in the separation and destruction.
The police are now finding out because of the firefighting.
Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: A discussion on eye height
The author, Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani, stands before them.
He has followed the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild repeatedly.
"I've been tasked with bringing interesting people to Greven for many years," explains the founder and chairman of the "Reckenfelder Reffs" - that association who cooperates in the direction of the evening with the Alliance of Cultural Policy.
El-Mafaalani rises very slowly into the reading, describes the writing process of the book, talks about how difficult it was to explain the subject clearly.
With a lot of gestures, hand-held numbers and some joke, he brings listeners one of the most controversial topics: migration and integration.
Why are there growing conflicts despite successful integration?
The Syriac author serves to answer the question of a metaphor.
On one table the German society sits, on the cat table the migrants of the first generation.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to go to the table.
The third generation of migrants was born in Germany, they were always sitting on the big table and want to agree.
This leads to conflicts.
Therefore, it is not a matter of whether one is politically aligned to the right or to the left, but, "Am I for or against an open society?" he stresses.
First of all, then the round of discussion is always going on.
And there's a need to talk.
A Afghan refugee reported from his perspective, telling two teachers how they saw successful or unsuccessful integration among students.
El-Mafaalani stands before, not on stage, a picture of the discussion: it is at eye height.
The sociology professor does not insist on his opinion, stressing that he speaks from the average, not from individual halls.
He is pleased that there is interest in the subject, because "only when we understand what the problem is, we can find solutions," says El-Mafaalani.
Even during the next hour, he still had an open ear for the questions of the guests and also in the foyer, in prepared Kurdish specialties, continued intensively.

Construction in Landsham: 100 Applications for 20 plots
The need is obviously huge: over 100 interested parties have applied for the purchase of one of the property in Landsham-South.
The municipality of Pliening has sold the first plots in the Landsham-South New Building area on the free market.
This is shared by Mayor Roland Frick.
In addition, the application phase for those 20 plots is completed, which offers the municipality with cheaper conditions or prices - similar to the previous domestic model.
Good 100 applications have been received, said Frick.
"The documents are currently being examined" with regard to the application criteria, completeness and accuracy.
According to the Plieninger Mayor, it was the aim of having the candidate rankings for the 20th estate by the end of the year and presenting them to the municipality.
Then the surrender can take place.
In total, 50 plots for single and double houses are created on the area south of Landsham and four areas for multi-family houses with an estimated eight housing units each.
The resolution is now as good as finished, the roads and roads are to be asphalted soon.
A single plot as well as two of the multi-family houses belong to a private person, the rest of the municipality of Plening.
It sells most of it on the free market, 20 plots in the social-consistency model.
According to Frick, the two multi-family homes of the municipality are to be built as a affordable living space.
With a total of 16 apartments supported by the state.
Space for 200 people
Grave is estimated to be a living space for about 200 people on the surface of the New Landsham-South area.
Not only that: Now, at the beginning of October, according to Frick, there is the start for the new construction of a children's place.
This includes three child-garden and three crippling groups as well as a multi-purpose space.
The opening is scheduled for September 2019, at the beginning of the next child garden year.
So Schalkes Naldo also manages "big sport" on the bank
For the third time not in the beginning itself: nevertheless, Naldo thanks Schalke-trainer Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues for the third time, not in the Schalker Startelf, but on the exchange bank, the understanding would have been great for many people if the almost two meters Brazilian had spoken correctly of the hunger of the soul.
But when the Schalker players gathered after the 1:0 victory over the FSV Mainz 05 as usual in the middle circle and thanked Chief Coach Domenico Tedesco for all his professions, the 36-year-old, called all the simplicity half Naldo, turned and said, "We have to thank Coach!"
"It was very emotional, it was a great sport," Tedesco later said about the reaction of his vice-capittain, who, despite his renewed reservist service, did not have a role to play.
Probably Naldo, who was celebrated as the best switch in the past season, knows that he is actually not on the landing track with his coach - but for good reason gets a break.
A reason called "tax control".
It wasn't easy to tell him
"It wasn't easy for him to tell you this, I'm telling you quite frankly," Tedesco reported from the moment he told Naldo that he wasn't in the beginning.
He's an important player, he's an important person.
But it's always about the thing, it's about the club," Tedesco founded the step.
Naldo played against Bayern and Porto for 90 minutes.
He's 36 years old.
It is important that at present all can penetrate.
And that we all keep in the boat," Tedesco explained the rotation that Naldo has recently won.
And he responded to the Brazilians with the wisdom of his advanced age: he also proved himself an exemplary team player at the bank.
The mood in Austria's industry continued to accelerate its valley travel in August compared to the euro area.
The purchase manager index (PMI) was 46.7 points on a 37-month stage.
However, throughout Europe Austria has the third best mood behind Ireland and the Netherlands, the Market Institute announced on Monday its survey of 3,000 companies.
Unlike in Austria, the euro area's SMEs rose by 1.1 to 45.1 points, but the index is still in the 13th month in a row under the 50-counter brand, meaning growth.
The only Irish industry broke this threshold in August with 50.9 points.
Finally, the Greeks (42.1 points).
In Germany, France and Spain, the mood barometer fell, however, slower than in the months before.
In Spain, the index reached the highest level with 40.0 points since March.
"The slightly weakened traffic could mean that the worst was over," said market economist Rob Dobson.
However, the industry - in the third quarter anyway - remains growth brake number one.
A quick return to the growth zone is not in sight: exports to the eurozone have fallen as strong as since November 2011.
The companies therefore constructed the seventh month as a result of positions.
In China too, industrial production fell stronger in August than at first.
The mood barometer fell from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points.
Experts had first expected 47.8 points.
The purchasing manager index is based on representative surveys of 3,000 European industrial companies.
These include developments in turnover, employment, stocks and prices.
Tuchels PSG team succeeds in winning the eighth league game
29. September 2018 at 19:45
Nice Trainer Thomas Tuchel runs with Paris Saint-Germain in France's Football Championship from victory to victory.
At the OGC Nice, the title defender won two hits by Superstar Neymar with 3:0 (1:0) and was also successful in the eighth league game.
Last year, in France, Olympique Lyon had placed such a good start in the game.
The Brazilian Neymar brought the PSG into command after 22 minutes and ended in the post-second period.
Christopher Nkunku (46.) provided for the interim 2:0.
Thus Paris also won the general test for the leading second Champions League group game against the Red Star Belgrade on Wednesday.
At 2:3 in Liverpool, Tuchels team had to take up the only mandatory play base in this season.
