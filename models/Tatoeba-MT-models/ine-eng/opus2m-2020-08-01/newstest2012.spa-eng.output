Parliament did not support an amendment to free Tymoshenko
The Ukrainian Parliament has today rejected the proposal to repeal the amendment of the section of the Penal Code condemning opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko.
The amendment would open the door to the excartion of the Minister's expression, but the parliamentarians rejected the proposal to reduce the penalties for economic crimes in the second reading.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison by the alleged signing of an agreement with Russia that was detrimental to Ukraine on the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not yet final; the Court of Appeal has an obligation to review it in December.
Tymoshenko was convinced that it was a political revenge of the regime, and even in the West there were doubts about the impartiality of the court.
The proposal to withdraw paragraph 365 of the Penal Code with which the former Prime Minister was convicted was supported by 147 Members in the vote.
For its approval, 226 votes were required.
Libya's Victory
The story of the Libyan liberation, or of the Libyan rebellion, already has its losers.
Muammar el-Gaddafi was buried in a secret place in the desert and without him there is no war.
Determines who the winner is
As is customary in the region, Islamists have won the elections, but now it is a matter of diluting whether it is moderate or radical
The National Transitional Council has brought into force the traditional law, the Sharia, which we already know in a certain way.
Libya will become a crime-free country, because thieves will be cut off.
Women can already forget to emancipate and apostates waiting for their execution and so forth.
Instead of the dictator's person, society, made up of war tribe, will be united by the Koran.
In Libya there will be an order that we cannot even imagine and certainly cannot.
However, our way of life is not the only or objectively the best and probably did not agree with the Libyans.
True, it is not surprising that the Islamic fighters will accept the help of the unfaithful dogs gratefully.
The only justification was that, from its point of view, NATO attacks did not lead them to a U.S. general, but great is Allah, whose greatness they celebrated after each successful intervention.
When winnings are sought in Libya, the West is not among them.
We are trapped in a shooting of what Islamists and our politicians are serving to get rid of a dictator in the person of a political ally without guarantees of benefit.
After the recent bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we did not occupy Libya militaryly.
In this case, the locals do not have a problem expelling the "crossed"
But will the oil tankers be able to deal with the Libyan black gold only with good words?
It is quite possible that not, but it may eventually be that the West can assume protection of human rights.
As long as the followers of the Sharia don't cross us.
Starts a New Age of Crisis
France and the rest of Europe go to search for investors
A statistical torbellin has spread throughout Europe
Individual States have published their GDP data for Q3.
The Czech economy has stagnated during the inter-quarter period, while France and Germany have grown.
However, the bond market today has broken records.
Investors are no longer only established in Italy, but also in Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical offices of the Eurozone, Germany, the Czech Republic and other European countries have already published their preliminary estimates of economic growth in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP grew by 0.5%, France's GDP by 0.4%
Both countries have made the second quarter data public, in Germany it has improved more than expected (0.3 per cent growth instead of 0.1 per cent) although in France there was a slight reduction of 0.1 per cent (the original data were talking about stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 per cent in the third quarter of this year.
However, during the inter-quarter period, gross domestic product (GDP) has been stagnated and, according to the ČSU, the trend towards gradual deceleration in growth of economic development has been consistent.
The results are even worse than the predictions of analysts.
Main events:
In the interim, the Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter of this year, but four-monthly it has stagnated.
In the third quarter, the German economy, according to previous and seasonally recalculated data, grew by 0.5 per cent.
The eurozone economy and also the European Union, between July and September and compared to the previous quarter, grew by 0.2%, which is consistent with the expectations of analysts.
The Greek economy has fallen by 5.2% per year.
The interest of their ten-year bonus is 28.45%.
The interest of the Italian and Spanish bonuses has grown to critical limits.
The problem also starts to affect Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc.
The interests of Czech bonuses at ten years of age are maintained by 4 per cent, although the situation is worsening in the area.
There are voices in Germany saying that the ECB should finally grant loans.
The Czechs are classified for the Eurocopa.
They won 1:0 and celebrate the ranking with a premium of 200 million.
The football team meets with the toughest performance of the whole season!
In Montenegro, thanks to the excellent Czech and brilliant porter Petr Jiráček, victory was given by 1:0.
The Czech team, along with a good dose of luck in the second time, was very much in favour of the attacks of the local team, so that the European championship will not be missed.
IHNED.cz followed the party's development in a detailed report.
There was almost no emotion in the first half and a good dose of luck in the second.
The Czech team, thanks to the collapse of the local team towards the end, as well as the excellent game of Czech and heroic Jiráček, won by 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrated its ride to the European Championship.
Due to the correct Czech defence, the Montenegrins did not press up to the second half.
The two injured members of the party were Damjanovic and Vučinić, who let go of two major occasions.
In addition, thanks to General Petr Čech, the Czech eleven will not miss the European Cup meeting, so the national football clubs will receive approximately 200 million crowns.
A good offensive game has been played since the first few minutes.
Both teams worked only to keep the lines and played nothing more around the center of the field.
There was no pressure from local players in the first half, Patadones to the other field in defense, just what the defense was supposed to avoid.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country's nuclear programme.
They formed a human shield.
Several hundred university students formed human shields around nuclear facilities in Iran.
They want to express their support for their country ' s nuclear programme in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
The students began praying on Tuesday at noon before the facilities and then they sent death slogans to the U.S. and Israel.
Several hundred university students formed human shields on Tuesday in the Iranian city of Isfahan around the nuclear technology center where they work with uranium.
They intend to demonstrate their willingness to defend their country's nuclear programme with their own lives.
In a recent report, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) noted that Iran, according to all indications, is in a hurry to achieve nuclear weapons.
Israel is talking about a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
The students began to pray in the afternoon before Isfahan's nuclear facilities and then launched death slogans against the U.S. and Israel.
In the event of an attack, whose aim would be to paralyze the Iranian nuclear programme, it would be achieved, according to Israeli sources, not only the central Isfahan, but also the installations of Natanz, where uranium is enriched.
Daily menu of an obese child: don't breakfast and dinner stuffed
Over one third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 have overweight problems, where overweight affects 9 per cent of the school population and obesity affects 5%.
Obese children come from most families with a lifestyle that is not healthy, according to current research.
It is again demonstrated the importance of the environment where it grows for healthy development of the person, as well as the models that serve as reference.
At the table, obsessive children, for example, are fed at least twice as often as children with normal weight.
For dinner, more than 19% of obese had had fried potatoes the day before the analysis, which is linked to the prevention program "obesity is not a coincidence".
In overweight children families there is no custom to practice sports, which is applicable to most current families, where only 15 per cent of children responded that their parents, at least once a week, have time for physical exercise.
Survey of 900 children
The survey was conducted at the end of last year's school year and participated in the same almost 900 basic education children from all over the Czech Republic.
It was already the second edition of the program "obesity is not a coincidence", which supports the General Health Insurance Company and the Unilever company.
So far, more than 12,000 children have participated in the project from 4th to 8th.
An adequate diet and plenty of exercise in the family are determinants, which significantly reduce the number of overweight children and even obesity.
"Only half of the children surveyed have responded that they have five daily meals according to the regime: breakfast, lunch, food, dessert and dinner, which is one of the basic conditions for a healthy diet," he gathers one of the results of the survey.
No breakfast, but with a set for dinner
Experts warn that, in healthy development, details are also important, such as having a fixed time for family breakfast.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23% of school families have breakfast at the same time.
In most families, each one has a single breakfast.
But the worst thing was to find out that in 10% of households there was no breakfast.
Breakfast, however, is the basis for a proper daily diet.
The study shows that in the families of obese children, fried potatoes are consumed much more often.
Almost all - regardless of weight - drink fresh sweet daily (70%).
Generally, more than 40 per cent of the children surveyed are sports, however, among their parents this result is reduced to less than half, only 15 per cent.
Make Your Diet
The next phase of the study enabled selected horses (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 colleges) to create their own diets from all possible offers according to their tastes and opinions.
"The food preferences of Czech children aged between 12 and 15 years from the point of view of healthy food are far from ideal."
Among its favorite foods are pasta, meat and sweets
"It is especially alarming the popularity of sweet refreshments," warns the final report of the study.
As the main food, the palm is taken by the paste and it follows closely to the bird's flesh.
In practice, children always reject legume and taste for fish and vegetables is very low.
Changes to Healthy Habits
At the same time, the study shows that children are willing to change their eating habits if they receive accurate information.
"In the control group of the participants in the study, who filled the questionnaire after finishing the prevention program "obesity is not an accident", there was in many cases an important change in favor of the principles of healthy food," the study's results point out.
He called attention, for example, to sweet refreshments, where many children would begin to prefer normal and running water.
Children would also choose more frequently in the questionnaire poultry meat and fish for main food and would restrict sweet food consumption and flour derivatives.
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, professionals support
In the introduction, How do the stylists learn, I already complained a little that the initial lessons were already quite loaded.
I had no idea how that would go.
Conferences of three professionals from the branch, how to dress up to problematic characters and, in addition, a seminar on how it works in the world of the show.
And it'll be worse.
The closer the final exams, more information and practical tasks await us
And although the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, there's no longer an affiliate.
We have studied with the director, Alena, (in the course there is no man) how to dress a woman who does not have a perfect symmetry.
And so is the great majority.
Someone's short, someone has a stylized figure without the right curves and someone suffers overweight.
The stylist needs to know optically soften broad shoulders, extend a neck or recreate the necessary curves
We have been given certain tricks about how to highlight the body of women of the type Jennifer López, of huge breasts and chairs but tight waist and at the same time do not dress it in too challenging a way
If, for example, the difference between the belt and the chair is so much that the heel or pants are not adapted, it is worth making at least one piece of extra-measured fabric.
No doubt they will not repent, for the garment that feels perfectly unforgivable.
With a moderate fall you will feel much better than with one that doesn't stop moving, getting up, dancing on your waist, etc.
The stylized body can be allowed to wear clothes with folds, ornaments, embroidered or flagged.
There are certainly many different types of information and bodies, so I am glad that I have all week to put all this information in my head.
And even so, I'm afraid with the assigned task, I already have more than enough.
Each participant in the course has been assigned two famouss, to whom two clothing should be designed: one for the day and the other for the night.
The current aspect, the style of fashion appropriate to the person in question, must be taken into account.
I've been "dressed" to Miranda Kerr, maybe you know Victoria's Secret campaign.
I cry inside, it is much better for me than, for example, Britney Spears or Christina Agülera, who will last have consumed about a hundred kilos (please, take into account the exaggeration), or the youngest Selena Gomez.
We have to cut them off from the magazines or search them online and print them, and then graph them.
The moodboard, which is what is called the complete result, also expresses our personal style and our relationship with graphic design.
It is also important to think about the graphic part of stylism.
The stylist, therefore, saw not only physically but also, for example, the product pages in the magazines (specific topics such as trends, bags, blankets, etc.).
That's what the designer Mario Kameník told us about.
But all of this is for Sunday.
The stylist must have a global vision.
The three specialists invited the conference on Saturday with information about all kinds of bodies.
The fashion designer Honza Pokorny, the fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to win this.
And a good stylist knows how to work with the same dress in different ways.
Variability is, in this case, fundamental.
Thus, such gabardina (or, as they say in English, trench-coat) can be dressed in the classic with cows and shirts, but it also serves to dress the naked body with heels shoes and photograph it as if it were actually a dress.
Or it's enough to straighten it up and up your neck to get a completely different image.
"Judge with it," he insisted.
What is most valuable is the following advice: "To start working, you need to first know all the rules".
"Then you can break them," said Jakub.
Finally, I am clear why we memorize all these formulas, what is combined with what, why, if it turns out that we find different results in fashion magazines.
That's not talking about the parades.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I know that a stylist has to have more types of clothes in the reserve he wants to photograph.
So for a fashion story that has ten pages (so ten outfits), you have to have ready, ready to use, at least fifteen.
And also that the photos of the clothes work in combination with other clothes, all of them different from those used in reality.
All of this has to be taken into account when designing the outfit.
Honza Pokorny assured us that the image and style they alone represent, in many cases, half the success.
Just look at Madonna, which is not exactly an extraordinary singer, but the image and the marquetine have made her a world star.
In the Czech Republic, for the time being, there is still no clear tendency to use the services of the stylists.
Even the famous characters also find it useless (I just have my skills, my physical aspect doesn't matter so much).
And when someone asks us for our services, we have to take into account that it is very likely that they will tell us a very different size from their real (less).
Then it just remains to Google and find out if the journals of the heart have already written about the subject, if a certain celebrity has swallowed/scattered, etc.
On Sundays, Honza and Mario insisted that the stylist not enough to focus on fashion, but that he has to understand outfit.
During your work, you must especially communicate with the people you saw, so it is essential to be a good psychologist.
You know how to value people, you don't miss them, you defend their opinions.
"When a director hires you to classify his dress and complete it with beautiful clothes, you can't pick up and take away everything he had and say, "Hey what horror"".
"Find at least a few things you can weigh and recommend so that someone can put them," says Mario.
He also showed us that everything must end up in the so-called "placovka", that is, the work bag.
This is fixed around the belt and there are all the necessary tools.
They are objects such as tiaras, chitapelus, or impermissible. There is also a nylon thread (which serves the stylist during the session of product photos such as bags or hats), special pins of glue before, if it is larger (the screws and other types of hooks are not allowed, because they could damage the fabric), or a sewing game.
To avoid passive listening and putting something into practice, we have learned to cover the floor of our shoes.
Even during the photo sessions in the study, on a flat surface, the floor could be damaged and much more the outside could be damaged.
And we did nothing but wear and wear.
We couldn't touch our shoes with our boots so we wouldn't hurt them by accident.
So I had to be very skilled.
Mario has given me the joy of praising my job without reservations.
The truth is, I don't get very good at these skills.
This is only a small part of all those we have heard during the weekend, in the second part of the course.
I've already realized that to devote myself to professional stylism is not a pink road, but it gives me exactly the same as people say.
In Need for Speed: The Run competes all over America.
Review
A journey, in principle unoccupied, complicates itself because of a series of improper neglects of a routine journey during the morning shift.
To some extent it was achieved to meet expectations, but that was not worth anything, if indeed it was not intended to do anything extraordinary.
The new delivery, which is added to the title The Run, raised high expectations already before its stage.
He promised that he would give new air to the old racing saga Need for Speed and, as a result of the show, it appears as a game that should not end up being another kind of action without more.
We are also curious to know how the scenes would be inserted, where the main character descends from the car and walks by his own foot.
As is usually the case in the NFS series, the results did not vary much in terms of what we expected.
There are courses that can be given by acceptable, but in the total computer points are lost due to absurd errors, which have already been appearing in the series for years.
It is not really possible to name mistakes, but rather the incomprehensible disengagement of programmers.
The adventure starts very well.
You are introduced into a story, whose protagonist, Jack, has certain personal problems; to solve them, you are offered to participate in an illegal career throughout America.
You sit on the west coast in San Francisco, and your mission is to get to New York first.
The idea is to offer something interesting.
The route is divided into ten stages and then into more than fifty races.
From this it is shown that each race takes place on a different path and the stages are located in different environments, which are quite diverse and interesting.
Thus, one does not even have the feeling that the game always offers the same.
Some of the environments are even pleasant to see, although the technical level of the graph is equivalent to that of previous series deliveries.
So it's nothing in the other world.
But walking through the desert, the autumn landscape or the high snow-covered mountains produce a very pleasant visual effect.
In addition, the races are diversified from time to time by an atypical element.
So, for example, in the desert you will find a sandstorm that decreases visibility.
On the other hand, in the mountains you have to be careful not to bury an avalanche.
According to that, each race is very well developed.
There's only a couple of models, but that's enough.
For a moment, you try to advance to a number of required rivals (normal in a classic career), then you try to earn time (classic chronic pain) and then you expect a duel against one opponent.
In the middle of all this, the police sometimes appear, which doesn't do but make things even more difficult.
The news is the landscapes outside the car.
Interactive animations are presented when Jack, in most cases, has to escape someone and you have to help him, always pressing the right button at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are many less landscapes in the game than I could expect (in particular there are only three).
But the final result is positive, because this element does not get upset and, in the context mentioned above, it is one of the elements that makes the game more interesting.
The driving model follows the traces of the previous episodes.
That means that today is no longer a big thing, but you can't say it's bad.
If you're looking for a realistic simulation, you can look elsewhere.
But a career designed with a lot of action is quite suitable for this driving style, although we can find something better among the competition games.
So far, everything's fine.
But problems arise after a certain time.
Unlike the correct driving models, the same does not happen with collisions.
Of such games you cannot expect to recreate complicated deformations and collisions, but in fact before a hit against any object, you cannot predict how your car will react, with which everything is not in order.
It is typical that when making a very adjusted advance or circulating the car with a normal traffic, there are only slight rocks, but in other almost identical situations, your car ends up making uncontrollable pirates.
The even is completely destroyed.
Thanks to the restorative system, there are no big problems, but it can put you in a bad mood.
The resets are programmed in such a way that when you suffer an accident or get out of the track, the game brings you back to the last rescue point on the track.
However, only five sets are available in each race.
If you consume them all, you have to restart the race from the beginning.
So it's only a help in case something's wrong, but it's not much to trust.
Sometimes, not even the reset helps, it only helps to learn the given stage of memory.
A great disadvantage of the game is that the same facts are repeated in different places.
In some curves, for example, you have to enter in a specific way; otherwise, they are impossible to take.
Sometimes you will find yourself somewhere "civil" vehicles always with the same configuration, even though you are the first, fifths or you arrive five minutes before or after.
This makes you angry especially in situations, when you see two cars going to meet in opposite directions, your opponent goes ahead without problems, but when you get there, you have to turn around or stop.
It's the same when you get here, because it's programmed because the "sudden" will always happen in front of your noses.
The opponents also have another advantage.
During the game you will arrive at places where, regardless of the moment, you will always be promoted by the same opponent in the same place.
In addition, this happens at the end of the game, in a long bridge, which is even more shocking.
Your opponent must arrive before you, at any price.
When he goes in front of you, he makes it difficult for you to see the cars coming forward, so at first you can make the car.
You can understand the idea of creating a game with maximum doses of suspension and adrenaline, but execution is so obvious that it will probably disappoint you soon.
And it's a shame, because even though the travel model is simple, the game is fun and with action, so it's often not possible to follow the details of what happens or where.
And it really doesn't matter, if the merit is taken the idea with fifty exclusive tracks or the ranking in the race so that it doesn't stop boring, or anything else.
An unusual idea is to change cars during the race.
You have to pay attention to the gas outlets next to the road, because right there you have to change your car, although in most cases you will have enough of what you have.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sports are suitable for urban areas, American strong cars for straight highways and ultra-port exotics for technical driving, for example, by mountain roads with curves.
In addition to the main narrative thread, there is also a series of parallel challenges, i.e. there are races in specific places you will know about the stories.
Here you will get not only medals, but also points of experience for your profile, which serves both challenges and stories.
When reaching the top level, the driver opens up to him several possibilities, beginning with the car and ending with funds for the profile.
At the same time, you have connected an online Autolog function, which compares your results with those of other players and provides other community functions.
One of the most difficult elements to understand is how the last race in history is made.
With the car you get to the metro tunnel (passe), where you put yourself in the dark by the roads (passe).
The speedometer marks you between 150 and 200 km/h (pass) and, suddenly, behind you comes the train from the metro and takes you forward without further notice.
In the editorial we will probably have a discussion about this for several days, about whether during the programming of the game no one thought even a little or if the real authors take us for a panda of fools.
The technical part of the game is nothing extraordinary, but at least the general visual effects result in most of the pleasant cases, sometimes even superlative.
So how sad it is that, at times the most tense, image quality is reduced and, at times, in a serious way.
This affects especially accidents where many participants are involved, when the image quality continues to be invalid.
The sound is good and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In order to please the majority of the youth group, the soundtrack belongs to the category "one of his father and his mother", but it can be assumed that no one would buy the game only for his music.
The final feeling of Need for Speed: The Run is therefore quite confused.
If the game is avoided absolutely stupid errors, we would have trouble asserting that The Run is the best NFS game in recent years.
Gives the feeling that the game is not over.
Entertainment is assured, but prepared because the mistakes will strike you in the eyes with the strength of airport reflectors.
The choirs at the University of Carolina will take part in the "Terciopelo Students" concert.
The joint celebration of the International Student Day and the anniversary of the Third Revolution as a musical experience will take place for the third time at the Festival of Academics.
During the same period, twenty corals from secondary and university centres will be presented.
The festival revolves around two concerts on 17 November.
"The University of Carolina has a high participation in the festival".
Among the current choirs are the Coral of the Faculty of Education and the Faculty of Humanities, the director Václav Hampl is in the festival committee," said the organization's manager, Jakub Čaloun.
The summit of the entire festival is the free entrance for all audiences to the concert of secondary choirs, which will be held on 17 March at 14 hours in front of the National Technical Library in Dejvice.
The program has the participation of the Czech jazzist Karel Rožička and his Celebration Jazz Mass.
The concert "Students of Terciopelo" will be held at the venues of the Municipal House in Vynohrady, where university choirs will participate, including the choir of the University of Carolina.
The Academic Festival aims not only to celebrate the International Students' Day and remember the 22nd anniversary of the Third Revolution, but also to present to the public coral music at the highest level and to promote collaborative creation among young people.

Ambassador to the EU, Vicenova:
The Czechs have a reputation for negative and Eurosceptic.
"The Lisbon Treaty has significantly affected the balance between individual institutions"
"I didn't expect a war without a quarter."
"It will take five, six years before the situation gets a little stable, calms down and the new players get used to their new roles," Milena Vicenová, a Czech ambassador at the Faculty of Law, said with conviction.
How can you not take seriously your "clearly and openly on Europe" motto, which you said in the first part of your conference, when you were able to describe each EU body and its relations with such precision and clarity, because it would be the envy of many speakers of the U.S. Faculty of Law.
Vice-President Herman van Rompuy also took on the work of the new permanent President of the European Council:
"The first comes the criticisms, that if it is insulting, a gray official, capable of taking on any role, but I have to say that he left everyone confused, because he takes on his roles to perfection."
"It is a man who can listen to members of the twenty-seven states, communicate with them and who has a clear view of where the EU should go."
The new post of representative of Foreign and Security Policy is explained from the question: "Who is this EU? What number can I call it?" This is therefore an important step towards the unification and clarification of political union towards States such as China or India.
No one wants to ban Olomouc cheese
Vice-President has also dealt with the next agenda, followed and will follow the European Council in the near future.
The Czech Presidency was a success two years ago.
The Czechs took care of the emerging economic crisis, resolved the gas crisis and organized a summit for the Eastern Association.
The fall of the government at that time was identified as a very negative aspect, which seriously affected the Czech Republic.
Czech representation in the EU has many commitments at the moment.
In the words of the ambassador: "a good abbot", not only the presidency, but also the financial crisis, which is now being dealt with.
On the other hand, the EU budget must be adopted for seven years, caused by the current economic situation, much more complicated.
If the budget is simpler and more effective, what sectors will have priority, what countries will receive greater support and what less? That is something that will be present on the agenda of the next meeting.
The Ambassador also recalled his main words, with which he came to Europe: "About Europe with clarity".
"The truth is, I don't like the ugly abbreviations, foreignisms or ferrets that people don't understand."
"How can a citizen understand that in Brussels the peppers are not really invented the curved or round peppers, bananas of various sizes or that no one is going to ban Olomouc cheese?".
It also aims to benefit more from the EU's environment and to bring more Czech citizens closer to the European institutions.
Europe of Speeds is waiting for us
According to the ambassador, the Czechs are famous for Eurosceptics and people are more likely to see the negative aspects than the positive ones.
He also regretted the low participation of Czechs in the European institutions.
Guilty is a lot of factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivation messages, but also the little support of the Czechs.
In addition to the success of the Czech Presidency, emphasis was placed on the strength and collaboration of the Visegrad Group.
"I believe that when a Pole and a Hungarian comes to me and approaches me with a Slovak, a Frenchman next to me says to me, "What, have you already stayed, those of the Visegrad Group?", and it is seen that no grace is given to him."
In the future, the EU, according to Vice-Presidents, is expected to have long-lasting budgetary policy rules for the Member States.
It is perceived as something very real of the concept of both speeds, if not more, in Europe than the new "European Federation".
"We have countries in the Eurozone and countries outside the Eurozone."
"We have the Schengen area and we also have the enhanced cooperation procedure."
"It was said for the first time that only the countries that wanted and did not, who remained outside, cooperated."
"These procedures will be increasingly and will strengthen Europe at both speeds," Vicenová is expected.
In this regard, he also stressed the role of the Czech Republic and Herman van Rompuy in the implementation of the principle, according to which all issues affecting the EU as a whole should be debated between the Member States, not only among the members of the Eurozone.
Fire history:
The innovative IBM starts its second century of existence
If someone were to look for a term that would define IBM's strategy very precisely, the nearest would be "long-term".
For the general public, IBM is the symbol of a technological revolution, a company that is perceived as current and, however, has been over a hundred years since its founding.
The basis of this longplacist character was set by the first head of the firm, visionary Thomas J. Watson Mr.
He has already come up with the motto that many of the world's problems have solutions if people are willing to think.
His motto "think!" became his seal, about which he will build the life of the future giant (it was also the title of an internal magazine that IBM began publishing in 1935).
Watson was also the foundation of a carefully raised business culture.
"For us, IBM involves a long-term thought, a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM has survived and prospered for a hundred years for that reason, because it remained faithful to its basic principles, but without fear of the changes around it.
This has allowed us, during our first century, to transform technology, business and society.
We hope to prosper even more in our second century," said Samuel J. Palmisano, the current director of the company during his anniversary.
A sophisticated system
Watson, already in the 1930s, was concerned about the care of his employees as an entrepreneur in Bâta in Czechia (the employees of IBM were the first US workers to enjoy paid holidays, insurance, elegant uniforms and a sophisticated pay system that rewarded the best inventors and sellers.
The same long-term sophistication maintains IBM in relation to the customer.
From the beginning, the company was supposed to discover talents (if it was one of the first world companies to end any kind of discrimination, it could choose without problems).
On the line of the anti-discrimination strategy is the current IBM plan, so Palmisano will replace it with the coming year: Virginia Rometty.
She has been working for 30 years in IBM, where she has been head of sales, marketing and strategies.
During the last years IBM has participated in so-called virtual encounters, a rain of online ideas, from which infinity arises from future strategies and innovations.
It is not surprising that ideas are about, as almost half a million people work in the firm.
An institution with a good reputation
The fixed position in the business provides the company with an internal and external image strong.
"From the beginning, IBM has maintained an institutional concept more than a technological company," says Harvard Business School professor economist and author of the book on IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technological company, but a company that is trying to solve business problems for technology users," says George Colony of the Forrester Research consultant.
As the company itself says there is a difference between entering the business and creating a business directly.
IBM - or "Grand Verde" - as it is known in the United States family due to its logo, has become one of the world's largest companies in the last hundred years.
It is possible the most versatile technology company (development of both equipment and software, infrastructure and web accommodation services within a wide range of services, ranging from servers to nanotechnology).
It shows the largest number of patents of all North American technology companies and five of their employees have received the Nobel Prize.
Among its inventions are automatic cash registers, payment cards, financial permutations, bar codes and diskettes.
IBM will bill $220 billion this year. This year has become the second technology firm for market capitalisation (the first is Apple), when it first exceeded Microsoft in 1996.
Looking to the Future
Not all products and innovations just satisfy the taste of customers and the moment (IBM did not bet on its own operating system, OS/2, Online Services Prodigy or Computers IBM PCjr).
"If your business is based on progress, it cannot be emotionally anchored in the past," acknowledged Samuel J. Palmisano.
Therefore, IBM has no problem building its bases on other platforms (and also, if they don't work, abandon them).
And this is the difference in competition, Microsoft, which basically keeps and always falls exclusively with Windows.
Future technology
In terms of sales, IBM is mainly dedicated to services, of which approximately one fifth are programme and another fifth are equipment.
However, even in 1990, the teams represented more than half of the supplier ' s share.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-income assets at a total value of $15 billion. During the same period, it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of future technology.
Investments have continued since 2008, when the modern global financial crisis first emerged.
IBM acts according to the assumptions of its first boss, Thomas J. Watson, who increased investment during the great economic crisis of 29.
It seems that until now IBM has been able to cope with the crisis.
The value of IBM's shares since the beginning of 2008 has increased strategically to 120%, and the net profit of the company has continued to increase.
The IBM currency is to change everything except for its value.
It is possible, therefore, to expect that when the next crisis comes, this flexible giant will endure.
IBM history: from cheese cutter to space flights
The company IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a hundred years ago, and its original name is Computing Tabulation Recording Corporation.
The name IBM was adopted in 1924 - it was originally a brand used in the branches of Canada and South America.
The basis that led to the birth of IBM arose from the merger of four companies which rose to the 1880s.
He had inventions such as the famous "reloj de ficher", which allows him to control the employee's entry and exit.
The architect of the new company was the businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 also presided over his supervisory board.
Flint got the head of a competition company, Thomas J. Watson, to help with the company's management.
The new leader eclipsed the founder of IBM ( Watson's ideas remain the firm basis on which corporate culture and identity are maintained).
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name indicates, began with the production and sale of all kinds of machinery for business, from meat and cheese cutters to register boxes.
During the first four years that Watson led the company, the billing doubled by $9 million and began the company's large expansion by continents.
Watson was so crucial to the company that, almost forty years after taking over the boss's chair, he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his direction, IBM began working on the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s IBM personnel and computers helped NASA to guide flights to space (in Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the famous flight to the Moon).
Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first generation of computers, the IBM System/360 series.
The classic "pieces", which introduced the computer standard back then, came to the market with the name IBM 5150 in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, which, for its part, acquired the consulting part of the company Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began offering full advice and services of added value.
The strategy IBM has paid for these last three years is the Smarter Planet concept, that is, "a smarter planet".
Its aim is to make a more rational use of technology, although the areas have not yet been planned or circumstances, for example, with regard to the transport and administration of cities have not been improved.
For the trade sector, IBM presented not long ago the Smart Commerce platform that allows retailers to manage the full commercial cycle.
IBM has a long history in this country.
Already in 1932 he opened a branch office in Czechoslovakia since then, the first country he had in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, the IBM ČR also operates the strategic centre of externalization in Brno.
The headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague. There is also a world-famous research team working with voice recognition.
Richter about your unfaithful husband:
Iveta, stay with that ass, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Richtářová (53) said acabo!
After her husband Josef Richtář (53) had become the only protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), but also her lover, Darina was still hoping that Joseph would wake up from her pink dream and return home.
However, it will no longer wait and have established clear rules for life in the future.
"People can go home, but not like my partner anymore," explains Richtářová.
When Darina Richtářová accepted Bartošové in her home during the summer, she could not even imagine how her marriage would end.
Despite the petition, Iveta had not moved 30 days after Ričany and Pepe did not leave the singer.
He even publicly declared that he loved her.
In time, Darina resigned, apparently accepted her husband’s relationship and even quit him forever.
Rychatář doesn't care who's with his wife.
If one day Richtář broke up with Bartošová, his wife wouldn't wait for him at home with his arms open.
He is the biological father of my children and, if he wants to live the rest of his life in our house, no one will throw him out."
"But here I would live, not as my dear old drunk who was wrong, but as a man who unites me with certain ties," said Richtářová and added that he had already disbanded his husband and insisted only on mutual respect.
Joseph so far does not care that his wife has closed the door behind him.
"I accept my wife's decision."
"I'll be with Iveta and there's no change."
"My wife established this as a marriage on paper and I respect it."
"The company is still in force, I make house arrangements, I take care of the garden, the home, I make the purchases."
"Darina and I talked normally, the only thing is that we don't share a bed," said Rychtář.
If Richtářová found a new love, he wouldn't resist.
"We don't sleep together and she doesn't care where she goes or if she has a boyfriend.
I know it's my fault, I'm in love with Iveta and I take full responsibility," Joseph concludes.
The worst vices of women: Do they also refer to you?
If you ask men to be able to cite some typical vices of women, they will generally be named without thinking.
Dear women, do you recognize them in the following lines, where certain female vices are cited that can cause men to bleed?
Go shopping
Do you blame your average orange who depends on the purchases?
Do you have to buy at least one slipper a week?
Do you like to buy often in the underpants?
Then in your case it can be said that going shopping has become a vice.
Some women realize that they should ease their passion for shopping, at least a little.
But to see, what women could resist the temptation to walk through the clothing shops without more, to look for well-adjusted clothes and then try them all in the testator ( ideally in all different colors)?
Although for most women to go shopping is a holiday time, for men it can become virtually a hell.
Just remember how many times you have already told your partner that you better wait in front of the door.
Constant Dissatisfaction
"Am I not too fat?"
"I'd need to pay at least five pounds - should I start to exercise?"
"Do you really like it?"
Don't you dream of these phrases?
What is it?
Then she is one of those women obsessed with her appearance.
It is not that you should stop caring, but many men are allergic to listening to your mate complain all the time of your physical appearance.
Strong sex also agrees that the more frequent complaints are made, the more annoying women become.
Order and cleaning first
It's like an infinite tiov.
Clean the windows, pass the vacuum cleaner, shave the floor, remove the dust, shave the bathtub and all that at least twice a week.
Does he blame his spouse for treading clean soil with a dirty foot, his children who have killed a newly cleaned washroom and a glass locker that cost him so much to clean?
In case you suffer from this "deviation", try to be aware that nothing should be exaggerated and that order and cleanliness should certainly not deal with being primary in the family.
This harmless desire for cleanliness could threaten their relationships and family well-being.
Make unremarkable comments
"The shoes used are left with dirty clothes."
"You want to put those shoes on tomorrow, too."
"The wet rag is not left on the ground!"
If you make those comets to your mate more often a day, you know that this will get you out of your boxes.
Of course. You don't mean anything wrong, you just want to get everything in order.
Perhaps, if men were to assume this, women, for their part, would not make so many comments.
Cumulative and Chismes
Some women are also exposed to slander, chismes, but also to insults and conspiracy against someone.
Women focus on relationships, so they like to talk together about things like who, where, with whom, how, and why.
At best, each one of us sometimes escapes a small and harmless chism.
With the hand in the heart, this is for almost all women.
On the other hand, there are chismous women who are not controlled, who love to shine and often do so, despise everyone and are dangerous to those around them, especially in a female labor team.
Jagr and Voráček helped with their assistance to defeat Philadelphia
The leading hockey player Jaromir Jagr participated on Monday in the NHL meeting with two assists that brought the victory over Philadelphia 5:3 in the Carolina cupboard and again put the Czech players in the vanguard of the competition.
In both cases Claude Giroux took advantage of the 39-year-old star, and took another step and was declared the best player of the game.
Two assistances were awarded to Jágr, Jakub Voráček, as well as to Jágr.
After the meeting, Jagr said to the overseas journalists that Giroux had preached a great night.
"Before the party, I told you I'd be tripled."
"He introduced it."
"Sometimes they seem boxed," Jagr explained, after his performance tells Giroux a goal, following the first flight of the Flyers.
A while later, the team's second intervention also had a Czech trail.
Voráček was made with the disc behind the Hurricane gate and moved it between the circles to Maxim Talbot, who scored.
A second before the first break a local player, Patrick Dwyer, was expelled, but from the beginning of the second part they already dominated the Flyers.
Especially for Giroux.
After collaborating with Jagr, he scored the third goal, after his shot fell through the doorway of Wayne Simmonds.
"I love to play with him."
"I don't mean to say that he's the best player in the game, but he's certainly among the three best," Jagr said to his head.
"I would never have happened that at the end of my career I was going to play with a sportsman like him."
"I'm very happy about it."
"I want to play for him."
All these years in the NHL, my companions played for me, and that now produces results," Jagr adds.
Carolina still turned the game into a drama, with Tuom Ruutu's goal and then again from Dwyer, from penalti, to a distance goal.
Matt Read did not allow any more complications, although they ended up outnumbered by two against one.
"Penger had a good performance in our field."
"I cleared the record, I took the speed and read went to the most distant part."
"I tried to touch the disc and I'm happy because I got it," Voráček described the party's last goal as he lived.
With his victory, Philadelphia has taken the lead in the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal, Jaroslav Špatak, did not play until the end of the match against Buffalo, in the second third he withdrew for injury at the top of the body.
The Canadians not only lost a player with a lot of defence experience, but also for a difference of two goals, 2:3.
Tomáš Plekanec didn't know how to use one of the shots.
More than the points lost to the local coach lamented the large number of injured in the last row, and played the game with only five defenses.
"That's bad."
"We played the game only with a veteran player, the rest were novels."
"At last, but it is that nothing can be done against it, we have to deal with it," said Jacques Martin.
"As much as rotating the players turned against us, we couldn't resist it."
"We had to simplify the game even more, get the record out of our field."
"And so we leave gaps," one of the defenses explained, P. K. Subban.
Porter Ondřej Pavelec contributed with thirty Winnipeg interventions in the 5:2 victory over Tampa Bay.
The Jets goals were marked by five players who thus ended up with a series of defeats that had already lasted five games.
How travel prices have evolved since 1989
Until 1989 there were only five authorised state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Recrea and Autotourist.
Travel agencies at that time sold in most cases travel only to the socialist bloc, as travel to the West was very limited.
Czech tourists therefore went from holidays to the beaches of the RDA (German Democratic Republic), to the Soviet Union, (Sochi in Crimea in the Black Sea) to Bulgaria and Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A positive exception was the period between 1962 and 1972 when it was possible to travel to Yugoslavia, however, then the Yugoslav regime turned west and the journeys of Czech tourists were then quite limited.
A great paradox of socialism was the fact that citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. the Czechoslovaks) were not allowed to travel freely and individually by socialist countries.
If a citizen wanted to travel individually, for example to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter, if not, the individual journey was not possible.
Travel agencies also offered trips to the West at that time, but one should put on the rope with a sleeping bag and spend the whole night, or have "known good" in the agency.
Still wasn't earned.
The so-called "change promise" that was the condition for travel to the West, was not granted to the "politically unreliable people", which could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely convertible currency and, without guarantee of exchange, it was not possible to obtain the resources (the Western currency) to travel to the West.
The vast majority of Czechs spent their holidays in their own country, so there were a large number of summer houses and houses that the Czechs would acquire.
The way of travel of the Czechs has suffered a real revolution since 1989.
While until 1989 it was no longer going to spend holidays in RDA or Bulgaria, last year the Czechs made 4.5 million trips to countries around the world.
It turns out in a great paradox, from which today we are no longer aware, that Croatia could not travel freely until 1989, because it was part of Yugoslavia since then.
In the early 1990s, visa exemption was imposed to travel to neighbouring Western European States, which resulted in a huge wave of short-term visits, especially to Vienna or Germany.
The Czechoslovaks, for a long time, did not see enough of the excursions to the West, everyone wanted to see it for at least one moment.
For example, in Paris the Czech groups slept in the parks in campaign shops, as our income from that time did not allow us to pay a hotel or pension.
A typical feature of the Czechs of that time was taking with you food (conservations, embuties, etc.) to save.
Another important moment was the introduction of the convertibility of the Czech crown, so our tourists could finally, after decades, buy freely Western currency.
Our standard of living increased and with it also average wages, which in around 1997 led to an increase in travel demand.
With the increase in travel demand, agencies began, starting in 1997, regularly to prepare travel using charter flight connections, which made it amazingly lower travel prices compared to the past, thanks to the possibility of obtaining discounts for passenger volume.
By the end of the 1990s, the Czechs had already traveled without visa to almost all developed countries, except the United States, which further simplified our journeys.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary tourism happened in 2000, when it was organized, thanks to a huge demand, the first direct flight from Czechia to an exotic country, and went to Thailand.
Since that year, direct charter flights with Czech tourists have been making distant and warm countries. This winter will already fly directly from Czech Republic to 12 exotic destinations.
Exotic countries are currently visiting about 100,000 Czechs a year.
Another interesting moment of this time, which symbolizes our post-revolutionary development, arrived in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the United States eliminated visas for Czech tourists, with what our country became among the most developed countries in the world.
In 2008, the Czechs, for the first time in their history, have spent more than half their holidays abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history, have spent more than 15,000 crowns per head on foreign travel, including expenses on the site of stay.
The ordinary General Assembly was convened to elect the President, who could end up dead again.
For almost five months now, Czech football has been without a president and Ivan Hasek's successor as President of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR) will not be known even after the next Extraordinary General Assembly is convened this Thursday in Nymburg.
In fact, there has not yet been an agreement on the voting rules to be followed.
Without them, no vote can be taken even to vote among the three candidates.
The people interested in chairing Czech football are Jindřich Rijkl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
Haszek gave up his position in June not until he called on his colleagues to find a strong person who is supposed to take up football in the future.
However, after the end of the Haszek era, a dispute arose between the two federations of the association unable to reach an agreement to choose a common candidate.
This remained evident on 16 September when the new president had to be elected.
The delegates of the General Assembly met in a van at the National House (Národní dôm), located in the Pragüsen district of Smíchov, because the talks had been blocked and not only with regard to the method of election.
There was no consensus, nor was there a right in the General Assembly to vote - only legal representatives or delegates with full authority.
From that point on and from this single point of view, a partial agreement was reached, supported also by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, according to which representation by full powers was not possible.
However, disputes over the electoral code remain open.
Further light on the situation could no longer be shed on even the Executive Committee, which, at its regular or extraordinary meetings, basically did not resolve anything.
The opinion on the possibility of voting has changed a few times already, but the neurological point remains the same.
The question is: How to proceed in the third round to avoid the dead point?
"The dispute revolves around whether to proceed in accordance with the statutes or find another model," says Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice-presidents of the FAČR, who, since the association's direction, represents professional football.
According to the model proposed in the statutes, the third round will win the candidate who has a higher percentage of support in the federation to which he will submit his application.
The Moravia Region is prepared to make a commitment so that it can win that candidate with a higher total percentage of votes in both federations.
However, the Bohemian part imposes the condition that the winner, according to these percentage calculations, must have at least two thirds.
"This would, however, take away the meaning of the two previous rounds and completely deny the concept of a bicameral system," as Svoboda understands the objections of the Morava party, according to which it would be best not to touch the order and vote in accordance with the applicable statutes.
Tomas Paklík is also surprisingly agreed, although it is assumed that the electoral regulation established by the statute of all candidates is more suitable for Pelta.
"I would like you to vote as high as possible in accordance with the statutes."
"So that no nonsense is invented about the representatives as in the last General Assembly," says the owner of Victoria Plzen, who for the first time has been nominated as a candidate and who directs his comments mainly against Pelta.
Pelta's still optimistic.
According to him, Nymburk will decide on the new president and he believes that candidates in the future will cooperate constructively.
"All passions will calm down with today's party of our national team at the European Championship.
"The football will again become a protagonist, and thus cooperate more closely," says Jablonice's representative, who among the three candidates has more experience in football management, both professionally and regionally.
Rijkl is the most reticent.
"I hope it comes to an agreement, but unfortunately the situation is much more complicated."
"It is not the conflict between Bohemians and Moravians, but there are attempts to adjust the rules to their own convenience."
"This may result in a new blockade of the General Assembly."
"At any rate, I hope the common sense will be imposed," said Rijk.
There is not much time left for all parties to reach an agreement.
Some negotiations had to be held in Montenegro, but who can know until the match starts if the football team is complete?
The special aircraft, on which they had to travel to Podgorica, including Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, did not leave this morning for technical problems in Prague, having to seek an alternative to transport the executive committee to the place where the classification party will take place.
Perhaps the decision-making meeting could at last be the one that will take place at ministerial level, which they say will be held this Wednesday.
Josef Dobeš, Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, would like to include the parties divided into the country's most powerful sports organization in order to reach an agreement.
There is much at stake: State subsidies, the credibility of football and also the next General Assembly of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovakian Sports Federation (ČSTV), which will try to provide a new direction for Czech sport after the financial problems of the Sazka lottery house.
Paklík will fight to reach the presidency, because he does not find a more suitable candidate.
If the leader of Pilsen's footballers, Tomash Palik, before the extraordinary General Assembly, knew the name of an appropriate candidate to satisfy all his ideas about the new President of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR), he would not be presented as a candidate for such a relevant position.
"If there was a suitable person, I'd be fighting for her and I wouldn't be presenting myself as a candidate for the elections."
"But to this day such a person has not been found," said Paklík to the Czech News Agency (ČTK)
What motivates Paclík to enter the challenge with Miroslav Pelta and Henry Rijkl is precisely the possibility of blocking Pelta, the so-called winner of the elections, which opens the way to the Czech Football Federation (FAČR) presidency.
Paklík also points out that, in case of victory, he would remain in office as president only until 2013, when the turn of the ordinary general assembly would arrive.
In that position, he would like to see an expert and good manager who is not too involved with football events.
"I've already spoken to some people I might consider."
"To me it was crazy to hear some say that at this moment they didn't even want to be identified with Czech football."
"I'd like to change that vision," he adds.
What is supposed to be more disturbing to Paclík at this moment is the relationship of Pelta with the president of the Pilsen Roman Berbr Regional Football Association, a man with a controversial past known outside the world as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the votes of delegates in the general assembly.
For Paklík it is so unacceptable to see Pelta sitting in the presidential chair.
"If he wins, he will keep his current status and nothing in football will change."
"With the support of Berbra, an ambitious businessman, football will take even less advantage," Paclík said.
He also mentions the fact that a few years ago the name of Pelta was associated with a telephone hearing during the investigation of a case of corruption, from which Pelta was sentenced.
"I don't know what prestige football might bring Pelta's victory."
"And with what eyes will UEFA and FIFA look at us," said Paklík, who also takes care of his previous statement that "the Pilsen Club would sell if Pelta became president".
In the event of winning the Thursday elections, Paklík could consider cooperation with Pelta in the future.
In the same way, it is the other candidate, Rijk, who has been supported by Paklík before the General Assembly of September which ended in a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first to follow."
"He's very capable."
"I could imagine it, for example, as head of representation."
"but not as manager of an association."
"I also don't put the noses where I don't feel able," Paklík added, who in September aroused much attention to support the suspension of the Arbitral Commission chaired by Ludek Macel, then replaced by Dagmar Damkova.
Paclik admits that he would dare to manage the association.
It uses its management capabilities for private companies, since last summer it is also the Director of Pilsen, who with his support celebrated the first division triumph in May.
"I have the strength to change some things in the field of football and contribute to their safe practice."
"To reduce the influence of some pressure groups, which probably tend to influence the decisions of the disciplinary and appeals committee, producing unpleasant situations, Paclík said without concealing his antipathies to the president of Sparta Daniel Křetínský.
One of the priorities would also be to strengthen the relationship between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with which it exerted pressure on political leaders to allocate more money to the sports of lottery taxes.
"It's one of the key issues the new president should be dedicated to."
"If they increase gambling taxes, as the political parties announce, they would support their arguments, but, frankly, they have to tell us where to stop all this money," he says.
In addition, Paclík now does not even consider his association with the Pilsner Club, although he himself claims that the President of the FAČR must be "not a party".
Pelta is in turn associated with Jablonec and Rijkl with Dukla de Prague.
"It's not ideal."
"But I don't see any sense in giving in hypocritically my actions at the Pilsen Club to another person to come back there after a year and a half," Paclík said.
Pelta promised FAČR new statutes that would end with the dead end of the elections.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of the presidential candidates, Miroslav Pelt, promised that, if he was elected, he would ensure that FAČR had new statutes that would definitely serve to resolve the disputes regarding the electoral rule in the future.
The representative of Jablonec is optimistic about this Thursday's meeting in Nymburg, and believes that the pre-election conflict could move towards a solution today with the possible victory of the football team.
Prior to the elections not held in September, Pelta promised to focus, in the event of being elected, precisely on representation and raising funds.
He decided to take part in the last minute in the last general assembly, so this two-month delay could be good for him to defend and present his ideas on football management in a broader context.
"People at all levels have been involved in football for a long time and hope to meet the new President this Thursday."
"They feel that the time has come for someone to manage the association," thinks the man who is associated mainly with the Jablonice Club, but who worked in the Spartan and the Association Executive Committee.
For this reason, you think you have enough experience to manage Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current election problems is the euphoria that reigned in Ivan Haszek's time.
"Unfortunately, the statutes that were not as perfect as they all thought were adopted in the General Assembly in June."
"If we exclude certain interpretations, we have a president since September," Pelta warned.
The re-adjustment of the most important document of the Civil Society was used as a sign for the benefit of delegates.
"If they choose me as president, I will take it as a personal challenge and I am willing to respond if this fails."
"It's a matter of principles, without which we can't exist," says Pelta.
In addition, in theory, try not to interfere with your opponents.
In the past, I had already warned that he was working with Henry Rijk, who respected his training in Law, and was aware that his opponent would also be his first vice president.
He had spent a lot of time without attacking Thomas Paklík who, unlike Pelta, did not give up on titering with his head.
"It's been over a year in the football world, and it's already achieved some success."
"His attacks but they were shameful and many people were surprised by the election campaign."
"That's why many of them doubt their true character," he told his opponent Pelta, who was still faithful to the statements announced already in September.
His most powerful weapon is, according to him, his knowledge of football, from the lowest competitions to the tops.
The latter should be escaped from the promotion of football.
"Also, I would try to resolve all the scandals caused by the Bohemians as a result of last year's corruption scandal."
"I would immediately be involved in negotiations with the public and the private sector, to ensure that there is enough money for all football," ČTK said 46-year-old candidate two months ago.
He also promised that his appointment as president of football would not entail any personal modification of the template.
"I should first know the tasks of each employee," he said, referring to Strahov where, after a long period of anarchy, an understandable nervousness prevails.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that are being Vaticand before the next general assembly, he believes that delegates will not travel in vain to Nymburg this Thursday.
"If the only point of disagreement is how to vote in the third round, we will certainly be able to overcome it.
"The football needs credibility, which will only be recovered if you finally have a leader," two days before the most decisive day in your career as a representative, Pelta remains optimistic.
Rijkl promises, that under his leadership, FACHR would begin to work with desire.
If in the fourth General Assembly the current Vice-President Jindrich Rijkl was elected as the new president of the Czech Football Association, many people would certainly feel.
Rijkl promises that if he was elected, he would work hard.
He wants to implement a systematic change and make the members of the Executive Committee responsible for each area of football individually.
It is also committed to resolving the situation of the Bohemians, improving relations with UEFA and FIFA, making more money for football and continuing the work initiated by former President Ivan Haszek.
"As President, I would like to devote myself fully to football."
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to selection, through professional football or training of young high-performance footballers."
"With this I don't mean that I would do it all alone," said Rijk in an interview for the ČTK.
"I am a team player and I want to divide the powers of the Executive Committee so that each member can be dedicated to a specific area."
"And I will assign difficult tasks so that football can, in each of those segments, continue with great impetus."
"Many people will probably not like this, because it will mean starting to work very hard and not just criticizing the work of others," he added.
Due to the atmosphere of criticism in the football movement, it is said that it has considered the possibility of not presenting itself again as a candidate.
"They all know that I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that this will make sense and that there will be no people behind me who will prevent me from taking every step of the way," he explained the reasons for his indecision.
"Many people have told me I shouldn't give up for victory, because then they would give up for the others too."
"It's about having faith not to give up like that, no matter what," he said.
According to them, it also motivates you to continue the work that has already begun with Haszek.
"For those two years, a large part of the work that I don't want to lose has ended."
"There are processes that had begun and that will have their effect within a few years and I would not like someone to have the father," he announced worried that if they elected the other candidate, Miroslav Pelta, the situation in the association could again be as it was before the Haszek era.
"I believe in the order, and it is something that, in my opinion, Mirek Pelta is unable to maintain.
"After him is above all those people who would take care of football to be only a privilege for a few elected."
"I can blame a lot of things, but not the fact that I'm in favor of someone."
"I'm trying to be a target."
"I want to make a football for everyone, because only this will make everyone feel good and not just the elected," said Rijkl.
It also rejects the idea that the president would only be Bohemian.
"Although some people are trying to say otherwise, I'm thinking of doing the best I can for Moravia."
"For example, it's time to think about dividing the second division into one Czech part and another Morava, whose winners would go to the first division."
"There would be no current situation where we have only three Moravia teams, which represents a problem for young Moravia players," said Rijkl.
Although in the fight for the presidential elections, Tomash Paklík, president of the Pilsner Club, Rijkl did not stop believing in his chances of being elected.
"I still feel strongly supported by the Czech Federation, which elected me as its Vice-President and who knows that behind me there are clear successes," said Rijkl, whose successes include the saving of a dozen million crowns of unfavourable contracts, the negotiation of television contracts and the negotiations on the lottery law.
On the other hand, he recognizes his part of the guilt in which the federation is not united.
And as he proclaims that Pelta is "dequalified to regain confidence in Czech football", he considers the other rival, Paclík, as a strong candidate who has something to offer to football.
"No one can deny that he did a great job for Pilsen that year."
"In the event that he is elected, he will probably follow what Ivan Haszek has already started and would not significantly change the staff template in the committees."
"I don't want to use that for my sake," she evaluates her rivals, Rachel.
The most beautiful pools in Europe
Blue Jump
by Julia Stanek
Swimming pools from an incredible sight, sumptuous bathrooms in Budapest: Anyone who visits Europe can live their blue wonder, and, after a visit to the city or a walk, rest their tired feet in bubbling baths.
A book shows where you can find the best well-being in the water.
When Iris Meder made a research trip last year and a half, there was something he couldn't miss in his luggage, a bathroom.
Backdrops on the water, looked up the dome artist, swam towards the marble angels, who were waiting for her on the edge of the pool and were amazed at the newly renovated covered pool.
He liked the bathroom, took note in his book at the time of all the interesting details about the style and history of the building.
Architectural historian Meder explored more than 200 swimming pools this way and presents them in his recent book "Badefreuden": the swimming pools covered in Munich, the historic bath palaces in the Black Forest, the "hormigon constructions" in Taunus.
In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, the Czech Republic, France, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia visited the most extraordinary bathrooms in Central Europe.
This 46-year-old German is a real enthusiast of the culture of the bathroom.
He doesn't want anything to do with sports, says Meder, only water is different.
It only bothers you that fans in the bathroom have to comply with blue tiles and chlorine hector, while fans can breathe the fascinating smell of bee forests or listen to the cheerful trains of birds in the park.
"One day I wondered why the pools must always be so ugly," says this Vienna resident.
"I started collecting beautiful pools."
The surface of the water doubles the architecture.
The capoteo in the pool and the ethereas oil from the sauna. The factor of well-being in the pools is so great because they take care of all the senses, according to Meder.
And if the builder strives, the covered pools can be a real gift for the view: "Instead of the ground, there is a water surface in the bathrooms."
"On the one hand it is transparent, on the other hand it reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything doubles optically: the high moves, the blues of colors, the trampolines.
The book with small-format photographs "Badefreuden" provides 190 pages of very interesting data on architecture and art history in the historical oasis of well-being, but mainly gives you the desire to jump to the blue.
Meder, the pool collector discovers the specimens highlighted in his research in Hungary.
Along with the magnificent medical baths such as the 100-year-old Szechenyi bath in Budapest, the water with nitrates is located in a unique karstic cavity (baths in the caves in Miscolc-Tapolca), as well as some terms, whose pools are of alkaline water and are located in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termalfürdö in Jászberény).
Many swimming pools discovered in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views: While the whole city places its eyes on the Zurich-covered swimming pool, you can look at Arlberb, snow cover, from the outdoor swimming pool of a bathroom in St. Antón, and: In the Turkish bath there is a window from which you can observe the practice in the ski slopes.
The design, perhaps more extraordinary, awaits customers in Langenfeld: Ötztal's water cathedral looks like an ovni that has just landed in the Alps.
From three open sources rises steam in winter, while deep mountains of Ötztal rise in the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Meder, the pool collector, did not invade the smell of chlorine in all the pools.
Many thermal baths smell sulfur, in the baths of Arpád in Békescuba, Hungary, the gas oil plague is so strong that people think they have come to a sanitary bath.
The smell comes from the medicinal waters containing bicarbonate and alcohol and whose legume sticks to the skin when entering the pool, a special enjoyment of wellness.
Iris Meder was also disappointed in a place in his search for nice places for the bathroom, when he wanted to visit discovered pools and sunbathings in the Czech bath of Luhatschowitz, he found himself with a blocked ground.
The bathroom of 1902 by architect Duan Jurkovic was closed.
When Meder looked through the demolished windows of the red, white and yellow modernist building, he saw the evil growing among the bricks.
The decadence ran counter to a charming pool in the Black Forest: the Thermal Palace in Bad Wildbald.
These bathrooms have three stages of construction behind them; not only neo-romanic elements of the times of their construction can be discovered in 1844, if not also an Arab alhambra-style hall, added in 1900.
Since its modest modernization in 1995, the Thermal Palace has been the favorite bathroom of the pool collector, Iris Meder, and not just because it is natural for the Black Forest.
"It's worth a lot to merge different architectural styles into such a fantastic unit," Meder says.
In a palace like this, immersion in the thermal pool seems to be of little importance.
Agrarian speculation
Deutsche Bank analyzes the business of raw materials
By Christian Teevs
Does Deutsche Bank give up its business with agricultural raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to verify the consequences of speculation for the poor in the world.
In January, the head of the consortium wants to show the consequences.
Hamburg,
For citizens, it is clear, according to one study, that 84 per cent of Germans do not seem acceptable for banks to speculate about agricultural raw materials such as wheat or maize.
Two thirds of respondents claim that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions withdraw from this business because it intensifies the problems of the poorest in the world.
This is the result of a survey by the Foodwatch consumer organization.
The study is based on a report submitted to Foodwatch in mid-October.
Author Harald Schumann shows that stakes on global commodity bags raise prices, and banks bear responsibility for the global problem of hunger.
The consumer's campaign is directed specifically to Josef Ackermann, director of the Deutsche Bank, although large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act in a similar way.
Originally, bets on raw materials were thought to protect traders from price fluctuations.
The main experts agree that players have been disconnected from supply and demand, and profit from the costs of the poorest.
Ackermann responded to criticisms differently than US competitors: he promised to review the claims and said that no business "should compromise the good reputation of Deutsche Bank".
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE information, an international working group is reviewing the claims of the Foodwatch report.
The analysis should be completed at the end of the year, then the results will be presented to the Deutsche Bank Directive, together with the recommendation on how to handle the matter.
At the end of January, the bank's management will report on the consequences.
In the end, there could be a reduction in the business of raw materials, or even their total abandonment.
Ackermann's trying to fix his image.
Thilo Bode, the founder of Foodwatch, celebrated the news, but reaffirmed his criticism of the financial sector: "The growing food prices bets show particularly drastic how loose banks are currently damaging public welfare."
Ackermann is located as the largest bank cabilator, especially in obligations.
"The Deutsche Bank must cancel all investments in its portfolio in which it puts the money at risk for food price bets," Bode said.
"It doesn't matter if Ackermann deals with people who go hungry or Deutsche Bank's fame."
Ackermann's inspection is surprising at first sight, but it is clear that the head of the consortium wants to offer a perfect image a few months before leaving his post.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the chairman of the Board of Directors would change something different from what was not planned in the Board of Directors.
With the abandonment of controversial agricultural speculation, you can improve your image.
And you only need to care for possible losses, that's what your successor will do.
Two thirds would cancel investment in raw materials
Foodwatch strives to keep pressure on the manager high.
So far, more than 30,000 netizens have participated in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Forsa Institute had asked 1,001 people on 7 and 8 November.
Only 10 percent considered it legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments in which food prices would be set.
Many bank customers showed personal consequences when they discovered that their bank was involved in such business: according to the survey, two thirds would cancel all investments that money comes from agricultural speculation.
43 per cent would dissipate such a bank to their acquaintances, 49 per cent would apply, after reflection, to cancel their account and change to another institute.
House 21 in Vienna
The moved pavilion
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with altibajos and a happy ending, the pavilion of the Austrian universal exhibition of Brussels in 1958 received awards, was in Vienna for a museum, remained empty and rested.
Now it's reopened as an exhibition house.
The architecture of modern postgerra passionately, the clear shapes, the crystal halls, the valentine curves and the new construction materials, typical of thinking about technical progress, so the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer for the universal exhibition of Brussels in 1958 is an appropriate and well-known example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion then obtained the Grand Prix of Architecture for its light and floating construction of steel and glass.
Construction is still considered a contemporary milestone in architecture.
He made the architect so well known that he also built the pavilion of Austria in the following universal exhibition.
With its legendary four-cylinder tower for MBW plus the adjacent building planned in Munich, it became internationally known.
His pavilion, designed as a temporary construction for exhibitions, was raised after the universal exhibition at the Swiss Garden next to the southern Vienna station, was reformed in 1962 and inside a museum of the 20th century was inaugurated, called "House 20".
The building was suitable but lacked adequate spaces and technology for a museum; no wall to hang art, no good environment.
Nevertheless, it was used until contemporary art in Vienna had a new home.
The building has been empty since 2001 and is becoming more and more empty.
Currently, architect Adolf Krischanitz reformed the pavilion, now called "House 21" and will be used in the future as a contemporary art museum.
On Tuesday afternoon the Belvedere museum was inaugurated, to which the house belongs, with the first exhibition, a blow of luck in a certain way.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, the new director of the Austrian Belvedere Gallery since 2007, has achieved a new start.
Husslein-Arco, a doctor in art history with a considerable career, among other things, artistic ice skater in his youth, later in Sotheby, the Guggenheim Museum and the founder director of the Museum of Modern Art in Salzburg, made the reforms with the insistence of politicians and protectors of monuments, provided public funds and private sponsors and established their use.
With the exception of contemporary art, the works of sculptor Fritz Wotruba of the homonymous foundation are exposed, there should be a cafeteria and a library and also a building of offices.
Strict control, low budget
Krischanitz was the best choice to make.
Not only because he significantly reformed Joseph Olbrichs' secession in Vienna, he was enlarged and awarded the competition, if not because he studied with Schwanzwer at the Vienna Technical University and the pavilion was for him an "important and huge place", in which he contemplated "almost all weekends" exhibitions.
He knew the project and the problem of the building, which disappeared with his transfer to Vienna in his exchange of use with generosity and ease.
In the current reforms there are major problems, the building was "an energy devourer," Krischanitz said.
The profile of the windows of the crystal facade was changed, an insulating crystal was installed reinforced with glass fibre and the crystal roof was replaced by a special safety crystal.
The thermal bridges and steel beams were reinforced or replaced and the asbestos roofs were rehabilitated.
Two basements were used for the new use, a light panel down between the house and the street provides lighting, a bridge serves to enter the building almost new, but still the Schwanzer pavilion.
The original outer doors remain, the house is painted in old tones caoba and protected from oxidation.
And the movie room is exactly as it was before.
And all this with strict control by the monument office and a low budget.
"I often had to find materials that were good, cheap and also liked the monument protection office," Krischanitz says and warns of an aperture soil in the basement.
Despite all the pressures, problems and reforms, the building remains flexible and lightweight.
The flag "who came from Brussels" has been difficult, Krischanitz said recently, a typical "accidental appearance in the history of the city".
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and that is why he wanted to "awaken the right consciousness".
In this case, house 21 is not in the wrong place, there has been a hit of urban luck. The completely new and planned "central station neighborhood", with houses and offices, is located next to the Schweizer Garden.
And maybe another blow of luck happens: House 21 could receive a boost from another construction of Krischanitz, since the collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the Berlin Time Art Room and, as you can hear, negotiates with the city about a nearby place in the Schweizer Garden.
Deutsche Bahn plans a package of winter crisis that rises to millions
The company has come up with a plan of crisis, which would avoid the dangers of trains in winter.
The number of staff must be doubled.
What costs millions.
In the fight against delays and delays in the trains caused by winter, Deutsche Bahn has spent more than €70 million this year, according to a newspaper report.
The "Bill" newspaper reported, calling for an internal crisis plan of the group, the planned investments up to 2005 of a total of around EUR 300 million.
To improve the availability of vehicles and the rail network even with an extreme time.
Among other things, it is planned to double domestic and external employees to 16,000 posts to remove snow from the roads and from the Andes.
The aim is to clean snow and ice for operation and 90 percent of the needle needed for operation within four to five hours.
Two months ago, Rüdiger Grube, president of Deutsche Bahn, warned of delays and delays in trains also during this winter after a summit with the government and industry.
Last winter Deutsche Bahn suffered considerable problems in the transport of passengers, because, among other things, he lacked reservations under adverse weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for an authorization from the Federal Railway Office for years.
There is also a delay in the delivery of high-speed trains.
Deutsche Bahn has been working for years to check the high-speed train axes frequently at the workshop, after a high-speed train suffered the break of an axle at the Central Station of Cologne.
Deutsche Bank pays millions of fines in the United States.
After a riot about President Josef Ackerman, a new U.S. problem appears, Deutsche Bank has to pay a millionaire fine there.
As if the problems were not enough for the Deutche Bank, its past in the United States acquires the sector giant, the Frankfurt Institute pays $145 million (106 million) in an agreement to end the contents due to the failure of five large credit cooperatives during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of mortgage securities.
The financial market regulator NCUA recruits many large banks to induce credit cooperatives with false promises to buy financial products; they have minimized risks.
Such titles lost their value during the financial crisis and dragged the banks to the depths.
"We are pleased to be able to clarify the subject without the parties having to go to the courts," said a spokesman for Deutsche Bank in New York.
The bank does not accept any fault with the agreement.
This also applies to Citigroup, which required a payment of $20.5 million.
Debbie Matz, president of the NCUA, celebrated the differentiation of both financial institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for U.S. credit cooperatives and provides support in the event of a break in order to protect client investment.
NCWA is trying to reintegrate the losses of millions of origin.
Currently concluded agreements are their first type.
The regulator had also asked other large banks and in the summer, arguments against JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
In the case of the disputed mortgage securities, these are the so-called mortgage-backed values.
These are based on housing credits.
When the U.S. real estate bubble broke out in 2007, it led to the loss of many financial institutions.
In September 2008, at the high point of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Although the results occurred a few years ago, there is currently a complicated wind for US banks.
Investors and the inspection have initiated countless processes to receive compensation or punish shortcomings.
The Federal Housing Financing Agency (FHFA) has produced the largest number of claims.
It reproaches the 18 major international banks that the two U.S. State mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have taken advantage of the mortgage business in an amount of approximately $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank also has a demand from FHFA, which is worth $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The inspection requires the Frankfurt Institute to respond to "substantial losses", without naming an exact figure.
Deutsche Bank rejected the debts as unfounded and explained that it wanted to defend itself.
Warren Buffett contributes 10 billion to IBM
The financial guru, Buffet, invests heavily in the company of IBM Information Technologies.
Since March, it has acquired shares for a value of more than $10 billion.
So far, the great American investor Warren Buffet has always declared not to invest in computer companies or Information Technologies because long-term business development forecasts are negative.
But he has read the commercial report of IBM and changed his opinion on investing in the sector.
He had to understand a lot before IBM offered above all services and looked for computer systems for the information technology departments of other companies.
In the financial world, Warren Buffett's investment is considered an honor.
Therefore, the primitive information technology must be called "Sir IBM".
Buffett has now revealed in the CNBC economy station that has acquired IBM shares for a value of $10.7 billion since March.
His Berkshire Hathaway investment went up to one of the largest shareholders of IBM with a 5.5 percent stake.
Buffett said that IBM didn't know until now anything about the commitment.
He commended the management of regular benefits in the economic crisis.
"They've done a great job," Buffet said about the strategy.
IBM has long established profit-making information technology services such as the operation of computing centres.
The old computer pioneer of over 100 years also offers software and advice as well as powerful company teams.
Buffett has avoided technology companies to date.
He said he was only investing in companies whose business he would understand.
On the contrary, Buffet took advantage of the occasion in a freight train, in a lubricant manufacturer or mechanical engineer.
Its Berkshire Hathaway has approximately 80 own subsidiaries, as well as part of a whole series of large consortia such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, formerly Municher Rück.
Buffet, 81, was commissioned by the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 60s and, with wise investments, extended it to become one of the most valuable companies in the world.
However, his life - style is humble.
That's why it's an idol for countless investors around the world.
His quick and infallible sense to earn money has given him the nickname "Omaha Oracle".
After discovering Buffet's investment, IBM's stock in the stock market increased by one per cent.
"The Blue Giant", as IBM knows, has a stock exchange value of over $220 billion and a figure, along with Apple and Microsoft, among the most valuable technology companies in the world.
With Microsoft, he said Buffet, he doesn't want to cooperate.
Bill Gates, his founder, is a close friend.
The threat is concrete
After the discovery of "the Zwickau cell", Turkish media doubt the state of German law.
A newspaper is talking about a "blood ideology" that relives itself.
The murders of eight small businessmen trick and Greek businessmen between 2001 and 2006 have a background on the far right.
Turkey and the German population of Turkish origin have reacted with fear and concern to this news.
For many of the Germans of Turkish origin, a ghost that was believed dead a long time ago, since the attacks in the form of fires in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there had been no more episodes of violence with an extreme right-wing background against the Turks.
However, it has never been questioned that there is xenophobia in Germany.
The ultra-research network discovered reveals a magnitude whose dimensions were not, much less, predictable.
"Does the bloody ideology relive?" titled the online edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
The newspaper "Sabah" points out the contrary that one of the perpetrators of the crime was an informant of the Federal Office of Defence of the Constitution and was concerned that the German authorities could be involved in the ultra-right-handle.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted sensibly, the weekend reminded the victims of racist violence with a guard at the Brandenburg Gate.
Two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, reflected on a solemn event of the fiftieth anniversary of the Turkish-German agreement.
The coexistence was staged with happy colors, such as a happy ending story.
The information came to some Turkish media as a joke: "The German gift for the fiftieth anniversary", says the title of an article on the Turkish internet platform "Haber X", referring to the background of the murder chain.
The German show "Hürriyet" also does not insist on drawing this mental connection.
"Starts to smell bad," says Ahmet Külahci's column title.
It should be noted that the murdered were persons who paid their taxes and made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany with their work.
In the online forums of Turkish-speaking Germans, police behaviour and their subsequent success in search are discussed very critically.
The authors are surprised that the German authorities did not seek much earlier suspects in the ultra-right circle.
Some appear to be less rhetorical about the drastic media: "From now on, immigrants are lost, they are left with no more than self-defence and weapons."
"This will be the best self-protection."
"Internal peace in Germany depends heavily on the quality of clarity and the adequacy of sanctions throughout the network," writes "Selen".
This means that if the domestic peace of Germany is in danger, the attacks of Mölln and Solingen will be clarified in ninety years.
The image of the ruins of Solingen's fire has been recorded in German and Turkish memories.
No other event showed more clearly to the Turks living here that there is a specific threat and to the Germans that mistrust and distance can lead to violence.
The attacks exacerbate the group feeling of the Turkish side.
Do not repeat past errors
In the Turkish press, mainly the lack of German policy after the attacks, Helmut Kohl refused to visit Mölln's survivors.
After Solingen's firefighting, he sent a pesamé telegram to the Turkish President and Klaus Kinkel, his Foreign Minister, replaced him at the Cologne funeral. Kinkel detailed in his speech what the German Turks contribute with taxes.
It is clear how a person's value is calculated according to the amount of his taxes.
The current information from the Turkish media shows again how deep it has since been the mistrust of many of the Germans of Turkish origin in the legality of this country.
In addition to the efforts of a comprehensive explanation and a re-evaluation of extreme right-wing terrorism in Germany, French words are needed this time.
The bank of the scandal of Lake Zurich
The most risky bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, if not in Switzerland.
The UBS almost went into bankruptcy in the financial crisis and has since slipped from one crisis to the next.
Now she's headed by a German.
I'm sure Axel Weber didn't think so.
After its spectacular departure from the federal bank summit, in July it was known that in 2013 it would begin in a new and almost equally spectacular work: President of the administrative board of the Swiss Grand Bank, an unexpected and lucrative step in its career.
Axel Weber is pleased publicly, thanks Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newly acquired strength and lets you have some kind comments about your future companions.
"The USB has achieved a revitalization."
"I'm happy to work with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
In September it became clear that everything would be completely different.
A USB financial operator in London avoided all bank security systems and robbed 1.7 billion euros.
Oswald Grübel, CEO of the USB, a banker not only known in Switzerland, had to come.
Since then, the president of the USB administrative board has been considered equally affected, and everyone has asked: When does Axel Weber arrive?
It was known that Weber should advise the bank since February 2012.
And it will take over the presidency of the Administrative Council in May, not in early 2013, as announced by the Bank on Tuesday.
This is hard for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, rather, a professor of economics and counsellor and has certainly had a period of adaptation needed.
He is responsible for the strategy of a bank, which has just proved that he deserves the title "the largest bank of the scandal in Europe" for a long time.
On the one hand, USB is huge, until recently it was the world's largest asset manager, and on the other hand, for years, it has been falling from a scandal to the next.
Nothing, it seems, saves the former so proud Swiss bank.
The financial crisis began.
USB had an excellent reputation until 2007.
The image of the Swiss property manager discreetly and solidly, but also fine, was combined with ambitious goals, also wanted to be a large number in investment banks.
On the one hand, with $1.6 billion, USB manages more money from incinerated customers than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, he has made progress as an investment bank in the league of the great banks of the world.
That's impressive.
Hans Geiger, the former banker and subsequent bank professor in Zurich for many years, explains: "Before my students, I have always qualified USB as a model of a good bank."
"From the current point of view, one asks: How could I be wrong?"
I was in a big mistake.
In 2007 it came out in the light that something went very wrong on the USB.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, the director general, who until then was considered a brilliant and very intelligent banker, gave up surprisingly.
A few months later, the reason was suspected.
The bank's investment fund was put into high-risk losses and had to be amortised by billions.
To load this, the USB announced a capital injection of nothing less than 13 billion francs.
For this he found investors, of course, that some looked with contempt until recently: an Asian and opaque state fund of Singapore and an Arab state fund, so discreet, that his name had never been heard.
This was just the first blow.
In April 2008, it worsened.
The bank had to declare the loss of billions, Marcel Ospel, President of the Administrative Council, in 2006 in Switzerland's second best paid administrative council, resigned.
In October 2008, the disaster continued, in view of its wrong investments, and UBS was in the financial crisis before the crash and had to be rescued by the state.
The national bank bought troublesome UBS values for many billions, the Helvetic Confederation gave six billion francs for a compulsory convertible bonus, thereby becoming the bank's co-ownership.
All Switzerland was affected, the dramatic claim was made that this was for a small country, if it accommodates such large banks.
Finally, the amount of the balance sheet of the UBS in 2007 was more than five times higher than the economic results of Switzerland (see chart).
"We can't rescue the UBS again," said Geiger, a bank expert.
In the first disaster, the second was joined.
A few months later, UBS headed for a tax conflict with America and was willing to hand over the data of the affected customers, who had possibly been taxed with the help of the bank.
In addition, it approves a figure of $780 billion, the reimbursement of unjustified benefits for these businesses with a payment compensation.
With this, the UBS confessed more or less to have helped in the tax fraud.
Simultaneously he lost something that had always been his capital in competition for rich customers: the aureola of discretion.
After the scandal, the secret of the Swiss bank is no longer the same.
This was followed by the resignation of the President of the Board of Directors and of the President of the Administrative Council.
And the exodus of customer funds.
In this way, within a few months the bank lost credibility in its two central sectors: the investment bank through wrong speculation and property management through aid to tax fraud.
And just when I was going to be a little quieter again, just when it was thought that the UBS was going to get it again, this desperate operator's story happened, an individual operator cheated EUR 1.7 billion, before the bank realized that something was going wrong.
And it was revealed, therefore, that this still does not work well with risk management in the investment bank.
"The Adopoli case shows that risk controls have changed too little," says Martin Janssen, professor of economics and finance at the University of Zurich's Banking Institute.
The financial director of a large German bank is also sure: "The UBS problem is that it does not dominate risk controls".
The idea of caution, with which the Swiss bankers had long been present, arose to be the guardians of the world's largest goods: no too great a risk, on the other hand, the security of the money wants to break away from the Alpine republic.
The security deposits of the Swiss banks were the symbol of unbreakable reliability, such as Lindt and Sprüngli of the authentic chocolate.
The UBS centre in Zurich does not match the cliché of the Swiss solid private bank, it is only slightly larger.
The situation is classic.
The bank has its headquarters on the Bahnhofstraße street in Zurich, which goes from the main station directly to Lake Zurich, marked by covered snow peaks in the Swiss mountains.
Here the buildings are ostensible, the tenants are one of the highest in Europe.
Here are jewelry such as Tiffany`s among traditional Swiss businesses such as the Sprüngli Confectionery.
The Swiss banks have been living here for years: from the national bank, passing through the palace of Credit Switzerland, to the elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
It enters the reception room of the UBS by means of a heavy rotational door.
Inside the walls are walled with marble, facing large leather chairs, next to the bank logo there is a large letter to indicate the "security".
The UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: Security.
The two large Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Switzerland, at some point have shifted the idea of the large Swiss bank, or betrayed it, as the president of a small Swiss private bank believes.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, at the end and in the end he does, like all Swiss bankers, also with the business of both large banks.
The UBS has become too large, mainly in the investment bank, where Anglo-Saxons have gained land.
There the Swiss had nothing else to say.
"And they've been used for a long time to the habits of the Anglo-Saxons."
In fact, the UBS changed the Anglo-Saxon Investment Bank, gave up its first great gain and then came the disaster, and no European financial institution had lost as much money in the high risk jungle as the great Swiss bank.
On 15 October 2008, the disaster was clear.
"This Wednesday the government coalition of the small country of seven million decided the largest rescue operation in the history of its nation," writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "Der UBS-Crash" ("The Crash of the UBS" in Spanish).
Politicians granted up to 68 billion francs or about 45 billion euros to save the large bank of the bankruptcy.
How do they do it?
They talk to Swiss bankers, so they see the problem in the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks merged into a powerful consortium.
There is a bank that, due to the merger, was too large for small Switzerland, and continues to grow.
It therefore served to complement the two different precursor banks of the UBS: a rich but sleeping bank with the centre of the administration of goods in Zurich and a poorer but stronger internationalization.
Suddenly, international investment banks arrived in a timely manner with a lot of money, with which they could round a large financial bicycle.
There are two names related to this rise of the UBS: Peter Wuffli, head of the UBS consortium from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then president of the administrative board.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a perfect team," says the bank expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the intellectual, modest, who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuition he managed to open up from learning in the bank to the summit."
Finally, Ospel became Wuffli.
And at the end Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake: "He thought his models were a reality," says Geiger.
"It's a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
It is clear: The detachment arrived before the case.
UBS employees clearly agree with the meetings of directors, where Wuffli, the head of the consortium, always repeated the same motto: Getting off the throne to Goldman Sachs.
The American bank was the world's most powerful investment bank.
They headed the League Tables, the classifications that then documented the success of the banks.
The UBS wanted to be at the summit.
A few steps have worked out for him.
In foreign exchange operations and in the negotiation of shares, it was the highest.
However, business advisors in charge highlighted a weak point: In the business of international interest, in the "fixed income" bank language, there is a huge compensation for the large banks.
UBS is empty in American mortgage products.
To fill these gaps, the UBS began an adventure that almost cost its existence.
Growth yearnings have invested both the same bank and one of its high-risk funds created in high-risk American investments.
It was transformed into a powerful machine to hold American mortgage credits and sell them afterwards, keeping certain risks in their own hands.
And also, like other banks, he's been down for a long time.
"In the summer of 2007, as the American real estate market was in flames, UBS bought there," said Geiger, a bank expert.
So great the euphoria, so deep the fall.
A manager had to leave, as the attempt to order turned out to be more complicated than they expected.
The positions in the UBS have become projected seats and are uncertain to date.
Currently, those who run a large bank have an almost impossible job.
You must find a strategy for a bank, before which all logical business models are lost.
Geiger, an expert in banks, has an idea, put an end to the investment bank, focus on property management, return to the Swiss roots.
The bank doesn't want to get that far (still).
But the investment bank must decrease a lot, it's clear right now.
The next Thursday, Sergio Ermotti, the new president of the bank, will present his future strategy to the world.
In fact, it was only thought of the 51-year-old Italian-Swiss as a transitional solution, since the bank was surprisingly separated from its Grubel predecessor.
In the meantime, he was charged: he must lead the business of the UBS on a permanent basis, the Zurich bank announced on Tuesday.
Ermoti wants to return the investment bank to its state in the mid-1990s.

But this is not enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is it?
What do you want to make money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is sure to ask right now.
So far he just says he's going to look for a place with his wife in Zurich first.
Next year.
The fear of recession in Europe weighs on the US bag
The impending recession in Europe has frightened US investors at the beginning of the week.
The changes in government in Athens and Rome remain in force.
The slowed industrial production on the continent undermines the hopes of stabilizing a debt crisis in its origin.
General relief on government changes in Rome and Athens could not be imposed.
The euro fell in front of the dollar.
Last week, the Italian and Greek glass was seen half full, not half empty, but now the problems are going back to a first level, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
First of all, the financial assets are listed in the sales list.

What created skepticism among U.S. investors: "We are not an island, if not dependent," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe cannot be released so quickly from a recession, and there are more signs of weakness in the banks.
Warren Buffett, the legend of investments, just confirmed this caution, it is not yet clear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything necessary to end the crisis, said in an interview for the CNBC.
It is therefore too early to invest in State loans or European banks.
Instead, it throws down a decade of old principles and enters the U.S. technology sector.
Its investment of more than ten billion dollars in IBM supports the contribution of traditional consortium shares and makes it contributions against the trend in the market at first only a higher percentage.

Smart degrees extend in cities
In many places the grasses are considered "problem pajamas": they do not expel these intelligent animals from the cities for a long time, experts say.
Some like it, others want to get rid of it very quickly, the fats have for years belonged to the city's image, but in many municipalities the neighbors' complaints about the coarseness and noise of the animals are accumulated.
Although no means has appeared against the "problems" so far.
The grasses no longer leave the cities, the experts say in the first symposium on grasses in Leer, East Frisia.
There experts from all over the national territory discuss possible solutions.
Search for alternatives in cities
Ecologists attribute the problems of cities to the migration of the field of certain protected fats; chemical applications in agriculture clearly end with traditional vital spaces.
The hunting, the growing building and the fall of trees that host them make the life of birds difficult.
The fats are protected.
There are large colonies with over 600 breeding couples in Soest, Westphalia, among others in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim in Bremen, as well as in Leer.
There, in 2005, negative press owners jumped a controversial project to kill in mass at the district.
Critics have described the hunting of animals through traps for birds and the killing of straw as especially brutal.
"By expelling them and raising them in a normal way, nothing is achieved," Werner Klöver, urbanist and landscaper of Leer said.
Shooting the nests with water or throwing the trees are usually unwanted consequences, says also Manfred Kaiser, environmental expert Lahr, Baden-Wurtemberg.
"The animals deviate, the large colonies divide and distribute elsewhere."
They are only imaginable as an exception in hospitals, nursing homes or colleges.
"We must live with them, we don't catch them anymore."
Without the surroundings, the problem is not solved in the cities, opinion Wolfgang Kellner, Mayor of Leer.
It is possible to combine animals of sensitive residential areas and pastures to re-seasonate elsewhere.
"Information panels instead of chain saws" Uta Maria Jürgens, psychologist and ethnologist advertises against the aim of dealing with animals in a completely different way: "The best thing is that we can endure a peak on the face with ampoule."
Jürgens co-founded Schleswig-Holstein's teaching circuit on Ascheberger's fats, where letters inform about the lives of intelligent birds.
Meanwhile, the project is accepted by tourists.
Jürgens also has his own opinion on the criticisms of bird noise: "All are forms of communication, they have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of these animals are legendary, the fats not only take advantage of the resources to access sketchy mouth, unless they produce tools to use them as resources.
Recently, ethologists at the University of Cambridge tested in four degrees until the intelligence of birds reaches.
In an experiment, the birds quickly learned that they should let a stone fall on a platform so as to reach a pollen larva.
Without much training, they firmly recognized the size and shape of the stone to fall on the platform.
In a second test, the fats had to solve a complicated problem.
The researchers placed a small cube with a pollen larva in a vertical cylinder.
Birds couldn't get to their prey with their pick.
But the researchers left them a piece of wire.
With which the four animals formed a hook, with which they fished the cube in the tube puller.
Three of the four fats got it in the first attempt.
Portugal at Eurocopa 2012 thanks to Christian Ronaldo
The Bosnians and the Turks have no hope in the championship.
The favorites, Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland will also be at Eurocopa 2012.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have sealed the latest Eurocopa 2012 tickets in Poland and Ukraine on playoffs.
Guided by the triumphal hero Christian Ronaldo (8, 53.), Portugal swallowed Bosnia-Herzegovina 6-2 (2-1) and, after 0-0 of the party of departure, made the following five Eurocopa participations.
The Czechs got 1-0 (0-0) in the back of the play-offs game with the Montenegro Outsider, after they left things clear on the go (2-0).
Croatia did not allow it to be marked on the 0-0 against Turkey, Ireland obtained a 1-1 (1-0) fleet against Estonia.
Nani (24), Helder Postiga (72, 82) and Miguel Veloso (80) marked the other goals of Portugal.
The former Bundesliga professional, Zvězdan Misimovic with a penalti (41.) and Captain Emir Spahic (65.) shorted distances twice for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic obtained a red card (54.).
Bosnia failed because of Portugal in the 2010 South Africa World Playoffs.
At the Da Luz Stadium in Lisbon, Portugal began perfectly.
Ronaldo ran a live free from more than 30 meters to get his head on the points.
A quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his gears to mark from far and got the 2-0 from 25 meters.
The Bosnians, who did not shine in the first half of the hour, had their first clear opportunity thanks to the cyclist Edin Dzeko.
The former Wolfsburg team player, Manchester City English leader, sent a head to the pole, but the balloon did not cross the gateline (33.).
Jiracek made the right choice for the Czech Republic
Next, Collegiate Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding was in the eye of the hurricane.
After the attack on Helder Postiga in the area of the Bosnian penti, he decided to show the Portuguese yellow card for being thrown to the ground (36.).
On the opposite side, Stark painted a controversial penalty after an action by Fabio Coentrao, which transformed Misimovic.
After the break, the 2004 European Vice-Campie clarified everything with 4 goals.
The Czechs ended the last doubt in the 81st minute with Petr Jiracek's goal.
The 1976 European champion is ranked for the fifth consecutive time for the Eurocopa.
Coach Michal Bilek's team with the Legionary of the Bundesliga Michael Kadec (Bayer Levekusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1. FC Nuremberg) were also lucky and had to overcome a second reaction in the initial phase.
At the last moment, Porter Petr Cech avoided with a reflection a possible goal at the door of Tomas Sivok (9).
Montenegro had more possibilities with two Steven Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic in action.
Damjanovic scored in the 40th minute of the turn of the front, very just in the Chech gate.
After the break the Czechs had to protect the width of the world famous porter, the FC Seoul front again escaped (50.).
Finally, the goal before the end was decided by the party.
Meanwhile, Turkey took advantage of Zagreb's wonder of football.
Four days after 0-3 in Istanbul, the Turks did not spend a 0-0 in Zagreb.
While it was almost certain that national coach Guus Hiddink had to leave his seat at the World's Third Bank in 2002, the Croats celebrated their fourth participation at the end of the Eurocopa.
Before 31,000 spectators at the Maksimir Stadium, the Turks almost attained a dream principle.
In the seventh minute and with a long shot, Selcuk Inan only managed to play the position. The attacker Kazim Kazim also could not send the balloon inside the door.
After the second reaction, Croatia took control more and more.
After the break, Croatia did not allow any goals to be set.
Along with Mario Mandzukic from VfL Wolfsburg, who in the 62nd minute took place Ivan Perisic, from Dortmund, Danijel Pranjic (Bayern de Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Intracht Frankfurt) are the legions of the Bundesliga in practice.
Trapatoni goes to Eurocopa
In Dublin, Irish have been the first to participate in the Eurocopa since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward took the team of Coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who won with the 4-0 in the party prepared for a previous decision, was put to the head in minute 32.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57.) joined the guest team.
Ireland pressed from the beginning, but it had to wait until the 23rd minute, when Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy had his first great opportunity.
From the very first moment, the defense has avoided possible goals of advantage.
But in the 32nd minute he made it.
After defending the porter Pavel London, Ward appeared and shot the balloon across the line, reaching 1-0.

Personal Massacre
The intense and generous new book of Peter Englund, The Beauty and the Pain of the Battle (The Beauty and the Sorrow): An intimate story about the First World War, "begins with a long drama character of the kind that can make one's soul fall to the feet.
Here are some action tips: Gently start this page and turn it into your brand pages.
It will come to know these people very well in Mr. Englund's news story, and this dramatic character will function as his GPS, a lighthouse during those few moments in which, as one of his men and women, he is confused and disassociated in the cloud of war.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which grants the Nobel Prize in Literature.
What you have written here is a low-voltage book, which correctly describes it as "an anti-history work".
It contains some notable names, important treatises or famous battles; there are virtually no ambassadors, elegant journalists or discussions about tactics or material.
It's not so much a book about what happened, it explains, as "a book about how it happened." It's about "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods."
"The beauty and pain of battle" combines the experiences in times of war of about 20 ordinary men and women, on both sides of the war, from colleges and botanicals to escalators, doctors, ambulance and administrative drivers.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Some will become prisoners of war, or lose their members, become mad, or die.
Their lives are here as vocal candles lit in a church; some new ones are added to the mixture while others are extinguished.
Mr. Englund's book is a deviation from standard history books.
It is also a correction to the notion that World War I was only the fungus war of trenches in the western front.
"The beauty and pain of the battle" moves expertly through other theatres of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the eastern front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
Soldiers in this book fall over the hills; one spends Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; Tse-tse flies are an intrusible problem.
This is a moving book, almost from the beginning.
The war inflames the lives of these people as a natural disaster, a Hurricane Katrina, which clings to cordita.
When the artillery fire is heard in the distance, and you're a woman who's at home with your children, are you staying or running?
Anyway, who's coming?
Almost no one understands what's going on, not even why we have to fight this war.
"Farence of facts," Mr. Englund observes, "has been filled with conjectures, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"The beauty and pain of battle" follows individuals like Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German sailor from the high seas fleet.
Their stories have been obtained in most of their memories, letters and other material previously published.
The explanations of your life may be scary or moving, but they are more full of life in the accumulation of small moments, lost details, of Mr. Englund.
Many of these are about privacy and dealing with what is there.
About telling the story of a German college says: "Successors everywhere."
"Cafe succession, false aluminum, imitation rubber, paper sales, wood buttons."
He continues to talk about the happening food in Germany.
It describes "meat made from cooked rice and pressed in sheep's fat (and finished with a false bone made of wood); tobacco made from roots and pellets of dried potatoes; shoes with wooden soles".
There are, notes, "837 meat substitutes allowed in the production of sausages, 511 coffee substitutes registered".
Some stories are about honor and value.
An American recognizes his own impulse to wildism and demonstrates about the war: "You feel that after all, this is for what men are conceived and not for sitting in chairs with a cigarette and a whiskey, the afternoon newspaper or a best seller, and pretend that this infantry means civilization and that there is no bar behind that half-screw and tachyon."
Instead, a British soldier realizes that he is likely to die, and that no one will know or care about him.
"Once you give up the thought of sacrificing yourself, one would like to think that it could happen in front of the public," he writes.
On the other hand, it is horribly similar to "to a convicted being strangled in secret".
Other observations are about an old Europe disappearing, and about new types of terror.
"The conflict has become increasingly an economic competition," writes Mr. Englund, "a war between factories."
It reflects the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the animalry of the young century: the eloquent and ideologically convinced murderer with well-made clothes that executes his butcherry while sitting behind a desk".
People behave in unexpected ways; there is both innocuous and heroic behavior.
Mr Englund is talking about soldiers who have actively tried to catch a venereal disease of prostitutes as a way to escape the service ahead.
"The most grotesque expression of this can be seen the trade of gonococious pus, which soldiers buy and embitter their genitals with the hope of ending in the hospital," he writes.
"Those who are truly desperate blow it over their eyes, which often leads to a blind man for life."
In this Swedish translation by Peter Graves, the prose of Mr. Englund agile but not extravagant, is perfectly adapted to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes it reflects the way in which the war to "desert exceptionally uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People start asking why their leaders are making them fight.
The best books about World War I have often been indirect, such as the Great War and Paul Fussell's modern memory, or novels such as No novelty in front of Erich María Remarkque, instead of comprehensive stories.
Mr. Englund's volume is connected to a non-conventional pantheon.
His book has one of the most devastating endings I can remember in a nonfiction work.
I won't reveal it.
But it is as if it had come from his book, drawn from between your fingers that page of dramatis personae, and burned it with a beryl.
After a false step, a planned attack per minute
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them carrying anti-disquieting helmets.
The night of Monday was chosen on Tuesday because Zuccotti Park would be more empty.
The operation was kept in secret except for a few high-ranking officers, initially telling others that they were joining an exercise.
Police inspector Raymond W. Kelly was in the center, his presence highlighted how the operation was being hit by challenges for the police department.
The episodes of recent weeks could not be repeated, such as the spraying of pepper spray on the protesters, violating departmental rules and creating a public sympathy storm towards the "occupations".
That is why the police operation to clear the Zuccotti Park of protesters was revealed after two weeks of planning and training.
Officers had been prepared to see occupations in other cities developed.
A major catastrophe simulation was taking place on Randalls Island, with an eye looking at Zuccitti.
The officers increased the so-called training of riots - counter-terrorism measures that involved quickly mobilizing a large number of police officers - to focus on the Lower Manhattan.
The last training session was on the night of Monday, on the east bank of Manhattan.
The orders to enter the park arrived in the "last minute", said someone familiar with the orders, who referred only to the mission as "an exercise".
"To the few cops I know they were called for this, they didn't tell them it was to enter the Zuccotti Park," said the person, who spoke anonymously.
"The only people who knew they were going to enter the Zuccotti Park were at the department's highest levels."
One reason for secretism was a lesson learned by the city.
On October 14, some agents wanted to clear the park, but they gave up when hundreds of protesters came up early after hearing about the plans.
The Tuesday operation involved agents from several police units, including special forces from all over the municipal district - dozens of mobile agents who used to flood neighborhoods with high crime rates.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, like those who travel daily to work, had been going and coming from the park during the day, doing 1 a.m. a good time to get in.
"It was appropriate to do so when there were the smallest number of people in the park," he said.
Trucks from the Emergency Services Unit with focus and speakers gathered on the Pike Slip cross with Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before leaving.
The lights and precipitated messages from the speakers seemed to intimidate many protesters.
Community affairs agents went to the park with their clear blue shorts, many protesters just picked up their stuff and left.
No shop was touched until 1:45 a.m., the police said, giving the protesters time to collect their belongings.
Other teams of agents were seen meeting in the perimeter to enter if arrests were needed in the park.
Journalists in the park were forced to abandon it.
Paul J. Browne, the chief spokesman of the Department of Police, said it was for his safety.
But many journalists said that they tried to avoid the police coming into action in the park, and that they had been treated abruptly by the agents.
Mr Browne said that mobile television units on Church Street, along the western edge of the park, could capture images.
As the police moved west through the dense margin of personal effects of demonstrators, including paper and plastic trash bags and scraped clothes, cleaning department teams followed them, collecting what was left behind.
Some protesters who refused to move were dragged out, showing images on the Internet shortly after.
A central group of protesters took positions near the camp's kitchen area, near the center of the park.
Some made a barrier, and the police came in to arrest them methodically.
About 10 people in the camp's epicenter were rubbed between them by their arms.
And two people were chained to trees, Mr. Kelly said.
Emergency service agents were called to cut down the candidates.
There were no arrests in the park until about 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly said.
The discharge operation was completed about 75 minutes later, the police said.
Mr. Browne said some 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests were due to "change of public order and resistance to authority", he said.
The highest-ranking officer on the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the department, the senior uniformed officer in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, the department's head of detectives, was also there.
Mr. Kelly, while he was present, "he wasn't running the operations," Mr. Browne said.
A second group of agents were waiting along the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar streets, if they had to enter.
Barricades were raised on Cortlandt Street, a block in the north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block in the south.
From these positions, the police were seen extending the perimeter even beyond the Zuccotti Park.
At a given time, a number of agents, many of them with shields, were seen pushing people out.
There were about 28 people in the north perimeter.
Some of the most noisy action of the night took place south of the park.
About 5 a.m., south of Pine Street, a protestant jumped over the top of a police car, and others were seen taking off the wheels of a police van.
At a given moment, a piece of blanket came out flying from the crowd.
In the end, an agent and a protestant were hospitalized.
The union of support workers will demand the city for the unemployed
The union representing hundreds of school support workers who lost their jobs last month plans to apply to the city on Wednesday, claiming that dismissals were unnecessary and discriminatory because of their disproportionate impact on schools providing for poor students.
The request is possibly the last weapon available to the union, the municipality district 37, in its effort to withdraw the dismissals.
Sixty-two school assistants, parents' coordinators and other employees who were among the worst paid in the city lost their jobs on 7 October, in a movement that trade union leaders described as a political revenge for their refusal to allow, last spring, access by the city to a health care fund by working groups to close their budget gap.
The municipal authorities have categorically denied that charge.
In a hearing in the City Hall last month, education counselor Dennis M. Walcott said that dismissals were part of the budget approved in June.
A member of the Council countered by saying that nothing in the budget specified that school support staff members would be fired.
Officials of the municipal district 37 said they filed the complaint in writing, warning the Department of Education that it would be requested. A press conference will be held on Wednesday to announce the official submission of the complaint, at the Supreme State Court in Manhattan.
The claim will include Mr. Walcott and the City Education Department as accused, and has eight dismissed workers as claimants, all of them black or Latin women, as well as most of the assistants who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, spokesperson for the Legal Department of the City, said that the city had not seen the claim and therefore could not comment on its specific allegations.
According to a claim by The New York Times, the union has focused on the number of dismissals in poor urban schools to support a claim for unfair treatment, saying that poor schools have lost more assistants, since they had been insufficiently subsidized in a chronic way.
It is noted that although there were no dismissals in Staten Island and a few dismissals in schools in the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school assistants lost their jobs in the District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 were fired in the Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
In view of the loss of five out of eight assistants employed by the 36 Public School in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the claim says, "This is not a neighborhood of infirm parents who can raise funds to cover the budget deficit."
P.D. The district budget of 36 was reduced by 3.26 per cent this year, and also lost money when the city changed the way the additional funding is calculated for each poor student registration in schools.
The union also claims that the principals of secondary schools may have been deceived by language in a memorandum that allows the dismissal of parents ' coordinators.
The memorandum used the word "exceeding" to describe the action, although "exceeding" more often describes the act of transferring a teacher from a school nominee to a work bag, whose salaries are paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six parents' coordinators were fired," says the complainant, "and not only in excess."
Mission completed, Congress prepared to reach agreement on Libya
It seems that Republicans and Democrats in the Capitol are finally willing to agree on something related to the rise in Libya.
All it took was that the rebellion was successful, that the veteran dictator Muamar Gaddafi was captured and murdered, and that U.S. involvement was at its end.
On Tuesday, the Senate's Committee on Foreign Affairs will consider a resolution, sponsored by President John Kerry (democratic by Massachusetts), along with Senator John McCain (republicist by Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (independent by Connecticut), applauding the Libyans for their successful rebellion and the US troops for their "valence".
"This resolution is to honor the braves of Libya, beginning to rebuild their country," Kerry said.
"It is a bipartisan statement of support for its democratic aspirations."
The language may seem harmless, but nothing about the debate on Libya has been easy so far.
This summer, the legislators of both parties fought each other and the White House on the drafting of a series of resolutions to approve or reject the role of U.S. military in NATO's mission to Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain submitted a resolution authorizing the limited use of US military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated in the Chamber by a wide bipartisan margin, and it never came to vote in the Senate.
But the same day the bill was rejected in the Chamber, the House also rejected a measure that would have cut funds for US operations in Libya.
That left the U.S. mission in a kind of legislative purgatory - with Congress as upset as to criticise Obama's management of the mission, but not as angry as to actually track the grass under his feet.
Next, Congress indecisiveness was overcome by events.
Tripoli fell into the hands of the Libyan rebels in August, and Gaddafi was murdered on 20 October.
NATO's mission ended officially on 31 October.
Now the Senate could be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Affairs " congratulates the people of Libya for their tremendous courage and extraordinary resistance to free themselves" and "Praises the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their coalition partners who participated in military operations to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionalism".
The resolution also "declares the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new measure win the full support of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, or will it divide the legislators as it did the draft law of June?
The latest version was rejected by Senator Richard G. Lugar (India), the committee's main Republican.
Lugar spokesperson said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new bill.
On the other side of the Chapter, the House will vote this week on a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Republican congressmen and some Democrats.
The measure, sponsored by Republican Bob Goodlate (Republican by Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or any other item that is actually a vote of the whole assembly in the Chamber or Senate at this Congress.
Other legislators have not succeeded until now in bringing their amendments to the Assembly, but not because of lack of attempts.
Goodlate's is only one of the 68 constitutional amendments that have been introduced at this Congress, covering a wide range of topics.
Some are duplicated - the same bill is proposed in both the Chamber and the Senate - and others with slight variations among themselves.
There are at least 15 versions of the budget balance amendment only in the House, and another fist that "will control federal expenditure."
Some of these bills are also identical among themselves, but they give their sponsors - especially new Republicans who are seeking to refine their curriculums - the opportunity to complain that they were the "authors" of this measure.
The Budgetary Control Act, which was adopted in August, required both the House and the Senate to vote on an amendment to the budgetary balance.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of this amendment.
Beyond the budget, a number of members want to limit the number of mandates that Congress members can fulfil, while the representative of José E. Serrano (democratic by New York) wants to remove the two mandates for the presidents.
Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democratic by Illinois) has proposed a series of amendments that guarantee the right to quality education and health care, among others.
An amendment that prohibits homosexual marriage is a perennial proposal, as well as one that prohibits flag burning.
Some legislators also want to allow the abolition of federal laws if they are rejected by two thirds of the states.
As enthusiastic as the members have been at the time of proposing amendments, they are not moving at a faster pace than in previous years.
At the 111th Congress, the legislators proposed 77 amendments, and presented 66 in 110th.
The pace is unacceptable compared to the 1990s, when members regularly submitted more than 150 amendments every two years, according to the figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they didn't have much more success then than they have now.
The last amendment added - 27 - was ratified in 1992, but in fact it was proposed by the Congress in 1789.
"Blowed but not defeated, " Giffords talks on his first TV interview since the shooting
Ten months after a gunman shot him on fire in an act constituting Tucson, representative Gabrielle Giffords (democratic by Arizona) appeared on national television on Monday night, sang along with Broadway's melody "The Sun will come out tomorrow" and said he wanted to recover more than he wanted to return to Congress.
On his appearance in ABC News "20/20", with Diane Sawyer, Giffords struggled to form prayers and needed help to walk.
The program documented his difficult way back from the damage caused by a bullet that broke his skull and pierced the left side of his brain, and passed from the front to the back of his head.
Three months ago, he was surprised to return to the Chamber to issue his triumphant vote in the debt ceiling agreement.
In his first television interview since the shooting in January, he killed six and injured 13, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and described his recovery as "hard".
When Sawyer asked him how he felt, 41-year-old Giffords replied, "That's good enough."
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a special program of "20/20" of an hour long, which was broadcast on the evening of the publication of the new book of the couple, "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope".
The special programme analyzed the recovery of Giffords since the shooting on 8 January.
In videos recorded by Kelly in the first few weeks, she is seen in her hospital bed, with her head shaved and a long scar passing through her front.
She can only keep one or two fingers up, while her husband keeps her soul.
Months later, he sees Giffords sitting on a wheelchair while the therapists teach him how to perform simple actions.
A head movement.
A rubbing of lips.
And then his first word, "What."
Within a few days, Giffords pronounced another word - "tossed", a request for change in his breakfast menu.
Videos broadcast by ABC show that music played a central role in the recovery of Giffords: The congressman is seen singing with the therapists the songs "Girls Just Wanda Have Fun" by Cyndi Lauper and "Free Falling" by Tom Petty.
In the interview with Sawyer, Giffords, two hours of therapy every day, he said he didn't remember the shooting day.
Her husband said he was reading to Giffords an article in the paper on the March 12 murder when she stopped him for the first time to ask about the six who had died in the incident.
The suspect gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is detained in a Missouri prison and is being medicated by the force while awaiting trial.
"Many people died," Giffords told Sawyer.
Hard, hard, hard.
Kelly told Sawyer that at a moment of his wife's recovery, she said, "I've been defeated."
"So, I said, 'Gabby, you haven't been defeated,' said Kelly.
"You've just been hit.
And you're going to get out of this, and you're going to recover and you're going to come back stronger than ever."
Troops make you feel more sorry than I do
The event was a Wall Street gala that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about impotence, frustration and loss.
At that time, several hundred soldiers, sailors, sailors, sailors and children of the Navy broke into their positions around him.
The crowd of tags stood up and applauded.
"Men and women were considered heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the collection of spring funds.
A high-ranking military officer in the gala, also known as then the president of the Joint Major State, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They were shown as a kind of orphan child," wrote the officer in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know they had them.
But it wasn't respect, really.
The markedly contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship that has been seized by the military and a U.S. public often far away, sometimes, worshipers.
It is distributed to troops with praise for their sacrifices.
But praise has a price, the members of the service say.
The public is more and more acting like they're punishing those uniforms.
"We are not victims at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who ordered the troops in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way some show their support is to put us in the role of the dead souls."
The issue is a very sensitive issue for military leaders, who do not want to seem ungrateful or disagree with the public they serve.
It is also noted that the anger faced by the troops who returned in the last years of the Vietnam war was much worse.
As a result, most of the discussions on pity are held in silence and in private among war veterans.
After her two children returned from fighting the Navy Infantry, Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that people other than the military would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with a sense of fear because they faced the insurgents and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if there would be "an angry and violent vet under the surface," said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to a high-level government job in Washington.
During his search for employment, he said, he felt that some interviewers had subtlely asked him whether he would be able to endure under pressure from a demanding job in Washington immediately after his fight.
"When you talk about your service, you need to deal with negative impressions," Cancian reminded her children.
The military concerns arise, in part, from the American indifference to war.
The achievements in the battlefield are rarely elected for the praise of a country that has little familiarity with the military and sees little direct benefits from the wars of Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We, as a nation, no longer appreciate military heroism in ways that were quite common in World War II," said General Lieutenant-General David Barno, who led the U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
On the other hand, the praise of politicians and the public is largely focused on the depth of the suffering of a member of the service.
The troops are recognized by the number of turns they have endured, the number of friends they have lost or the extent of their injuries.
The army faces increasing pressure to end the rape
This week, a historical hearing will decide whether 28 women and men have a case against the army for their alleged commitment to rape.
If not, hundreds of applicants are being organized for the following.
The first soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant the night she said she was raped by a companion.
It was October 2008, and was headed back to his quarters at Miramar Air Base, north of San Diego, after dinner with a friend when he met a colleague who carried a 12-pack of beer.
He asked her if she could join her in her room for a drink.
"It was an alarm signal," says Lyman.
However, Texas natives left their concerns aside.
I thought, no, he's 19.
"It's Texas," he says.
"I wish I'd listened to my instincts."
Within minutes of entering Lyman's room, the man approached her behind her, throwing her down and raping her, claiming.
This week, on 18 November, Lyman and 27 other members of current and former military personnel are eagerly awaiting a judicial decision in a historic trial to be held in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide whether the claim they have filed against the former Secretary of Defence Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be tried.
The claim claims that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to reduce the widespread violation among the military, in violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
Presented in February by Susan Burke, a Washington lawyer, D.C., the claim initially involved 17 claimants, but grew to 28 in the following months, 25 women and three men, all claiming that they were raped or sexually assaulted by their companions, and that the army failed at the time of investigating, prosecuting, or giving adequate justice after the alleged attacks.
Burke says he's going to the army's largest level, because the problem starts with them.
"The army is a structure from above," he says.
"Who are the people who are capable of eradicating the culture of retaliation?
Burke also says that since February, about 400 more survivors have been contacted, many of whom could be part of future demands.
Your strategy: Instead of collecting all the applicants in this case, putting all the eggs in the same basket, so to speak, it will present several cases, if necessary, to keep the pressure.
The Defence Team for the Department of Defence, headed by federal prosecutor Neil MacBride, has given an incentive to dismiss the case.
The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defence strategy - essentially, that soldiers cannot be prosecuted by current or former soldiers for injuries suffered by the armed forces.
By a 1950 Supreme Court judgment called the Doctrine Feres, the federal government is not responsible for the damage suffered by staff in active service.
"The alleged damage is part of the military service of the claimants," the documents say.
The Department of Defence refused to comment on this article.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women are still officially forbidden to serve in combat, this distinction is only nominal: Modern wars rarely have clear lines of front.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, armed women's teams are playing increasingly important roles, especially to reach local women in war zones.
The result: 150 women and two thirds of them have died in combat.
It's time the army is also modernizing, says Burke.
She is not alone in her struggle, and three other demands are in progress, besides her.
At Yale Law School, the Veterinary Legal Services Clinic is preparing a case against the four main military academies for allegedly promoting a misogytic environment.
On the other hand, the non-profit organization Vietnam Veterans of America is making a claim against the army that focuses on the diagnosis of "personal disorder" assigned to victims of rape in order to give them the highest service - a common event, according to activists, such as Anu Bhagwati of the Network of Women's Action in Service, a group of human rights.
His group filed a claim in December against the Veterans Administration, accusing it of discriminatory practices in the way it manages claims of benefits for those who claim to have been sexually assaulted in the service.
Nine separate bills have been submitted to Congress by a bipartisan mixture of senators and representatives, proposing a series of corrections.
In 2010, there were 3,158 reported sexual assaults, according to the Office for the Prevention of Sexual Aggression and Response of the Department of Defence.
However, the aggressions are reportedly reported below, and by the Pentagon ' s own estimates, which is approximately 13.5 per cent of the estimated 19,000 incidents that occurred that year.
The report, published in March, also examines the processing indices: in 2010, about 20 per cent of the cases reported in the army were tried - half of them in the civil justice system.
The applicants in Burke's case describe their attacks as only the first of a series of traumas.
In Lyman's case, he reported alleged rape to the military police less than an hour after it happened.
That night, he says, he was asked to tell details of his rape 11 times different from a crowd of policemen, doctors, and commanders.
She was subjected to a rape kit, and the blood of her attacker - from a cut in her arm - was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended a hearing before a judge, during which he was asked if he had had had sexual relations with his boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six persons declared themselves to be witnesses of personality on behalf of the alleged author, who was finally acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was read," says Lyman.
"I thought I was going to go to work--I found myself screaming from the room."
"They put me in the psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember telling my commanding officer, "That wasn't his judgment. That was my judgment."
Lyman was ordered to visit a military psychiatrist, who finally diagnosed a personality disorder, which made her unfit for service.
In January 2010, he was released from service in less-than-honorable terms, which prevents him from receiving any benefit.
As to whether the case presented by Lyman and his fellow claimants continues, it is a very remote possibility, says John Turley, Professor of Law at the George Washington Faculty of Law.
However, he points out, "In my opinion, they should be able to move forward."
What lies between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was first published.
I've been a permanent critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The army is decades behind because it does not have the same incentive and deterrence that raises responsibility.
And he adds, "The odds are strong against them... but it's important for them to try."
These things only change when good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing doesn't go on its way, Burke, the plaintiff of the plaintiffs, will put in the queue his other hundreds of plaintiffs for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the army on this issue until the reform takes place," he says.
"Or until we bet, what happens first.
The walls have eyes: How the researchers are studying you on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the extreme right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just another type of online anti-immigration approach.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to having committed a murder in Norway in July, who left 77 dead, faced his first public court hearing.
While Breivik may have acted alone, he was far from alone in cyberspace: he had spent most of his time attacking his computer, talking to some of the millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups on social networks.
After the tragedy this summer, researchers wanted to know more about these people.
But how do you find them?
Easy - you only have to access Facebook.
"We realize that it was not so difficult to get to them," says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a recently published report on European digital populism by the British study centre DEMOS.
The personal information ally of Facebook is so encyclopedic, says Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the advertising tool to determine their desired demographic characteristics with scientific precision - the way vendors have been using for years.
Bartlett's team found half a million fans of right-wing groups across Europe and then they were directed to ads, but instead of linking them to a new band or diet product, ads invited users to complete a survey that asked about their educational level, attitudes to violence and optimism about their own future.
On arriving through Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to study more than 10,000 followers of 14 extreme-right parties in 11 European countries - all without leaving the office.
"It's a completely new way to do an investigation," says Bartlett.
Some of the results are not entirely surprising: Online right-wing supporters tend to be young, men and angry with immigration.
However, in a kind of roundup, "those who combine their online activity with off-line activity are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who remain behind the computer screen".
The work of DEMOS is just an example of how Facebook is becoming a new and important tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centres, medical researchers and political scientists are using the site to study everything, from health problems to social trends as expressed in "I like", messages on the walls and state updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three pieces of content per day, Facebook's "supernova" is generating an increase in research, boosting the number of academic works with the name of the site in the title up to almost 800% in the last five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that it allows you to study people you couldn't approach with a folder on the street.
"Before, when you tried to investigate people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You'd have to go through the party, and they'd never let you access," says Bartlett.
"Facebook eliminates all that--you go to them directly."
Others say that the site could provide a way to identify and address social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and his colleagues found that university students who talked about their Facebook drunks had a significantly higher risk of drinking problems than those who remained silent about the subject.
Moreno suggests that students' partners, such as residential advisers, could control the site and intervene to help a student who publishs too many state updates with his drunks.
"You can't deal with a problem if you can't diagnose it," said Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Moreno and director of the Center for Health, Behavior and Development of the Child at the Seattle Institute of Child Research, Washington Post said.
"We have found a way to identify children at risk that would otherwise not be diagnosed."
Facebook is also constantly "pinning" your own population to get data.
The Site Data Team has compiled statistics on the status of the relationship and Valentine's Day, the expectation of electoral participation in the mid-2010 legislative period, and a National Happiness Index (mainly using the information that can be accessed - digital freedom defenders have long held that the site should make available to others its large amount of data for research).
However, Facebook users know that the site is watching them, they like it or not - the sacrifice for being able to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away is to allow the site to mine your personal information.
But what happens when Facebook users become part of a survey they don't even know?
While researchers have well-defined guidelines on how to collect their data offline, online is a free bar for everyone.
"I don't think many of the users have even thought about the fact that a researcher might be examining their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, about a 2006 study that took place with students' public Facebook walls.
"As far as they were concerned, it was just between them and their friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even off-line, there is no guarantee that a research topic is being completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know that part of a user's profile information and wall messages are true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside Facebook are two completely different things," says Selwyn.
That is why, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn believes that a paper and a boligraph are still the best research tools anyone can use.
"There is no substitute to enter the real world and talk to the real people," he says.
"Social research is supposed to be about social - and a lot of social still happens out of line."
"Free and Inhuman: Anders Behring Breivik makes his first public appearance in court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to being the brain of the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, has described himself as a fighter of "resistance" during his first public appearance in Oslo court.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and the Norwegian Templar Knights," he said in front of a room full of 500 people.
"I oppose the court because it has received the mandate of organizations that support the ideology of hate and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I recognize the facts, but I do not declare myself guilty."
Judge Torkiel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during that monologue, because "I didn't want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this audience as a platform to express his views".
For the same reason it was refused to allow Breivik, who delivered a written speech in advance, to address the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivik in custody for 12 more weeks, banned access to the media for four weeks, and said that the authorities would have to have strict control over all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and family members of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came with the hope of looking at Breivik in the eyes, others to confirm that he was locked under a key.
All attended with the aim of moving towards the conclusion.
"I thought it looked cold and inhuman," said a survivor of Utoya to the Norwegian NRK station.
"It was uncomfortable, but for me it was a step forward after seeing and hearing the suspect."
Dressed in a dark and curved blue dress, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the audience and looked at journalists and survivors in the eyes when he entered and left the building.
Despite Breivik's strange notion of being part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge determined that he was not a mental illness, and said that there was no evidence that he acted with complicity.
Some may be advised that the July 22 attacks seem to be the work of an extremist instead of a group of radicals.
But that does not automatically relieve the pain and confusion that every nation still feels.
"I'd like it to look like a monster, but it doesn't seem," said a victim's family.
"It would be much easier if it looked like it."
7 Lessons from Steve Jobs' lost interview, shown in a theatre this week
After Steve Jobs died on October 5, there were some who compared it to Henry Ford - distinguishing the genius of technology as the Great Modern Inventor.
But what Apple fans could find more revealing, in an interview with recently rediscovered Jobs, which has been evaporated as an advance of a series of special projections in the larger markets this week, is how much this creative mind understood about the trade processes and workflows of products.
He was undoubtedly a self-recognized designer, dreamer and hippie, but he was also a methiculous organizer and a yonki of flow charts - a man who believed that many executives were suffering "a disease that consists of thinking that a great idea is 90 percent of the work... [but] there is a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely was developing the television series The Triumph of the Nerds on the trees of the personal computer, and he sat for more than an hour with Jobs for an extensive and rare conversation.
At that time, it had been barely 10 years since Jobes had been forced to leave Apple, and he was already working hard on his new NeXT computer company, waiting for popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of the Cringely interview was used in Nerds, he said the originals of the interview disappeared during their transport.
It was only after Job death that a complete copy of VHS was discovered in the director's garage.
This file material, slightly re-edited, is Steve Jobs' base: The lost 68-minute interview that reaches the Landmark cinemas this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known to hate deep interviews, jobs here seem surprisingly willing to expose their technological philosophies and commercial strategies.
And very thoughtful.
In four different points during the interview, there is great silence between questions and answers - from 10 to 15 seconds of reflection, where Jobes is clearly suspending his thoughts, looking for precision.
There are also times when Job perfectionism goes up to the surface, where it seems impatient because of Cringely's questions, pushing him to go faster to the topics or arguments of greater importance.
Filmed before the Pixar era, the iPod or the iPhone, there is something strangely prophetic in The Lost Interview, when Jobs evaluates what other companies see doing good and bad, and offers their own vision of the future of computer science.
One thing is to read posthumous evaluations of the career of Jobs, but there is something cruel and inspiring in Jobs that we see here, the anxious dreamer at the edge of greatness.
He has a vision of how they can and must be things.
Not long after he explained everything in detail here, he went and did.
A quick summary of seven notable sequences of the missing interview:
About how you learned to carry a business:
"Over the years in the business, I always asked, "Why do you do things?" and the answers that give you invariably are, "Oh, that's just the way it is done."
No one knows why he does what he does, in business no one thinks about things very deeply.
That's what I found.
Jobs leads to detail their efforts to simplify Apple's accounting.
Disconcerned about the way in which costs were recorded - often starting with a "standard cost" that was made in the eye of good coverage, and then adjusted with a "variable" - developed an automated factory that ensured that commercial costs could be determined in detail.
On the Pope's joke:
Jobs tells the "Blue Box" that he himself built with Steve Wozniak - a device that allowed people to hack the phone effectively and make long calls for free.
It has been widely written about the device, but the euphoria of Jobs here when describing the Blue Box as an act of empowerment is contagious.
Describe how he and Wozniak tried the box using a public phone, making a call, and then connecting from one AT & T network to another, while creating a loop with as many satellites as possible.
"We were involved in things around the world a half dozen times and yelled through the public phone and went back to the public phone next door," says Jobes with a laugh.
"We were young and what we learned was that we could build something ourselves that could control billions of dollars in infrastructure around the world."
We two, we didn't know much, but we could build a little thing that could control a giant thing--it was an incredible lesson, and I don't think Apple would ever have existed without it.
Jobs continues to describe a glorious joke that he and Wozniak almost abandon, calling the Vatican through the Blue Box in the middle of the night and asking to talk to the Pope, while doing his best imitation of Henry Kissinger.
As several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to speak to the U.S. diplomat, the two were thrown into jail just before the Pope himself was woken up to answer the phone.
About falling in love with technology (and selling by phone with Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, he was looking for Bill Hewlett on the phone and called him.
Shortly after his 20-minute phone call, Jobes got a part-time summer job in Hewlett-Packard.
"That was a remarkable influence on me, it was the only company I had ever seen at that age and formed my vision of what a company was and what good they treated their employees."
Jobs later became one of the HP employees who visited the company's research laboratories in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desk computer ever made".
He was as big as a suitcase, he had a small cathode tube screen, and I fell in love with him.
I'd get a trip to HP as a teenager and waste time with that machine and write programs for her.
About improvising innovation:
At various points in the interview, Jobes is talking about inventing new products on the march.
Soon in his career, as he dedicated himself to selling a handful of basic plates, he asked him if he could install the entire equipment.
Working with only 30 credit days, I had to find out the installation and delivery of the finished devices.
Later, while in Apple, he recalls the struggles he faced in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember having dramatic arguments... they yelled at me that it would take five years [to create a mouse that would cost $300], and I got tired and went out and found a designer.
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could build for $15 and it was completely reliable.
About big companies losing strength:
Much before leading Apple's rebirth, Jobes prophetically predicted how many industry leaders would stumble into their vision and lose control of their market share.
"Say you're working on IBM or Xerox, so you're doing better photocopiers and printers, and what?"
You have the monopoly of the market share, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing departments increase their success, so these are the kind of people who end up leading companies and the people responsible for the products are expelled from the forum for decision-making.
The genius of the products that led to this monopoly position is powdered because of people who do not have the concept of good products vs bad products - the knowledge of the profession needed.
That's what happened in Xerox...
Xerox could have been taken care of by the entire computer industry.
It could have been ten times its size, it could have been Microsoft in the 1990s...
They took the defeat of victory.
About innovation as an artistic expression:
"There is a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product... as the great idea evolves, changes and grows."
Much is learned about the subtleties of the same.
There are sacrifices you have to do - some things you can't do to make the electrons, the glass makes them, the robots make them, the factories make them.
You have to keep 5,000 things in your brain - these concepts - adjust them all at once...
In the end, everything is reduced to the taste - lower to try to expose yourself to the best that a human team has done, and then try to adapt these things to what you are doing.
Picasso said good artists copy, great artists steal.
We've never been ashamed of stealing big ideas.
What partly made Macintosh great was that the people who were working on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, who were by chance the best computer scientists in the world.
If it wasn't for computer science, it could be doing wonderful things in other fields.
Scalia and Thomas dinner with rivals of the health care law while the court accepts the case
The day the Supreme Court met at closed doors to discuss the politically controversial question of whether they would accept the challenge to the health care law of President Obama, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were held at a dinner sponsored by the firm of lawyers who will present the case to the High Court.
The occasion was last Thursday, when the nine judges met in a preliminary hearing to study the revision requests in detail.
One of the cases in question was a request submitted by 26 States challenging the total reform of the health care approved by the Congress last year, a law that had been a war cry for conservative activists throughout the country.
The judges agreed to admit the claim and, in fact, a 5-and-a-half-hour claim is expected for March, and the result will probably further disrupt the 2012 presidential career, which will be in full swing at the time the court's decision is known.
The lawyer who will appear before the court and will claim that the law must be abolished will probably be Paul Clement, who served as U.S. Attorney General during the government of George W. Bush.
The law firm of Clement, Bancroft PLLC, was one of almost two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a group that has been dedicated for many years to the defence of conservative legal principles.
Another signature that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Independent Trade Federation.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., who has a huge financial interest in the outcome of the dispute.
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel, hours after the preliminary hearing of the court on the case.
Among the assistants was Mitch McConnell, the most important Republican in the Senate and a declared opposition to the health care law.
The special guests at dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
It is nothing new: The two judges have been attending events of the Federalist Society for years.
And it's not something that conflicts with ethical standards.
In fact, judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct governing the actions of the lower federal judges.
If they did not, it could be said that they would fall under the Canon 4C Code, which says: "A judge may attend events to raise funds from law-related organizations and others, although the judge cannot be a speaker, an guest of honor, or be included in the program of such an event."
However, the absolute proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the law firms in the case, as well as a company with a huge financial interest, was sufficient to alert ethical activists in the government.
"This impressive break of ethics and indifference to the code goes against the demands of several judges who enforce the court by the same rules that apply to all federal judges," said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause (Common Case).
"The judges were engaged in a collection of gala funds with lawyers who have pending cases before the court."
Their appearance and assistance in the collection of funds for this event undermined any demand for impartiality, and it was unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little interest in critics who say they mix too easily the activity of the court with the agenda driven by groups such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife, Ginni, is a prominent conservative activist.
On the other hand, the Conservatives argue that it is Judge Elena Kagan, who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan worked as Attorney General of the Obama Administration when the first legal challenges were presented to the law in the Court of First Instance.
His critics have pressured Kagan to refrain from seeing the case, saying that he was too involved in defending the law as for now being impartial.
Kagan hasn't given any indication that I'm going to do it.
Boeing receives a record request of $18 billion
The Emirates airline requires 50 Boeing 777 double-pass aircraft, with an option of 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner planes to Oman Air, an operation valued at over $1 billion.
Rarely is news when a company gets an order from 50 units of its product.
But it is a great deal when the company is the manufacturer of Boeing Co. aircraft and the sale price for the 50 aircraft is up to a record of $18 billion.
It is as big as the place where Boeing received the order: Middle East, a gold mine growing from future aircraft orders.
In a study published on Monday, the company in Chicago estimates that for the next 20 years, airlines in the Middle East will need $2,520 aircraft worth $450 billion.
Boeing announced during the end of the week his biggest demand for commercial aircraft for its value in dollars - 50 Boeing 777 double-step jets.
The successful request came from the Emirates airport in Dubai.
The airline also has an option to buy 20 more planes, which would raise the total sales price to $26 billion, Boeing announced in Dubai's 2011 Aeronautics Room.
Then Monday, Boeing said that Oman Air had requested six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliner, which assumed a fuel savings and services for spectacular passengers.
The sale price for six of them is over a billion dollars.
"This clearly has a huge positive effect on Boeing," said the analyst of Morningstar Neal Dihora.
"The quality of these particular customers is very strong."
Many Middle East airlines are owned by their oil-producing nations.
Therefore, not only do they have the money to pay the aircraft, but they have an increase in fuel prices - usually harmful for airlines, because it is one of the biggest costs - it is not so harmful, because the country is making money with the increase in oil price.
That is important because they have less chances than other airlines to cancel or delay flight orders when fuel prices increase, Dihora said.
"They have a natural protection," he said.
The application of the Emirates strengthens Boeing’s leadership in the wide-ranging aircraft market and helps keep your Airbus SAS competitor’s attempt to invade its domain with the A350 passenger plane.
Boeing's victory in the air fair takes place four months after Airbus said it was going to delay the debut of the largest A350, which competes directly with 777-300ER.
He delayed the debut to add more momentum after customers demanded an increase in the useful load and range.
Boeing Co's shares increased by 1.5 per cent to $67.94.
Mexico's president's sister, apparently defeated in Michoacán's vote
Luisa María Calderón claims that drug traffickers helped their opponent of the PRI, Fausto Vallejo, in the content for governor.
President Felipe Calderón's sister seems to have lost her candidacy to the governor of Michoacán during the elections of the violent state, and she said on Monday that the drug traffickers helped to bend the race in favor of one of their opponents.
Preliminary results led to the career for Western State governor Fausto Vallejo, of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the electoral process and, above all yesterday, is alarming, not only for Michoacán, but for the whole country," Luisa Maria Calderón said in a radio interview one day after Sunday's vote.
"They threatened our candidates, our electorate workers, they seized the urns, installed barricades, and ordered people to vote" in favor of the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost its presidency in 2000.
However, it is the stage of a return, and the victory in Michoacán is an important step in that effort.
The PRI is hoping to win the presidential elections in July.
Vallejo seems to have crossed a small margin to Calderón, who had led the polls before the elections.
Calderón, a candidate from the Conservative National Action Party of his brother, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the left-wing candidate for the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, who currently holds the position of governor, remained in third place, a great defeat for the left divided and unfortunate before the 2012 presidential elections.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the preliminary results.
Vallejo, the mayor of the capital of the state of Morelia, denied links to drug trafficking and urged the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has been dominated for a long time by drug cartels specialized in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines.
It is the birthplace of President Calderón, and he elected Michoacán to launch a military offensive directed at traffickers in December 2006.
However, violence has persisted.
A PAN mayor was murdered a week before the elections while campaigning for Luisa María Calderón, and many candidates left the local candidacy for fear.
Although for the PRI, because of the unpleasant appearance of the Michoacán elections, a victory will help push the party.
The man who is supposed to represent the PRI in the presidential elections, Enrique Peña Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said, "I think this victory should be very encouraging, from year to year."
BAsD urges Asia to help rescue the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (BAsD) has called on India and China to prepare to help rescue the eurozone from its sovereign debt crisis in order to avoid a long-term recession that would prevent the growth of Asian economies.
Rajat Nag, Director General of the Asian Development Bank based in Manila, said that the two world's fastest growth economies had to "do everything possible" to accelerate the recovery of the economic bloc through the International Monetary Fund or directly through bilateral agreements.
He warned against BRIC [Brazil, Russia, India, China] countries that observe Europe's difficulties in a "fair" way and said that Asia's financial assistance along with European leadership and resources would help avoid a long-term crisis in the global economy.
"We're all in this together."
"So anyone who can help Europe out of the crisis is useful," he told the Financial Times in an interview within the framework of the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
"Asia can be protected to some extent, but it can't be immune."
"So if China and India can help, that's all the means."
The European monetary union has been seriously undermined by a sovereign debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy's debt costs have been severely dropped and the prime ministers of Italy and Greece have dropped.
The current sovereign debt crisis in Europe has increased the fears that it could push the global economy into recession and has generated calls for the major emerging economies to join in helping the eurozone find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that any support from Asia would be channelled through the IMF, but he said that bilateral assistance - such as the purchase of EU ransom funds, the European Financial Stability Fund - offered a greater negotiating power for the Asian partners in Europe.
Anand Sharma, Indian Minister of Trade, said that "India will do its best" to help the eurozone as its own economy was now suffering the fall of exports and the exhaustion of foreign capital inflows.
"No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent," he said.
"We have monumental challenges and we have to maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not an option, it's an imperative, because where we find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women."
Others argue that developing economies such as India have no responsibility to help the rich Europeans when they face their own and deep economic problems.
Ashtosh Varshney, professor of Brown University in the United States, said it would be politically difficult to sell aid to Europe for the billions of two hundred thousand people in India, of whom up to 800 million live with about $2 a day or less.
"At some point they will realize that the Greeks retire at the age of 50 and leave from vacation to the beaches and that will not fall well," he said.
Lee Howell, Managing Director of the World Economic Forum, was also asked why India's reserves should be used to maintain numerous and well-paid Greek public sector workers in unmanaged business positions and loss generators such as railways.
Mr Nag said the eurozone crisis threatens with "significant chain effects" across Asia.
The Asian Development Bank forecast of 7.5 per cent of economic growth in Asia for 2011/12 is now facing "low-risk" because of Europe's threat.
He said that vulnerable emerging markets needed to make "contingency plans" to protect themselves from a crisis and significant capital outflows from their economies.
Serious warnings from the Pentagon about possible defense cuts
The Defence Secretary, Leon Panetta, warmed the Congress Monday, warning that the accompanying automatic budget cuts could undermine national security and cause a financial reaction in chains from the steps of the Pentagon, to the Afghan battlefields, to the civil assembly chains.
The Pentagon is already undermining $450 billion in reductions over the next decade, but now it fears an additional reduction of 600 billion or more in cuts that may be imminent if Congress does not reach an agreement on expenditure.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating to the department," Panetta said in a letter to Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina.
He said that Congress' failure to reach an agreement on the budget and its consequences, the so-called “rescue”, would result in 23 per cent of global reductions and a high number of new projects.
"A large cutting, applied in this indiscriminate way, would make most of our shipbuilding and construction projects impossible to execute - three quarters of a ship or building cannot be purchased - and seriously damage other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We would also be forced to separate many of our civil servants in an involuntary manner and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, it is almost certain that we would have to fire civilians in order to meet the goal."
"These changes would break faith with those who maintain our army and seriously damage the good mood."
The cuts in time would reach the combat troops, Panetta said.
"Although funding for wartimes in the offshore contingent operations accounts is not directly affected by the kidnapping, war efforts would be adversely affected by the serious disturbances in the core budgets," Panetta warned.
"The recruitment of personnel would be reduced, which would lead to delays in contracts and the supervision of the war-supported contract."
"Nominee staff would be reduced, resulting in delays in payments to wartime providers, and legal and political support would be interrupted."
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days ago, requesting information on the possible impact of automatic cuts in the Department of Defence.
"The consequence of a kidnapping in the Department of Defence would cause a rapid decline in the United States as the world's main military power."
"We are firmly against this draconian action," the senators said in a joint communiqué on Monday afternoon when they published Panetta's letter.
"This is not a result that you can live with, and certainly not one that we should impose ourselves."
"The kidnapping is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and should not be allowed to happen."
Whether the letter from Panetta and the senators' recent warnings will increase the pressure for a budgetary commitment or intensify calls for release from the Pentagon of the cuts are to be seen.
Panetta has been more and more frank about possible cuts, despite having come to work at the top of the Pentagon with years of experience in budgets in Congress and the White House and knowing that she faced difficult decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Defence Secretary painted a dark picture of what might be ahead - an army with a shell, but not a nucleus.
"It's a boat without sailors."
"It's a bulletless brigade."
"It's an air wing without enough trained pilots."
"It's a paper tiger, an army of quartiles, buildings and bombs without enough soldiers trained to carry out the mission," Panetta said in her opening words at the Pentagon.
"It is a force that suffers from low morals, poor preparation and is unable to keep up with the potential adverse."
"In fact, he invites aggression..."
In an addendum to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta states new details of how the reductions " generate significant operational risks: delay in response time to crises, conflicts and disasters; severely limits our ability to be deployed and committed in advance worldwide; and poses an unacceptable risk to future combat operations."
And Panetta said that some of the largest defence projects could face the spell, including those that are already being tested and some only in the early stages of planning.
This list includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter combat aircraft, a new planned bomber, the ballistic submarine of a new generation, the new coastal combat ship and the new ground combat vehicle that the Army and the Navy need to replace, the humvee.
To stop F35 ' s development and additional evidence could generate about $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but its supporters said it was the next vital step to improve and address potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to Detect a Lie
A look at the latest headlines tells us how serious and omnipresent deception and the lie in daily life are.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy exchanging charges of sexual harassment with several women; each party accuses of lying to the other.
The administrators of the State University of Pennsylvania have been accused of perjury for allegedly concealing reports that a retired football coach was sexually assaulting children.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was "piled" with an open microphone claiming US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
Lies have destroyed race and convulsed countries.
The congressman for New York and exhibitor for the Internet, Anthony Weiner, made the joke with his dissatisfaction quickly beaten up by the irrefutable test.
The former presidential candidate John Edwards has been accused of crimes in the financing of the campaign relating to the coverage of an extra-matrimonial relationship.
And again, no one who would live him will ever forget the media circuit that President Bill Clinton decapitated by lying during his second term of office about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
The legends about traps in school and university examinations are very extensive.
There have been cases where teachers have given student reviews to students in order to be better viewed in their performance assessments.
Mentors who should be teaching the contrary are sending the message that lying and cheating are acceptable.
How much deception do we find?
In any day, studies show that they can lie to you anywhere from 10 to 200 times.
That's for sure, many of those lies are divine lies.
Another study showed that the unknown lied three times in the first 10 minutes of meeting.
Detecting lies, or "the location of lies", is an essential skill that we must acquire all for both personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a table game similar to, for example, Charada, where the goal is to proclaim: "I have you," the detection of deception is a branch of knowledge would be based on scientific data obtained during the last six decades in prestigious universities that carried out deep research projects, especially in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the investigation is that the old myths about the lie have been remedied.
The liars do look at their eyes.
Not always tartamudean, balbucean, ruborize or worry.
It cannot be concluded that liars are difficult to detect or unmask.
A trained lie detector can come to the truth by learning about the structure of the statement, microfaceal expressions, questions and times.
I spent several years researching scientific discoveries about deception in the vast and always emerging body of knowledge, and it was clear that the detection of deception is a modern technique that is easy to learn and helps navigate through our complex world - especially if your professional responsibilities include recruitment, interviews, or negotiation management.
Good liars have the ability to read well to others, making them feel good, handling their own emotions and intuitively feeling how others perceive them.
We know from the research that extroverts lie more than introverts, that men say more "false towards themselves", while women say more lies "oriented towards others" -- usually to protect someone's feelings -- that married people lie less often to their mates than those who are not married (but the lies they usually say tend to be "an enormous").
We also know that if you are perceived as a villain, others will feel less guilty when they lie to you.
How do you know if someone's lying?
First, observe the usual behavior of the subject.
This is called "creating a base line".
Helps to provide reference points to measure after the changes.
Observe the position of the subject, smile and vocal characteristic.
It is better to know if someone usually hits his foot all the time to avoid unfair accusations when he sees his feet beating in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for misleading, verbal and non-verbal behavior groups.
Consider these behavioral groups as alarm signals, not as evidence of deception.
People who cheat can freeze the upper part of the body by trying to remember their history, they can point their feet towards the door, turn towards an exit, change their position significantly, or display a "post-interview mood" -- that exaggerated breath of relief and change of posture once all the difficult questions have ended.
Questionnaires often make it false that the interview has ended only to seek that post-interview relief.
Also pay attention to the subject's vocabulary.
Scott Peterson put his foot to the bottom and used the past time while claiming that his murdered wife was alive, throwing a search for her at the national level.
People who cheat can also use a remote language: "I didn't have sexual relations with that woman... Miss Lewinsky" or repeat a difficult question completely.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "restrictive language" when answering a difficult question: "Well... to tell the truth... until I... to understand."
This makes the response a perception rather than a fact and is often a warning signal.
There is no magic formula to detect lies, but developing skills to discover deception is possible.
These skills will improve the possibilities of anyone to avoid being sacrificed by the artists of the falcon in their professional and personal lives.
The controversial plan of the pipeline derogated from the US delay threat at its approval
Days after Obama's administration threatened to delay the approval of a planned pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- angering the unions, while calming the environmentalists -- the company seeking to build the pipeline says it is ready to redirect the project to take it back.
TransCanada said Monday night that it will move the planned pipeline outside the environmentally sensitive area of Sandhills in Nebraska, and trusts that the project will win approval.
The company announced the decision at the press conference in the Nebraska Capitol.
TransCanada Director Alex Purbax says the company maintains its confidence that in time the pipeline will be approved, although it is true that with a different route.
This came after the announcement last week by the Department of State that they would delay the decision by a federal permit for the project until new potential routes were studied to avoid the Sandhills areas of Nebraska and the Ogallala aquifer, a vast supply of groundwater.
"This is a real path of progress," said the representative Lee Terry, a Republican of Nebraska, to Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the Department of State is possible to separate any decision by 2013, after the elections next year, although officials denied that policy was involved in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the request of the Department of State, and expressed full support for them.
The oil pipeline, from 1,700 kilometers, would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would take 700,000 barrels a day from the province of Alberta to the refineries in Texas.
For that, it would be necessary to cross six states.
It is hated by the environmentalists, but loved by the working groups, who have voted for the estimate of 20,000 jobs linked to the oil pipeline.
But Nebraska legislators opposed to the plan are suspending legislation to force the removal of the Sandhills region and the Ogallala aquifer, the largest source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current environmental impact study of the Department of State found that the project only produced limited adverse environmental impacts, but the source of the energy industry said that the department ' s general inspector had ordered an independent test of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is whether the member of the lobby hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliot, who was campaign advisor to Hillary Clinton in 2008, represents a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is whether a signature that was hired to conduct the original study was an inappropriate choice because it was linked to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle accused of allegedly causing a child to vomit out of fear
A New York family claims that the diva of disc music, Patti LaBelle, behaved like a lunatic in the lobby of her building in Manhattan, landing her little daughter to the point that she was afraid.
The song "Lady Marmalade" frightened Genevieve Monk, 18 months old, so much he suffered "personal changes, sleep disorders" and "increased his fear of strangers", says his family in the Supreme Court of Manhattan.
It was 10 November last year when tram driver Kevin Monk, his wife, Rosana, teacher in the kindergarten, and Genevieve were preparing to go on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk took the car, Rosana Monk went down to the lobby of the Riverside Boulevard building, with his luggage, taking him to Genevieve.
Rosana Monk said she stopped by the door and put her daughter on the ground for a moment.
"Someone came up behind and said to me, 'Do you know what your daughter is doing?' I said to her, 'Yes' and I went to pick her up,' she said.
LaBelle was angry at the pregnant woman.
"He said in an aggressive tone, "He shouldn't have left his daughter near the door," said Rosanna Monk.
"I said, "I have no interest in what you say or think."
He became angry and began to use bad words - the word C and the word J aloud...
He had a bottle of water and he started to throw the water from the bottle over me."
He said Genevieve was hysterical.
"I told this woman, "Look what you've done to my daughter," said the girl's mother.
LaBelle was balanced about the mother -- who was still subject to Genevieve -- and had to be held by her environment and removed to a car that was waiting for her, said Rosanam Monk.
The little one was crying so hard that he vomited, he added.
Later, the family sent a note apologizing to LaBelle, but he did not get an answer.
LaBelle's lawyer and representatives did not return their calls to comment on what had happened.
The claim seeks unspecified damages, but the family lawyer Sam Davis said he took the case free of charge and that the family plans to give all the money that a child cancer support association can get.
"The purpose is to make Patti LaBelle responsible for his conduct," said Davis.
"This kind of behavior is completely unacceptable, especially when it comes to a teacher of childhood garden who carries in her arms an 18-month-old child."
Climate adversity slowed the economy
During the first year of management of Mario López Valdez, unemployment and informality have increased in Sinaloa, foreign investment has declined and the economy has been contracted.
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdez, self-denominated change, which has generated great expectations regarding the economic progress, but given the climate change of the beginning of the year, there is no growth, but a deterioration in the main indicators of economic development is recorded.
The low temperatures in February, in addition to causing millions of losses for the agricultural sector, limited the potential of the state economy to grow, caused a contraction of overall economic activity of 3.6 per cent in the first half of the year, mainly due to the 31.16 per cent fall in agriculture, which affected the dynamics of the other economic sectors.
According to the report of ice impacts issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, there were damage to 582 000 835 hectares cultivated, 78.03 per cent of which suffered total damage and 21.07 per cent had partial damage, the main sinew crops were vegetables, corn and barley.
The fall in economic activity has generated, until November, a steady increase in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, the rate of state unemployment during the first three quarters of the year was seen as an accelerated growth, since while between January and March 55 000 053 signacles were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 per cent of the economically active population, for the second quarter the rate rose to 5.28 per cent, and between July and September the average continued to increase to 6.19 per cent, a rate that in the number of people with over 74 thousand signacles, an increase compared to the first half of 18 000 969 individuals.
Less Liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, for economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the growth of unemployment can be explained indirectly, depending on the actions taken by public policy.
"What is being seen is an increase in unemployment that has to do with several factors, including the loss of liquidity on the market due to a restriction on resources by the legislation adopted at the congress to combat money laundering, as for people who illegally seize dollars it is not easy for them to work, invest and use them in something," he said.
Organisation
López Cervantes noted that there is also a demographic factor in the increase in unemployment.
"The number of people going from the state looking for work abroad in the United States has been restricted, firstly because of the difficulties of entering, and secondly because entering already have many difficulties of finding work, these people are staying and are demanding work sources here in the state, which makes unemployment rising," he said.
Informality
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloan increased by considering the high level of informality that prevails among working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 per cent of the state-occupied working population without being contributing as a worker to any social security institution.
In addition to unemployment and informality, another of the state's labour surpluses is low wages, the entity has the lowest salaries in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Labour Secretariat and Social Welfare.
The average monthly income of the workers in Sinaloa was, until September, 5 000 352 pesos, much below the national average, located at 7 000 375 pesos.
IED contraction
As a result of the fall in economic activity and the increase in unemployment, the largest decrease in direct foreign investment over the past 10 years was recorded in 2011 according to the State IED Economic Secretariat from January to June, which amounted to $630,697, representing a decrease of 87.74 per cent over the $5 million,143,312 recorded during the same period of the previous year.
For its part, the State Government's Secretariat for Economic Development accounts for a total investment of 17 billion 280 million pounds per year, mainly of enterprises in the third sector.
The debt
In view of the economic contraction scenario, the Government of the State requested the approval of a loan of 3 billion pounds in July, which would be intended to invest in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, in order to reactivate the economy, the approval of the local congress was at an amount of 2 billion 600 million pounds, and until November they had not observed the benefits of debt in any sector of the state economy.
Reactions
For business sector representatives, the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdés shows a lack of government management capacity.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chamber of the Transformation Industry, said that during 2011 there was a lack of harmonization of the wills of the different sectors, including the government itself.
"The performance of the economy in Sinaloa during this year has been very poor, we have to work hard to recover the land that we lost this year, in 2012 we have to redouble our efforts, we have to align the effort of all and above all the well-synchronized progress of this new government team, we hope that next year will be much better," he said.
Economic slowness
Loredo López said that events such as early-year ice creams stopped the state economy and restricted its performance and growth.
"The low economic flow is the product of several events, including ice creams, one of the main effects has been a slow economic turn that does not return fast enough to generate an economic dynamism that allows an acceptable level of flow in processes, products and services, and therefore, at the end of the year we are closing very much below the expectations we had," he said.
Redefine job
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Mexican Master's Confederation in Sinaloa, stated that the state is required to engage in productive activities of greater dynamism.
"In general, we have observed that we have been working, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term programme that redefines the vocation and economic direction of the state, because it is important that all the potential of the material and human resource that Sinaloa has is detonated," he said.
Work to do
The President of Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision for the future that better matches the Government's efforts.
"In general, I would say that the Government has been working hard to deliver good results in various areas, but there are some progress in economic development but it is important that a long-term programme is developed," he said.
He noted that the current administration had made progress in its way of leading public policy.
"There are elements that allow us to say that the Government is becoming more inclusive, I can say that there is work done and I think the Government is aware that there is work to be done," he said.
Condemned by 8 kg of marijuana
At five years of imprisonment and 100 days of imprisonment, a neighbor of Navolato was sentenced to eight kilos of marijuana.
The Attorney General of the Republic reported that the convicted drug addict was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for the crime against health, in his version of possession of marijuana for commercial purposes.
According to the AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I file, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by elements of the Mexican Army on 7 June 2010 in a surveillance operation on Cipriano Valdez Street, opposite 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The Narcomendist was in a pick-up truck, white, where he carried a black bag in the vehicle box and in the copilot seat a small backpack, where the soldiers found eight kilograms 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the insured remained at the disposal of the District Judge and the sentence continued internally at the Centre for the Enforcement of the Legal Consequences of the Crime.
Should Contributions for Works
Social work on programs such as Habitat, Public Space Rescue and 3x1 for migrants is at risk of not being completed or of having serious delays due to lack of economic resources, Miguel Ángel López Miranda said.
The municipal Social Development Director indicated that, although the work programmes have so far progressed, they are at risk of failing to comply with the Government of the State with the contributions corresponding to it, which amount to more than 11 million weights in the three programmes.
He noted that the total investment in these three programmes was nearly 50 million weights, of which the State accounted for 25 per cent, and that so far only the Federation and the municipality have contributed resources to the work, so the possible delay in the conclusion of these programmes is now in force.
"It's almost 12 million that they've got to bring, and even though the year is about to end, they haven't given us a fifth, when since July they've had to give us a share," he said, "we've started the works and they're going to be very advanced, but we need the money."
He mentioned that last year, in the administration of Jesus Aguilar Padilla, the State did not comply with their respective contributions, so at the beginning of the administration the municipality had to apply for a credit to cover the more than 7 million that the state administration did not provide on that occasion.
"It's already happened to us in the previous sixties because the State had no economic capacity to participate and the programmes continued to walk, and this year we were able to access these programmes we had to get the resources to cover what the State had left pending," she said.
Despite the State authorities ' commitment to meeting the delivery of these resources, he noted that the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villareal, had been requested to accelerate efforts to ensure that their respective percentages were reached as soon as possible.
"It's almost 12 million that touches them to bring, and even though the year is about to end, they haven't given us a fifth."
Valid "analogic apagon" cut in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of analog signals by digital is one of the most important changes the world has ever experienced in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) dismissed the constitutional disputes raised by the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies against the presidential decree that precedes the so-called "analogue apagon" from 2021 to 2015, when the eight votes necessary to invalidate it were not met.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed in his duties by issuing the decree detailing the actions to follow to concrete the transition to digital terrestrial television.
As a result, the constitutional dispute promoted by the Senate of the Republic was dismissed for not reaching the qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to decide on the constitutionality or inconsistency of the decree, and this remains in force.
The draft judgment, drawn up by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed to declare the decree unconstitutional, because the regulation of radio and television materials is a power reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in contravention of the principles of hierarchical subordination and of reservations.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sanchez Cordero voted in favour of the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies have promoted two constitutional disputes to challenge the decree, and in accepting the demands, Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions in it that are prepared for the digital transition.
The whole of the ministers also decided to reject the request made by the Chamber of Deputies, without entering into the discussion of the project, also under Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister said that he did not agree with the project's arguments, in that the Federal Executive could not, through general rules, structure the measures for the preparation of the public administration.
"I also do not think that if I did, the autonomy of the regulatory body would be affected," and recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector would correspond to the Federal Executive, who has a constitutional mandate, the State Directorate.
The replacement of analog signals by digital is one of the most important changes the world has ever experienced in recent years, and it translates into a better use of the radio spectrum, a better quality of the signal and more channels.
To postpone the change, it was to delay the benefits of digitisation, which involves a decision of public interest, which does not only have a technical dimension, "may cover economic, social, political and national security issues".
These issues, he pointed out, "requires the operation of the entire system established, in accordance with the principle of economic direction of the State, to include a group of attributes that the Constitution leads to the power of the State Executive."
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world have already completed the digital transition, and has done so through the Executive, despite having highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, when issuing the contested decree, which in some way invades the area of competence of Congress, as it is providing in the administrative sphere for compliance with the laws issued by the Legislative Act, has ensured.
Analyse the possibility of a "vote by vote" count in Michoacán
According to the data provided by the PREP, the difference between the first and second seats of the governor's election is only 27 per cent, even without counting the votes for 879 of the 6 billion 74 total records.
The possibility of counting "vote by vote" is a reality with regard to this year's electoral process in Michoacán, where according to the data released by the Preliminary Electoral Results Programme (PREP) the difference between the first and second seats of the governor's election is only 27 per cent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6 billion 74 total records.
In this regard, the President of the General Council of the Michoacán Electoral Institute (IEM), Mary of the Llandal Angels Zaragoza, recalled that only a few days ago, last November, the electoral body adopted a series of guidelines to harmonise local norms with federal electoral reform.
As you will recall, Michoacán did not approve its Constitution or its Electoral Code of the State or its Electoral Justice Act, while the Congress of the State approved the reforms shortly before the end of the legal period so that they could enter into force in this electoral process and Governor Leonel Godoy Range omitted its publication within the time limits provided for in the Law of the Official Journal of the State, arguing that it had some objections.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional dispute promoted by the local Legislative Power and described as "invaluable and illegal" the vote of the State Representative for Constitutional Reforms, although he does not have the right to "sanction them or vete them".
Interviewed about the possibility of "voting by vote", Maria de l'Angeles explained that the adoption of the relevant guidelines by the General Council of the EMI will allow for partial and total accounts of the vote by the local electoral body.
In this way, the partial counting of votes, of one or more electoral packages, may be provided in the assumption that: the results of the records do not match; there is no record of vote and record in the file of the case or does not open in the power of the President thereof; or, where there are manifest errors or alterations of the records.
In addition, the total number of votes received in all the electoral boxes may be obtained when there is evidence that the difference between the candidate alleged to be the winner of the election concerned and who has obtained the second place in the vote is equal to or less than one percentage point; where the request is made by the party representative and/or coalition which applied for the second of the candidates indicated at the beginning of the session.
The total count of the vote may also be made if, at the end of the ordinary course, it is established that the difference between the allegedly winning candidate and the second-place candidate is equal to or less than a percentage point, provided that there is an express request from the political party's representative, whose candidate remained in the second place, in which case the electoral packages which have been partially counted will be excluded.
It should be noted that in this situation is the choice of Morelia, where according to the PREP the difference between the first and the second place is only 0.16 per cent, although without counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total records.
His Last Will
Its ashes will be scattered in the Serra of Zapalinamé, as confirmed by the family.

Located three abandoned corpses near Cadereyta NL
Hours before the discovery, the military authority presented to the media eleven persons who were detained in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found killed at bullets in different parts of the body and with the shot of grace, in an abandoned fence in the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez, New Leon.
The find took place in the 1.5 km from Cadereyta road to Santiago, at the height of the community known as El Castillo.

The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has placed that country on the brink of economic disaster
The appointed Italian Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy on Wednesday to present the new government that will face a crisis that has placed Italy on the edge of the economic disaster and has put the whole euro area at risk.
A communiqué from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, will meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he can form a government.
It is expected that he will present an office consisting of most technocrats, although it is not clear when the new executive will take office.
Monti said he will present to the president the result of his talks with political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," the former European Commissioner told journalists.
Monti did not explicitly say that he could form a government but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles had been overcome.
The "mark is now well-designed", he added.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, much less than usual, while Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that has driven its debt costs to unsustainable levels.
The new administration led by the former European Commissioner Monti must approve a tough austerity package required by European leaders to regain the strong confidence in Italy.
Stressing the pressure on Monti to accelerate, market instability placed the performance of the Italian BTP bonds 10 years above 7 per cent, the level at which Greece and Ireland were forced to be rescued.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the Italian patronage confindustria, told the press after meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government a lot."
We believe that this Government is the last opportunity for Italy to get out of this emergency situation.
Monti's success prospects were driven considerably by the support of Silvio Berlusconi's PDL party, which the crisis forced to resign on Saturday.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are intended to have a good result," Angelino Alfano, secretary of the Central Right Party, told the press.
The support of the PDL, the largest party in Italy, is significant because so far many of its members have opposed the Government of the technocrat majority that is forming Monti.
Parliamentary support
The new Monti Government must have strong parliamentary support to implement what is likely to be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blocking or delay in their efforts could lead to a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks was put under pressure by warning that Monti's failure would be a disaster.
Monti started consultations on Monday with political parties, trade unions and business groups, as well as with youth and women's organizations.
He'll finish his round of meetings on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed Sunday by Naples, which has enabled an extremely fast transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief breath at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would resign, the costs of the Italian debt have now returned to critical levels between uncertainty about whether the new prime minister will succeed.
Saving Italy, with a public debt of EUR 1.8 billion, would be too much for the current financial defences of the euro area.
Monti has said that his government should last until the next elections, scheduled for 2013, despite the widespread predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms before the elections proceed.
Monti has said he would like to include politicians in his office, but the major parties insist that he should be trained only by technicians, an indication of his repairs to a process forced by financial pressure.
Political sources noted that mutual mistrust and disagreements between the parties were complicated in the attempt to include political figures.
The Spanish rock is higher than the ticks
Of the 22 footballers called from Spain, ten cross the 50 international games.
On the side of Costa Rica, only one of the 22 assembled arrived at the 50 meetings.
A major contrast to Costa Rica, if the 22 called by both countries are compared to the friendly today at 3:05 p.m. at the San José National Stadium.
While World Champions and Europe, number one of FIFA's monthly rankings, account for a wide record of Class A interselective games, the Tricolor only owns the defender Michael Humana as the only one with the 50 international parties.
That figure reached her last Friday in the match against Panama (0-2) in Rommel Fernández.
Spanish footballers who play in the League of Stars and in powerful clubs of the League of the Premier of England maintain an intense year-long activity in league and domestic Cup championships, and high-level shocks in European Cups such as Champions League.
The above is the experience with the Spanish Fury in complicated Eurocopa and the World of Football eliminations.
On the contrary, typical footballers have a limited international rock in an area, such as Concacaf, which is considered the lowest level within FIFA.
We see that the highest record of the Spanish Selection is from the Archer Iker Casillas, who on the previous Saturday before England (fall 0-1 in London) equaled the record of the exporter Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international meetings.
Casillas will play in front of the Tricolor today and will impose a new record for Spain of 127 internationalities.
Xavi Hernández, Barcelona's brain steering wheel, has 106 properties.
Casillas and Xavi, even, were recognized by UEFA last week along with the other hundreds of Iberian teams, the mentioned Zubizarreta with 126 and the Arieete del Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
Nearly the centenary number is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
Following him is Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Inista, with 62; Cesc Fabregas, with 61; and David Silva, with 53.
On the tip side, and close to Michael Umuna, are the left side of Junior Díaz, with 48 presences and the Bryan Ruiz artillery, with 45.
After that, only five won the 30 matches: Keilor Ships with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
At least.
With more than 30 presentations in Spain, Gerard Pique (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 presences, Roy Miller appears with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest is not close to 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar owns only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson do not yet begin.
The historical cyclist of Spain is David Villa, with 50 days, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
By Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one who registers more with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto included the country in its two-departure celebration tour
"Go to Costa Rica is a dream made real"
In an exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament from Pearl Jam said the band is ready to offer one of their best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
They have been waiting for more than 20 years, but the band assures them that they will also actually convert the dream of playing in the country.
That was how the basilica and founding member, Jeff Ament, who spoke exclusively to Viva from Brazil last week.
The grouping is located in the South American wing of its two-decade celebration tour and Sunday 20 will make its only scale in Central America.
That day will be presented at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 p.m., along with the Angelina The X band and the Las Robertas nationals.
This is an extract of the conversation, whose full transcription is on The Nation on the Internet.
For their Costa Rican followers, is it a dream made reality that Pearl Jam is going to play in Costa Rica, are they aware of what their fans are living?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream made real to us too.
This is only our second time in South and Central America and so far it has been great.
I've only been to Costa Rica once and for vacations; it's such a beautiful country and I think we'll be able to stay there for a few days.
So we're excited to take our music there.
I wonder why there is a kind of devotion to the band, fans live intensively the previous days.
What do they say to their most fierce followers?
Thank you for staying on our side all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica; thanks for waiting so long and we regret that it took us so long to get there.
Some people even refer to their concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does that add some pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we've played over the last 21 years have happened over the last couple of weeks.
We play a couple of giant shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that has put us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
Actually, we're really looking forward to playing there.
We love that country, we love surfing and jungle; for both things, Costa Rica is among the best in the world.
How did they find Costa Rica and its waves to surf?
We have many friends who are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves there are incredible.
My friends always went surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, along with Mexico, are great places to surf; that's how we learned, through people who love surfing.
On seeing the tour, they have come to deliver huge shows with many songs.
What have you planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
As we've never touched there before, then we have no restriction on what we can do.
We will try to give the best possible show with a good variety of songs; we will try to play a couple of songs from each album and give our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
What's this all about?
I think it's partly because we have nine discs and we can play over 120 songs and each one likes different songs, so it's hard to choose which songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we take time not to play, it keeps us focused and it also keeps us surprised because it reminds us of the reasons why we liked those songs and that we could have forgotten.
That makes the show more interesting for us and, therefore, I think it also becomes more interesting for people.
With this turn, they're celebrating 20 years of trajectory.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything they've achieved?
Yes, absolutely.
First of all, I think none of us imagine that we would be on a big rock band and have done it for more than 20 years now that it looks like a dream.
We continue to count our blessings and are very excited that we can continue to make music together.
We all love and love to create music.
We're lucky to go to places in the world that we always wanted to go to.
Things couldn't be better for us.
What did it mean for you to have been a fundamental part of the emergence of the grunge?
It has always been an honor to be part of that group of big bands.
We are very friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It's amazing when a movement comes from a group of friends and it's something unusual.
From time to time, a band of a city arises, but it is much more strange when five or ten bands come out of the same city at the same time.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle Group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year, we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on his tour, so we are lucky to be friends of all of them still and honor us to be part of that Seattle sound that came up.
It is also very strange that a band like you are kept together and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which is, by itself, much more time than many bands last.
First of all, I think that we are all happy to be still alive and, secondly, we are all concerned about others.
We are all very close friends and, thanks to that, musical avenues have also been opened that give everyone the freedom to experience.
We trust each other with each other's music and it couldn't be better.
Your relationship with the famous word has not been simple; however, thanks to their success, they have been able to do what they want.
How do you find a balance?
As we have grown, it has been easier to find a balance.
We make sure you're not too busy because it's easy to fall into that game of the great crowds and people who love your music.
While one remembers that people are there for music, that reminds you that you must respect the music and what it brought, without getting caught up in being famous and being a rock star, something that none of us really care about.
How do you remember your other Mother Love Bone project?
I think we wrote very good songs and at first it was something great.
We were a band for almost three years and never published a record until after Andrew Woods died.
There were many frustrations because it lasted so long and most importantly, we are still very friends of Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who started in the band with us and when I hear a song or see a picture think about the incredible person Andy was and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh, talk about music and football and much more.
He was a surprising human being and we surprised him.
The national band Las Robertas will be responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know your work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that that's why you chose her for the opening?
Yes, production sent us videos with several proposals and that was the band that we liked most, so we are eager to see what Las Robertas can offer live and should be very entertaining.
Why do they always change Yellow Ledbetter's letter alive?
That's a question for Eddie Vedder, so I don't know.
He sings it and I think he does it with the first thing that happens to him.
As a bassist, what are your influences?
That's it.
Among the first to happen to me are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
They're so many that I could talk all afternoon about the bassists that I love.
How has Pearl Jam managed to keep the grunge relevant despite being no longer fashionable?
I think we all always feel a little disconnected from the grunge word.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the bands I mentioned earlier, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all those who came up at the same time, and, if there's relevance now, I think it's something wonderful because it's music that's worth listening to and bands like Mudhoney are now making better music than ever.
At first, his music had a darker content and now has become more positive.
What does this change owe?
It's interesting because I think there's a couple of songs in the new album that may seem more light, but there are also songs, such as The End or Just Breathe that qualify as very dark songs although they may sound a little positive.
With both, when Ed touched them, I would cry when I heard them and they are deeply dark songs.
I think that when you grow up and there's some trauma in your life and you lose a family or a friend, these things start to influence your art and your music and those two songs, no doubt, represent that for me.
Also, I think you can be a happy person and still be able to make music that is dark.
Peru:
Fujimori is hospitalized again for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized on Tuesday in a public hospital to be evaluated for the loss of muscle strength that he has in his legs, he informed his head doctor.
Fujimori, 72 years old, who is sentenced to 25 years in prison for violations of human rights committed during his government (1990-2000), suffers several maladies, including cancer in the language by which he has been operated four times and is kept under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal physician, told Canal N of television that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the reason for the pain and loss of strength of its lower members.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate for the benefit of pardon for humanitarian reasons, however, he said that he did not want it because he knew himself to be innocent.
It was operated four times to the tongue, it has a weight loss of 18 kg to which other pathologies such as severe erosive gastritis have been added, pancreas cyst, kidney calculations, arterial hypertension and circular problems in the legs, the doctor listed them.
Fujimori has been in prison since September 2007 in the National Police Special Operations Directorate.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 persons by a squad of soldiers who secretly operated in the first years of his government.
Music travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official committee, headed by the Uruguayan President José Mujica, and composed of several ministers and entrepreneurs, will launch a visit to Mexico this Tuesday to expand trade between the two nations and address political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet on Wednesday with her Mexican couple, Felipe Calderón, the highest point of an extensive agenda of meetings with political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the community of Uruguayan residents in Mexico, according to the agenda disseminated by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between both presidents in the city of Guadalajara will be "favourable for the exchange of information in all political matters between the two nations", according to the South American Presidency on its website.
According to local media, Mujica would seek to get Calderon to support Uruguay in the incident with France when French envoy Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country in a list of tax havens at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that remain tax havens, a statement that provoked the rejection of Uruguay and the call for consultation with its ambassador in the European country.
Since November, Mexico has presided over the G20, a group composed of the world's most powerful emerging and developed countries, and has been in force with the South American country since January of this year an agreement to exchange tax information in order to avoid double taxation.
In recent years, the Government of Uruguay has tried to speed up the implementation of tax exchange agreements in order to get out of the "grey list" of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), composed of countries that have not implemented all international tax cooperation standards.
At the commercial level, Mexico and Uruguay have been in force since 2004 a Free Trade Treaty (TLC), which has increased the exchange of goods between both nations.
The bigotud fountain passes the three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has fought, tireless, for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the snares of the evil Bowser, but never so far had he done it in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the girl's love in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which comes this month to shops around the world, has been designed from a beginning to take advantage of the features of the Nintendo 3DS portable console, which allows to play in three dimensions without needing to use glasses.
"Mario is the character that has to say how stereoscopy should work without glasses," said Nintendo's press officer in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Alvarez indicated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first video game of Nintendo originally thought for that support", as so far success such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
Nintendo's spokesman has argued that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "accessible" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and fluid game.
Alvarez has said that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "single" to trap the least skilled users.
Once it is over, the most experts will be able to give a "second back" to the levels of the game, which this time present a greater difficulty.
In addition, users will be able to choose in real time between an "aggressive" D or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it will be necessary to play in three dimensions in order to overcome the different challenges and "do not succumb to optical illusions".
This Super Mario incursion into the three dimensions also involves the return of the character to a portable console, which has not occurred since 2005.
In this video game Nintendo gives guides to the saga followers and repeats the formula of the success of previous deliveries, which consists that the fountain of the bigote will have to use mined platforms of danger in order to free Princess Peach.
Although the player will find news in the movements, environments, costumes and enemies as well as a Luigi "playable".
Colom down the extradition of Portillo to the United States
President Alvaro Colom announced this Tuesday that he has processed the extradition of ex-Governor Alfonso Portillo to respond in the United States to the conspiracy for the US$70 million wash.
Thus ends the process for Guatemala to respond to the request of the northern country that claimed Portillo to judge him there.
At a press conference, Colom stated that his decision was due to the independence of judicial and executive powers, taking into account that a court of law had already ordered extradition.
He stated that during his term of office he "did not put his hands" in judicial resolutions and treated all extraditions he had known.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will be extradited, for murder and serious injuries, and Edgar Strada Morales and Victor Strada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Colom's doing so entails an executive procedure after all judicial and constitutional bodies have been exhausted in order to prosecute the respondent from 2000 to 2004.
According to resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo must be extradited once his legal situation has been resolved in Guatemala and his human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was absorbed by the Q120 million defalation in the Ministry of Defence when he was president, which was the process that preceded extradition, but the Ministry of Public Appeal appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people at risk
The entity was born to avoid the fall in the marginality of boys without training
The balance of the first 25 years of life of the social support entity Trinijove is important: 6,000 youth at risk of exclusion have been helped to overcome a difficult situation over this quarter of the century.
This is added to the hundreds of jobs currently achieved for this social group.
The anniversary was served yesterday to balance in an act celebrated in the former Fabra and Coats factory, attended by more than 300 people.
Trinijove was born in the district of Trinidad Vella in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with little training, unemployment, problems of undergrading or marginalization.
Yesterday's celebration in Sant Andreu focused on a large number of managers of entities and institutions who have worked with the association over the past 25 years.
The various political representation, in full-time elections, showed the unitary nature of the work done by Trinijove.
Together with the President of the Generality, Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, former socialist education councillor Ernest Maragall, and current mayor and environmentalist councillor Richard Gomà attended the event.
They also visited the big hall of the Fabra and Coats the current councillor of Social Welfare and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the director general of the social work of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
But he said that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and that the present is also true, but he added that the work done so far "is a good basis".
The President gave Trinijove an example of how to fight bad circumstances and how to give hope to people with difficulties.
"The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work it does," he said.
Dissolved an occupied farm where macrofiests were made
The invaders had fled 11 out of the 13 floors of the building, in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants left the fence yesterday afternoon without offering resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare that lived in the neighbors of the 51st Street of Balmes has come to an end.
Twelve people left yesterday's afternoon voluntarily the property that they illegally occupied, and where they organized macrofiests who were desperate for the neighborhood, by court order and without the need for police intervention.
When the operation was completed, the door lock was changed to prevent the situation from being repeated.
"From now on there will be an access control," said the administrator.
The occupations, which had invaded 11 of the 13 floors of the building - the rest are inhabited - took away the entire electrical installation and part of the water, besides painting the walls and leaving waste of all kinds, especially bottles of alcoholic beverages.
The first three floors were the scene of the crowds, which lasted up to two days and were desperate for the tenants.
Alongside the building there is a disco, Balmes 51, which has also been damaged.
His owner, Maria Pantinat explained to Europe Press that since the building was occupied the business has dropped by 80%.
The disco owner points out that the bank's invaders had unfair competition, as they sold the cups to three euros, while the disco worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the place of leisure had to respond to neighboring complaints by noise, while, as he pointed out, they were not caused by the discotheque customers, but by the residents of the occupied house and, above all, by the partyers that were organized there, who had increased their frequency and intensity in the last weeks, according to the angry neighbors of the area.
The director of the discotheque explained that the trouble was so great that he even reached an agreement with the owner of the property and nine months ago that he "forgive" the rent.
The Urban Guard also confirmed that over the past few weeks, it had received more complaints from its neighbours about the situation.
The president of the municipal group of the PP in the municipality, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had claimed last week "to immediately evict the property to end the problems of coexistence and civilism that produce to the neighbors, as well as the degradation of the area".
The popular leader explained that before the summer there was only one plant in the occupied building, but during the last months the occupations had been entering all the plants of the building and almost all the floors, and that in some cases even thefts had occurred.
In this sense he added that, "it is necessary to end impunity and to be determined against the incisiveness that has been generated in the land".
Also yesterday, the Mossus evicted a building in Nou Barris.
At 3.30 p.m., the police headed up to 35 from Mont-ral Street, after receiving the call from a neighbor who had noticed that four people had access to the building.
The four were arrested at the moment.
Park the mountain?
Architects agree on the occasion of the summons beyond debate on fees
The municipal competition on the 16 doors opens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In the early 1980s, in the midst of the already extensive Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this Administration printed a number of Collserola promotion passports.
The brochure defined the mountain as the great park of the metropolitan Barcelona.
Moreover, it was accompanied by a comparison, in figures, with the New York Central Park.
With the death of the CMB in 1987, the park again settled in the imagination of many, such as the upper limit of Barcelona, being the Catalan capital of the few that are not oriented in the north-south axis but above (mountain) -low (mar).
The qualification of Collserola as a natural park is based on this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with the jabalis on the role of the Yogi bear.
In these were until September, the municipality convened a megacompetence consisting of 16 competitions for so many other doors of access to Collserola.
A door leads to the idea of park, no doubt.
Either that or someone's going to put doors in the field.
The question goes out alone: Collserola, park or mountain?
The competition, both for its purely organizational aspect and for what it means to reflect on the city, is the topic of conversation among all Barcelona architects.
It is almost already a recurring topic to hand out when two members of this old caste of elects are recognized in an elevator.
And this fact gives just one of the few coincidences between what three Barcelonian architects and university professors have presented.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the contest is timely.
For Roldán, after approaching the coastal front "if necessary" debate on "the front of the mountain", while the speech of Ildefons Cerdà, the one of the green apples, has not been held.
"Beginning from the base that Barcelona's most extensive park is the beach.
Among other things, because of its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex," says the architect for whom the title of "Callserola doors" includes a "legislative trap": it should not be thought of "as access to a park, but the delimitation of areas where action must be taken".
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urban world, describes the proposal of "intellectual challenge" with "some dangers".
Dangers derived from the "uncertain that it is today to project public space" after the experience in the 80s and that it had in the Forum area "song of the cisne".
The first fear is the very delimitation of borders on where one can build.
"Limiting something is fixing the next step," that is, its overstep.
"We need to think about new urban planning instruments, because the current [referring to the Metropolitan General Plan (GMP)] can lead to real disasters."
More curious about the question, Modol believes that by simplifying the Valesan view of Collserola "it can be understood as a park, Barcelona's one, no," for a purely topographic question.
Modol remembers that there is already a work done by the Collserola patronate that "should not fall into broken bags", although he appreciates the opportunity that the town offers its crowd to intervene in this project "from the first moment".
And even more, he understands that the proximity of the mountain with the city is the safe conduit that allows architects to enter into the debate, but "question" about whether this technical profile is the one that should lead the multidisciplinary teams ("all right", he points out) that they had to create: "The architects should be just a tool."
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that gives title to this piece is complex, because on the basis of the contest there is no global view of Collserola: "16 cross-border competitions -dice - have been convened in the mountain-sea sense, but there is no longitudinal reading, which sees and understands the area as a whole."
This results, at least in their case, that they have chosen to participate in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, a project for one of the doors can shock in program and definition with that of the architect of the side door.
In his view, that is to say, the town should ensure that the dam is immediately higher than the Dalt Round should provide for an area of equipment that would carry out a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonas Larrazábal and exits free
After 72 days of rooting, the legal seizer of the Red Casino granted forgiveness to the mayor of Monterrey from the process that was followed by alleged blackmails
After 72 days in prison, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the legal arrester of the Red Casino grants him forgiveness before the District Criminal Tribunal, which follows a blackmailing process against the mayor of Monterrey's brother.
After the attack on the Royale Casino, the owner of the Red Casino, Sergio Gil García, made public a series of photos and videos in which Manuel Jonás allegedly demanded payment of an economic contribution so that the regional council would allow the clandestine operation of the betting house.
After the public complaint, the State Prosecutor's Office opened a criminal trial against the Panist mayor's brother and on 2 September he was arrested and kidnapped for 30 days.
After four hours before the Public Ministry Agent 3 in Heritage Crimes, he was transferred to the House of Arraigo 1, located in the Old Town of the capital of the State.
In that place, he remained for 49 days after he was issued a second order of withdrawal after the official of the Ministry of Public Affairs dismissed the crime of organized crime and crime.
On 19 October, he was transferred to Cadereyta's Penal Service for blackmailing with one and a half million pounds to the owners of the Red Casino; however, he remained only a few hours in the middle security prison because there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to follow the trial in the municipal cells of San Nicolas de los Garza.
On 25 October, he was arrested by the Secretary of the Second District Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who said that at almost two months of investigation sufficient evidence had been found to determine Jonah's guilt, such as a charge of 1.5 million pounds to the representatives of the betting house in exchange for allowing the operation of the same.
This Monday, the legal seizer of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, approached Judge José Luis Pecina to ask forgiveness for the brother of the regional mayor; so in the next few hours he could regain his freedom.
During legal diligence, the official of the Ministry of Public Affairs attached to the Judge, Ramiro Arias, questioned Garcia Gomez if the damage had been repaired and who of the members of the betting house was the one who granted the pardon, although the lawyer tried to reserve the name.
On the basis of file 197/2011, the legal pardon is granted to Jonas Larrazábal and no claim may subsequently be made about the process followed; in addition, no damages or punishment shall be required.
After hearing the legal arrest of the house of bets, about 15:50 the immediate freedom of Larzabal Breton was ordered.
The judge's secretary, Jorge Yánez, moved to the prison of the municipality of San Nicolas de los Garza to notify Jonas that he has been legally forgiven and his file will be filed.
It shall also notify it of the immediate release order issued by the judge.
Secretary Dionysio Pérez Jácome gives details of the air accident where the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake, lost his life, and seven more people
The Secretariat for Communications and Transport (SCT) reported that the results of the accident where the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake Mora, lost his life, and seven others, indicated that the helicopter had been directly affected on the ground in full structural integrity, without the pilot being able to attempt a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that before disembarking the aircraft, the pilot found that the weather conditions were suitable for flying.
"The elements that seem to indicate that the unit had several contacts with the ground, the asphalts had contact with trees 25 meters where the unit lost the rocket."
It also reported that the unit was designed for 19 persons, so it had the necessary requirements for the transportation of personnel.
In addition, he said that investigations carried out in the impact area did not report the presence of parts on the ground.
"In a search it is reported that there are no parts or components of the ship elsewhere, the impact was presented structurally.
"The design of the helicopter was for 19 passengers, with adequate requirements for transporting passengers.
The ground has a seven-degree slope of 30 degrees.
At the moment, the secretary ensured that it was a priority to count the results before possible; however, the investigation could take several months, even a year.
For his part, Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Auxiliaries Airports and Services, assured that at the time of the impact, the High Presidential State helicopter was operating at a cruising speed and that this happened in an ascending soft terrain.
"This information strengthens the hypothesis of a normal cruise operation at the time of impact," he said.
At the press conference, the owner of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, listed six relevant elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to aeronautical policy, the flight was carried out under visual flight rules, which implies that the crew must have visibility during flight and field.
Weather conditions:
The reports in the ICM provided adequate conditions for discharge, as the aircraft moves towards the border area between the DF and the State of Mexico presented low-height clouds.
Selected paths:
It is likely that because of the cloudy conditions, the crew has sought a lower elevation and greater visibility for the Cuernavaca Valley.
Impact location.
The impact coordinates and the latest radar aircraft record coincide, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or alteration in the flight path.
Dispersion of aircraft residues in a reduced area:
The information available so far suggests that the impact occurred on a straight and side-by-side route.
The aircraft residue scatter pattern suggests that the helicopter was impacted on the ground under conditions of structural integrity.
No evidence of fire or explosion has been detected:
There is still no evidence on the ship's remains of any kind of explosion or fire on the site of the sinister.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that they could have had multiple contacts with the ground.
During field work, parts of the aircraft have been found at an altitude of 9 billion 200 feet above the average sea level, the ground has a slope ranging from seven to 30 degrees.
The photographs show the sequence in which it was predictedly disarrayed during that journey.
The information provides elements that appear to indicate that the helicopter could have had multiple impacts on the ground.
After the thorough search in a wider area than the agreed site around the accident, no scattered parts of the aircraft have been found, which reinforces the assumption that the impact was presented in terms of structural integrity.
MSS announces protocol to find obesity gene
Directs Social Security an investigation to discover the gender of obesity in children and young people; it is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute for Social Security (IMSS) announced that it is conducting an investigation to discover the gender of obesity in children and young people, called the 'Genetic Protocol on Child and Adolescence Obsessiveness', which will allow you to have markers associated with overweight.
In a communiqué, the head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry of the Hospital of Specialities of the 21st Century National Medical Centre Miguel Cruz López explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers was integrated.
This team is supported by specialists and postgraduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Centre for Advanced Research and Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Political Institute (IPN).
The investigation invites the participation of the population whether or not they are law-abiding, to visit IMSS participating sports units in the Valley of Mexico, where tests are carried out for minors, every Saturday from 8:00 p.m.
He noted that the protocol began in the Cuauhtémoc Sports Unit (Ponente State of Mexico) and that since 8 October, the activity has been carried out in the Nezahualcoyolt Sports Unit (East Mexico State).
Once the goal of meeting 500 or 600 minors is met, the study will continue in the Independent Sports Unit (south of the Federal District) and finally in the Morelos Sports Unit (north of the Federal District).
He explained that the purpose of this research was to know the components and importance of genetics with regard to the development of obesity and to identify risk factors in children and young Mexicans to prevent the emergence of degenerative chronic diseases.
On 14 November, World Diabetes Day, the goal was to gather three thousand children and young people between the ages of six and 14, with the consent and supervision of their parents, for the implementation of specific food questionnaires.
They will also be asked about the physical activity and history of hereditary diseases, in order to avoid risk factors that trigger suffering such as diabetes or renal insufficiency.
It detailed that the Saturdays apply to all participants anthropometric measurements (weight, size, waist circumference), blood pressure taking, determination of glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin and genetics (it is sought to identify genes associated with child obesity).
Cruz López noted that this research is due to the concern of health professionals about the alarming weight gain in minors.
'The 1999 and 2006 health surveys indicated that in just six years there was an increase, in children, of 77 per cent in obesity, and in girls of 47 per cent; in terms of overweight, a dramatic rise was also observed', the IMSS expert pointed out.
He indicated that the justification for the search for markers was that the population of the country differs from others in its genetic history.
He reported that on average, the Mexican has 65 percent of American Indian inheritance, 30 percent European and five percent African, and this condition is reflected in the genes associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity is translated into the inability to burn the excess energy we consume (calorie) and stored as fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for participants is the comprehensive assessment of children, which allows them to detect whether they have any excess weight or obesity.
Even, he said, the presence of dark-coloured folds (acantosis) in the neck and forearm, which indicate the probability of metabolic changes and even prediabetes.
The information is handled in a confidential manner, the doctors hand it over in writing to the parents, who are told each of the measurements and changes in their lifestyle to prevent diseases.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic suffering: sedentaryism, which is the lack of daily physical activity, remain most of the day sitting in front of the TV and use means of transport instead of walking short distances.
It is also due to high calorie intake, i.e. the higher consumption of sugar drinks, carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburger, etc.) with high fat and protein content and the genetics analysed in this protocol.
UNAM Asphalt Avoids Bakes
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the UNAM Chemicals Faculty, develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with better performance, regardless of environmental and temperature conditions
If the signals sent by the floor were attended, it would not be necessary to repair about 200 thousand acres each rainy season in the Metropolitan Zone of the Valley of Mexico, warned Rafael Herrera Nájera, a researcher at the UNAM Chemicals Faculty (FQ), who assured that if the construction and maintenance process of an asphaltic floor is the right one, the bricks could be reduced in quantity or even eliminated completely.
At its conference A technological opinion of the baches, dictated in the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, revealed that the laboratory in charge develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of the asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance, both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera estimated that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, like some cities in the north of the country, to improve its performance and therefore the formation of baches.
He explained that asphalt, the most heavy part of oil, is a set of hydrocarbons molecules, one of high molecular weight, called asphaltenes, and others of low molecular weight, called maltenes, which together give the floor its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behavior of the asphalt is that at high temperatures, about 180 degrees, behaves as a liquid, at 120 degrees centigrades its viscosity is very high and at 50 degrees centigrades presents an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes broken, added.
The above means that in the streets the resistance of the asphalt is not uniform, but that it is being changed during the day according to environmental and temperature conditions, the chemical engineering specialist warned.
The FQ researcher observed that the streets of Mexico City are mostly covered by flexible floors, consisting of six layers of materials, of which the last three involve asphalt.
Among the most superficial layers is the asphalt folder, consisting of small stones bathed in asphalt and then compacted.
Each of the stones that constitutes the folder, pointed out, is bathed with asphalt.
When the vehicles are moved and effort is generated, they allow the forces to spread very well on the floor.
If it were modified asphalt, it would spread even better, the chemical engineer said.
On the asphalt folder, there is a last layer called rounding folder, which is made of fine stone material, i.e. a sand that is also bathed in asphalt.
As it is about the layer that will be in contact with the vehicle’s rims, it must have more mechanical strength than the asphalt folder and provide friction on the road.
As part of the floor that will receive and spread the efforts, the rolling stock also requires adequate thickness and the material it is made must be taken care of.
The climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, is also a very important factor to consider, especially water, because it significantly affects the performance of the asphalt folder.
When the soil is wet, the water spreads inside the folder and it is difficult to get out, this causes a resplendent of all layers of the floor and therefore the formation of bashes.
In the process of forming a batch, he said, the first to wear is the film of rotation and only then affects the asphalt folder, but the damage does not happen instantly, but it is a process that should address the first signals with appropriate maintenance programs.
The member of the National System of Investigators also explained that the vehicle load is another important factor in the formation of bashes and therefore the thickness of each floor layer must always be related to the vehicle load and ensure compliance, in order to avoid frequent bash formation.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still much to investigate and work on asphalt, for example, asphalt emulsions, which in other countries are already even on the market and allow for the repair of the bays with ease and without the need to use high temperatures.
What did the Valle candidate miss to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that led to Melina Ramírez Serna not reaching the crown of Miss Colombia.
The Valle receives its title number 14 of princess.
Once again the Valle del Cauca remains with the wishes of the Crown of Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to conform to being in the winner's podium, light the silver crown and the band that believed her as a new princess of Colombia.
With the result of last night in Cartagena, where the Atlantic Miss raised herself with the crown and the harp, the department has already added 14 titles from Princess and Melina to the legion of Valecaucan women who have been close to the crown but who were princesses among them Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorraine Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blance (1988), Monica Evers (1989), Maria Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
Today's big question that many ask is what's missing?
Because the result represents the defeat of a great favourite who in each presentation showed that she had everything to be the new Miss Columbia, not in vain was elected Queen of the Police and Best Face Jolie of Vogue, titles that obtained kingdoms such as Talia Vargas or Natalia Navarro who took the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor that is considered a key in the decision that the jury made to appoint her First Root Princess in which she did not agree with her answer to the question "What is that book that has marked you for and why? made by Martin Murillo Gomez, of the Literary Carteta Leamos.
To the questioner the Valecaucana replied:
"I read a lot, I think a lot in literature, I think it's a way of culturalizing, I definitely think that the book that marked me as a child is "The principle", it's a pretty deep book.
I am currently reading "crime and punishment", it is a universal literature book that we must all read; and today I am reading Irene Nemirovski's book, a Russian, a very beautiful book called "The Burning of Blood".
An answer that little liked first by the term "culturalize" and second by not explaining in a concrete way how each of the books quoted had marked it.
But at the end of the Melina ceremony it turned out to be quiet and happy with the result "the universe is wise to pass what has to happen.
And for all people, please read a little, "The principle" is a great book"
Among the assumptions launched, it is said that Valle burned her favoriteism.
A Bogotá journalist pointed out that when he was the favorite, the ovation and the candidate who wore all the preliminary awards (Oster gastronomy challenge, public vote for the best craft dress, and Queen Mother), "it aroused the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen and therefore did not shine on the stage".
And that was noted in his first performance in the Hilton Beach bathroom and his two shows in the coronation evening.
Although in both it was clear, it was noted that it lacked the strength and impetus shown by Magdalena and Atlantic representatives.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist of the "As at Home" program of the RCN Canal, said that the fact that Melina was appointed princess "founds that the candidate who won the most prizes during the contest did not remain as queen".
In addition, Valle was shown last very skilfully with the press, and there he was wrong.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury about his interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
For one thing, two days before the election, the international jury Lucy Doughty showed that they were looking for a woman who was committed to their parents' social needs.
"The beauty alone is not enough in a Miss Colombia, you have to look beyond the physical and focus on your social sensitivity, which before entering the Competition you are already involved in projects," he explained.
It is also speculated that Valle sinned because of her defects in the back and fibrosis she was noticed in her abdomen, but it is contradictory because exactly the jury chose her as the candidate 'Natural Beauty' with the healthier body, good food and responsible physical work.
The preparer of Queens Jorge Hernán Orozco recognizes that Melina did not have the best body, which was better, "but her problem of fibrosis in the abdomen, that the truth to me was not very familiar, dropped points in the last day".
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of the Cromos magazine believes that the error of the Valecaucana was the surgical interventions that were practiced.
"The surgery is okay, but Valle is not supposed to be done.
His body was never his strong and here he was charged."
For this prize, which for the first time delivered the National Beauty Competition, after the show in the bathroom, there was a cruel Vatican that was performed last night, because it was said that this was the pleasure that Raymondo gave to Melina not to give him the pleasure of the crown.
Reality or not, it is true that Melina from today begins a year of reign, not as a sovereign, but as a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international contests by appointing the National Competition itself.
However, she will pass on to history as one of the queens who, despite her rolling pass through Cartagena, was blinded by the crown.
So it was the work of the cane that identified Alfonso Cano's corpse
A cali lobbyist passed into history like the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials is key.
Last November 4th, a CTI lobbyist in Cali passed on to history as the man who confirmed the identity of the chief of the Farc: "Alfonso Cano", through the collar of his fingerprints.
Of the seven lobbyists working in the ITC section, this week it was the turn of "availability" to Eliaszar González, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working in the judicial investigation area for 21 years.
At the start of his career, González worked in the municipalities of Chocó, where he often had to stay in the forest for more than five days to get to the place where the corpses were to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to the Valley capital and, after conducting the corresponding courses, specialized in lofoscopy, which is the study of the hair of friction, that is, palm of his hands and feet.
The week of the operation against Alfonso Cano alias to Eleazar warned him to wear minimum clothing for three days.
Something big was waiting for him.
On Friday night he left for the Cauca on a helicopter from Palmira.
He knew that he should identify two corpses and that one of them was suspected of being the man who addressed the oldest guerrilla in the world, so they asked him to carry Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the research team at the site where the corpse was located, he did not recognize it for his physical appearance, since it was very different from what he had seen in the media.
I was without beard, dressed as a peasant in the area, without glasses and much more thin.
But the fingerprints don't lie.
Along with a galtonian lupa, ink, a transplanter and a flashlight, Eliezer compared the fingerprints of the corpse to those of the card.
His eye didn't fail: it was Alfonso Cano.
That very night, the man from Puerto Tejada was responsible for confirming to the Minister of Defence Juan Carlos Pinzón that he was the chief of the Farcs.
Searching for the tag
For a touchtiloscopist from Sijín de Cali, the recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos gave to Eliasar González, in the press wheel by the operation against "Cano", is very significant.
A lot of people don't know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an accurate science, without error, which can become a key in the resolution of crimes.
Apart from the identification of corpses, the Lophoscopists support investigations for crimes such as rape and murder and confirm the identity of the captured persons.
When captured, many criminals present false cards or do not have papers.
We take their fingerprints and search them in the database.
The investigator told him that, in a case of theft, he was touched to remove a piece of wall from a house, because in that place the thief had supported his hand to pull out a strong box full of jewelry and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not suitable surfaces to extract a fingerprint, but in that case we were able to get the fingerprint of the whole hand and identify the offender, who had participated in different storms," he recalled.
The fingerprints can also dismiss or reaffirm suspects in cases of murder.
They recently found a dead man, with bottles of liquor around him.
Through the investigation it was determined that a family could be suspected of the crime and, in fact, a bullet in the bottle coincided.
Although this does not guarantee that he has been the killer, he does place him on the scene of the crime.
A CTI dactyloscope explained that in the objects "the fingerprints are extracted with chemical or physical reactives".
When they appear, a transplantor or tape is used to raise them.
After that, the impressions are sent to the Asif, which is the criminal database, or to the Registry.
"The problem is that there are still many undocumented Colombians," said the ITC expert.
He made it clear that not everything is as shown in the CSI TV program.
Just as not everything that shines is gold, not everything that touches becomes a mark.
However, if it can be used, if the respective quota is made.
The "enraged" challenge authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters flocked to the Zuccotti Square to camp.
A large part took care of the eviction order and moved to a nearby parish.
The members of the Occupa Wall Street movement challenged the authorities in New York this Tuesday to try to enter again, under a court order, at Manhattan Square where they were evicted from the morning and to try to occupy another park of the Grand Manzana.
Hundreds of protesters flocked to Zuccitti Square, where they wanted to access thanks to a judicial order that allowed the "innocent" to camp again in the place, while another part of the movement responded to the eviction by occupying a further park in the north of the city, where there have been new arrests.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp again in the square, we will install ourselves somewhere else and we will continue the legal battle for returning to Zuccitti, as well as through peaceful seats and demonstrations," said one of the spokespersons of the Wall Street movement, Mark Bray.
Bray explained that the response of the "enraged" to the expulsion of his camp, personally dictated by the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, came to the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the forced evacuation of the place and allowed protesters to remain camped.
In addition, the "enraged" took place in the occupation of a new park located in the confluence of the Canal Street and the Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Dutch tunnel, which is a New York and New Jersey, and the property of the Trinity Church parish.
For at least an hour they managed to occupy the place, but then the Police came and went to arrest some of the protesters, although Bray could not confirm the specific figure, while assured Ef that he saw several journalists who were also married.
The organization assures that there are several hundred people who had been installed at that point, where a delegation of religious leaders has already been displaced in support of the members of the movement and who have tried to mediate with the Police.
Meanwhile, the Zuccitti Square - which is a private property complex - remains closed pending a judicial review scheduled for this same Tuesday, in which the legality of the evacuation of this morning must be analysed.
Some of the demonstrators who were displaced there carried and distributed copies of that court order at this time and even handed them over to the officers who were guarding the plaza, which caused "some small clashes", said Bray, who reported that some officers had beaten the demonstrators.
The court order prohibits the authorities from evicting the members of occupied Wall Street or from applying "laws which were published after the beginning of the occupation or from prohibiting demonstrators from re-entry into the park with stores or other properties used previously".
Mayor Bloomberg pointed out to the press that because of this judicial order, the city had suspended the reopening of space to the public and protesters, who warned, however, that local laws did not allow them to re-install with campaigns and sleeping bags.
The director personally defended the eviction carried out in the morning of Zuccotti Square, an operation in which there were about 200 arrests and which was decided because the protesters were "violently violating the law".
Bloomberg explained that he had ordered to evacuate the square because it was becoming "a place where people didn't come to protest, but to violate laws and, in some cases, to harm other people," as "some businesses had received threats" and the neighbors feared "for their quality of life".
"The eviction of this morning was arid and shows that the Bloomberg fund is more interested in preserving the financial interests than those of US workers," added the spokesman of the movement, who accused the mayor of "missing respect for freedom of expression".
The leaders of "Employment Wall Street" also indicated that they were planning to organize "great actions" for Thursday in collaboration with community and trade unions to commemorate the two months during the protests, which began on 17 September.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary on a special TV Christmas
Together with Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, will appear on the television program "It's to Russell Peters Christmas" next December
Canadian Pamela Anderson has been Tim Allen's assistant at Home Improvement, "Baywatch", joined by "Playboy", the wife of Rock musician Tommy Lee and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a special Canadian TV Christmas.
The private TV channel CTV announced today that Anderson, along with the "croner" (baladist) Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, will appear on the television program "It's to Russell Peters Christmas" next December, giving life to a very special Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed images of the television program in which Anderson, also known for the widespread Internet distribution of a porn video home in which he appears together with his husband, the battery of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, appears dressed as the Virgin Mary holding in a face a doll representing Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin who recently acted as a presenter in part of Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" tour, appears as José.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, CTV's special Christmas present the Canadian singer Bublé, who married the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires at the end of March, and is no stranger to the controversy.
Bublé recently called US Kim Kardashian "Zorra" during one of his concerts in New York.
Japan resumes after the earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to household consumption and ends the spiral of falls that began in March
Since last March, Japan's economy has been paralyzed, still convoluting by the devastating earthquake that has occurred in a nuclear crisis, the worst catastrophe that the country has suffered since World War II.
The first estimates by the Government of Tokyo amounted to material losses of $300 billion, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, seemed to have been attenuated.
After three consecutive trimesters of fall, the data of the Gross Domestic Product between July and September served to pass through the page, definitely: GDP increased by 1.5 per cent compared with the previous quarter and 6 per cent at the annual rate.
The registration in the second quarter - for the Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - also represents the highest rate of growth from January to March 2010.
The recovery is partly explained by the repertoire of the purchase of machinery to restore areas isolated by the seismic and subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1 per cent, compared with the fall of 0.9 per cent in capital expenditure from January to March, the first return after six months of uninterrupted increases.
However, the real revolution of the Japanese economy is not based solely on the Keynesian drive to exploit the crises to strengthen or rebuild the infrastructure, to use the shortages to grow from scratch.
Japan has, above all, woken up thanks to the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable rose by 1%, driven by increased expenditure on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The label for the link to the website of the program
Tokyo has been entrusted to the internal market, when the yen - the Japanese currency - has become one of the "refugees" chosen by investors fleeing the debt crisis in the euro area and the stormy US forecasts, a privilege that weighs as a lot in the accounts of the exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, the products are more expensive abroad, a serious reverse for a country whose economic fluctuation line is determined by the health of the major technological groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, found their weak results between July and September at the Yen.
While markets continue to be based on the EU's peripheral countries, the Yoshihiko Noda Government is not under guard.
"We must pay attention to the risks that persist, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of Thailand's floods and the rapid appreciation of the yen," said yesterday's Secretary of State for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa.
And, in fact, prospects are not encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) stated that the majority of member countries presented more subtle signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator that anticipates inflation points in the global economy highlighted that the main powers are being halted.
Since it dropped four tenths to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 August.
The euro area, including it, was below the average, which is at level 100, when eight tenths of the euro were rushed to 99.13 points.
Athens re-emerges in doubt
Papadimos says the adjustments will be approved, but the Conservatives will not sign any written commitment
With the peripheral risk premiums fired and the uncertainty re-installed in the parks, Greece continues to sink into the maze leading to the exit of the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "consensus" of the new Greek Transitional Government is more subject to the demands of Brussels than a genuine conviction of the political forces begins to be confirmed by fact.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, warned yesterday that there was no alternative to structural reforms and that the period of one hundred days agreed upon in his appointment might be short to apply them, the leader of the Conservative Party New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would not support new austerity measures in any case and reiterated his demand for new elections by the scheduled date on 19 February.
"The main task of this Government is to implement the decisions of the October 26th summit," Papadimos said when opening yesterday a parliamentary debate that will culminate tomorrow with a vote of confidence for the new Executive.
A package of 24 programmes to promote employment, reform of the disciplinary code of officials and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, Samaras's message does not clear the doubt about its position: "We have committed ourselves to helping the Transitional Government, but we have not committed ourselves to anything else".
The conservative leader was a further step forward in his push to the EU and the IMF, the agencies that must unlock the 8,000 million Athens urgently needed, and he made it clear that he would not give his visa good to any letter of commitment for compliance with the adjustments.
But the European Commission, still shocked by the impact of the Papandreou referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demand is firm: it will not unlock the aid if the new Government and the leaders of the main Greek parties do not sign "a written commitment without ambiguity and as soon as possible".
Economic Affairs spokesman Amadeu Altafaj explained that Troika inspectors will return to Athens "very soon" to discuss with the new government "what is needed to pay the sixth instalment" of 8,000 million, although there is no final date either.
The Greek Madeja still has a mouse thread.
Woman Sofia: "They are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen highlights Spain's "preponderant" place in relation to this type of finance
Spain "has reached a leading global place in the role of microfinance".
The Queen Doña Sofia recalled yesterday that the country has become the second donor of this cooperation instrument in the last two decades, whose " essence" pointed out that it is a " instrument for social progress, justice and the hope of a better future for all mankind, based on trust in the human being".
The Queen inaugurated yesterday the V World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid with the conviction that "there is no doubt" that this type of operation is "absolutely indispensable" in order to achieve the United Nations Millennium Goals with a horizon of 2015, and, "very especially, in this one that aims to reduce to half the volume of people living with incomes below a daily dollar, with which the "poverty threshold" is fixed.
Spain "keeps working" to expand the network of beneficiaries "to all corners of the planet, and assumes this task with "responsibility", said Doña Sofia, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions from the Summit, which will be extended until Thursday, "guarante new capacities and best opportunities for the poorest, and especially for women", the main beneficiaries of these loans.
There are "many achievements achieved" and "many of the challenges we face".
The Microcredit Summit is considered not only as a forum for discussion, but also as the platform from which to promote "two basic goals".
Thus, His Majesty explained that it is expected that at the end of 2015, 175 million poor families who have access to these financial services and that hundreds of millions of such households are coming out of the poverty threshold in which they are living.
The momentum in the design of microcredit in Spain and the rest of the world "has followed the path started years ago as a pioneer" by Muhammad Yunus, highlighted Doña Sofia as a "act of justice and due recognition".
And it is he who described the father of this tool as "an amazing idealist in the universal cause of the struggle against poverty", whose work has been known for 15 years, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to know her borrowing policy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in Costa de Marfil in 1999, Canada 2006, and "in all I have been able to see the continuous evolution," His Majesty explained, whose link to this project was worth yesterday the qualification of the "family head" gathered in Valladolid by the "poor baker".
Finally, the Queen of Sofia concluded her intervention by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
"Ethic imperative"
The Foreign Minister, Trinidad Jiménez, warned that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for all democratic states.
In this regard, I pointed out that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries at times of economic prosperity, since it is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez considered microcredit to be "a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to eradicating poverty", and now "more than ever" the Governments of developed countries must work under solidarity criteria and not allow it to be a victim of cuts.
For Spain, microcredit consists of "one of the main development cooperation lines".
For his part, the Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, praised "the success" of giving "trust" to those "exclusive to whom everyone closes the doors"; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier Leon de la Riva, welcomed those present to a city that "opens its contaminated doors of the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect the European President by universal suffrage
The first day of the Congress of the Christian-Democrat Union (CDU) in Leipzig on Monday, 14 November, has passed without great difficulty for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and President of the Christian-Democrat Party.
Initially, the future of Europe had not been included in the agenda, but the issue was imposed in autumn, in particular to satisfy militants who felt that the government's policy was currently too strict with the Greeks and could be in a future with the Italians.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the Directorate, was adopted unanimously.
Of the 1,001 delegates, only nine votes against and ten abstentions were recorded.
The standing ovation of several minutes that they won, with their interventions, Angela Merkel and, after several hours, Wolfgang Schäuble, the Europhile Minister of Finance, clears out any possible doubts.
The key idea of the Chancellor, and of the motion, is summed up in a motto: the response to the crisis "is not less Europe, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe is peace, but also because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
For the Chancellor, "the time has come to open the way to Europe."
This could be reflected in amendments to the Lisbon Treaty in order to strengthen the control of the European Union over the budgetary policies of the euro area countries, although it could also trigger in the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage to "give a face to Europe".
In any case, that is one of the proposals of the motion adopted by the Congress, clearly the idea of Wolfgang Schäuble.
Without a doubt, it is unlikely that the twenty-six will soon reach an agreement on this radical change: Britain is hostile to him and CDU leaders seem to know that Nicolas Sarkozy too.
But the ball is on the ground.
On the other hand, delegates have rejected by a overwhelming majority the proposal to weigh the weight of each country in the European Central Bank Directive on the basis of the weight of each economy, which would obviously strengthen the weight of Germany.
The Chancellor has increased references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but he has also not tried to win his congress at the expense of the "small" European countries or countries in difficulties which are willing to criticize the arrogant Germany.
Although the motion on Europe deals with the importance of "French-German friendship", Angela Merkel has not lied to France.
Except for the past.
Remembering that two centuries ago, there was a bloody battle in Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats for Napoleon's army.
The impact of fraud on lows due to disease
After the grants, the UMP and the Government committed an offensive against disease-related reductions.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday, 15 November, to visit a responsible family allowance box and give a talk on the subject, which has been recurring since 2007, of the fight against social fraud and assistance.
In addition, to accompany such offensive, which is part of the will to save rigorously, but still recalls an axis of the presidential campaign on the right, most want to focus on the lows by disease.
First of all, to implement budget cuts: the Government plans to impose a fourth day of shortage on private sector workers before they are able to take down.
Finally, unless there is a specific business agreement, a sick worker would lose four days' wages, i.e. a minimum of 15% of his monthly income.
This is a measure that could raise a wave of anger, but which would save EUR 280 million, according to Les Echoes.
In addition, it would be accompanied by another measure with a more symbolic scope: to impose a day of non-remuneration on employees in the event of low employment (to date, there is no shortage, compared to the three days that apply in the private sector).
While these issues are being debated, the majority re-examined the subject of fraud, this time oriented towards the abuse of labour.
"The controls are going to be significantly increased and, in addition, if someone is discovered committing a fraud, they will have to refund the amounts," Xavier Bertrand warned by speaking on Sunday, November 13, in the RTL.
As in other cases, the effects of the announcement appear to be slightly disproportionate to the reality of fraud in the field of labour losses.
In fact, there has been a constant follow-up to this issue since 2002 and various political offensives have been launched which have usually produced fruit.
The French are no longer sicker than the rest of Europe.
Let us take a close look at the national figures.
According to the French Institute for Social Security (CNAM), more than EUR 237 million was paid in 2006 for low-employment benefits.
According to the French Institute for Research and Documentation in Health Economics, low-cost subsidies represented 5% of health expenditure in 2008, amounting to EUR 11.300 million.
Of this amount, 46% are lower by maternity and labour accidents, while 54% are related to lowers by disease, which amounts to EUR 6,200 million.
Consequently, 2.5% of health expenditure.
In 2010, the French took an average of 14.5 working days, compared with 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by Alma Consulting.
An average that no doubt conceals deviations: another survey, published in 2007 by the professional management Syria Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed claimed that they had not taken a single day off due to illness.
Another study, in this case, of the Disease Insurance case, indicates that in 2010 37% of the disease rates had a duration of less than 8 days, 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11% were longer.
If we compare them with our European neighbours, French workers are no more likely than in other areas to catch low by disease.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers indicated that, between 1994 and 2001, the overall rate of absence of work (both for health and other reasons) ranged in France between 10 per cent and 11 per cent, compared with 20 per cent and 28 per cent in Denmark, 15 per cent in the United Kingdom or between 16 per cent and 18 per cent in the Netherlands.
Deficiency in disease rates is not particularly significant compared to undeclared work.
There is a limited scope for fraud.
The strengthening of legislation, since 2002, has led to systematic controls on disease-related diseases for more than 45 days.
In 2008, of 1.5 million inspections, CNAM verified, in 13 per cent of 285,000 cases, that short-term reductions were "unjustified or too long", i.e. 37,050 cases.
In the case of reductions of more than 45 days, subject to systematic inspections, 11 per cent of the cases were considered to be "adequately adapted or unjustified; a figure that, with a total of 1.2 million as a starting point, amounted to 132.000.
Therefore, a total of 169,000 "unjustified" cases are reached among several million workers who have suffered a low sickness rate.
No doubt a small figure compared, for example, with work in black.
According to UMP Dominique Tian, the author of a report on this issue in June, this practice would represent a loss of tax revenue of between EUR 9,000 million and EUR 15 billion per year, i.e. more than the total cost of low subsidies and, of course, considerably more than fraud in this last area.
Papadémos: Greece must apply a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment plan to address its economy.
This is what Prime Minister Lucas Papadémos told Parliament on Monday 14 November; he added that the hundreds of days that have been granted to his union government would not be enough to achieve that goal.
"In order to make efforts to recover the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new programme of budgetary adjustment," said the Head of Government, who delivered his first public speech during the opening of the debate on Parliament's vote of confidence on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone Summit on 27 October will be the "principal task" of the new government, as "is at stake" the country's stay in the euro area has been added.
As a result, Papadémos has foreseen that the country's public deficit will be reduced "to about 9%" of GDP by the end of the year, after reaching 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
Right rejects new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the head of the right-wing group, showed his support for the measures already adopted to try to get out of the debt crisis on Monday, but warned that his party would not commit itself to additional austerity measures.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said during a meeting with the members of his party "New Democracy".
He noted that he was in line with the deficit and debt reduction objectives, as well as combating waste, but against any policy that prevented economic recovery.
Olli Rehn, European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unlock the necessary EUR 8 billion loan without a written guarantee of support for all parties to the planned measures, Antonio Samaras has replied that his word would be sufficient and that he would not sign anything due to external pressure.
A Committee of Experts states that euthanasia and assisted suicide should be legalized
Canadians live denying death, according to the report of the Canadian Real Society
In the field of palliative care, the Committee calls for Governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, not only in cancer cases.
Canadian society lives by denying death.
In fact, only 9 per cent of Canadians are willing to talk to their doctor about the conditions under which they wish to die and make provision for this.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, which included the participation of six experts in various fields, including ethics, legal and medical.
The Committee recommends that the Government amend the Criminal Code so as to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, when the patient has chosen this option and has been considered competent to take the decision.
To begin with, experts cite a recent survey by the United Economist Intelligence Unit that compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
Although Canada holds its tenth position, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has generated a culture in which people are afraid to address the topic of death".
With or without medication, 77 per cent of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, according to experts selected by the Royal Society of Canada.
And although most Canadians want to die at home, 68.6% of them have died in the hospital.
Overall, the highest rate in this sense registers Quebec, where 86% of the deaths occur in the hospital.
With regard to the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report reached conclusions that did not coincide with the position of the federal Government, which had already stated that it did not wish to amend the Criminal Code in relation to euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to experts, who have also studied the situation in all countries where such practices have been legalized or do not constitute a criminal offence, there is no evidence that the fact that they are not considered a criminal offence has not resulted in an abuse of their implementation, i.e. the use of euthanasia or suicide assisted by persons who are not competent or who have not given their consent.
Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, said yesterday by teleconference that, on the contrary, more was observed in those countries where euthanasia or assisted suicide had not been legalized.
"In Canada euthanasia is practiced, although it is clearly illegal."
"In Canada, assisted suicide is practiced, although it is clearly illegal," explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians, in favour of euthanasia
We recall that 85 per cent of Canadians have already spoken in favour of euthanasia, since they believe it would allow people whose death is near to relieve their suffering, as indicated by an Angus Reid survey conducted in 2010.
In addition, 66% believe that the legalization of euthanasia will not imply that the life of the elderly or the disabled is of less value.
With regard to persons who have committed assisted suicide, 41 per cent of respondents believe that a process should not be initiated against them.
With regard to the maintenance or interruption of health care to a patient, the situation is not so clear, as reported by the authors of the report.
In addition, its recommendations suggest that the Criminal Code indicates that withdrawal of health care, if legally refused, does not constitute a criminal offence.
The Committee of Experts also requests that health professionals be trained to respect the fact that a patient rejects assistance at the end of his life without fear of facing a complaint.
In the field of palliative care, the Committee calls for Governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, not only in cancer cases.
Finally, in relation to palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in the health institutions of Canada, the Committee requests that, unless it is used to reduce physical pain, it be considered euthanasia and subject to the same procedures.
Other experts show reservations
Other experts in the field of health law have already expressed reservations about the conclusions of the report of the experts of the Royal Society of Canada.
Pierre Deshamps, a specialist in health law, has described "extremely" the position of experts signing the report, including because the practice of euthanasia is not limited to terminally ill.
"This leaves the door open to a situation in which someone who is tired of living and has more than 18 years of age may ask for help to commit suicide," Deshamps said, who consulted yesterday a summary of the report.
Mr. Deshamps also stressed that the authors of the report seem to give priority to personal autonomy over any other value of society.
Now, add that "in society, there are labels and limitations".
Health law specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed his "strong opposition" with regard to the conclusions of the report, which he described as "a manifesto in favour of euthanasia".
Margaret Somerville, who also belongs to the Royal Society of Canada, particularly discusses the lack of abuse in certain countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal, as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan urges President El Asad to abandon power
Damascus denounces a "complot"
Syria is increasingly isolated
The Bachar Asad partisans showed up yesterday before the Foreign Ministry building.
Yesterday the diplomatic pressure on Syria of Bachar El Asad was intensified, which, with the support of Russia, resisted and claimed that there was a "combat" against the country.
Two days after Syria's suspension by the Arab League, the European Union has reinforced its sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, neighbours of Syria, have expressed themselves in favour of the abandonment of power by President Asad.
King Abdalah II of Jordan was yesterday the first Arab leader who asked President Bachar El Asad to "reject power" in Syria, where a quarter of the regime's forces and civilians have already died.
"If Bachar is really concerned about his country, he should resign, in addition to creating the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life," said the king of Jordan, a neighboring country of Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
For his part, Turkish diplomacy chief Ahmet Davutoglu has regretted that the mediation efforts he has been carrying out in Turkey since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime have ended in failure.
"Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their peoples and cannot satisfy them will leave," he said, praising Syria, a neighbouring country in respect of which Turkey is taking an increasingly tough stance.
For their part, following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union, the United States has concluded that "the consensus against Asad and the actions of the Syrian regime has been strengthened".
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and other countries, such as Turkey, are taking an increasingly tougher tone" with regard to repression in Syria, Mark Toner, spokesperson of the Department of State points out.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime's forces in the Deraa region in southern Syria have already lost their lives, as announced by the Syrian Human Rights Observatory (OSDH).
Two other civilians have died "on bombings and shootings with heavy machine guns in Jobar" in Homs city, as reported by the NGO.
During a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Al Mualem believes that the country "is moving towards the end of the crisis".
In addition, he has reacted firmly to the Arab League's decision to suspend Damasco's duties, which in his opinion constitutes "a dangerous step".
Syria "will not fade," he added, guaranteeing that "the plots against Syria will fail".
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently studying a “civil protection mechanism” and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers to the country.
French Minister for Foreign Affairs Alain Juppe has also expressed his support for the sending of United Nations observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime that he believes is part of the "paranoia".
A new extraordinary meeting of the League tomorrow in Rabat is expected to be held to bring about the implementation of the exit plan of the crisis adopted on 2 November, which includes, in particular, the withdrawal of the armed forces from the cities in the hands of the opposition and the release of the detainees.
The Russian Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov, yesterday considered the decision of the Arab League to be "inaccurate", while China urged Syria to implement the plan to end the crisis, although it did not express its support for the implementation of possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti asks for time for Italian markets and sacrifices
The future head of the Italian Government, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for some time to train their team and implement a programme that will include "sacrifices" intended to restore lost credibility during the last months of the Berlusconi Government.
The former European Commissioner discussed yesterday with political parties and today he met with trade unions and employers.
It should form a relatively restricted office, consisting of external technocrats in Parliament.
"Monti has talked about a wide programme with many sacrifices," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many small parliamentary groups that participated in the meetings after meeting with the President of the appointed Council.
For his part, the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, said he hoped that Mario Monti would ask for a vote of confidence before Friday to ensure that the new Government had sufficient support.
The consultations will end with Mr. Monti's presentation of a limited list, no doubt from a dozen Ministers, to the Head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Monti has commented on the nervousness of stock exchanges and bonders yesterday, asking for time.
In "democracy, there are precise deadlines" for forming a Government and preparing its programme, he stressed, adding that it is "certain that markets will be patient and understanding".
His appointment by the President was initially welcomed by the markets, but then anxiety was imposed, particularly after an unforeseen fall in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The appointed Prime Minister should create a team composed mainly of technocrats, even if he has pointed out that he would like to include "political".
The new Government should operate until 2013, the date of the next legislative act.
According to the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new Government will receive Parliament's confidence vote before Friday.
Monti has committed himself to working, when he is in charge, taking into account the urgency and the objective of Italy 'recovery its protagonist' in Europe.
A spokesperson for Commissioner Olli Rehn has pointed out that "including a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy will not vary".
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its objective of achieving a budgetary balance in 2013, despite the austerity plans adopted over the past months, has called for more stringent measures.
The Italian "head of the" Emma Marcegaglia, who will see her dead, also insisted on the need to boost the economy, "since a country that does not grow cannot meet the deficit requirements".
Monti, famous for his competency and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), is an "exchange of time" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism"; the "teacher" symbolizes "the challenge of seriousness" and "other Italy", according to editorialists.
The great incognito will be the longevity of your team.
President Napolitano wants to avoid early elections, as Italy has to place some €20 billion in state obligations before April 2012.
A Russian scientist has collaborated with the Iranian nuclear programme
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, has collaborated with Iran in the development of a detonator that can be used with a nuclear weapon, an American NGO specialized in atomic risk said Monday.
For the identification of the researcher, the Institute of Science and International Security (ISIS) is based on a recent report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents issued by that United Nations agency.
The IAEA expressed its "severe concern" last week for a "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to ISIS, based extensively on IAEA documents, Danilenko, born in 1934, would have worked for three decades, since 1960, at a Soviet military nuclear centre in Cheliabinsk (Ural) and would have participated in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he would have left the centre to form a company centered on the production of "nanodiamantes" in Kiev.
His company's economic problems would have led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
It is then believed that it cooperated with the Iranian programme between 1996 and 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its last report, the IAEA mentions that there are "clear indications that Iran is developing" a nuclear detonation system "with the help of a foreign expert who not only knew the technique well but also, according to a Member State to the Agency, worked during most of his career in this technology in the military programme of his country of origin".
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by about 50 per cent between 2009 and 2010, while the remaining types of racial and religious violence have decreased or increased only slightly, according to statistics published by the FBI on Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of acts of violence against Muslims has increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, that is, it has increased by 49 per cent, compared with a 13 per cent increase in the case of acts of violence against Catholics, a 4 per cent reduction in crimes against Jews and a total increase of 14 per cent in the number of crimes and anti-religious crimes.
The total number of "hate crimes" has increased slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% are due to racial differences and 20% to religious differences, as indicated by the FBI.
"After a decline in 2009, it is worrying that these crimes and crimes have again increased," the Human Rights First human rights organization stressed, "the increase in acts of violence against Muslims is particularly significant," the organization added in a communiqué.
"Human Rights First has long been pointing out that violence against Muslims, as well as all kinds of hate crimes, should be considered a serious violation of human rights," adds Paul Legendre.
"The U.S. Government can and should strive to put an end to such abuses," he added, considering that such efforts could include an improvement in police reports on "hate crimes".
The "hate crime" in US federal law was inherited from the time of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of racial violence, skin color, religion, origin and now sexual inclination.
Twitter changes its platform and looks more like Facebook
The microblogging Twitter site changed the presentation of its platform on Monday to allow its users, in particular, to observe the activities of the people who follow them, causing their service to look a little more like Facebook.
A new "activity" and another called "name" tab allow to follow more legibly and directly the activity of other "Twits", i.e. those online whose messages ("twitters") follow you on the Internet or follow you.
This lets you know if they follow messages, if they subscribe to new accounts, if they qualify for a favorite message, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested "with a small percentage of users in August" before spreading it to the rest of the network on Monday, as AFP has indicated Twitter spokesperson Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, which was known for its non-instinctive functioning, with slightly esoteric terms (RT to send a message from another person, follow-friday to recommend following another user) making the initiative happy, opens up to a wider audience with a more comparable handling than that of the big public networks Facebook and Google+.
On the network, users have discussed "tweets" with different opinions the interest of this innovation.
"It's useless, it's invasive and it looks too much like Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"The Activity function will help me better follow some elements of my Twitter stream," writes @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Introduction of a "gold rule" budget in the Constitution
The Government of the Great Social Democratic/Christian Coalition that is in power in Austria has decided on Tuesday to include in the Constitution a budgetary "golden rule" to reduce the public deficit and thus to avoid possible degradation of Austria's sovereign note by credit rating agencies (triple A).
It was the Socialist Chancellor himself, Werner Faymann, who announced this decision after a Council of Ministers, when the Austrian public debt reaches 74.6%, a very high figure above the 60% limit laid down by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly below the debt of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If the solvency of Austria was reduced at a single level, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay EUR 3 billion more in interest each year," said Vice-Cancellor of the Christian Democrats for Foreign Affairs, Michael Spindeleger.
Austria thus responded to a request from the Brussels Summit to the euro area member countries of the last 26 October: in it, the Heads of State and Government requested the inclusion, before the end of 2012, of the reduction of the public deficit and the recovery of the balance of public accounts in the Constitution or in a Law of equivalent value.
The device adopted by the Austrian Government is approaching the "German model", since Germany was the first European country to adopt this kind of "rule".
Before 2017, the structural public deficit should decrease annually by 0.75% of the gross domestic product (GDP) and, from 2017 onwards, the federal State's structural public deficit should not exceed 0.35% of GDP annually, while the regional States, as well as the municipalities, should submit balanced budgets.
The objective is to reduce public debt under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty by 2020/2021.
A strong fill
Not a threat with a new intervention in the foreign exchange market
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would again intervene in the trade mark if the yen continued to increase.
"We will intervene, as we did last time, if we prove that there is excessive volatility" in the type of change of the yen, he explained Noda to the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen rose to a level close to the historical peaks that led to the intervention of the Japanese authorities on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo sold massively fines for dollars to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which had just reached a new record since 1945 compared with the US currency.
But the yen has been rising slowly since then, driven by the purchases of investors who consider it a "future value" in these times uncertain of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar back on Tuesday is less than 77 yen and the euro has fallen below the 105 yen symbolic bar, reaching close levels to which the last intervention was triggered.
Before the financial crisis in 2008-2009, the dollar was set at about 120 yen and the euro at more than 160 yen.
This explosion of the Japanese currency is detrimental to the archipelago exports, as it enshrines the products Made in Japan and reduces the value of foreign income received by Japanese companies when they convert them to the national currency.
"Japan is fighting for reconstruction" after the 6th and 11th March tsunami, which devastated the Tohoku region (northeast), highlighted Noda, who fears that the anchoring of the root yen is weak recovery.
The third world economic power has recovered growth in the third quarter (approximately 1.5 per cent in relation to the previous quarter), for the first time in a year, thanks to an increase in exports and consumption of households affected by the disaster.
But the Prime Minister considers that the high level of the yen did not reflect Japan's "economic bases".
The Minister of Finance, Jun Azumi, asked the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened on Tuesday a two-day meeting of its Monetary Policy Council, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
However, the institution's Deputy Governor Hirohide Yamaguchi warned that the BoJ had already taken "adequate measures", implying that greater monetary flexibility should not be expected on Wednesday.
During its last meeting at the end of October, the emission institute increased by five billion yen (EUR 47 billion) its Treasury Letter purchases, bringing to the 55 billion yen (EUR 519 billion) the threshold of the funds dedicated to the acquisition of various financial instruments to flood the liquidity market.
Euro area:
the types grow, the bags fade
The risk of contagion of the debt crisis continues to harm European indices.
Despite the appointment of new Heads of Government in Greece and Italy, as well as better growth rates in France and Germany, the rates of the weaker countries continue to increase.
Still concerned about the stability of the euro area, European stock exchanges sink a little further into the negative zone on Tuesday, 15 November.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., CAC 40 loses 1.4 per cent and is located at 3,064 points.
Dax lost 0.4% in Frankfurt and 0.1% in London.
"In view of the new tensions with regard to the performance of the euro area States' loans, stock markets around the world continue to yield some of their recent gains."
"Investors, nervous, are perfectly aware of the risk of infection," explains Terry Pratt, an institutional corridor in IG Markets, quoted by the agency Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange has closed with a fall of 0.7%, renewing market stakeholders' concerns about Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has a fixed view in Europe and exchanges will continue to take place in a limited range of variations, so investors will not have proof that the situation has been stabilised," says Mitsushige Akino, fund manager in Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
Reappearing concerns about the future of the euro area affects the single currency, which continues to decline on Tuesday.
The euro has remained at its lowest level for a month and a half.
Up to 10 hours, the European currency was $1.3570, a drop of 0.4 per cent.
According to the runners, it has lost value after the Chancellor Angela Merkel's party, the CDU, which met in Congress on Monday, adopts a motion that includes, in particular, the option of a country in difficulty to leave the euro area without leaving the European Union.
The Italian and Spanish types exceed 6% with growth
The credit rates of Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
On Tuesday morning, the performance of Italian obligations at 10 years of age reached 6.85 per cent, while Spanish titles at the same time offered 6.2 per cent.
These tensions in relation to the types of interest of the countries of the south, although also of France, continue to fuel the fears of the interveners.
The head of the future Italian Government, Mario Monti, has asked for time on the markets to improve the situation in Italy, which is at risk of falling into debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, for his part, has stated that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone Summit on 27 October would be the "main work" of his Government.
Spain is at the market point of view, while the legislative elections will be held there on Sunday.
The difference in types ("spread") between 10-year-old obligations in Germany and Spain has reached a new historical maximum.
Waiting for euro area growth figures
From a statistical point of view, France has recorded an economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, i.e. a more favourable figure than the projected 0.3%, driven by domestic consumption.
However, the Insee has revised the number of the second quarter at a lower rate, with a reduction of 0.1% of the gross domestic product (GDP) instead of a stagnation.
In addition, the fourth quarter is what really concerns economists.
Germany, for its part, has recorded a 0.5 per cent increase in the same period.
The first forecasts for the euro area as a whole are foreseen at 11 p.m. after the European Commission has warned of the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
the facts must be worth more than the dogmas
If there is a topic that cannot be dealt with taking into account short-term considerations or simply thinking about emotions, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly influence the purchasing power and the competitiveness of companies.
It is appropriate that an election meeting should be the time to reflect on such issues and on the place of nuclear energy.
The debate will only be useful if it examines the overall economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, on rational data.
Now that we are 7. billion people on the planet, demographic developments will result in the duplication of electricity demand by 2050, unless a large proportion of the world's population is deprived of a vital element.
At the same time, there will be an increasing shortage of fossil resources to continue producing electricity continuously, without forgetting the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change, a topic that has disappeared from the ecological debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany remains alone in its decision to give up nuclear energy.
That is neither the case in Belgium, which is subject to the need to find a source capable of replacing it, nor in Switzerland, which is only intended to build last-generation plants.
On the other hand, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, by quoting some examples, continue with determination with their projects.
The United States, on the other hand, after Fukushima decided to add a unit to its park, resumes the construction of a power plant interrupted after the Three Mile Island accident.
If the German model, based on renewable energies, is sometimes presented as an example, the reality goes against such speech.
The Berlin election will result in an increase in the price of electricity, a greater energy dependence on the increased need for imported gas, in particular Russia, an increase in CO2 emissions for the construction of gas and coal plants.
Within a few months, the adverse effects will be noted.
You should think about the case of Denmark.
Europe's wind champion, which accounts for 30% of its electricity, is also one of the major users of coal and gas due to the intermittent wind; for this reason, its CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the persistence of our energy policy, our neighbours are paying an electricity bill of 40% higher than that of the French households.
While in a globalised economy the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and guaranteeing the maintenance of industrial utility in the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
For this reason, any significant reduction in nuclear energy would result in a strong rise in the price of electricity, which would remain realistic to the wonderful declarations on the re-industrialization of our country and the defence of our purchasing power.
This is a price that the vast majority of French people refuse to pay and, in fact, do not initially object to this type of energy, as the surveys show.
We recall that our country's energy policy has lost the construction of an industrial sector with 125,000 directorial jobs and 410,000 indirect jobs.
Widely export-oriented, it covers a galaxy of SMEs specialized in international markets that can create non-localized jobs.
If France had decided to abandon nuclear energy, it would have been the sacrifice of a large part of these SMEs and the loss of EUR 6 billion per year in French nuclear equipment and services exports.
What electrician would charge an EPR designed to operate sixty years, when its manufacturer is expected to collapse?
To solve the equation of nuclear energy, it must be admitted that there is no miraculous source of electricity production, as there is no diabolical source.
The development by Areva of low-carbon and renewable solutions demonstrates the complementary nature of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is essential to maintain the maximum level of safety.
In France, we have a security authority that exercises strict and transparent control over both existing power plants and the construction of Flamanville.
Our teams, of recognized professionalism, are also obsessed with security.
In the middle of the century, the nuclear sector has suffered three serious accidents.
Only one, that of Three Mile Island, took place under normal operating conditions; it did not have consequences for people or for the environment.
In Chernobyl, the accident was due to reactor design and unforgivable human failure.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident was due to two natural disasters of unprecedented scope, causing the death of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear sector will learn from this accident, as it did from the previous two.
Thanks to these progress and cooperation between the security authorities and the French and German operators and builders, the EPR presents a design capable of resisting such phenomena.
While all the electric actors who want to build a power plant are studying it, the interruption of their construction in Flamanville would be a great gift for the competitors of Areva and EDF, as it would leave them free to assume leadership in the inevitable development of the nuclear sector.
It is essential and legitimate to seek the best energy options for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let the emotions, dogmas and party maneuvers dominate such an important debate for our country's economic, social and financial situation.
Immigration, a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy implemented by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticised from a number of points of view: the saturation of police, judicial and administrative services subject to digital policy, the compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of France's "country of human rights".
More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students that has jumped the headlines, with the Minister of the Interior (see the newspaper Libération of 23 May) proclaiming from the past that France "does not need foreign talents, workers or comrades".
However, it is rarely analysed from an economic point of view.
The question is, on this subject, there is a considerable consensus between the left and the right.
In the case of the right, Jacques Chirac set the orientation in 1976, stating that "900,000 unemployed should not be a problem for a country with about two million migrant workers", while on the left, the tone set Michel Rocard explaining that France "could not be responsible for all the misery of the world" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, both the left and the right shared the fear of the invasion of the national territory by a multitude of Polish fountainers.
On both sides, immigrants are considered to be a burden to the French economy and society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity with which they act with regard to immigrants.
In its programme, François Hollande is limited to including banalities, indicating that the development of co-development will enable the " problem of migration" to be solved.
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may be economically profitable, but it is very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron point out in a recent work summarizing the most recent knowledge about immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among experts on the positive impact of migratory flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries receiving immigrants.
The limitation of immigration weakens growth and harms employment.
Fears related to the impact of immigrants are based on the idea that they can replace national workers, particularly those with low qualifications, by pressing for their salaries to be reduced.
However, experience shows that immigrants are actually more complementary than substitutes for national workers and are mainly engaged in professions in sectors with a lack of employment.
Unqualified immigrants work in sectors that do not attract national workers and the most skilled in dynamic sectors where training does not meet staff demand.
A positive effect on salaries
Just as a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country that lacks anesthetists, complementarity between nationals and immigrants causes the arrival of the latter to have a positive impact on the salaries and employment of the nationals.
In view of the above, Giovanni Peri calculated that an increase of 1 per cent of the migration flows is a rise in real long-term wages of between 0.6 and 0.9 per cent.
And, without taking into account the fact that the diversity of immigrants contribute to the creation of ideas and economic growth (there is a large proportion of naturalized U.S. Nobel prizes and companies such as Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Immigrants are also net contributors to social systems, as they average 1% of the total budget in European countries.
For example, the International Labour Organization estimates that in Germany an immigrant who is 30 years old will make a net contribution of EUR 150,000 (less cost) to the public average budgets throughout his life.
At the beginning of his term of office, Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to go look for the growth points he missed "with his teeth".
These teeth, which deterred immigrants, had exactly the opposite effect.
Europe invented democracy, it just needs to think about a European democracy
Democracy is a precious but fragile asset.
The European continent should be able to remember this because, although it was invented in Athens over two thousand years ago, during the 20th century it has suffered the tragedies of the World War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the crowns in Greece.
Some may have believed that, in order for democracy to finally triumph over its enemies, it would be sufficient to exercise the vote and in the most direct way possible.
We know, since Napoleon, "the Little one," which was about something thought.
Universal suffrage, although it is a necessary condition for democracy, is not enough for itself and can even become an "oppressive instrument", as former Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot said.
No, democracy requires much more: public space, public spirit, values, organization, separation and control of powers, education, Lights, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis we live in Europe is an economic crisis, but it is about to become a political and democratic crisis.
The Palinody of the true-false Greek referendum had in this regard a double revealing effect: it showed the need for a powerful return of the political sphere, but also the worrying feeling of its impossibility, of its incongruity.
You must think about this ambiance to overcome it.
The truth is that the lines of the front of the democratic battle have now shifted and that, in many cases, Republican soldiers are no longer progressing in the right direction.
We will not win if we demand a succession of national referendums, organized according to needs and in an orderly manner.
A white signature to the absolute European monarch or a high vacuum to the nationalist hole: what options for the citizen!
No, we do not want to strike effective but a common exercise, full of law, quiet and continuous, of options and democracy, this time at European level.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal (in fact, we did not know where to finish the list), because there is only one crisis, the crisis in Europe.
The whole of Europe is the one that adheres to the orders of markets and rating agencies, the one that suffers from its impotence and lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that suffers from humiliation in the international sphere.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but it is all Europe that slowly loses sovereignty and, with it, each of its nations.
The most urgent thing is that popular sovereignty recovers the driving force of the European project.
Because only together can Europeans reduce their debt burden, get rid of the markets and prepare their future by investing.
The outcome of the crisis will require decisions at European level that cannot be taken without total democratic legitimacy, unless it is to lead us to disaster.
After a long struggle against this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone is currently calling for European economic governance.
That's right.
But thinking about it without greater political and democratic integration, and without living as such by the citizens, would be a new madness and would lead us to a new dead point.
We must take a new stage of European construction.
To build the Republic in France, it was necessary to "make" Republicans.
The Revolution motivated by interests would not be enough.
This lesson is still applicable.
We must build a more integrated Europe from an economic point of view.
Only a more democratic Europe can be achieved in political terms, a true European popular sovereignty.
To build Europe, let us make Europeans.
Cards with "without contact" chips are generalised
The world hall of chip cards starts on Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, with an optimistic environment.
In fact, 2011 should end up with an increase of 11% in global card sales with microprocessors (bank cards, SIM cards, etc.), with a total of 6 billion units, according to Eurosmart's office calculations.
The most powerful segment is that of wireless technology, which allows you to subscribe to common transport or purchases simply by approaching the card to a reader.
This year will be sold worldwide 460 million cards without contact, 320 million more than the previous year!
Its share should continue to increase in 2012 (580 million units are expected) and represent about 10% of the world market for chip cards (6,925 million cards).
Europe, which has long been relegated to the Asia-Pacific region, is gaining ground in the field of unpaid payments.
About 26 million Visa bank cards already have this function, which is accepted in 75,000 payment terminals.
In France, its beginnings are more modest: 400,000 visas are being used without contact.
But the big surfaces work for four.
Carrefour has issued 2.5 million Pass MasterCard cards this year without contact.
In order to make the top move, however, banks need to make it available to their customers.
"There are two large French establishments that have been committed to systematically spreading in the future, among their customers, bank cards with the system without contact," Gérard Nebouy, Director General of Visa Europe France, announced.
Banks test payment by mobile phone
But it is only a first step towards the middle of the future payment: the mobile phone.
There are currently few devices equipped with NFC (Near Field Communication) technology, essential for the transaction.
"They're laughing."
"But I should finally experience a true growth next year."
"We anticipate that between 80 million and 120 million units will be sold in 2012 worldwide," explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks take the lead.
The agricultural credit bank announced yesterday the launch of a test between December and June next in Caen.
The iPhones of around 200 customers and employees will be matched with a fund that allows the payment without contact.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the General Society has also stated yesterday that it is preparing the marketing of an offer that allows its customers to pay without contact through their mobile.
From Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front is increasing
Paris is concerned about the links between Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The links between the Al Qaeda terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect of Boko Haram, which has been suspected for a long time, have been confirmed.
On Sunday, the Algerian Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Abdelkader Messahel, even said that Argel already "has certainty".
"The way both organizations operate and the intelligence services reports demonstrate that they are cooperating," he explained, without providing more details.
Paris seems to have reached a similar conclusion.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger last January would have resumed the crossings.
Raped in a Niamey restaurant by people related to Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory died the following day along with several of his kidnappers during an operation launched by the French special forces.
In the ruins of the intervention, French and Nigerian researchers discovered several telephone chips belonging to terrorists.
Terrorist Axis
The study of the calls made refers to several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers especially captured the interest of the researchers: one leads to a Nigerian who stayed for a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, with Boko Haram, and the other to a man who is allegedly close to Aqmi and the sect.
"It is progress, but we must certainly expect to have more formal evidence before speaking of operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"We have known for years that the sect enjoys external financial and intellectual support and that it is increasingly active," says Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, these "supports" have been increasingly evident in the evolution and discourses of Boko Haram or in its operating modes, which now involve the use of increasingly complex camikames or explosive devices and the same style as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, beginning with Washington, has since been pressuring Abuya to take into account the problems generated by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities, in fact, have taken time considering the group as a community of illuminators of little interest.
A Quick Success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and fundamentalist Imam Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram (which means, in hausa, "Western education is a sin"), it encourages the establishment of an Islamic emirature in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association is experiencing rapid success.
politicized and demanded strict respect for the Sharia, while its militants engaged in the fight against the evil central government.
The latter focus primarily on churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram's militants were particularly active and the attacks against the commissioners multiplied.
Abuya's reaction was, as it usually happens, generalized.
The army attacked the city and recorded 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested alive, receives death in prison.
Since then, the sect has become radicalized and has abandoned its northern foes.
The past Christmas demands an attack that causes 80 deaths in Jos and then another one in Abuya.
In June, Boko Haram again attacked Abuya, in particular the police-protected headquarters, with a suicide attack, the first of which.
In August, the United Nations local headquarters became its first international goal.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which would cover from Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria, concerns all security experts.
While Aqmi has attacked Mali and Niger and the Somalis of Al-Chebab operate in Kenya, Boko Haram emerges as a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week, during a meeting in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppe warned him against Boko Haram and said he was willing to "share all the information".
The world according to Republican candidates to the Presidency
With regard to China, Iran and with the help of Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry compete in simplicity and lack of knowledge.
An America weakened by the crisis, can you manage a complex world with simple ideas or even simplistic ideas?
Listening to the Republican presidential candidates, voters might think so.
Since a few days ago, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the other candidates have been making more and more gruesome statements and attacks on foreign policy, traditionally a strong point of the Republicans.
The slogans, often unfounded, about China, Iran, extend the aid to Israel.
Mitt Romney, the best candidate in the race for the "Grand Old Party", has threatened to bring the Chinese to the WTO and to denounce them as "by manipulation of their currency", a key issue in a America that is exacerbated by the migration of entire fragments from their sector to Asia.
It doesn't matter if that involves the explosion of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former Obama Ambassador to China and the only candidate who has a sophisticated vision of foreign policy, almost drowns himself in an attitude that "paddles" emotions.
It has called for a firm, but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current Obama position).
But Huntsman, who is trapped in the depths of the probes, is still hearingless.
Reagan-style
Romney has also promised military intervention in Iran if sanctions fail to interrupt its nuclear programme.
"If I'm elected, I'll arrest Iran," he fanfarroned.
"If Obama is re-elected, they will have the bomb."
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing to meet his obligations with respect to that partner.
Businessman Herman Cain, the second best-class candidate, shows for his part a shameful ignorance of such topics.
Recently, he urged to counter the Chinese military threat because Beijing "is trying to develop nuclear capacity", apparently ignoring the fact that China has already had military atom since 1964.
The Tijan Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to intervene in Iran, says that for his part, he is willing to deploy the US army in Mexico to fight against drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists, prohibited by Obama in 2009, is also preceded by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
The differences are considerable with the 2008 Republican candidate John McCain, a heavy burden on foreign policy.
The opponents of the current President replied that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War.
They remember that Obama himself was a fan and that he had to hit the gun in combating terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of their ingenious dialogue with Iran, the rush of Iraq's "boys" and their harassments in Libya, and they label it weak.
But the attacks aren't simple.
The population is more positive about Obama's national security balance, which ended with Bin Laden.
Since Iraq, he has been unaware of military interventions that cause a sinking.
And, arguing that it takes economically to rebuild America in order to revive its leadership, Obama gives the impression of being more just.
North Stream, new Russian gas entry door in Europe
The North Stream pipeline, which communicates directly Western Europe with Russia passing through the bottom of the Baltic Sea, has already been put into service.
It must provide gas to meet the needs of 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, has wanted to celebrate the event with a great pump.
Last Tuesday, more than 500 guests, including four Heads of State and Government, participated on the shores of the Baltic, between orchestra music and a delicate buffet, at the opening of the North Stream, the new pipeline that communicates directly, under the sea, Russia with Germany.
The German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his counterpart from the Netherlands, Mark Rutte, have swirled together the valve wheel that controls the entry of Russian gas into the Western Europe network.
With this new pipeline, it will each year reach 27.5 million cubic metres of additional Russian gas to Western Europe through a first tube of 1,224 km that communicates the San Petersburg region with the Land of Mecklenburg-Pomerania.
A second pipeline should be completed by the end of 2012 which will provide a total of 55,000 million cubic metres of gas, i.e. enough to cover all French consumption.
In addition, it is already mentioned the possibility of building a third tube through the same route.
For Gazprom, the completion in time of this huge work presents the air of victory.
Poland and the Baltic countries had firmly opposed the project.
In fact, the North Stream will allow direct supply of gas to Germany, avoiding land transit by third countries (Poland and Ukraine).
At the same time, these two countries are losing some of their power: for them, it will be more difficult to influence Russia by threatening it to close access to Western European markets.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare the North Stream as a "new German-Soviet pact", referring to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That is, if the subject is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, supporting the Russian project, has gained greater security of supply.
But the price is a weakening of Europe's energy since the project has created a gap between the Europeans of the East and the West.
Russia has known, in just five years, to triumph over its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and rich Western countries, large gas consumers and with increasingly limited reserves.
"This pipeline is part of our association with Russia, a new artery that unites us organically," said François Fillon during the launch of the pipeline, demonstrating to what extent the major gas sector contracts are both political and economic.
All this explains the broad smiles in the faces of the Gazprom directors, numerous in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical achievement.
The submarine tube is made of cement-covered steel to protect it from the anchors of the ships.
It is located at the bottom of the sea, an average of 200 m deep.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid mines that date from World War II.
"It was necessary to withdraw or destroy a hundred of them, with caution," says Jens Müller, spokesperson for North Stream.
It was also necessary to extend measures for the protection of fauna and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake that weighs like 242 Eiffel towers and is not interrupted throughout its length: neither by valves nor by maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned in Sweden's waters, but the project's managers also gave up on the fact that the Swedes were not very willing to allow a Russian state society to be permanently established at sea in front of its shores.
"In case of emergency, we will stop the gas passage in less than a minute," says Jens Müller.
In case of escape, the gas pipeline will therefore be released into the atmosphere.
But the builders consider it unlikely that a flight will occur, since they have planned mergers that, according to the forecasts, they will have a flight every 100,000 years.
The control of the state of the pipeline shall be ensured by means of a submarine robot, dragged by a ship, carrying out external inspections, as well as by a device flowing through the interior of the pipeline.
With the shape of a pure, it enters the inside of the tube, which has a diameter of one meter, and moves with the gas.
Upon arrival, after three complete days of travel at a speed of three metres per second, provide precise data on possible metal deformations.
The pipeline has been designed to operate for 50 years without the need for any type of repair.
Gas circulation is guaranteed only by pressure.
At first it is 200 bars and at the output of 100 bars.
Five companies have united their forces to be able to carry out this project.
The leading company is Gazprom, which holds 51% of the stakes.
The Germans E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each), joined her.
These five companies have created a common company, called Nord Stream, which is responsible for building and exploiting the pipeline.
It has its headquarters in Zoug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then rented to that company, for a renewable period of twenty-five years, the total capacity of gas transport.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas actually transported," says Jens Müller.
Funding for the construction of the pipeline has been completed by 30% with the contribution of shareholders and by 70% with bank loans.
The total cost of the work should be EUR 7,400 million for both pipes.
For GDF Suez, for example, investment has reached 240 million.
But minority shareholders are certain that they will not exceed their investment, since Gazprom assumes on its own the risk of expenditure.
The pipeline emerges from the Baltic in Lubmin, on a sandy coast planted by pines.
Some valves, with a height of 4.5 meters, form the gas output door.
There are sensors that measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas on arrival, before it is transferred to the German pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal receives a million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
Total capacity will be three million per hour and in 2012, six million.
Moleskine, a brand book.
Created half a century ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to give people the taste for writing.
It has an air of adventure, hours of writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine book is easily recognized, with its black rectangular pastes, its rubber, its broken white leaves, as aged over time.
However, Moleskine booklets with the current aspect were born... in 1997.
The Italian company Mode Modo, based in Milan, then decided to place on the market a book of design, but distinguished.
Maria Sebregondi, then company consultant, was responsible for the launch of the new product.
The book is inspired by an old production technique, the skin mold (top skin), which refers to a demersed cotton used, among other things, to cover the banquets.
This type of book was highly appreciated by writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has adapted to the present taste an old and forgotten object, an icon of the avant-garde artists until the 20th century," says Maria Segregondi, who since then became responsible for the brand in Mode.
And he achieved success.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26%, reaching 12.7 million units sold.
Far away has been the confidential production of the first years, in which only 3,000 books were designed.
Moleskine goes beyond the Italian borders and exports its products to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to determine the buyer's profile, since the notebook attracts both business men and students and professionals.
Like Moleskine, its users are cosmopolitans, open spirit and worship.
The small Italian company, which had twelve workers at its start, now has about 100 and, since 2008, has two offices: one in Milan and the other in New York.
It distributes its quads in bookstores, from Fnac to small shops in the city centre, and has been able to impose its identity.
"We have adapted to the times and need to write, despite the increase in e-mails," Maria Segregondi explains.
This cultural signature goes hand in hand with the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand has launched the exhibition "Detour" where architects or artists expose their own frame.
In August, he also launched a notebook with Leopard tapas, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and this cultural aura, Moleskine has managed to diversify its products: bags, agendas, boligraphs, computer funds... The brand covers a wide range of supports.
A success that provokes envy: in the fall of 2006, Mode was acquired by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, currently Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in Moleskine's history.
Why is the unemployment rate of disabled workers still so high?
About 19 per cent of people with disabilities are seeking employment.
The XV Week for the Employment of Persons with Disabilities begins today.
Despite a resolved public policy, implemented since 2005, the unemployment rate among persons with disabilities doubles the average rate: 19 per cent, compared to 9 per cent for the population as a whole.
Dissolved?
"No," said Éric Blanchet, Director General of Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of the disabled.
"The progress made 15 years ago is considerable.
"At that time the unemployment rate was not twice as high as the average, but three times as high as the average.
"However, there's still a lot to do."
It should be noted that the unemployed continue to face numerous obstacles to accessing employment.
They usually have a more advanced age: 37% are over 50 years of age (17% average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% have not completed the bachelor's degree and only 10,000 of the 2.3 million students in higher education are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very widespread among them: 53 per cent for disabled people, compared to 38 per cent of the average.
In other words, there are many issues that make it particularly difficult to return to the labour world and that "constitute the quoy of the problem", says Christian Grapin, Director General of Tremplín, an association created in 1992 to help businesses hire disabled workers.
These are the objective obstacles.
In addition, there are those who are not mentioned; people's mentality progresses, but too slowly.
A study carried out in April by the IMS-Entrepreneur Association for the City indicated that the directors surveyed have "a level of knowledge about low disabilities", with an "excessive representation of people in wheelchairs, physical or intellectual disabilities".
The result: private companies with more than 20 workers are far from the goal of hiring 6% of disabled workers, which was set out in a... 1987 law.
According to the latest available figures, which date from 2008, a ratio of 2.6% is reached.
"Now we reach about 3%," says Pierre Blanc, Director General of Agefiph, the agency responsible for collecting the contributions of companies that do not comply with this law.
The test: the number of establishments "submitted to this contribution" as well as the amounts disbursed has decreased between 2007 and 2011, ranging from 59,000 to 46,000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 Act, which increased contributions, has created great pressure for businesses," Pierre Blanc explains.
"But this improvement also reflects a true awareness, particularly among the major groups."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59 per cent of the companies with between 20 and 49 workers have employees with disabilities in their template, compared to 82 per cent of businesses with between 100 and 199 workers.
Hazard: "A Joy"
To meet the Blues on Tuesday night (2045), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens do not hide the pleasure of this friendly party.
We will not dare to say that there was connivance among them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting next to each other, on the street of the auditorium of the Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have really made peace.
Five months after the gesture of resentment against Turkey, the Belgian electorate has no more than praise for it.
"I am very happy for Eden, for its progress and because it is Belgian."
"I want to move forward," Lille's front reply.
As for the contrast between their presentations on their team and selection, "is a set", it has been justified.
"In Lille, I am all year long, which does not apply to Belgium.
"I have to sit down."
Called to play against Romania on Friday night, taking into account this match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to finally "bright".
Don't forget about the placer.
He has been encouraging the Blues since he was seven years old, as well as during the victory campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been his fan," he says.
That will certainly strengthen especially the "particular" character of the meeting.
Especially because you will face " Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami), " , remember.
"We just faced a few years ago.
"Playing against them is always a joy."
Leekens has simply referred to pride.
"Glorious" for arguing "a game of gala."
"Golden" also for checking, as "neighbor", that France "reallys to be a very high-level team", about a year after Knysna's trauma.
"Laurent Blanc has done a tremendous job," he said with enthusiasm.
While Belgium will not attend the next European competition, the technician would be delighted to be able to share with the Blues... Brazil, in 2014.
"Our little Belgians are growing," he stressed.
"We are building something; players are ambitious, hungry.
"You will be able to see it in the next match." Including the match against France.
Portugal shows great confidence
Porto de Paulo Bento faces great optimism at the return party against Bosnia (22h00), to be held in Lisbon on Tuesday.
In the party, they lacked realism for both teams.
"When these 90 minutes pass, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already in Poland and Ukraine.
There is no doubt about it; the selection, which runs since September 2010, will qualify for the 2012 Eurocopa.
Indeed, only 90 minutes separate Portugal from happiness.
But there's a game to play and a rival, Bosnia, to win.
Given the party of departure (0-0), Friday in the Hell of Zenica, it seems clear that the thing is not decided.
Portugal dominated the game for more than an hour, yes, but could not mark the valuable goal that would have given him peace.
"It's a good result, but at the same time it takes a risk, since we haven't marked out of the house."
But at home, at the bright stage of the Lisbon Light, the Portuguese are convinced that they will pass, in front of a public who should be equally enthusiastic, even if it is clear that the party "is very equal", said an optimistic but lucid Bento.
"We hope the party is very equal, but we are fully convinced that we can take the lead," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We continue to have a 50% chance of participating in Eurocopa 2012", however, has relativized Carlos Queiroz's successor.
Friday's empathy in Bosnia obliges Portuguese to mark and win.
The Bosnians could get a empathy, although they also need to mark.
"It's a good result, but at the same time it takes a risk, since we haven't marked out of the house," says Bento.
"We're going to play against a team that has a great technical quality and that has players with a great individual quality," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will go with the intention of exerting, from the beginning, maximum pressure on the Bosnians to "don't leave them time to think".
A good idea, whenever, this time, it's realistic.
