Wells National Assembly members are concerned that they "look like maps"
Some members of the congregation are amazed at the proposal to change their name to MWP (Member of the Belgian Parliament).
This stems from plans to change the name of the congregation in the Belgian Parliament.
Members of the congregation from all over the political spectrum are concerned that this may be the subject of ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party Assembly said his party was concerned that "refuses with Twp and Pwp".
For those who don't speak Welsh: on the Welsh twp means "insane/crazy", and pwp means "like".
Plaid's member said the party "is not happy" and proposed alternatives.
A member of the conservative party said part his party is "free" for the change of name, but noted that the similarity of the words MWP and "muppet" is great.
In this context, the Welsh letter "w" is similar to the Yorkshire-English pronunciation of the letter "u".
The Commission of the People's Assembly, which is currently preparing a law to introduce name changes, said: "The final decision that any words to be named by members of the congregation will, of course, be made by the members themselves."
Wells' 2017 government law empowered Wells' congregation to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation on proposals that indicated great support for the appointment of the congregation as a Welski Parliament.
On the issue of the name of the members of the congregation, the Commission prefers members of the Belgian Parliament or WMP, but the MWP option has received the greatest support from public consultations.
Members of Parliament propose alternative options, but the struggle to reach consensus can cause headaches for the congregation's President, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a bill for changes within a few weeks.
The Reform Act will include other changes to the way the congregation works, including rules on disqualification of members of the congregation and the design of the committee system.
Members of the congregation will give the final vote on the question of their name when they discuss the law.
Macedonians will vote on a referendum to change the country's name.
Voters will vote on Sunday to change their country's name to "North Macedonia Republic".
The popular vote was put in an attempt to resolve the decade-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbour's name represents a right to its territory and has consistently opposed the country's EU and NATO membership attempts.
Macedonian President Gorge Ivanov, opponent of the name change plebiscite, said he would not take the vote into account.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say the name change is simply the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's voice suffocated as the churches in Harlem faced problems
"Historic, the old people I spoke to say there was a bar and a church at every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today, there's no one else."
He said the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"People are socializing differently today," he said.
"Bars are no longer living rooms in the villages where people go regularly".
And for the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of property will not last as long as the leaders think, "and sooner or later, they will return to the same place they started".
The churches, he added, can be replaced with residential buildings full of people who will not help the remaining shrines in the village.
"Most of the people who buy apartments in those buildings are white," he said, "and that is why the day when these churches will be completely closed is not likely to become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem to become the metropolis of the Blacks — the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin a decade later.
The original white-methodist congregation moved away in the 1930s.
The congregation of black people who practice their faith nearby takes over the property of the building.
St. Martin was taken over from the black congregation during the reign of priest John Howard Johnson, who led the boycott of the 125th street, the main market street in Harlem, who refused to hire or advance blacks.
The building was badly damaged in a fire in 1939, but since Father Johnson’s parish members had plans to rebuild it, they bought the trailer.
Priest David Johnson, father Johnson's son and heir to St. Martin's, proudly called the "poor bell".
The expert who played the chariot in July called it "cultural wealth" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of Michigan University, also noted that it was the first carione in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionicio A. Lind, who moved to the largest carione in the church of Riverside 18 years ago.
Mr. Meriveter said St. Martin didn't replace him.
What has happened in St. Martin over the past few months is a complicated story of architects and entrepreneurs, some brought by church leaders and some of the Episcopal Church.
The Church Committee – the church's leading body, composed of informal leaders – writes to the parish in July with concern that the parish will "seek to transfer the expenses" to the church committee, although the church committee was not involved in the employment of the architects and entrepreneurs who sent the parish.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the parish.
Shark injured a 13-year-old kid in diving for pillows in California
The shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while he was snooping for lobsters in California on the day of the opening of the autumn season, the authorities said.
The attack took place about 7 hours ago near Bikon Beach in Ensinitas.
Chad Hamel said about the KSWB TV in San Diego that he had knocked with his friends about an hour in the morning on Saturday morning when he heard the boy shout for help and then went to the group to help get him out of the water.
Hamel said that he first thought it was an excitement to catch a lobster, but then “he realized that he was shouting, 'I'm late!
You're late!'
The whole key bone was looking at him," Hamel said he noticed after he got to the boy.
"I used to get everyone out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!' said Hamel.
The boy was taken by helicopter to the Radi Children's Hospital in San Diego, he was taken to a critical state.
You don't know what kind of shark was responsible for the attack.
The beach rescuer, Captain Larry Gils, told the press conference that a couple of weeks earlier, a shark had been spotted in the area, but they decided that the shark was not dangerous.
Gils added that the victim suffered from traumatic injuries in the upper part of the torso.
Authorities closed the beach off the beach of Pontho in Casablanca to Swami in Ensinitas for 48 hours due to investigation and security.
Gils noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans are entering the beauty market in the United Kingdom
Sainsbury's takes over Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams with beauty rafts in the style of business houses full of professional assistants.
As part of the significant entry into the UK beauty market, which weighs 2.8 billion pounds, which continues to grow as fashion and household sales decline, large beauty rafts will be tested in 11 shops across the country and will be presented in more shops next year if they prove successful.
The investment in beauty appeared after supermarkets began looking for ways to use the space of the rafts that was once intended for televisions, microwave ovens and household appliances.
From Sainsbury's said for the first time they would double the offer of beauty funds to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweeterman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing brands L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with burnt areas similar to those in stores like Boots.
The supermarket also relaunchs its Boutique series of makeup, so most of the products are suitable for vegans, which is increasingly required by younger consumers.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop perfume dealer will test concessions in two Sainsbury stores, the first of which was opened in Creedon, South London, last week, and the second opened in Sally Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Buying online and the tendency to buy smaller amounts of food at a daily basis in local stores means that supermarkets need to do more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Cooper, Director of Sainsbury's, said stores will increasingly look like business houses because the supermarket chain is trying to fight against Aldi and Lidl discounts with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's began to put Argos' shops in hundreds of stores, and also introduced numerous Habitat stores after he bought both chains two years ago, which they said increased the sales of supplies and made the purchases more profitable.
The previous attempt at the supermarket to reorganize its beauty and pharmaceutical departments has been unsuccessful.
Sainsbury's tested a joint undertaking with Boots shortly after 2000, but co-operation ended after disagreeing on how to divide the profit from chemicals stores into supermarkets.
The new strategy emerged after Sainsbury's sold 281 of its pharmaceutical stores at Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
Lloyds was said to play a role in the plan, adding a series of luxury brands for skin care, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hix, Sainsbury's commercial director, said: "We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty rafts to improve the environment for our consumers.
We also invested in specially trained colleagues who would be available to offer advice.
Our brand series is designed to meet every need, and the attractive environment and convenient locations mean that we are now a mandatory destination for beauty that causes the old way to buy."
Peter Jones "infuriated" after Holly Willowby withdrew from a contract worth 11 million pounds
The star Peter Jones of Dragons Den left "infuriated" after TV leader Holly Willowby withdrew from an 11 million pounds contract with his brand-new life-style business to focus on her new deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willowby doesn't have time for their brand True for products and household supplements.
The couple's business is linked to the Goop brand in Guineat Paltrow.
This 37-year-old morning program leader told Instagram he was leaving.
Holly Willowby left Peter Jones, the Dragons Den star, withdrawing from their lucrative brand-new lifestyle business at the last minute to focus on her new big deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources say Jones was "infuriated" when the TV gold girl admitted during a tension meeting on Tuesday in the seat of his business empire in Marlov, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts – worth up to 1.5 million pounds – mean that she no longer have time to dedicate herself to their True brand for products and household supplements.
The business is linked to the Goop brand of Gunet Paltrow and was said to double Willowby's wealth by an estimated 11 million pounds.
As 37-year-old Willowby told Instagram that he was leaving True, Jones soon left Britain in one of his weekends.
One source states: “Truly was always at the top of Holly’s priorities.
It was to be her long - term future that she would send in the next two decades.
Her decision to withdraw all affected caught them absolutely unwilling.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday was so close to the opening.
In Marlow's seat there's a warehouse full of products ready for sale."
Experts believe that leaving this morning's programme guide, which is one of Britain's most paid stars, can cost the company millions because of large investments in handkerchiefs and candles products, as well as clothing and household products, and because of the potential for further postponement.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willowby, the mother of three children, and wife Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Cap for ten years.
Willowby founded Truly with Cap in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined them as president in March.
The two go on vacation together, and Jones has a 40% share of Baldwin's television production company.
Willowby should become an ambassador of the M&S brand and replace Ant McPartlin as a leader of I'm A Celebrity (I'm a star) on ITV.
A source close to Jones yesterday said "We are not commenting on his business ventures".
A Serious Conversation “And Then We fell in love ”
He was joking about the criticism he would receive from the media about commenting that some would consider him "unprecedented" and because he is so positive for North Korea's leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said with his voice recast as "the news representative".
"I didn't give up anything."
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump assessed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards the denuclearisation of North Korea.
But negotiations on denuclearization have been postponed.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told the world leaders of the UN's General Assembly that the North does not see a "adequate response" from the United States to North Korea's early disarmament movements.
Instead, he said, the United States continues with sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump takes a much more optimistic view of his speech at the meeting.
"We agree perfectly with North Korea," he said.
"We should have been at war with North Korea.
Millions of people will die.
Now we have this great cooperation."
He said that his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim brought positive results – they ended up testing missiles, helped free hostages, and the remaining American soldiers returned home.
And he defended his unusual approach to talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It is easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to enter this full arena, we will have 200 people standing right here," Trump said, pointing to the crowd before him.
Cunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroyed the island and took hundreds of lives
As a result of the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population was displaced, there was no notice of an elemental disadvantage, which is a prerequisite for obtaining international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they were very clear that they did not seek international assistance, so it is a challenge," Mr Sumbung said.
Although "Save the Children" is a team that will travel to Palau, it is not yet certain that foreign personnel will be able to work on the ground.
Mr. Sotopo, spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palau to see if international agencies will be allowed to contribute to aid efforts.
Because of the earthquakes that constantly hit Indonesia, the country remains desperate for the wrath of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not a common sight on other coasts.
The obvious lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palau, though a warning was issued, probably contributed to the loss of life.
In the best time, traveling through many islands of Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok for the treatment of earthquake victims headed for Pala, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Vidodo's election campaign was the improvement of Indonesia's old infrastructure and he spent a lot of money on roads and roads.
But the lack of funds covered Mr. Yoko's administration in the eyes of the reelections next year.
Mr. Yoko also faces pressure from sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority accepted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed, and tens of thousands of them were displaced from their homes while Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets, using swords, bows, and arrows and other old weapons.
Look: Daniel Starridge of the Liverpool team at once against Chelsea
Daniel Starridge saved Liverpool from losing Prime Minister's goal at 89 minutes on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Xerdan Shakiri gave Starridge the ball about 30 yards from Chelsea's target, while his team lost 1 - 0.
He moved the ball to the left before heading to the distant article.
The ball moved high over the sixteenth as it turned toward the right corner of the network.
The ball finally passed through the jumpy Keppa Arisabalga and fell into the net.
"He was just trying to get to that position, get to the ball, and players like Shak always give as much as possible, so I just tried to create as much time as possible," Starridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante getting closer and just touching her and not thinking much about it and just shooting."
Chelsea took 1 - 0 at half an hour after the Belgian star One Hazard hit the target in 25 minutes.
The attacker of the "blues" turned five back to Mateo Kovacic in that attack, before throwing the ball almost to half the ground, and then sprinted into the middle of Liverpool.
They quickly gave up Kovacic in the middle of the field.
He then directed the missile, leading Hazard in the sixteenth century.
Hazard passed the defense and finished off on the network of the far-off left-legged article next to Alison Becker in Liverpool.
Liverpool will fight Napoleon in the group phase of the Champions League at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Nepal, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton at the WEFA League of Europe at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia has risen to 832
The number of earthquakes and tsunami victims in Indonesia rose to 832, the country's disaster agency said early Sunday.
It was reported that many people are trapped in the ruins of buildings that fell into the 7.5 earthquake that hit Friday and caused 20-point waves, the agency's spokesman Sotopo Purvo Nugroho said at a press conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was piled up from the ruins of the ruined buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old murder suspect after a woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been initiated since a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merciside this morning.
Forty-four-year-old woman was found at 7.55 with Grayson Moves stab wounds on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested in suspicion of murder.
The police asked the people in the area who saw or heard something to make statements.
Detective Inspector Brian Ohagen said: "The investigation is at an early stage, but it would ask people who were near John Street in Birkenheid, who saw or heard something suspicious about contacting us.
I also want to ask people, especially the taximen, who might have recorded something on the cameras from the cars to contact us because they may have information that is important to our investigation."
Police spokesperson that the woman whose body was found was a local resident of Birkenhead and was found in an facility.
In the afternoon, friends who think they know the woman came to the crime scene to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is underway, and as the police have said, they will inform the victim's closest people.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Moves just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police told him it wasn't allowed to go in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
The residents were now told that hours would pass before they could return.
Someone heard a cop tell a man that the whole area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman in tears appeared at the scene.
She keeps saying, "It's so terrible."
At 2.00 p.m., two police vans were on the border, and another one was outside.
Numerous policemen stood in the border and watched the apartments.
Anyone who has information is asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact anonymous fighters against crime at 0800 555 111, quoting a record 247 of September 30.
Parliament's Cromwell's statue has become the newest memory blow in the karan for "rewriting history"
Her persecution would be poetic justice for his "Taliban" destruction of many cultural and religious artifacts produced by his fanatic Puritan followers.
But Cromwell's Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "crazy" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the current debate on the removal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell’s figure before the Chamber of Westminster would become a goal.
The iconoclast of English civil war was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Maybe the wrong Cromwell will sacrifice himself for the works of his ancestors, Thomas, in the previous century.
The beautiful presentation by Sir William Hamo Thornecroft of Cromwell is evidence of the 19th century’s view and part of the story of a figure that many believe is still worth celebrating.
Mr. Goldsmith said about The Sunday Telegraph: "Many consider, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, that Cromwell is a defender of parliament from outside pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether this is an entirely accurate presentation is the subject of continued historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individual recognized figure that represents one side of that division.
His achievements as Lord-protector are also worth celebrating and mentioning."
Pig-killer broke up and killed a Chinese farmer
Pigs attacked and killed a market farmer in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by the name of "Juan", was found dead with the skin artery, covered in blood near the market in Liupansui in the province of Gicou, South China, said Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to put pigs' vaccines on a pig farm on May 30, 2005, in Xining, Kinghai Province, China.
He apparently traveled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs to the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door from the neighboring piggy.
He declared that there was a great plague of blood on the hip.
The forensic investigation confirmed that the five hundred and fifty-pound fork broke the farmer and killed him, according to the report.
"My cousin's foot was bloody and broken," said the cousin, named "Wu", according to a quote in Guyang's evening news.
The picture from the security camera showed Juan entering the market at 4.40 p.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The life that killed the man did not belong to John or his cousin.
The market manager said about the evening news that the pig was locked up to prevent other people from attacking, while the police collect evidence on the spot.
Juan's family and market leaders are allegedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rarely, cases of pigs that attacked humans have been reported in the past.
In 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, causing critical injuries to the husband.
Ten years earlier, a 650 - pound [650 kg] pig stuck a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife drove the animal out.
After a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as an "activator".
"They're just playing."
They want to grizzly, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone intentionally.
You just have to give them enough respect," he said.
Residues of Hurricane Rosa will bring fertile rain to the southwest of the United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves through the cold waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring rain showers to the north of Mexico and the southwest of the United States in the next few days.
Rosa brought 85 mph winds, a storm of 1 out of 5 o'clock east time on Sunday and was located 385 miles southwest of Punt Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, depression is beginning to develop over the Pacific Ocean and is moving east towards the western coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the peninsula of Lower California on Monday, as a tropical storm will begin to import large tropical moisture north into the southwestern part of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in the parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then the tropical moisture with the approaching depression will produce abundant rains in the southeast in the next few days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause sudden floods, floods of ruins, and possible landslides in the desert.
The great tropical moisture will cause storms that in some places will be about 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in the parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
A maximum of 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in part of the southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
Sudden floods are possible because of the rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the nature of the tropical rain.
In particular, it is recommended not to go to the desert on foot at the possibility of tropical rain.
Some rain may cause the canyons to become stormy rivers, and storm storms will bring local strong winds and dust.
The coming depression will bring local torrential rain on parts of the South California coast.
Possible rains of over half an inch, which can cause rivers of ruins and slippery roads.
This would be the first rain in the region of their wet season.
Temporary tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early in the morning on Monday, before the rain spreads later on Monday and Tuesday.
Some rain will spread in "four corners" on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
In October, intense temperature changes are expected everywhere in the United States due to Arctic cooling, but tropical areas remain high.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature of short distances.
An excellent example of a dramatic difference in temperatures will be in the central parts of the United States on Sunday.
There is almost 20 degrees difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and between St. Louis and De Mon, Iowa.
In the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to regenerate and expand.
Most of the central and eastern parts of the United States are expected to have a warm beginning of October with high temperatures of 80 degrees from the south plains to the southeast.
New York City can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long - term forecast points to the possibility of average temperatures for the eastern parts of the United States, up to the first half of October.
More than 20 million people saw Brad Cavano’s hearing
More than 20 million people saw the exciting testimony on Thursday of the nominated high court candidate Brett Kavano and the woman who accused him of a sexual attack that allegedly occurred in the 1980s, Christina Blassi Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the uninterrupted political situation continued, with speakers interrupting regular reverse programmes last Friday: Jeff Flake, Senator of Arizona, concluded an agreement with the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation into the charges.
Ford told the senate's judicial committee that it was 100 percent sure that Cavano took her drunk and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavano, in his passionate witnessing, said that it was 100 percent certain that it did not happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people, as Nielsen said, saw it on Friday.
The company counted average visibility of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available for the other networks they showed, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen's usually having trouble measuring people looking at offices.
To make it look better, it's a audience with a size similar to a playoff game in football or the awards of the film academy.
The Fox News channel, whose leaders strongly attacked Cavano's appointment, led all networks with 5.69 million viewers on average during the day-to-day hearing, said Nielsen.
ABC was the second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was a central figure in the Friday drama.
After a moderate announcement by the Republican Office that he would vote for Kavano, CNN and CBS cameras captured him as protestors calling him Friday morning while he was trying to get into the elevator for hearing the judicial committee.
He stood there with his eyes down for a few minutes while he was being beaten, and all of that was transferred alive to CNN.
"They're standing here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth of the earth"?
He was told, "You have power, and so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office issued a statement and said, before closing the elevator door, that there would be more to say during the committee hearing.
Cable and radio networks all covered hours later, when the judicial committee was to vote to advance the nomination of Cavano in the voting Senate.
But Flake said it would only do so if there was an agreement with the FBI that they would consider charges against the nominated next week, which was requested by the minority of Democrats.
Flake was partly convinced by the conversation with his friend, democratic Senator Chris Kuns.
After the conversation with Kuns and several senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's choice was of great significance, because it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve the Cavano without investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into charges against Kavano.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "playing politics" about the coast
Prime Minister Teresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union for "playing politics" with the British future and undermining national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Teresa May arrives at the conservative party conference in Birmingham, Britain on 29 September 2018.
In another interview right up to her main page of the paper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson attacked her so-called "Checkers" plan for Breggsit, saying the proposal that Britain and the EU should collect loan costs is "totally absurd".
Shooting Wade Sims: Police arrested suspect Diton Simson for the death of a sportsman at the state university of Louisiana
Police arrested a suspect in Wade Sims' 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University.
Twenty-year-old Diton Simpson has been arrested and imprisoned for second-degree murder, Baton Rose said.
Authorities posted a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, the WAFB partner of CBS said.
After being interrogated by Simpson, the police reported that he admitted that he shot Wade and killed him.
His bail is set at $350,000, the lawyer said.
The office of the pathologist at the parish of East Baton Rouge announced a preliminary report on Friday, where the cause of death was shot in the head to the neck.
The Department of Thank you to the Louisiana State Police Refugee Unit, the State Police Criminalist Laboratory, the South University Police, and the citizens of the area for the aid they provided in the investigation that led to the arrest.
The Athletic Director at the State University of Louisiana thanked the police for her "activities in pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6:6th rate pool grew in Baton Rose, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the state university of Louisiana.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 caught balls per game in the last season.
On Friday morning, coach of the basketball team at Louisiana State University, Will Wade, said the team was "destroyed" and "in shock" since Sims' death.
"This is what you're worried about," the coach said.
Volcano threw ashes on Mexico City
Throwing ashes out of the Volcano Popocatepetl reached the southern settlements of Mexico’s capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned Mexicans not to go to the volcano on Sunday after starting their activities in the crater and 183 gas and ashes emissions were registered for 24 hours.
The center was tracking more tattoos and shakes.
Social media images show a thin layer of ashes on cars in the inhabited places of Mexico City, such as Socimilko.
Geophysicists observed an increased activity on the volcano located 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital after a 7.1 earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Gojo has been active since 1994.
Police clashed with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence protestors clashed with the police for public order and peace and after thousands joined the rival demonstrations to mark the first year of the polarising vote for the secluded Catalonia.
A group of masked supporters of separatists detained by the police for public order and peace threw eggs and colors right, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that would normally be full of tourists.
Later that day they also beat fights, and the police used sticks to beat fights.
For more than a few hours, the independence groups called "No forgetting, No forgiveness," and on the other hand, trade union protestors called "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries in protests, said local press.
The tensions remain high in the region that wants independence, one year after Madrid characterized the 1 October referendum as illegal, but it was celebrated by separatist Catholics.
The majority voted for independence, although the outcome was small because of the boycott by the people who opposed separation.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police violently tried to stop the vote at the polling stations in the region.
Independence groups camped overnight on Friday to prevent demonstrations to support the national police.
The demonstrations took place, but they had to change the route.
Sixty-eight annual electrician Narcissus Termes, who participated in a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer hopes that Catalonia has a chance to gain independence.
"We lived one of our best moments last year.
I watched my parents cry with joy because they can vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Although they held a vital but close victory of the regional elections last December, the Catalan independence parties were struggling to keep the dynamics this year with many of their most famous leaders or in self-elected persecution or imprisonment awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Forty-two-year-old mechanic Hoan Puig, recording the police support protest, said the conflict was supported by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting stronger," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Hunkeras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who are in prison before last year's trial, announced that he will run the European Parliament elections next year.
"Being a candidate for European elections is the best way to condemn the regression of democratic values and the repression we saw by the Spanish government," he said.
Londoners: Men arrested after crashing a car into a house

At one point it could be fired with a self - shot shot at the car.
Menga’s Battle Brings a 1 - 0 victory against the Rangers
Dolly Menga's First Goal for Livingston Provides Victory
The advanced Livingston wrote the Rangers signing Stephen Gerard, with his only two losses in 18 matches, as the manager of the Ibrox Club.
The Dolly Menga strike turned out to be significant as Gary Hold's country rose to a level with Hybrid in second position.
Gerard's country was defeated in the season and will face the Harts leaders next week, behind which eight points remain.
Before that, Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in Europe the League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston continues unbeatable in the division during six matches, and Coach Holt has not yet faced defeat since Kenny Miller’s replacement last month.
Livingston missed the chance against the harsh guests
Holt's team was supposed to spend a long time before they gave the target, and their directness caused many Rangers problems.
Scott Robinson tried, but he pulled the attack around the goal, and then Alan Litgo could only direct his efforts far away after he slided the blow with Craig Halket's head over the goal.
The guests were pleased to have the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could create problems with the actions they set up.
And that's exactly how the judgmental goal came.
Rangers missed a free blow, and Livingston got the opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson set up Menga together, who only gave the target from the center of the sixteenth century.
So far the Rangers have dominated the possession of the ball, but they couldn't break down the housekeeper's defenses, so the stripper Liam Kelly didn't play most of the time.
The scheme continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos performed rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman failed to score because of the Rangers' skill, Alan McGregor, and Litgo took the ball away from another set action on Livingston.
Livingston's sixteen-year-old was constantly passed and constantly defended, while two criminal demands – after Halket's dispute over Glen Middleton's replacement and one for hand-playing – were rejected.
Livingston's Phenomenal – Analysis
Alasder Lamonte of BBC Scotland in the Tony Macaroni arena
Phenomenal game and result for Livingston
They were excellent, continuing to surpass the expectations of this uphill path.
Their style and character of playing barely changed after their return to the top, but much of the credit goes to Holt about the way he galvanized the team from his coming.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halket was outstanding in managing a super-organized defense, but Menga still held Conor Goldson and Joe Voral ready.
The Rangers still lacked inspiration.
As well as ever under Gerard's leadership, they are now lagging behind with the same standards.
Their last game was weak – only once they were able to open the homes – and it is a little awareness of the Rangers, who found themselves in the middle of the table.
Erdogan received mixed reception in Colony
There were smiles and blue skies on Sunday (September 29th) when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which is aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
They got worse because of problems involving human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then turned to Colony to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to Turkey's largest population outside Turkey.
The police quoted security reasons to prevent the gathering of a crowd of 25,000 people in front of the mosque, but many supporters came nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of protestors against Erdogan, many of them Kurdi, also explained, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
Protesters protest the division of the visitor famous as a hero of some German Turks and criticized as an autocrat of others.
Traffic accident on the road in Deptford: a bicycle driver died in a car crash
A bicycle driver died after a car crash in London.
The crash took place near the crossroads of the streets of Besyoud and Evelyn, a major trafficker in Deptford, in the southeast of the city in about 10.15 BST.
The car driver stopped and came to the rescue, but the man died at the scene of the accident.
The crash occurred a few months after the death of another biker in a traffic accident on Childers Street where the driver fled, about a mile from the crash on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said officials are working to identify the husband and inform his family.
Roadblocks are set and buses are redirected and drivers are recommended to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: six policemen injured in trouble
Six prison policemen were injured in riots in the male prison with a high level of security, said the prison's office.
The riots broke out in HMP Long Martin, Warsaw, about 9.30 BST on Sunday and are still ongoing.
Specialists from Tornado unit were brought to resolve the unrest, which includes eight prisoners and is confined to one wing.
Police are being treated for minor injuries in the area.
Prison spokesperson said: “Specially trained prison personnel were directed to deal with the ongoing incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We don't tolerate violence in our prisons, and those responsible for it will be handed over to the police and can spend extra time behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin has 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was announced that the prison governor received hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And last October, public order and peace police were called to prison to deal with serious disturbances in which staff were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (can be useful for dry areas)
A tropical depression rarely occurs to hit Arizona, but it is likely that it will happen at the beginning of next week when the remaining force of Hurricane Rosa will pass through the desert southwest region, risking sudden flooding.
The State Weather Station has already issued alerts for possible sudden floods on Monday and Tuesday for West Arizona, as well as to south and east Nevada, Southeast California and South Eastern, including the cities Phoenix, Flegstaff, Las Vegas, and Suite Lake City.
Rosa is expected to move straight through Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching late Monday with rain.
The Phoenix State Meteorological Station tweeted that “only ten tropical cyclones had maintained the status of a tropical storm or depression of 200 miles [50 km] of Phoenix!
Katarina (1967) was a hurricane of 40 miles from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the State Centre for Hurricanes predict 2 to 4 inches of rain, with isolated quantities up to 6 inches in the work of Mongols in Arizona.
Other areas of the desert southwestern region, including the central parts of the Carpest Mountains and the Great Basin, will probably have 1 to 2 inches, with isolated places up to 4 inches of rain.
For those outside the risk areas for sudden floods, the rain of Rosa can be a blessing because the region is hit by drought.
Although the flood is a very serious problem, part of this rain is likely to be of benefit because the southwest region is hit by drought.
According to the U.S. Drying Authority, almost 40 percent of Arizona faces extreme drought, the second highest category," weather.com said.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa has led to earth’s defences everywhere on the subcontinent of Lower California in Mexico.
Rosa, still with a hurricane strength on Sunday morning with winds of up to 85 miles an hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moves north with 12 miles an hour.
The storm comes in contact with the Pacific waters and decreases.
Therefore, rains are expected in Mexico with a tropical storm in the afternoon or evening hours on Monday.
The rains in parts of Mexico may be intense and pose a significant risk of floods.
"A rain is expected from 3 to 6 inches from Lower California to northwest Sonora, with a possible maximum of 10 inches of rain," weather.com said.
Rosa will then move north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching Arizona's border in early morning hours on Tuesday as a tropical depression, which will then move up through Arizona and South Juta until late evening hours on Tuesday.
"The main danger that is expected of Rosa or her remains are the abundant rains in Lower California, southwest Sonora and the U.S. desert southwestern region," the Hurricane State Centre said.
These rains are expected to bring life-threatening sudden floods and floods of ruins, as well as landslides in mountain regions.
Midsummer Norton attack: four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested in suspicion of attempted murder since 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the area of Excellior Terrace in Midsummer Norton about 4.00 BST on Saturday.
He's taken to the hospital and is in "stable" condition.
One 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and one 20-year-old were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset police said.
The police have asked if anyone has photos of a cell phone from the case, to step up.
tramp said Kavano "has suffered the greatest evil and anger" of the Democratic Party.
"A voice for Judge Kavano is a voice to reject the most harsh and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a gathering in Willing, West Virginia.
tramp said Kavano "has suffered the worst of evil and anger" of the Democratic Party during his nomination.
Kavano witnessed before the convention on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying Christine Blassie Ford’s accusations that he had been assaulted by sex several decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford testified to the hearing and her accusations.
The president said on Saturday that "Americans saw the brilliance, quality and courage" of Kavano that day.
"The positive vote for Judge Kavano is a vote to confirm one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an unsurpassed public service record," he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly mentioned Kavano's nomination as he spoke about the significance of Republicans' outcome in the early elections.
"Five more weeks to one of the most important elections of our time.
I'm not running, but I'm really fighting," he said.
"That's why I'm everywhere and I'm fighting for excellent candidates."
Trump said the Democrats have a mission to "give resistance and prevent it".
The first key vote for the nomination of Cavano in the Senate is expected not later than Friday, an older GOP leader told CNN.
Hundreds of dead in Indonesia's earthquake and tsunamis, and the total number of victims is increasing
At least 384 people died, many were taken away from the huge waves that hit the beaches, when a great earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in Palu on Friday when waves of six feet [6 m] (18 m] high hit the shore of the sunset, bringing many to safety and ruining everything on their way.
After an earthquake of 7.5, it hit the tsunami.
"When the tsunami threat came yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and they didn't run away right away, so they became victims," Sotopo Purvo Nugroho, the spokesman of the BNPB agency for disaster relief in Indonesia in a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, dragged cars, trees, houses, hits everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami traveled through the open sea at 800 km/h (497 miles/h) before it hit the coast.
Some people climbed a tree to escape the tsunami and survive, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palau.
Air photographs published by the disaster agency have shown many destroyed buildings and shops, torn down and broken bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The ensuing earthquakes continued to shake the coastal city on Sunday.
The earthquake series was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesia Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said that the energy released from the massive earthquake on Friday was about 200 times greater than the energy released from the nuclear bomb in Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographical position of the city, which lies at the end of the long, narrow shore, may increase the size of the tsunami, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as "bundling" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had collapsed.
Some victims' bodies were found trapped under the shell of ruined buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 disappeared.
Nugroho said that victims and damage could increase along the coast of 300 km (190 miles) north of Pala, in the area called Dongala, which is closer to the earthquake epicenter.
Communication "was completely damaged without any information" by Dongala, Nugroho said.
"There are more than 300,000 people living," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers are heading towards the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse," they said.
The agency was widely criticised on Saturday for not informing her that the tsunami hit Palau, although the authorities said the waves came about at the same time as the warning was issued.
In an amateur photo shared with social media, a man on the top floors of the building can be heard as shouting out loud, warning people down the street about the approaching tsunami.
In a few minutes, a wall of water runs into the shore, carrying buildings and cars.
Reuters couldn't confirm the video right away.
Earthquakes and tsunamis have caused power cuts off communications around Pala, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue activities.
The military began sending cargo planes to Jakarta and other cities, the authorities said, but the evacuated people are still desperately in need of food and other basic needs.
The city's airport was reopened for help only and will remain closed until October.
President Yoko Vidodo was planning to visit the evacuation centers in Palau on Sunday.
The total number of tsunami victims in Indonesia has risen to over 800.
It's really bad.
While World Vision staff from Dongala arrived safely in the city of Palu, where the employees were sheltered in shelters of cows in their office yard, they walked through desert scenes, Mr. Dosseb said.
"They told me they saw many houses destroyed," he said.
It's very bad.
Even as relief teams began dark attempts to start disaster relief, some complained that foreign aid experts were prevented from traveling to Palau.
According to Indonesian laws, financial support, supplies and foreign personnel can only begin to come if the site of the disaster is declared a national disaster zone.
That has not yet happened.
"It is still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Ariani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"What the government will say, 'Okay, this is a national disaster', we can accept international assistance, but still no status".
As the second night of the earthquake and tsunami in Palau fell on Friday, friends and families of the missing ones were still hoping that their loved ones would be the miracles that would relieve the black story of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been stuck under a shuttle for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, a coach of the Indonesian state team for paragliding, trained two of the missing paragliders for Asian games, which ended early this month in Indonesia.
The others who are trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, added Mr. Mandaghi, were his students.
"As a senior in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon said how, when she began to circulate news about the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel in the community of paragliders, he desperately sent messages to WhatsApp to the Palo contestants, who participated in the beach festival.
But his messages ended only with a gray sign of stoning, instead of a son.
"I think that means messages are not delivered," he said.
Stealers stole $26,750 when they filled the ATM at the "New Port of Cay"
The thieves stole 26.750 dollars on Friday morning from a Brink's employee who added a ATM to Newport's office, according to Newport's press statement.
The car driver celebrated the ATM in the entertainment complex and prepared to supplement it with money, wrote Detective Denis McCarthy in his statement.
While he was busy, another man "run behind Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money destined for delivery.
The Witnesses noticed more suspects fleeing the scene of the crime, according to the statement, but the police did not give a specific number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone who has any information about their identities should contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanje West: Rapper changed his name to Jay
Rapper Kanje West has changed his name to Yah.
The change announced on Twitter on Saturday. He wrote: "The universe was once known as the Cannie West".
Forty-one year-old West wore his crosshairs for a while and used his crosshairs for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change took place just before his visit to Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to publish his new Yandhi album.
He would replace the singer Ariana Grande on the show that had to give up "emotive reasons," the creator of the show said.
Although he uses it as a shortcut to his current professional name, West previously said the word has religious significance for him.
"I think 'yes' is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there it means 'you'," West said at the beginning of this year, discussing the title of his album with Radio Director Big Boy.
"What means I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
He left Canaan, which means the only one, only Jehovah, a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, everything.
The album is more of a show of who we are."
He's one of the many famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs is known as Paf Dedi, Pi Didi or Didi, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love (Love and Brother Love).
Former West co-worker Jay Zee also uses his name with or without a drawing and all the big letters.
AMLO from Mexico promises not to use the army against civilians
Mexico's CEO Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised that he would never use military force against civilians while the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of blood repression on students.
Lopez Obrador vowed on Saturday in Tlateloko Plaza that "he will never use the army to repress the Mexican people".
The military shot peaceful demonstrators at the square on October 2, 1968, killing even 300 people at the time when leftist student movements took root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by giving monthly help to those studying and opening more free public universities.
He said the unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attracted young people to criminal gangs.
The United States needs to double the financing of artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double its research resources in the field, the investor and practitioner told AI, Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Commentaries arrived after various parts of the US government made statements about artificial intelligence, even though the US did not have a formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year: it strives to be number 1 in innovations for artificial intelligence by 2030.
"The adoption of the artificial intelligence budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are so far ahead of the United States, and we are looking for the next discovery in artificial intelligence," Li said.
The duplication of funds can double the chances that the next major achievement in the AI area will make the United States, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published a month ago by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, Director General of Sinovation Ventures, who invests in one of the most sophisticated companies for AI in China, Face++.
In the 80s of the University of Carnegie Melon he worked on an artificial intelligence system that won the highest-ranked American suit player, and later was director of Microsoft Research and president of the Google branch in China.
Are you grateful for previous US government technology competitions as the challenge of the Agency's robotics for advanced defence research projects and asked when it will be next, in order to help identify the following visionaries.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get state grants, Li said.
"It's not China that took academic leaders, it's corporations," Li said.
Facebook, Google and other technological companies have employed university experts to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy can also help the United States improve its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think "green cards" should automatically be offered to science doctors by artificial intelligence," he said.
China's State Council issued its plan to develop the future generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
The Chinese National Foundation for Natural Sciences funds people in academic institutions similar to the way the National Science and Other Government Organizations Foundation distributes money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of work is lower in China, Li said.
Earlier this year, the US Defence Ministry established a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, which should include partners from industry and the academy, and the White House announced the establishment of an Oval Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion for the initiative called "AI Next".
As for NSF, they currently invest more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, US legislation requiring the establishment of a National Commission for the Safety of Artificial Intelligence has not taken effect for months.
Macedonians vote on a referendum on whether to change the country's name
People in Macedonia voted on a Sunday's referendum on whether to change its name to "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would resolve a decade-long dispute with Greece that blocked its membership requirements in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that its northern neighbour's name represents a right to its territory and veto its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the change will undermine the ethnic identity of most of the Orthodox population of Macedonia.
President George Ivanov said he would not vote on the referendum and the boycotting campaign doubted whether the outcome would meet the minimum 50 per cent required for the referendum's validity.
The issue of the referendum tab was: "You have given NATO and the EU membership with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece".
Name change supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that it is worth the price to be paid to enable bodies such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the country's future, for young people in Macedonia to live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us," said 79-year-old Oliver Georgievska in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, enough members of parliament said they would respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
A two-thirds majority in parliament is needed to change the name.
The state electoral commission said there were no reports of irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, the outcome stood at 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent in previous parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66 per cent of registered voters gave their vote.
"I came out to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Jose Tanevski, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dusko gave their vote at the Macedonian referendum on change in the name of the country, which will pave the way for the country to enter NATO and the European Union on September 30, 2018 in Strumica.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavadarkov was preparing a small scene and chairs in front of tents set by people who would boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to enter with our heads raised high, not from the back," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we still have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring much needed investment in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 per cent.
"I believe that the majority will be because more than 80 percent of our citizens are EU and NATO," Zaev said after he voted.
He said the result "yes" would be "firm for our future".
The poll, published last Monday by the Institute of Political Research of Macedonia, showed that between 30 and 43 per cent of voters will participate in the referendum, which is under the required stand-by.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonian television Telma, showed that 57 per cent of voters plan to vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent will vote with yes.
In order for the referendum to be successful, the outcome should be 50 percent plus one vote.
The unsuccessful referendum would be the first serious blow to the policy of the pro-Western government after they came to power last May.
Look: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City spent all of Brighton's defenses on target.
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling soon conquered Briton's defense in the 2 - 0 victory for Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made his shot look so simple in the 65th minute.
The Argentine attacker was given an average of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He quickly passed between three Bryton's defense players before he entered the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four "greens".
He surrounded a defensive player before he ran a few others to work on the 16th of Brighton's.
He then left him on Sterling.
The British attacker used his first arrival to return the ball to Aguero, who with his right foot beat the Briton's hero, Matthew Ryan, with the only hit on the right-hand side of the network.
"Aguero has leg problems," City Manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about playing 55 - 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky to have you naked at that moment."
But the initial advantage of the "heavenly blues" gave Sterling in the fight for the Prime Minister's League.
The target came in 29 minutes.
Aguero got a long ball in Brighton's territory in that game.
He sent a beautiful direct ball along the left-hand side to Liroy Shane.
Shane touched her a few times before he took Sterling to the remote station.
The attack on "heaven blues" brought the ball into the net before it went out.
City will fight Hoffenheim in a match of the League of Champions in 12.55 on Tuesday in the Rain Nekar Arena, Germany.
Shercer wants to play a spy against Rockys.
Since Nashnels was eliminated from the playoff fight, there was no reason to force another start.
But always the competitive Shercer hopes to stand in the central square on Sunday against Colorado Rockis, but only if there is still implications for Rockis' team playoff, which are leading a match in front of Los Angeles Dodgers at the Western National League.
Rocky's team had at least a "joker" for a 5 - 2 victory over Nashnels on Friday night, but they are still struggling to determine their place in the first division.
"Although we don't play for anything, at least we can throw it knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team will probably play at the highest level of any time I'm going to face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in that?"
Neshnels still has to publish a week - long starter, but he reportedly tends to let Shercer get into such a situation.
Shercer, who will start after 34th time, trained throwing on Thursday and would normally throw off on Sunday.
Washington's right is 18 – 7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strike-points in 220 2/3 inches this season.
Trump meeting in West Virginia
The president indirectly mentioned the situation about Brett Cavano's election to the Supreme Court as he spoke about the importance of the outcome of the republicans of the previous elections.
"All we've done so far will be put on the dice in November.
Five more weeks to one of the most important elections of our time.
This is one of the big, big -- I'm not running, but I'm really fighting, so I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump continues, "You see these terrible, terrible groups of democrats, you see what's happening right now.
And they are determined to regain their power by using all the resources available to them, you see wickedness, inequity.
They don't care who they hurt, when they have to walk through to get power and control, that's what they want power and control, but we won't give them."
The Democrats, he said, have a mission to "give resistance and prevent".
"And you see it in the last four days," he said, calling the democracies "enraged, angry, unfair and false".
He mentioned Senator Diana Fynstein from the ranks of the Democrats set up by the Senate's Judicial Committee, on behalf of which the public responded with complaints of contempt.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you publish the document?
Oh, oh, what.
No, no, no, wait a minute – it was a very bad speech on the body – the worst speech on the body I've ever seen."
Laborists no longer accept different opinions.
Those who express their opinion are not tolerated
When momentum activists in my local party voted against me, it was almost no surprise.
However, I am only the last in the ranks of members of parliament from the labyrinth party to which we were told that we are not welcome – just because he expresses his opinion.
My colleague-parliamentary Joan Ryan received a similar treatment because he took a decisive stand against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship movement criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbin.
The importance of responsible economic policy, for national security, for Europe, ironically similar issues that Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
The announcement of the Eastern Laborist Party's meeting in Notingam stated that "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive".
In most of my eight years as a member of the parliament of the Laborist Party, the council meetings Friday night were just like that.
Unfortunately today, it is not the tone of most meetings, and the promise of "fear, gentle" policy has long been forgotten, if it really has ever begun.
It is increasingly evident that different opinions are not tolerated in the laboratory party, and each opinion is judged whether it is acceptable for the party’s leaders.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues with whom I thought we had previously shared a similar political opinion began to expect to change my thinking completely and to take positions that otherwise would never take them, whether it was about national security or the EU's internal market.
Whenever I speak in public, and it really doesn't matter what I'm going to say, there's a critical abuse of the social media calling for condemnation, denial of central politics, telling me I shouldn't be in the lab party.
And I'm not the only one with this experience.
Actually, I know I'm more lucky than some of my colleagues because the comments that are directed to me are usually political.
I have a great deal of respect for professionalism and the determination of those colleagues who face numerous sexual or racist abuses every day, but they never withdraw.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era in politics is how the level of abuse has become normal.
Jeremy Corbin claimed last week that the lab party should practice culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer accept different opinions and with every request for "no confidence" or change in selection rules, the party becomes more narrow.
I have received many advice over the past two years, telling me to keep my head down, not be so loud and then "all will be fine."
But that's not why I came into politics.
32 years ago, when I joined the Laborist Party as a student, provoked by the concerns of the Thacher government that literally left my school to collapse, I struggled to improve public services for those who were most needed, whether as a local adviser or a government minister.
I've never hidden my policy, including in the last elections.
No one in East Notingham could be confused in any way about my political positions and areas of disagreement with current leadership.
To those who supported Friday’s request, all I want to say is that when the country is forced to join the Bregzit, which will harm households, businesses and our public services, I don’t understand the desire to waste my time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labor Party.
But I have a message not for Notingam Momentum, but for my voters, whether they are members of the laboratory party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no matter how condemnational threats or political opportunism I will survive, nothing will deter me from sharing in the way I think it is in the best interest of all of you.

Ear 38 - 17 Melrose: Unbeatable Ears Go to the Top
The two late points may have changed the final result somewhere, but there is no doubt that Ear earned the triumph in this wonderful fun game on the day of the Scottish Rgby Championship.
They are now at the top of the table, the only unbeatable side of the ten.
In the end, everything is due to their superior defenses, as well as to their well - used opportunities, which the home team brought, and coach Peter Murchi has the right to be satisfied.
"We have been tested through our competitions so far and we are still invincible, so I must be happy," he said.
Robin Kristi of Melrose said: "The Fire for Air, they have made better use of their chances than we have".
Grant Anderson's point in 14 minutes, converted by Fraser Klimo, gave Air an advantage, but the yellow card for Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, given for Warors' game, enabled Melrose to improve the numbers, and Jason Bagot grabbed an unconverted point.
Klimo extended Ear’s leadership by a penalty, earlier, right in the middle of the day, reaching a point, converting a solo point to achieve Ear’s salvation.
But Melrose well started the second half, and Patrick Anderson's point, converted by Bagot, reduced the lead to five points.
Then there was a long holdover due to a serious injury to Ruarid Nott, who was worn out, and from the beginning, Earl continued to be tortured with the point of Stafford McDoval, converted by Klimo.
Earl's CEO, Blair McFerson, then got a yellow card and again, Melrose paid for the additional man with an unconverted point on Bruce Colvin at the end of time with unmerciful pressure.
But the home team recovered, and when Stroan Hachinson received a yellow card to defeat Klimo without the ball, McFerson took a tachydoon from the back of the Air's sharp attack.
Klimo converted, as he did almost again from the beginning, after Kyle Row took David Armstrong's punch and sent the wing player Gregor Henry to the fifth point for the home team.
The Still Game star seems ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
The star of Still Game, Ford Kiran, seems ready to move into the hospitality industry after it was found to be appointed director of a licensed company restaurant.
Fifty-six-year-old Jack Jarvis is playing in the popular BBC series, which he is a screenwriter and plays together with a longtime comedy partner, Greg Hemfil.
Duoto announced that the next ninth season would be the last and seems to be Kirnan planning for life after Kreglang.
According to official records, he's the director of Agregmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although Scottish Sun's source indicated that Kirnan was trying to engage in Glazgo's "successful restaurant trade".
"The sea is ours": Bolivia is surrounded with thirst hope that the court will reopen the path to the Pacific
Marines patrol at a hidden-lying Navy headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings set up a sea blue flag.
The Navy bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are filled with the motto: “The sea is our right.
It's our duty to return."
Through the land of Bolivia, the mention of the coast lost for Chile in a bloody 19th - century conflict of resources is still fresh, as is the search for the Pacific.
Those hopes may now be the greatest in decades, while Bolivia awaits a decision by the international court on 1 October after five years of debate.
"Bolivia has a moment, a spirit of unity and peace, and of course a positive outcome is expected," said Roberto Calsadija, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the decision of the international court of large screens everywhere in the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will judge for the benefit of Bolivia's claim that, after decades of variable talks, Chile is obliged to negotiate to grant a sovereign sea exit to Bolivia.
Here's Morales, Bolivia's charismatic president of native origin, facing a controversial re-election battle next year, also depends heavily on the verdict Monday.
"We are very close to getting back to the Pacific," he solemnly said at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will probably not judge for the benefit of Bolivia and that it will not change much even for the benefit of them.
The UN body based in the Netherlands has no power to allocate Chile's territory and has indicated that it will not decide the outcome of the possible talks.
That the verdict of the international court comes only six months after the final arguments indicates that the case "was not complicated," Paz Zarate, an expert on international law from Chile, said.
And for the last four years, they may have been behind Bolivia's cause rather than improving it.
"The current Bolivian administration has used the problem of accessing the sea for its own purposes," Zarate said.
Morales' military rhetoric undermined Chile's remaining goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to speak at a certain point, but it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Velce, a Bolivian representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that making a court decision is unusually quick.
On Monday, he will bring Bolivia "an incredible opportunity to open an era of good relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end up 139 years of mutual disunity," he said.
Calsadia also rejected that Morales, another of the most popular presidents in Latin America, used the sea problem as political support.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific," he added.
"The decision is an opportunity to see that we must overcome the past".
North Korea says it won't come to nuclear disarmament if it can't trust the United States
North Korea Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never disarm its nuclear weapons first if it can't trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday before the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to keep its promises made during the summit in Singapore among rival leaders.
His comments came at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was working on reintroducing blocked nuclear diplomacy more than three months after Singapore with North Korean Kim Young Un.
Ri says it is "fiction" to be considered that the continued sanctions and US appeals for the declaration of the Korean war will bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is careful to agree with the declaration without Pyongyang to take significant disarmament measures first.
And Kim and the president of the United States Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is great skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about giving up the arsenal that the country probably sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for Kim-Tramp's second summit.
Paris fashion fairs discover the newest line of massive hats on the way to the biggest shops near you
If you want to improve the size of your collection of caps or completely block the sun, then do not search any further.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown have discovered a series of dazzled overcrowded hats for their SS19 collection on the track that blinded the style set on the Fashion Week in Paris.
Finally, unpractice hats launched Instagram this summer and these designers sent their creations that fall into the eye of the track.
The piece highlighted by Valentino was a huge hat shirt decorated with a wide range of feathers that flooded the model's head.
Other major supplements included citricians, magic hats, even pineapples, but they are not designed to warm your head.
Tom Brown also discovered a selection of bizarre masks, and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had narrow lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecturer than in high fashion.
One creation looked like a diving equipment full of glasses and a diving tube, and the other looked like a dense corned ice cream.
And if you continue with the huge fashion statement, you're lucky.
The fashioners predict that huge hats can come to shops near you.
The big hats came very quickly after La Bomba, the broken hat with a round of two steps that all carry from Riana to Emily Ratajkovski.
The cult fashion house behind too much unpractice hat spread through social media sent another great creation on the track, a straw bag for the beach with almost the height of the model it was pulling.
The dark orange raffia bag, with a raffia border and a white skin handle, was the piece highlighted in the collection La Riviera SS19 of the Fashion Week in Paris.
The famous designer, Luke Armitage, said to FEMAIL: “I expect to see the big hats and beach bags in the shops next summer, because the designer has so much influence that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for too many additions.”
John Edward: Language skills are needed for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain academic excellence and this continues in 2018 with another set of extraordinary results of the trials, which only reinforces with individual and group success in the community's sport, art, music and other achievements.
With more than 30,000 students everywhere in Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best service to their students and parents.
Independent schools seek to prepare their students for further and higher education, the career they have chosen, and their place as global citizens.
As an educational center that can design and implement custom school programs, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and desirable as an object of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to a person in a language he understands, it will make him a demeanor.
If you talk to him in his language, it will hit him in the heart."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the recent results of this year’s exams, we can see that languages surpass all other subjects with the highest rate of success in independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who learned foreign languages achieved a higher 5+ assessment.
Data collected from 74 schools in SCIS showed that 72 percent of students achieved a higher 5+ rating by Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who learned German, 69 percent of those who learned French and 63 percent of those who learned Spanish also achieved "5".
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly gain in the future.
Languages now, as an item of choice, are viewed at the same level as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools as elsewhere.
The 2014 OK Employment and Skills Commission survey noted that 17 percent of the reasons why employers failed to fill jobs were due to a lack of language skills.
Thus, language skills are becoming increasingly important in order to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more jobs looking for languages, these skills are needed in the globalized world.
No matter what career someone chooses, if they learn a second language, they will have real advantages in the future with such a life - style.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically give priority to the polyglot before competition.
According to a survey of more than 4,000 adults from OK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak foreign language well enough to speak, and French was the only language spoken over ten percent, that is, 15 percent of people.
So investing in language teaching is now important for today’s children.
Having more languages, especially those in developing economies, will equip children with better opportunities to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school will vary according to the language it teaches.
Several schools will focus on classic modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important in OK when viewed in the future by 2020, as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what your child's interests are, there will always be a number of languages from which you can choose in independent schools, with professors who are specialists in this area.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills needed for success, no matter what the future may bring.
At present it cannot be denied, in the global business environment, that languages will continue to be vital for the country's future, so this must be reviewed in schools.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for young people in Scotland.
"I need ben le fare" (it has to be done).

Lebron will lead Lakers to debut in San Diego on Sunday
Waiting's almost over for fans who wanted to see Lebron James start for Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced James will play the first pre-season game on Sunday against Denver Nagets in San Diego.
But how many minutes will he play, it's still not decided.
"There will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
The Lakers reporter, Mike Trudel, tweeted that James was probably going to play a limited time.
After the beginning of the week's training, James was asked about his plans for the six-game game schedule before the Lakers season.
"I don't need games in the pre-season at this stage of my career to prepare," he said.
YouTube channel for Trump's meeting in West Virginia
President Donald Trump started a series of meetings as part of the campaign tonight in Willing, West Virginia.
It is the first of the five scheduled meetings of Trump next week, including visits to inclined places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote to confirm his election to fill an empty place in the Supreme Court is in rest, Trump is trying to build support for the upcoming elections in the middle of the mandate, as Republicans may lose control at Congress with the November vote.
What time is Trump's meeting in West Virginia tonight and how do you view it online?
The Trump meeting in Willing, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 noon. The Eastern Coast Time Zone tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's meeting in West Virginia on the Internet live on YouTube.
This week it is likely that Trump will address the hearing of the man nominated for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavano, which has become tense due to allegations of sexual misconduct with expected postponement of the Senate vote by one week, while the FBI's investigation is ongoing.
The primary objective of the series of meetings is to help Republicans get a hold on the November elections .
From this point on, President Trump's campaign said these five minutes next week are aimed at "encouraging volunteers and supporters because Republicans are trying to protect and extend the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Convention control is so important in its agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible with the beginning of the campaign's hard season," Tramp's campaign spokesperson for Reuters, who refused to be appointed.
Appointed in the Wesbanko arena in Willing, tonight's meeting can attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as the Pittsburgh media, according to West Virginia Metro news.
On Saturday is the second visit of Trump to West Virginia in the last month, a country in which he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is behind the polls.
"It is not good for Morrisey that the president must come to improve the popularity of the polls," said Simon Hider, a politician at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Cup Ryder 2018: U.S. team showed courage in fighting to keep hope alive at the beginning of individual competitions on Sunday
After three one-sided seasons, the four on Saturday afternoon might have been exactly what he needed at the Cup of Ryder.
The turnaround of happiness is a completely invented sports concept, but players really believe in it, and most of these games.
Who would you say happiness is now?
"They had a six-point lead, and now they're four, so we're a little lucky," Jordan Spit said after the end of today's competition.
Europeans have an advantage, of course, leading four points and twelve more games.
According to the Spit, Americans feel that they have a weak wind in their liver, even though they have enough incentive, if nothing else is then the shape of Spit and Justin Thomas playing together all day and each has reached three points of four.
The hospital was excellent and guided by example.
Those strong challenges of celebration were becoming stronger during his game, with a key blow that led to the equalization of four-four when he and Thomas had two failures after two rounds.
His punch with which he won the 15th match was met with a similar call, which tells you he believes the American team isn't out of play.
"You just have to get deeper and take care of your game," Spit said.
That's all that's left of each player right now.
18 holes to reach a point.
The only players with more points from Spit and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Flitwood, the undisputed story of the Cup Ryder.
The strange but beautiful duo of Europe is four out of four and they can't be wrong.
"Molywood" was the only couple with no bad hits on Saturday afternoon, but they avoided bad hits on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the previous nine on Friday morning.
That series and the way their energy seems to flow to and from this noisy group ensures that they are the players that will win on Sunday and that there will be no other popular players that will provide a potential European victory when the sun goes behind Le Golf Nazional, except for Flitwood or Molinari.
He preferred the two at the same time at different holes.
However, the talks on European fame remain unjustified.
Baba Watson and Web Simson quickly dealt with Sergio Garcia, the morning hero of double couples, when he joined Alex Norren.
A missed blow and two doubles of the first nine buried the Spaniard and the Swedes in a hole they never managed to get out of.
Sunday, however, there's no one who can help you get out of the hole.
The two couples and the four are so fascinating to look closely at because of the interaction between their partners, the advice they give, the advice they don't listen to, and the way the strategy can change all of a sudden.
Europeans played better as a team and thus made a significant lead in the last day, but the fourth season also showed that the U.S. team could fight even though some, especially Americans, were in doubt.
Europeans led by 10-6 on the last day of Cup Ryder
Europe will take a solid lead in the last day of the Ryder Cup after Saturday's leadership in two pairs and four from 10-6 in front of the United States.
The inspired duo Tommy Flitwood and Francisco Molinari led the two-victim attack while Tiger Woods was struggling to take the lead so far at Le Golf National on four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who fought to keep the trophy lost in Hazeltin two years ago, dominated the American team that had many failures in the morning double pairs and won the 3-1 series.
The Americans provided more resistance to the four, winning two matches, but they could not reach the leadership.
Jim Furick’s team needs eight points from 12 individual games on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Flitwood is the first European beginner to win four consecutive points, while he and Molinari, called "Molywood" after the sensational weekend, are the second pair to win four points in the first four matches in the history of Cup Ryder.
After "sucking" Woods and Patrick Reed in double pairs, they played excellently and won the developed Woods and American beginner Bryson Deshambu with an even more pronounced 5&4 result.
Woods, who went through two swords on Saturday, played great at times, but now lost 19 of the 29 matches in double pairs and fours and seven times in a row.
Justin Rose, retired as the morning double pairs lasted, returned as a partner to Henrik Stanson in the four defeats of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka -- ranked first and third in the world.
However, Europeans were not all at their disposal that pleasant, windy day south-west of Paris.
The three-time dominant winners Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas have put in place an action for two-point Americans on Saturday.
They won a decisive 2+1 victory over the Spaniards John Rahm and Ian Puller in the double pair and returned later to win the Puller and Rory McClroy with 4&3 in fours, but lost the initials, two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Cup Ryder team has recovered from the lack of four points in an individual game, although as bearers of the title, Furik’s team had enough equal results to keep the trophy.
After two days, however, the Sunday attack seems to remain on top of them.
North Korea says "no chance" to disarm unilaterally without confidence
North Korea's Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions are deepening mistrust in the United States and that there is no way the country can give up nuclear weapons unilaterally in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the World Body that North Korea has taken "significant measures of good will" last year, such as stopping nuclear missiles tests, dismantling nuclear testing facilities and committing itself to the proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see a proper response from the United States." he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security and under such conditions there is no way to unilaterally disarm ourselves first".
Although Ri reiterated North Korea's well-known complaints of Washington's resistance to the accession to nuclear disarmament "in phase", according to which North Korea would be progressively rewarded for the steps taken, his statement seemed significant because it did not reject unilaterally, nuclear disarmament, without discussion, as Pyongyang was doing in the past.
Ri alluded to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit at the current US president and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12th, when Kim pledged to work towards "nuclear disarmament on the Korean peninsula", while Trump provided security guarantees to North Korea.
North Korea is demanding a formal end to the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States claims that Pyongyang must first give up nuclear weapons.
Washington also refuses to give up strict international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on "nuclear disarmament first and foremost" and increases the level of sanctions pressure to achieve its goal by force, and even opposes "the declaration of the end of the war," Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can not bend on our knees is a crazy dream of people who don't know us.
But the problem is that the existing sanctions are deepening our mistrust."
Ri did not mention the plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader stressed earlier this week in the United Nations.
Instead, the minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Mun Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If the other side of this nuclear disarmament problem was South Korea, instead of the United States, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula would not end in such a deadlock."
However, Ri's tone of speech was significantly different from last year's, when he told the UN General Assembly that the targeting of North Korean missiles towards American land is inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim "a rocket" with a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, which was threatened last year with the "complete destruction" of North Korea, much more grateful to Kim for his courage to take steps to disarmament, but he said there was still much work to be done and that sanctions must remain until the nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for it, saying "Does it take two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter".
China and Russia believe the UN Security Council should award Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that "the sanctions of the Security Council must continue fully and without exceptions until full, finally nuclear disarmament is confirmed".
The Security Council unanimously increased sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in order to prevent the financing of the Pyongyang nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompey met with Ri on the margins of the General Assembly of the O.N., and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompey has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last time has gone wrong.
He left Pyongyang in July with a statement that he had made progress, but was denied by North Korea only after a few hours for "gangster demands".
North Korea is committed to meeting with Moon this month for the disarmament of a missile building, as well as a nuclear complex if the United States takes "adequate measures".
He said Kim told him that the "adequate measures" he was looking for are the security guarantees that Trump gave in Singapore, as well as moves towards normalising relations with Washington.
Harvard students visit courses to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year aims to teach all diplomats more sleep in order to fight the growing sword culture of learning by staying awake all night with the help of caffeine.
One researcher found that students at the leading university in the world often know nothing when it comes to primary care for themselves.
Charles Chaisler, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School's sleep, and a specialist at the Brigam Women's Hospital, designs the course he believes to be the first of his kind in the United States.
He was inspired to begin the course after giving a talk about the influence of excessive sleep on learning.
"At the end of the lecture, a girl came and said to me, "Why are you telling me this now, in the last year?"
She said no one ever told her about the importance of sleeping - which surprised me," he said about the Telegraph.
The course offered for the first time this year explains to the students the basics of how good sleep habits help in academic and athletic outcomes and improve overall well-being.
Paul Barrera, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students have a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The same course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In part, there is a picture of a student’s home that students press on cups of coffee, curtains, shoes, and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how insufficient sleep affects the athletic results and the importance of the routine when going to bed.
In another part, participants learn how a long - term lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart and brain attacks, depression, and cancer.
The campus map, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that it will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know -- just as you have the right to know about the health effects when you choose to smoke a cigarette," added Professor Chazler.
The culture of pride with "work all night" still exists, he said, and besides modern technology and increasing pressure on students, the lack of sleep is a growing problem.
Having enough sleep, with good quality, should be the "secret weapon" of the student in the struggle against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said -- even to avoid fatness, because the lack of sleep causes the brain to go into hunger, which makes them constantly hungry.
Raymond Saw, a 19-year-old student from California in chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chaisler design the course after visiting one of his classes last year, in his first year at Harvard.
He said he opened his eyes to the course and inspired him to act on the course throughout the student city.
He hopes that the next step is to ask all post-graduates to complete a similar program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Chaisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm when they go to bed, and when they wake up and be aware of the harmful effects of "the blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED light, which shifts the circular rhythm, leading to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Manga's goal is to crush Gerard's people
Rangers suffered another devastating, sad day when Dolly Menga's hit sent Stephen Gerard's rifle team to defeat 1-0 in Livingston.
Ibrox's team wanted to record their first victory after the February 4-1 triumph in St. Johnston, but Gary Holt's team put down the second defeat of Gerard's team in 18 games as a manager who left his team with eight points behind the fledgling Harts team in the Scottish first league.
Menga scored seven minutes before half-time and Rangers' setup lost inspiration and equalization chances.
Now the Rangers have fallen to the sixth place, and Livingston has climbed to the third, and they're just behind the hibernian according to the difference in their heads.
There may be additional problems waiting for Rangers after Linen Judge Kalum Spence had to receive medical help for head injury after he was obviously hit with a remote object.
Gerard made eight changes to the crew that Air went through in the semifinal of the Bott Betfred.
Holt, on the other hand, was playing with the same 11 of Livingston who won a score with Harts last week and would be happy to see how his well-trained attitude suffocated the opponents at every opportunity.
Rangers may have dominated possession of the ball, but Livingston did more with the ball than they did.
They were supposed to reach a point, two minutes after the beginning when Menga's first game hit Scott Pittman to Alan McGregor's goal, but the middle-ranked player missed the chance.
Then a blow from the distance of Kehan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halket, but his defence partner Alan Litgou could only play openly in defense.
Rangers managed to control the game, but it seemed there's more hope than faith in their last third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he should get a penalty in the 15th minute when he and Stephen Lowell got into a fight, but Judge Stephen Thompson did not give a sign of approval of the Colombian complaint.
Rangers managed to reach only two shots to the target in the first half, but Ibrox Liam Kelly's former goalkeeper didn't get away with the hit on Lasana Kulibali's head and the weak hit on Ovi Edaria.
Although the beginning of the 34th minute of Livingston may have been contrary to the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved according to their game.
Again, Rangers failed to deal with Jacobs' blow.
Scott Alfred didn't react when Declan Gallagher added Scott Robinson's ball, which with a cold head chose Menga for a simple end.
Gerard reacted during the half-time when he replaced Kulabali with Ryan Kent, and the replacement had a quick effect when the wing player passed Morelos, but the impressive Kelly reacted from his block line.
But Livingston managed to attract the host players to play the type of game they enjoy, with Litgou and Hackett getting a lot of the long additions.
Holt's team could've extended the lead to the end of the game, but McGregor set himself up well and stopped Jacobs from playing with his head on the corner before Litgou.
Rangers' replacement, Glenn Middleton had another request for a penalty after he broke up with Jacobs, but Thompson didn't approve again.
Almanah: Gajger's Calculator Insulator
And now one side of our German "Saturday of the morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and WE REMEMBER ... the day that the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Gajger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, a discovery that led to the creation of a device known as the gajger calculator.
Since then it has become the main focus of science, the gayer's counter has also become the main focus of popular culture, such as in the 1950's "The Plain of Colorado", in which these seemingly insurmountable, cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans perform:
Man: "What's that again?"
Rogers: “It’s a giger’s counter, which is used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put your headphones on, you can hear the effects of the atoms that release the radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans: "Say it, it's probably jumping now!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the discovery that bears his name still exists.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" removed cells
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "look at" remote cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize isolated cells as part of the treatment
Method includes the extraction of immune cells from the patient and their changes to the laboratory
You can "see" protein honor in many kinds of cancer, and then be returned to the organism.
The test vaccine provides promising results in patients with multiple cancers.
In a woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize foreign cells, ovarian cancer disappeared in 18 months.
The method includes extracting immunological cells from the patient, their changes in the laboratory, so they can "see" protein honour in many types of cancer called HER2, and then their return to the organism.
Professor Jay Berzofski, of the American National Institute for Cancer from Beteda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a promising vaccine."
HER2 "stimulates the growth of several types of cancer", including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, white lungs and colorectal cancer, explains Professor Berzofski.
A similar approach by withdrawing immunological cells from patients and their "learning" as targeting cancer cells works when treating a particular type of leukaemia.
Kanje West made a pro-Tramp exit, carrying a drop with his motorcycle, after a performance on Saturday night alive.
That didn't go well
Kanje West was noted in the studio during a live show on Saturday night, after a useless performance in which US President Donald Trump was missing and said he would be running for office in 2020.
After performing the third song that night, called the City of Spirits, where he wore a stick with the title To make America Slavna Again, he began criticizing the democracies and reiterated his support for Trump.
"Many times when I talk to a white man, they say, "How can you like Trump, he's racist?"
Well, if I was worried about racism long ago, I would have moved out of America," he said.
On Saturday evening, a live show began with a satire with Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star laughed at Brett Cavano's testimony before the Senate's Legal Affairs Commission on the charges of a sexual assault by Christine Blaisey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the picture of West's output was posted on social media by Comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock tried to laugh at West with the announcement.
Also, West complained to the public that he had a hard time going behind the scene because of his drop.
"I was ridiculed behind the scene.
They told me, "Don't show up with that drop."
They made fun of me!
Then they told me I was in the basement, he said, according to the Washington Exterior.
West continued: "Do you want to see the submerged place?" said he would "put on his superman cap, because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try with love."
His comments attracted insults from the audience at least twice, and the evening show crew seemed embarrassed, Varajeti reported, a man said to the publisher: "We're taking the whole studio."
West was brought as a replacement at the last moment for the singer Ariana Grande, whose former boy, rapper McMiller died a few days ago.
It surprises many with the song "I Love It", dressed as a Perier bottle.
West received support from the conservative group TPSAD, Candis Turner, who wrote on Twitter: “For one of the bravest spirits: Thank you for your efforts to resist the crowd.”
But the host of the show Karen Hunter wrote to Twitter that the West "was hers and it was absolutely wonderful".
"But I chose not to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his "art") who I believe accepts and spreads ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
So did we," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced to Twitter that he had changed his name, with him now "formerly known as Caine West".
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow Didi's steps, known as Paf Grandpa, Paf and P Didi.
Comrade rapper, Snoop Dog has the name Snoop Lyon and of course the late musical legend Prince changed his name into a symbol, and then in the artist previously known as Prince.
Indictment for attempted murder at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man is indicted for attempted murder after stabbing a man in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Balikhakmore, the police said.
The accused is expected to appear before the Supreme Court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the public prosecutor.
The star of the Throne's Game Series, Keith Harrington, attacked the toxic male
Keith Harrington is known for his role as a skilled swordsman like John Snow in the violent, medieval, fantastic Thrones Game series.
But the actor, 31, attacked the macho-hero stereotype, when he said that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they have to be strong to be respected.
In a statement on the Sandey Times culture section, Keith said he believed "something is wrong" and wondered how to deal with the problem of male toxicity in the #SegaImam era.
Keith, who recently married to the Throne's Game Star, Rosie Lesley, also admitted that there are "strong feelings" on the issue.
"I personally have strong feelings, at the moment - where did we make a mistake with the male?," he said.
"What do we teach men when they grow up, about the problems we see now?"
Keith believes that television may be partly responsible for the increase in male toxicity, thanks to strong male figures.
He continued: “What is born, and what is taught?
What is learned from TV, and what on the street makes young boys feel that they must have a certain side of the male?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time - how do we change it?
Because it's obvious something's wrong with young men."
In an interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in the continuation of the Thrones Game when the series ended next summer, saying that he "ended with battles and horses".
From November, Keith will be performing in the renewal of Sam Shepard's True West, which is a story of a film producer and his brother as a thief.
The actor recently discovered that he thinks that what he met Rose's wife is the best thing that came out of the Throne's Game.
"I met my wife in this series, so she gave me the future family and my life in the future," he said.
Rose played Game, a character who had a loving attraction to Keith's character, John Snow, in the fantastic series that won Amy's awards.
The couple got married in June 2018 on the property of the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reported 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% jump in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 are occupied in the country, health authorities say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new developments have been transmitted through sex, which is a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through some parts of China as a result of blood transfusions.
But the number of people suffering from HIV in this way is nearly zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in the province of Yunan.
From year to year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has grown by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sex is an acute issue for the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but the discrimination of people from LGBT is great.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies show that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will ever marry women.
Many of the transmissions of the disease are due to inappropriate sexual protection in those relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV drugs as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxin Waters denied the data issued by a member of the staff associated with the Republican Party's senator as "dangerous lies" and "provoked theories"
US Representative Maxine Waters rejected the allegations on Saturday that a member of her staff had published personal information to three republican senators in the United States of Wikipedia legislators.
The Democrat from Los Angeles believed that claims were "ultra-right" sympathizers and web sites.
"Flags, lies, and even more repugnant lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information reportedly includes home address and phone numbers of US senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hech from South.
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday, published by an unknown person in Capitol Hill, as the Senate's hearing panel on allegations of sexual misconduct against Brett Cavano, nominated as a judge of the Supreme Court.
The information submitted appeared shortly after Cavano's interrogation by three senators.
Conservative locations such as Gateway Pandit and Redstreet reported that the IP address identifying the source of the announcement is linked to the Waters office and published information about a Waters staff member, Hill said.
"These unfortunate accusations are completely false and constitute an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"My staff member -- whose identity, personal information and security are compromised as a result of these false and false accusations -- is in no way responsible for the information being made.
Unlucky accusations are completely false and absolutely false."
Waters' statement quickly attracted criticism of the Internet, including the former White House press secretary, Ari Flyscher.
"These denials are nervous," Flyscher wrote.
"This shows that it has no temper to be a member of the Congress.
When someone is accused of something he has not done, he must not be angry.
He can't be challenged.
He must not question the defendant's motives.
He must remain calm and calm."
Fletcher seems to have compared Waters' reaction to the criticisms of the democrats associated with Judge Kavano, who was accused by the critics because he seemed too angry during the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navaro, a Republican candidate to replace Waters in the middle of the mandate, also announced on Twitter.
"If it's true, it's a big deal," he wrote on Twitter.
In her statement Waters said her office reported "the institutions and the police responsible for false claims.
"We will enable criminals to be discovered," she continued, "and that they will be legally responsible for all their actions that are harmful and dangerous to some and all members of my staff".
Thinking of Johnny English Attacks Again - He undermined Rowan Atkinson's spying scams
It is now traditional to look for elements of Bregzit in every new British movie, which seems to be valid for this renewal of the french frenchist Johnny English comedy, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and was repeated in 2011 with Johnny English: born again.
Will careful self - ridicule on how obvious we are to nowhere be the new possibility of exporting the nation?
After all, the face with big eyes and many grins of the incompetent Johnny English got a license to "feel" things for the second time -- his name above all means that he is a comical creation with a wide range, made for viewers in cinemas in places where English is not spoken.
He is certainly a sketch of a secret agent who, despite his bizarre efforts for a careful glamorous little like Clouseau, has Mr. Bin's drawings and a part of the boy playing a note from the Kochi song on the fire of the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympic Games.
Its foundation is the traveler and mysterious international man Atkinson who once performed in Barclay's now forgotten TV commercial, leaving chaos behind.
There's one or two moments in Johnny English's latest edition.
I liked it very much when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor, and the wheels were hit by his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy can be seen, but humor seems weak and somewhat superficial, especially because "serious" film brands like 007 and the Impossible Mission and themselves contain elements of comedy.
The humor seems to be meant for children, instead of adults, and for me, Johnny English's freaking accidents aren't as inventive and focused as you're denying bin's character atkinson.
The theme that is being pursued all along is that Britain is in serious trouble.
Cyber hacker has infiltrated the super secret network of spies in Britain, discovering the identities of all British agents on the ground, to disappoint the agent who is in office -- a disappointing little role for Kevin Eldon.
In the last chance of a prime minister who is a tougher and more combative figure and already suffers from a complete meltdown of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives himself up in this figure of Quazi-Tereza-May, but there is nothing special about the scenario to deal with.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that since every active spy is compromised, she will have to activate one of the retired.
And that means calling Johnny English himself who now works as a private school teacher, but "black" gives lessons for secret agents: there are a few good boys here, when English offers a school for spying that looks like a rock academy.
English is soon called to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with former co-worker Bow, who plays Ben Miller.
Bow is now a married man, about a submarine commander, a comical role that Vicky Pepperdin is not well used.
Well, Batman and Robin, for messing up all things in the Royal Secret Service, are returning to action and meeting the lovely Ofelia Bouletova, a character played by Olga Kirilenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is under the dangerous influence of a charismatic technological billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems: the evil Jason Walta, played by Jake Lacey.
English and Bow begin their examination of absurd procedures: processed as waiters they light up a French restaurant; make a desert after they have turned themselves into the luxury yacht of Volta; and English starts right anarchy when trying to use a helmet for virtual reality to get to know the interior of Volta's house.
All the brakes have been removed for the last sequence, but as kind and noisy as it is, there's a lot of child TV in the entire movie.
Nice, moderate things.
And as with other movies with Johnny English, I can't help but think: can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that will use his talent?
Laborists deny that British plan to work four days a week, but to be paid for five
Jeremy Corbin's Laborist Party will consider a radical plan that says British people will work four days a week - but will be paid for five.
The party allegedly wants the company's bosses to use the shields they make with artificial intelligence to give workers another day off.
The employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but they would get the same pay.
According to the sources, the idea "appropriate" with the party's economic agenda and the country's plans to be more inclined to the workers.
The four-day shift is supported by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to have gains from changes in the economy.
A high - ranking member of the party told Sandey Times: “The revision of the strategy should be announced before the end of the year.
"It won't happen overnight, but a four-day work week is an effort that is consistent with the party's accession to rebalancing the economy for workers, as well as the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Laborist Party will not be the first to accept such an idea, the Green Party pledged a four-day work week during the parliamentary election campaign in 2017.
However, the aspirations are not accepted by the entire Labour Party.
Labourist Party spokesperson: "The four-day working week is not a party's strategy and the party does not consider such an idea".
Shadow Chancellor John McDonald used the Labourers' conference last week to present his vision for the socialist revolution of the economy.
Mr. McDonald said he was determined to seize the power of "personless directors" and "profits" in municipal companies.
The office's shadow plans also mean that current shareholders in water supply companies may not get the whole part back because the Laborist government could make "deductions" for non-ethical behavior.
He also confirmed the plans for workers to become part of the company's boards and to create Inclusive Property Funds with which 10 per cent of the private firm's capital will belong to employees, which could take an annual dividend of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy's making a statement about "60 Minit" whether the FBI's investigation for Kavano can reconsider them.
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavano postponed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court at least one week and updated the question of whether the Bureau's findings could be considered by some republican senators to withdraw support.
In an interview published on Sunday, the correspondent of "60 Minnit" Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find out something that would make them think.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina doll.
"I think you do," Kennedy said.
"I said when I went to the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Cavano.
I called him after this happened, after the charges were dropped, and I said, "Did you do that?"
He was strong, determined, unmistakable."
Graham's voice, however, seems to be carved into stone.
"My decision was made for Brett Cavano and a shocking accusation is needed," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett turned down energetically," Graham added, thinking of Christine Blacy Ford.
"All she calls could not confirm.
That's 36 years old.
I don't see anything new to change."
What is the Global Civilian Festival, and did it do anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday in New York will be held at the Global Citizens' Festival, an annual music event on which famous stars perform and have an impressive mission; the end of poverty.
It is now being held for the seventh time, and the Global Citizens festival will visit tens of thousands of people coming to the big lawn in the central park, not only to enjoy events such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Civilian Festival, which began in 2012, is a continuation of the project against global poverty, an international activist group hoping to put an end to poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to get a free ticket for the event (except if they don't want to pay for the VIP ticket), participants have to perform several tasks or "actions" such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, telephone call or other useful work that will help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful is Golbalian because 12 years remain to achieve the whole?
Is the idea of a free concert really a way to convince people to seek something or just another case of "click-activism" -- people who feel that they make a real difference by signing a petition on the Internet or sending a message on Twitter?
Since 2011, Global Citizens have claimed to have registered more than 19 million "activities" from supporters, which have acted for many different purposes.
They say these activities have helped to encourage world leaders to promote dedication and strategies that have raised more than $37 billion and that will affect lives of more than 2.25 billion by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 promises and statements resulting from their activities, of which 10 billion dollars have already been sent or collected.
The group estimates that the collected funds have a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key promises are the Power of Food, an investor-implementation partnership, based in Britain, dedicated to "helping children take advantage of their potential", which promises to provide $35m for Rwanda to help about the country's food shortage after receiving 4,700 messages on Twitter from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens as well as you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition, a note in history," said Ambassador Tracy Ulman of Power of Food, in front of the assembled people at the live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said over 5,000 activities were undertaken related to calls for better nutrition for mothers and children in Britain, the government announced funding for the project, the Power of Iskranta, which will include 5 million women and children with intuitive interventions.
As an answer to one of the frequently asked questions on their website "Why do you think you can put an end to extreme poverty?"
From a Global Citizens answered: “It will be a long and difficult journey — we will never succeed.
But as well as the big civil and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Sean Mendez, Cardy B, Jeanelle Mona are some of the artists that will take place at this year's event in New York, whose host will be Deborah-lie Furnes and Hugh Jackman.
America can use the Navy as a "block" to prevent Russian exports of energy - Ministry of Interior
Washington can "if necessary" use the Navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching the market, including the Middle East, US Interior Minister Ryan Zinky, quoted Washington Egzeminer as saying.
According to Zinky, Russia's involvement in Syria -- the name, where it acts at the invitation of a legitimate government -- is a benchmark for researching new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is because of the energy market, as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe," he alleged.
And according to the government representative, there are ways to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to ensure that sea routes remain open and if it is necessary to block their energy from reaching the market," he said.
Zinki addresses the event's presence organised by the Energy Consumer Alliance, a non-profit group that represents itself as "the voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He continued to compare Washington's approach to Russia and Iran, noting that it is effective.
"Iran and Russia's economic option is, more or less, raising the stake and replacing the fuel," he said, while talking to Russia as "one unpleasant pony" with a fossil-dependent economy.
The statement followed after Trump's administration launched a mission to encourage the export of liquid natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To that end, officials from the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to step off the "indecent" North Tek 2 gas pipeline project, which according to Tramp, made Moscow's "prisoner" from Berlin.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Tech 2, which is worth $11 billion, should double the current capacity of the 110 billion cubic metres pipeline, is just an economic project.
Kremlin claims that Washington's strong opposition to the project is only for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a pressure-making tool and that customers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. attitude came up against Germany, which confirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading industry organisation in Germany, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), called on the United States not to interfere with European energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third party interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kemp, the first man of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "will carefully consider" whether to run for president in 2020, Senator of Massachusetts said
Senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she "will carefully examine" whether to run for president after the mid-term elections.
During a meeting in the town of Holiok, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was thinking about running.
"It is time for women to go to Washington and fix our non-functional government, which means a woman on the forehead," she said, according to Hill.
"After 6 November, I will carefully examine whether to run for president."
Voren evaluated President Donald Trump's work during a meeting in the city assembly and said he "is leading the country in the wrong direction.
"I am too concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren is open in her criticism of Trump and the man he nominated as a judge at the Supreme Court, Brett Cavano.
In a Twitter message Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that a large number of voters in her election unit think it should not be run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "probably" Massachusetts voters said the senator should not be running, according to a study by the Centre for Political Research at the University of Safolk/Boston Globus.
Thirty-two percent support such a candidacy.
The survey has shown more support for the nomination of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent supporting potential nomination, and 48 per cent opposing.
Other well-known names from the democratic party that are being discussed for nomination in 2020 are former vice-president Joe Byden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Byden said he would officially decide by January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Payline talks about Trek Payline's post-traumatic syndrome at Donald Trump's meeting.
Trek Peelyn, 26, spent a year in Iraq after he applied in September.
He was arrested and accused of domestic violence on Monday night
"As for my son, as he goes through after returning, I know how the other families who have been broken up because of the post-traumatic syndrome and the wounds that our soldiers are returning with," she told the audience at a meeting about Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Peylin called the arrest "an elephant in the room" and said that her son and other veterans "are returning a little different, they are returning fortified, they are returning and wondering if there is respect for what they and their friends from the airship, and every other member of the army has given it to the country".
He was arrested Monday in Vasil, Alaska and accused of domestic violence with a female assault, along with a report on domestic violence and possession of alcohol-related weapons, according to Police spokesman Dan Bennet in Vasil.
18 states and the city of Washington support the challenge of a new asylum policy
Eighteen federal states and the city of Washington support the challenge of a new US policy that prevents the granting of asylum to victims fleeing domestic or gang violence.
Representatives of 18 states and the city of Washington submitted a petition to the court (amicus curiae) in Washington on Friday as a support for an asylum seeker who disputes politics, Ann-Bi-Ci News reported.
The full name of the prosecutor in the Grace v. Parliament case, which the US Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy, has not been found.
She said her partner "and the violent members of his gang," abused her, but the US authorities rejected her asylum request on July 20th.
She was imprisoned in Texas.
The state defender, whom Grace represents, described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of requests for asylum arose in the United States, as nations with constant problems of gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy repeals the 2014 Immigration Complaints Board's decision which allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The city's public defender of Washington Carl Rasin said on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of bringing laws at the federal, international, federal level".
"The federal law requires all requirements for asylum to be adapted to certain facts and circumstances of the request and such a provision violates that principle," according to the petition to the court (amicus curiae).
In addition, the defenders in the letter claim that the policy preventing immigrants from entering is harmful to the US economy because they are more likely to become entrepreneurs "to offer the necessary labour force".
Public defender Jeff Seshns ordered immigration judges not to give asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
"There is asylum for those who leave their country for persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or membership in a certain social group or political opinion," Sess said in presenting politics on June 11th.
Asylum has never been conceived as a solution to all the problems -- even all the serious problems -- that people around the world face every day.
A desperate effort is being made to save Palu because the number of victims doubles in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is incredibly serious.
"It's very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, as she comforted her male baby in the center of evacuation in the destroyed city of Palu.
"Every minute, ambulances carry bodies.
There's no clean water."
People return to their ruined homes and choose from their items mentioned to save something they can.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dui Harris, who has fractures on his back and shoulder, rest in front of the War Hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outside, due to frequent minor earthquakes.
Tears came to his eyes when he described the terrible earthquake in the hotel room on the fifth floor with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pushed into the urinates of the wall, so I think," Harris told Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for wedding.
"I heard her wife ask for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and her child.
I hope they're safe."
US Ambassador Indicts China to "distribute" with "propaganda"
A week after the official Chinese newspaper announced an advertisement on four sides in the US daily newspaper listing the mutual benefit of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using US media to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump spoke last Wednesday about China Daily's payment supplement in De Moin Register -- the most sold newspaper in Iowa -- after accusing China of being involved in US elections for the November 6th convention, China rejected the indictment.
tramp's accusation that Beijing is trying to get involved in the U.S. elections was accompanied by American Reuters services, a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to publish trade promotion ads, Beijing and Washington are currently in a trade war that balances import tariffs with each other.
China's debt rates at the beginning of the trade war were directed towards US exporters like Iowa, who support the Republican party of Trump, Chinese and American experts confirmed.
Teri Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and former, long-standing Governor of Iowa, chief exporter of agricultural products in China, said Beijing is hurting US workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a column in the Sunday issue of De Moin Register, "now doubles the abuse of propaganda advertising in our free press".
"When the propaganda is demised, the government of China abuses the unscrupulous American tradition of free speech and free media by placing advertisements in De Moin Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, in the near newspaper stand, here in Beijing, you can only find a limited number of opinions and you will not see the true reflection of the desperate thoughts that the Chinese people may have about China's problematic economic trajectory, because the media are controlled by the firm hand of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most read newspapers in China rejected his offer to publish" on the column, even though he did not say what the newspaper is about.
Republicans away from women's votes before the mid-term elections, due to the debacle with Kavano, analysts warn
Because many Republicans do not observe or defend Brett Kavano's nomination in the Supreme Court despite several allegations of sexual assault, analysts warn that there will be negative consequences, especially from women in the forthcoming elections in the middle of the mandate.
The emotions surrounding the case are extremely strong, and most Republicans have already been told that they want to continue to vote.
From such things there's no going back," wrote Grant Richer, professor of political science at Maxwell University College in Syracuse, for Hill, in a column published on Saturday.
Richer said he doubted that the pressure on the FBI's investigation of Senator Jeff Flake (Republican of Arizona) would be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget tomorrow, nor in November," said Karin Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesperson of the Progressive Group MoveOn, in front of Washington D.C. on Friday.
On Friday morning, demonstrators called out "Noemvri is coming!" in protest in the Senate hall, when Republicans, who have control of the Legal Affairs Commission, decided to continue with the nomination of Cavano despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blake Ford, Mick said.
"Enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be high," said St. Rottenberg, a non-partisan political analyst on the news site.
"People already say they're tall; that's right.
But they may be higher, especially among independent women voters in the suburbs and young voters, from 18 to 29 years of age, who, although they don't like the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony, in which her allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court candidate were detailed, analysts suggest that there may be negative consequences if the Republicans continue to vote.
"This has become a major mess for the Republican Party," said former president of the Republican National Committee earlier last week, according to Ann-Bi-Ci's news.
"It's not just about voting in the commission or the last vote, or whether Kavano will go to the hearing, it's also about how the Republicans dealt with this and how they treated it," said Gai Cecil, US Priorities Director, a group that helps in the selection of Democrats, for the news channel.
However, the Americans are divided about whom to trust after Ford and Cavano's testimony, even though more are accepted by the first party.
A new Yu-Gov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believe in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or probably believed in Kavano.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought Cavano probably or definitely lied when witnessing, while only 30 percent thought the same about Ford.
Following the pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the charges brought by Ford, as well as at least one more, to Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian said.
Ford testified before the Senate Legal Affairs Commission, under oath last week that Cavano attacked her in a drunken state when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez charges that the judge in the Supreme Court showed her genitals at a party while studying at Jeil in the 1980 ’ s.
World Network Designer plans to start a new Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Network starts with a startup business that claims to be a rival of Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the legend in technology, Inrapt, is a company that is built on an open-source solid platform in Berners-Lei.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and which people have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Bernards-Li joked that the Inrupt's intention was "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said about the start-up business.
"Now is the historic moment."
The application uses Solid's technology to enable people to create their own "information store on the Internet" or short POD.
It may contain contact lists, task lists, calendars, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outluck, Sleak and Spotifay all available to a viewer at the same time.
What's unique about the personal data store on the Internet is that it depends only on the user who has access to certain types of information.
The company calls it "personal strengthening through data".
The idea of Inrapt, according to John Bruce's executive director, is to ensure that the resources, processes and skills for Solid are available to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lei, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several development programmers with an agreement on the project's work and a community of coders volunteers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their decentralized applications using tools available on the Inrapt website.
Berners-Lei said he and his team don't talk to Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a complete change where their business models are completely reversed overnight.
"We're not asking for their permission."
In a press release, published on Saturday, Berners-Li wrote that "Inrapt's mission is to enable commercial energy and ecosystems to protect the integrity and quality of the new solid-based network".
In 1994, Berners-Li transformed the internet through the Consortium of the World Network of the Institute of Technology in Massachusetts.
Recently, Berners-Li is an influential speaker in the debate on internet neutrality.
Even at the start of the Inrapt, Berners-Li will remain the founder and director of the Consortium of the World Network, the Internet Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am a great optimist for the new era of the Internet," Bernards-Lei added.
Bernard Van: A well - known Victorian crossman since World War I
The only priest of the Anglican Church who received the Victorian Cross during World War I was celebrated in his hometown for 100 years.
Colonel Bernard Van received recognition on September 29, 1918 in the attack on Bellenglis and Lehaukur.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew that he had received the highest British military medal.
A commemorative stone was discovered by his two grandsons on a parade in Rashden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said it was "an incredible symbol" that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather received the award.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Van led his battalion through the Canal de Saint-Quentin "Near a very dense fog and under a strong fire of guns and mitrals".
He later ran to the site where he was shot, and with "the greatest courage", he moved forward, before he attacked the cannon and disabled three of the servants.
Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, almost a month before the war ended.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I know I'll never be able to fulfill, but it's something that doesn't make you humble".
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, also placed a wedding after the parade led by the Young Imperial Band of Brentwood.
Michael Van said that "it's a great honor to be part of the parade" and added "the courage of a true hero is shown by the support that will be given by many people".
Fans of combined martial arts stayed awake all night to watch Belator 206, instead of getting Pepa Prase
Imagine, you've been up all night watching Bellator 206, and you don't have the chance to watch the main event.
The San Jose list contained 13 battles, including six with the main card that were displayed live all night in Canal 5 in Britain.
On six o'clock in the morning, only Gerard Musasi and Rory McDonald were ready to face, the viewers in Britain were shocked when the channel was transferred to Pepa Prase.
Some were not impressed when they stayed up until the early hours of the fight.
One of Twitter’s fans described the transfer of a children’s cartoon film as “a sick joke. ”
"The law is such that at 6 a.m. that content was inappropriate, so they had to switch to a children's programme," said Dave Schwarz, Vice-President of Belator for Marketing and Communication, when asked about the transfer.
"Peppa pig", yes"
Belator Scott Cooker's president said they would work on an agenda that would include future British observers.
"I think that when I think about re-launching, I think we can probably find a solution," Kucker said.
"But there's six o'clock in the morning on Sunday and we won't be able to find a solution on Sunday after our time, and Monday after their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, we got a lot of messages on the transfer, and none of them were welcome.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical mistake.
But it wasn't, it was a legal question.
I can promise you it won't happen again.
We're going to limit the number of five fights, instead of six -- as we usually do -- we tried to deliver more because of fans and we went too far.
It's an accident.
Disks on the empty island: Tom Dale felt "inferior" because of sexuality
Olympic Jumper Tom Dale says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality - but it motivated him to succeed.
24-year-old said he didn't realize until he went to high school that "all aren't like me"
Speaking at the first broadcast of Radio 4's blank discos, presented by Lauren Lavern, he said he was talking about the rights of homosexuals to give "hope" to others.
He also said that what became a parent made him worry less about winning the Olympics.
The regular presenter of the long-term show Kirsty Young took a month off because of the disease.
Appearing as a comparative character in Lavern's first program, Dale said he felt "less" than everyone else as he grew up because "it was not socially acceptable to have sympathy for boys and girls".
He said: “To this day, those feelings of inferiority and diversity were the things that gave me power and strength to succeed. ”
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, not to disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The Olympic with two bronze medals became a known supporter of LGBT campaigns and used its performance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said that he spoke publicly because he felt happy that he could live freely and wanted to give “hope ” to others.
The three-time world champion said about a man's love - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013 - "suddenly surprised me".
Daley married the uncle, who is 20 years old, last year, but she said the age difference was never a problem.
"When you're going through so much early age," he went to the first 14-year-old Olympic and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it's hard to find someone at the same age who has experienced similar heights and depths.
Both became parents in June, a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that "all his views" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, everything was related to "I need to win a gold medal," he said.
"You know what, there are more important things than the gold medal at the Olympics.
My gold Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son bears the name of his father Robert, who died in 2011, at the age of 40, after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept his death, and one of the last things he asked was whether they had tickets for London 2012 - because he wanted to sit on the first row.
"I couldn't tell him "you wouldn't be here to be in the first row," he said.
"I held my hand when he stopped breathing and when he actually stopped breathing and died I finally realized he was invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
"I just knew this was what I had dreamed of all my life -- jumping in front of the home audience of the Olympics, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first choice of song — Pride of Heather Small — that he was turning his head in preparations for the Olympics and that he was still struggling with.
The CD on the empty island of Bi-Bi-Ci Radio 4 is Sunday at 11:15 British summer time.
Mikelson, when he wasn't in shape, was at the bench during the Cup of Ryder on Saturday.
American Phil Mikelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays the 47th Cup Ryder game, but he will have to change his format to avoid an unfortunate turnout.
Michaelson, who played the biennal event, recorded 12th time, was sent to the club by Captain Jim Furik during Saturday's double pairs and fours.
Instead of being in the center of attention, as often represented by the United States, the fifth winner, he divided the time to win and practice his game, on the scale, hoping to correct what he was doing.
He has never been the best leader, even at the top of his career, the 48-year-old is not an ideal choice for the narrow Le Golf Nazional playground, where the far-off rough hits are a regular punishment in the face of neglect.
And if the field itself is not scary enough, Mikelson, in the ninth match on Sunday, is faced with the precise British Oppen Francisco Molinari champion, who plays in pairs with the beginner Tommy Flitwood to win all four matches this week.
If Americans, who miss four points before 12 individual matches, start hard, Mikelson's game can be judgmental.
Furick expressed trust in his man, not that he could see anything else.
"He fully understands the role he had today, touched me behind my back and put his hand around me and said he'd be ready tomorrow," Furik said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He's part of the celebrities and he's been given a lot for these teams last week.
I probably didn't think of him playing two games.
I was thinking more, but that's how it went, and we thought we had to do it.
He wants to play, just like everyone else."
Mikelson's gonna pass Nick Faldo's record for the most played Cup Ryder games on Sunday.
It could be the end of a career in Cup Ryder where he never reached the best results in his individual career.
Mikelson has 18 wins, 20 lost matches and seven-half, although Furik said his presence carries something immaterial to the team.
He's funny, he's sarcastic, sensitive, he wants to joke with people and he's a great man at team meetings," he explained.
"I think younger players were having fun playing with him, as well as this week, which was fun to watch.
He offers a lot more than just a game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows the great leadership can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant lead to individual competitions in the last day of the Cup Ryder can easily turn into an uncomfortable position.
The Danish debuted in Walderama in 1997, when the guy led by Steve Ballesteros had a five-point lead in front of the Americans, but "they crossed the target line only with the noses," with a minimum of 141.2-131.2.
"I remember that we had a great lead in Walderama; we had a great lead in Brooklyn, when we lost in Walderama, when we won for a while," Bjorn said, figuratively, after watching the 2018 class win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday with a 10-6 lead in Le Golf Nazional.
Well, history will show me and everyone on the team that this isn't over.
You're going ready for tomorrow.
Get out and play the right game.
This is not finished as long as the game takes place.
We have a goal, and that's to try to win the trophy, and the focus remains on it.
I say all the time, I focus on 12 players in our team, but we are fully aware of the opposing side - the best players in the world."
Bjorn added: “I don’t want to make premature assessments on this issue.
Tomorrow's game is a different beast.
Tomorrow we are expected to have individual games, and that is different.
It's great to play with a partner when things go well, but when you play individually, then all the skills are tested as a golfer.
That's the message to be sent to the players, to give up tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner and he should give it all up."
Unlike Bjorn, opponent Jim Furik will ask players to play better individually than they played in twos, exceptions are Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who won three points in four.
Furik himself was at the end of the last day's changes, because he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn before he ended up as a loser when Europe performed the "Miracle in Medina"
"I remember every word there," he said when asked about how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, united the players before the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but we want to start as at the last start we saw in Brooklyn, as we saw in Medina.
When the moment goes in a certain direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle competitions.
We set the line properly and the team's order is according to how we feel, you know, we want to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of standing up first and facing Rory McKlroy's most important match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Flitwood and Ian Polter with other Europeans in the most important half of the sequence.
"I decided to act this way with the guys because I think that's how we'll cover it all," Bjorn said about the choice in individual games.
The new German military ship is delayed again
The German Navy's latest fleet was due to be delivered in 2014 to replace the old warships since the Cold War, but it will not happen until at least next year because of the wrong systems and the growing prices, local media reported.
The delivery of Rainland-Falz, the leading ship of the new class of Baden-Witmberg frigates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Di Cate, calling for a military spokesperson.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014 but the problematic issues after delivery prevented the fate of the ambitious project.
The four boats of the Baden-Witmberg class that the Navy ordered in 2007 will be replaced by the old Bremen-class frigates.
It is known that they will contain a powerful gun, a large number of anti-aircraft weapons and marine missiles, as well as some stealth technology, as a reduced radar, infrared and acoustic trail.
Among other important features is the portrait maintenance - it should be possible, the latest fragments, to be absent up to two years from home ports.
The constant delays, however, mean that modern warships - which should enable Germany to have power over the oceans - will already be obsolete as they enter service, notes De Cate.
The F125 accident fleet reached the headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to accept the ship and returned to the Blom and Voz shipyard in Hamburg.
That was the first time the Navy returned the ship to the shipyard after the shipment.
There is little to know about the reasons for the return, but the German media cites a number of key "software and hardware defects" for which the warship was useless if sent to a combat mission.
The software deficiencies were particularly important because the Budden-Witmberg class ships would have a crew of about 120 sailors -- only half of the older crew of the Bremen class.
It has also shown that the ship is drastic over the planned weight that reduces its performance and limits the ability of the sailor to add upgrades in the future.
Rainland-Faltz weighs 7,000 tons and is believed to be twice as difficult as the ships of a similar class that Germany used in World War II.
In addition to the problematic hardware, the cost of the whole project - including crew training - has also become a problem.
It is said that it has reached an incredible 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) -- an increase of the initial €2.2 billion.
The problems faced by the latest frescoes are particularly important because of warnings about Germany’s lower sea power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartelles, head of the German Parliament's Defence Commission, confirmed that the Navy "has been missing ships that could be deployed".
The representative said that the problem had worsened over time, because old ships were withdrawn from service, but were not secured ships for replacement.
He complained that none of the bad guys in the Baden-Wittemberg class could join the Navy.
National Trust Hears the Secret Life of the Lilies
A new survey of property in the Scottish mountainous regions is being carried out in order to find out how the lilys use the area in the search for food.
There is hope that the discoveries will respond to the behavior of unique flying mammals and help in conducting future protection activities.
Studying the scientists of the National Trust for Scotland will follow the ordinary and soprano lily, as well as the caffeine lily with long ears and daubenton lily in Inverow Gardens in Western Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations around the property to track the activities of the lilies during the season.
En-Aich-Es personnel and volunteers will also conduct mobile research using hand detectors.
Expert analysis of the sounds of all the images will determine the frequency depending on the type of lilies.
Then a map of the habitats will be developed to create a detailed picture of their behavior within the area.
Rob Devar, a Nature Protection Advisor in En-Ti-es, hopes that the results will reveal what areas of life are most important to the lilies and how each species uses them.
Such information will help determine the benefits of managing habitats, such as creating meadows and maintaining forests for lilacs and other associated species.
The population of lilacs in Scotland and Britain has declined significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by building and development that affect the beds and losses of dwellings.
Windmills and lights also pose risks, as well as sticky fly belts and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as domestic cat attacks.
The Lilies aren't really blind.
However, because of their nightly fishing habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated echo-location techniques to find insects and obstacles in the flight path.
En-Ti-Es, who is responsible for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of the country, takes the lilys very seriously.
There are ten trained experts who regularly carry out research, sleep inspection, and sometimes rescue.
The organisation even founded the first and only lilac reserve in Scotland at the property of Triv in Damfris and Galovay, which is home to eight of the ten species living in Scotland.
The property manager David Thompson says the property is an ideal territory for them.
"Here in Triv we have an excellent area for lilacs," he said.
"We have old buildings, very old two and very good dwellings.
But there are many unknown things about the lilies, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us learn more about what they need in order to make progress."
He emphasises the importance of checking that there are lilacs before real estate renovations are carried out because the unconscious destruction of the bed can destroy up to 400 women and girls, and destroy the entire local population.
Lilies are protected and are illegal to kill, torture, or disturb or destroy their beds.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official in the Trust for the Protection of Lilies, encourages the public to help.
She said: “We still need to learn a lot about the lilies and our other species, we just don’t know how they live. ”
Ronaldo rejected charges of rape, and lawyers will sue the German magazine
Christian Ronaldo called rape charges "false news", and added that people "want to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which announced the charges.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus is accused of raping an American, named Catherine Mayorga, at a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
Apparently, he then paid her $375.000 so as not to mention the incident, Der Spiegel said on Friday.
Speaking of a live video of Instagram to its 142 million followers, several hours after the charges were filed, Ronaldo, 33, rejected the reports as "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What was issued today is false news," the gold ball winner in front of his camera said.
"They want to promote themselves using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous for mentioning my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and it's all right," the player added laughing.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for the charges, which they called "an unacceptable transfer of privacy concerns", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Sherc said the player would seek damage for "moral damage to the amount corresponding to the seriousness of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
Apparently, the incident that was the subject of the charges occurred in June 2009 in the hotel and casino Palms in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga went back to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her annually, according to documents filed before the court in Clarke area of Nevada.
Majorga claims Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was "99 percent" "good boy", but he dropped under that "one percent".
According to the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that they had sex, but that there was agreement.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police and was taken pictures of her injuries in the hospital, but later agreed to a deal without judicial participation because she was afraid of revenge" and was concerned "that she would be publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old says he is now seeking to change the deal because there are traumas from the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join the Royal Madrid of Manchester United when the alleged attack occurred and this summer he moved to the Italian giant Juventus with an agreement worth 100m euros.
Breggsit: Britain "will always regret" losing car manufacturers
Britain will "always regret" if it loses world leader status in car production after Bregzit, Business Minister Greg Clark said.
He added that it is "disquieting" that Toyota-British has announced to the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement, it will temporarily stop production in the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
Japanese car manufacturer said the impact of border stops in the case of Braggzit without an agreement would cost jobs.
The factory in Burnaston -- produced by Toyota Auris and Avensis -- produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I think if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March there will be a stop to production in our factory," said Marvin Cook, Toyota's managing director in Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in Britain expressed concern about how, when leaving the EU without an agreement, cross-border trade will work, including Honda, Be-em-We and Jaguar Land Rover.
Be-em-We says, for example, he'll close his mini factory in Oxford a month after Bregzit.
The main concerns are related to what car manufacturers call risks to the logistics chain in the case of Braggzit without an agreement.
Toyota's production line works according to the "precisely time" system, where the shares arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in Britain and the EU, for cars according to orders.
If Britain leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be a break at the border which, according to the industry, could cause delays and gaps in parts.
It will be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a daily inventory in the Derbyshire factory, the company said, so the production will stop.
Mr. Clark said Teresa May's plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely made to avoid such border checks".
"We need to have an agreement. We need to have the best agreement that will enable us not only to succeed in what we are going to enjoy in the present, but to seize this opportunity," he said about today's Bi-Bi-Cy Radio 4 programme.
"The evidence not only from Toyota, but also from other producers is that we must be able to continue what a very successful set of logistics chains is".
Toyota could not say how long production would have been stopped, but for a long time warned that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and cost jobs.
Peter Cualaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and is a representative of the trade union in the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “As soon as I lose those jobs, I will never return.
According to a government spokesman: "We have established a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU".
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again, the White House said
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Public Lawyer Rod Rosenstein can be "delayed for another week" because he continues to fight about Brett Cavano's nomination for a judge in the Supreme Court, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates the Russian interference in the elections, the links between Tramp's assistants and Russia, and the potential violation of the laws by the president.
Whether Trump will fire the deputy public defender and thus threaten Miller's independence, he's been encouraging talks in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, New York Times reported that Rosenstein was thinking about carrying a camera to record talks with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But with the release of the reports last Monday, he went to the White House in order to resign.
Instead, the meeting with Trump was scheduled for Thursday because he was then in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he "would not like" to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed in order to avoid a collision with the hearing of the Senate Justice Committee in which he witnessed and Cavano and one of the women charged with sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blacy Ford.
On Friday, Trump issued an order to conduct a one-week investigation by the FBI on charges against Kavano, which would further postpone the Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary Sara Sanders appeared on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The date for the meeting is not yet established, it could be held this week, and it could be postponed for another week in view of all the things that are happening in the Supreme Court.
But we'll see how things are going and I always try to keep the press informed."
Some journalists argue: Sanders has not given a briefing to journalists in the White House since 10 September.
Chief Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the small number of briefings did not depend on the lack of "a great influence" on television journalists, although he added: "I will agree with the fact that they have a great influence."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the media would increase.
"The president organizes several sessions of questions and answers from any president before him," she said, adding without mentioning the evidence: "We have looked at those numbers."
There will still be briefings, says Sanders, but “if the press has a direct chance to ask questions to the president of the United States, it is far better than talking to me.
We're trying to do that more often and you're witnesses that we've been doing it all the time over the past few weeks, and talks with the president of the United States will replace briefings for journalists."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in open sessions or press conferences when visiting senior officials.
He rarely participates in independent press conferences.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why it is so with his uncontrollable and sometimes bizarre appearance in front of the assembled journalists.
Health Secretary with a letter to EU workers employed in Scotland's national health system on Breggsit's fears
The Health Secretary wrote a letter to EU workers employed in Scotland's national health system expressing the country's gratitude and desire to stay after Bregzit.
Jin Freeman, a deputy in the Scottish Parliament, sent this letter less than six months before the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed itself to covering the costs of resolved applications for status for EU citizens working in public services at a lower level.
Mrs. Freeman wrote in her letter: "The negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on withdrawal continued during the summer, in order to make the expected decisions this fall.
However, the United Kingdom government also intensified preparations for the possibility of a non-agreement.
I know this period is very disturbing for all of you.
That's why I wanted to stress how much I appreciate each member's contribution to the workforce, regardless of his nationality.
EU-wide colleagues and more widely share valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the health service work and are useful to the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Kristion Abercromby underwent an emergency operation after he suffered head injury
Kristion Abercromby, the tennis State Tigers' defensive linebacker, was subjected to an emergency operation after he suffered a head injury on Saturday when the team lost 31-27 from "Vanderbilt Commodores", says Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Rod Reed, the chief coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the injury occurred immediately before half-time.
"He came to the side line on the playground and just slumped the country," Reid said.
Coaches and medical personnel gave Abercrombi oxygen outside the playground, and then put it in the closet and carried it to further evaluation.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercromby had come out of surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no information on the type/grade of the injury" and "Tennessee State" is trying to find out when the injury actually occurred.
Abecrombi is a second-year student and plays his first red-haired season in "Tennessee State" after the transfer from Illinois.
He made a total of five clashes on Saturday before leaving the game, resulting in a total of 18 clashes this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when buying property in the United Kingdom
According to Tori's new plans, foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when buying property in the United Kingdom, and these additional funds will be used to help homeless people
This move will neutralise Corbin's attempt to attract young voters
Higher administrative fees will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The ministry expects this move to raise up to 120 million pounds a year, which will be used to help homeless people
Teresa May will today announce that foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when they buy property in the United Kingdom, and these additional funds will be used to help homeless people.
This move will be considered an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbin's attempt to attract young voters with his promises to provide affordable housing and to focus on people with high pay.
The higher administrative fee will be imposed on individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, with additional funds increasing government efforts to improve the situation with homeless people.
The additional amount, which in addition to the current administrative fee, includes the higher levels that were introduced two years ago for a second home and the purchase of property with a view to renting it can reach up to three percent.
The ministry expects this move to raise up to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of London's newly built property is purchased by individuals who are not residents of the United Kingdom, which has led to an increase in prices and has caused difficulties for people who buy property for the first time to get involved in this housing purchase process.
Many rich areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become "spirit cities" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time away from the country.
This new policy was announced only a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked to reduce the administrative fee to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction firms of offering high prices of the property they keep, but did not use it, and asked Mrs. May to change the allocations for accessing homes in order to correct the "sudden housing situation" in Britain.
Mr. Corbin announced a series of attractive domestic reforms, including housing controls and the end of immigration without justifiable reasons.
He also wants to give advice more authority to build new homes.
Mrs. May said: "Last year I said that I would dedicate my prime minister to returning to the British dream, that life would be better for every new generation.
And that means repairing our broken home market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build life here.
However, it is not right for people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as for foreign companies to be able to buy homes as easily as the valuable British residents.
The dream of owning its own home for many people has become too distant, and the humiliation of homeless people is too real."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to run with Scotland"
Jack Ross, head of Sunderland, said his "final ambition" is in the future to become the manager of the national club in Scotland.
Scottish, 42, enjoys the challenge of reviving the club in the northeast, which is currently in the third place in the first league with only three points less than the club at the top.
This summer he moved to the Light Station after returning St. Mirren back to the Scottish Prime Minister League last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B cap and that was it," Ross told the Scottish "Sportsound" of BBC.
"But I grew up looking at Scotland in Hampden with my father and always something dragged me back.
However, I could only get this opportunity if I'm successful in managing the club."
Some of Ross' predecessors as Sunderland's manager are Dick Advokaat, David Moes, Sam Allardice, Martin O'Neil, Roy Kein, Gas Poet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former head of Alloa Athletic says he was not upset to know that he should follow such established names in such a large club after he had previously rejected the offers of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"My success at the moment is assessed with "Can I get this club back to the Premier League?"
Given the structure and facilities of this club, he undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It is not an easy task for this club to get there, but I will probably think that I have achieved success here only if I get the club back there."
Ross works as a manager for only three years, in which he entered the career after he worked as a assistant to the head of Dumbarton and after a 15-month engagement as part of the Hearts training staff.
Then he helped Alloa secure from the fall of the third league and returned St. Mirren from losing his title in the next season.
Ross says he now feels more comfortable than playing in "Clyde", "Hartlepool", "Falkirk", "St. Mirren" and "Hamilton Academic".
"That was probably a true crusade for me," he recalls at the adoption of Alloa.
"I honestly believed that career as a manager is the right choice for me, better choice than career as a player.
It sounds weird because I was doing well, making enough money for it, and enjoying certain high benefits.
But building a career as a player can be a real challenge.
There's a lot of things you need to go through on a weekly basis.
I still go through certain things in terms of stress and work pressure, but I just feel good about the manager’s role.
I've always wanted to be a manager and now I'm doing this, and I feel more comfortable in this role than ever in my adult life."

According to one study, the perfect beer time is 5:30 a.m. on Saturday
The summer heat wave has led to an increase in the profits of British pubs, which are currently in a very difficult situation, but has imposed increased pressure on restaurant chains.
The figures show that pubs and bars saw an increase in sales of 2.7 per cent in July, but the profits of restaurants decreased by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin of the CGA for business consulting services in determining these figures said: "Suntime and longer than the expected participation of England in the World Cup meant that the situation in July was similar to that in June, when the profits of the pubs increased by 2.8 percent, and the restaurants decreased significantly.
The fall in sales of 1.8 per cent of restaurants in June has worsened in July.
The pubs and bars where drinkers are mostly sold saw much more growth compared to the previous years compared with the restaurants where a decline was observed.
The pubs where food is sold mostly were also badly hit by the solar periods, although not as dramatic as the owners of restaurants.
It seems that people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In successful pubs and bars, the sale of beverages increased by 6.6 percent during the month, and the sale of food by only three percent.
Paul Newman, an analyst for vacation and hospitality from "RSM", said: "These results follow the trend we saw at the end of April.
The time and impact of major social and sporting events remain the most important factors when it comes to the sale of the market outside the home.
It is not surprising at all that restaurants are still in a difficult situation, although the fall in sales of 4.8 per cent over a year will be particularly devastating as a complement to current pressures resulting from costs.
The long warm summer could not have come at a worse time for local owners where food is mostly sold, and time would show whether the more moderate temperatures we had in August would provide the much needed rest."
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including the newly opened ones, accounted for 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the stop in publishing new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker's sales monitoring device in the pubs, bars and restaurants sector in the United Kingdom collects and analyzes data on the efficiency of the same 47 operational groups with a combined revenue of over 9 billion pounds and represents a determined repertoire for the industry.
One of the five children has a secret profile of social media that hides it from their parents
One study showed that one of the five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, has a secret profile of social media that hides from their parents and teachers
Research involving 20,000 secondary schools showed an increase in the number of "false Instagram" profiles
News Increases Fear That Such Profiles Reveal Sexual Content
Twenty percent of students said they have a "main" profile that they show their parents
One of the five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, creates a profile of social media that hides it from adults.
Research involving 20,000 secondary schools showed a rapid increase in the number of "false Insta" profiles, a shortcut for the Instagram website where photos are shared.
The news has raised the fear that such profiles contain sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said they have a clean "main" profile that they show their parents, and they also have other private profiles.
A mother who accidentally found the secret profile of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who asks others "to rape her."
The research carried out by Digital Awareness UK and The Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) in independent schools showed that 40 percent of children between the ages of 11 and 18 have two profiles, and half of them have admitted that one of them is a secret.
HMC chief Mike Bukenan said: "It is really disturbing that so many teenagers are trying to create online profiles where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Elid Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" of the Scottish Athletics committee
Elid Doyle has been elected as a non-executive director of the Scottish Athletics Committee of the annual General Meeting of the Governing Body.
Doyle is the most outstanding athlete in Scotland, and President Ian Bitti described the move as an excellent opportunity for those who are part of the leadership in this sport to take advantage of its extensive international experience gained over the past decade.
"All in the Scottish, British and world athletic community have great respect for Elid, and we are sure that athletes in Scotland would benefit greatly if she became a member of the committee," Bitty said.
Doyle said: "I am ready to be the voice of athletes and I hope I can really make my contribution and help in the proper direction of sport in Scotland."
The American who won the titles of 200 and 400 metres of the Atlanta Games in 1996, in addition to the total of four gold medals won at the Olympic Games, and who now appears regularly as a commentary on BBC, could not go after having suffered a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote to Twitter: “One month ago, I received a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors told me that only time would show me whether or not to what extent.
The whole process was grounded, but I was able to completely tighten up, I can go again and practice agility!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!"
An advertising for a breast pump where mothers are compared to cows causes a division of Internet opinions
The chest pump production company caused a division of Internet opinions when it announced an advertisement in which nursing mothers compare to cow milling.
To mark the launch of a product that is said to be "the most innovative breast pump in the world", user-oriented technology company Elvie has published a funny advertisement inspired by the music videos to show the freedom that the new pump provides to the mothers who come in.
Four mothers dance in a cow barn full of sand on a song whose text sounds like this: "Yes, I use milk, but you don't see a tail" and "If you haven't noticed this doesn't go away, these are my breasts."
It goes on to say: "Pump, pump, feed the babies, pump, pump, pump."
However, the advertisement published on Facebook by the company caused internet controversy.
With 77,000 reviews and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from the viewers, with many saying it highlights the "horribles" of the dairy industry.
"It is indeed a bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
They, just like we should be pregnant and born so they can produce milk, except for the fact that their children are stealing from them only a few days after they are born," one of the comments said.
Elvie's breast pump discreetly fits into the nursing home ("Elvie")
Another comment states: “It is understandable that this is traumatic for both mother and baby.
But, yes, why don't you use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who keep their babies?"
Someone else added: “Really inappropriate advertising. ”
Others, on the other hand, defended the advertisement, and one woman admitted that she felt that the song was really "smiley."
"I think this idea is brilliant.
I'd buy a pump like this if I was still in touch.
I felt just like a cow.
The commercial is a little crazy, but I think it's honest.
It's a genius product," one of the comments said.
Another commented: "This is a fun commercial designed for mothers who use milk (often at their workplaces or in toilets) and feel like "cows."
This doesn't claim to be missing or condemning the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women discover that they were dancing while discreet pumps were being tapped in their garden.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the attitude that many women who use milking pumps say they feel like cows.
However, Elvie's pump is completely quiet, no wires, no tubes, and discreetly fit into the breast-feeding garden, giving women the freedom to move, keep their babies, and even get out of the house while breast-feeding.
Anna Balarin, partner and DDR in "Mother" commented: "Elvie's pump is really a revolutionary product and deserves courageous and provocative launch.
By setting a parallel between women who use milk and cows, we wanted to use milk with the help of a pump and the challenges that we bring to the center of attention, showing the incredible sense of freedom that brings the new pump in a fun and closer way.
This is not the first time Elvie's pump is present in all titles.
During the fashion week in London, the mother of two children appeared on the fashion track for designer Martha Jacobovski carrying the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of children in detention has increased significantly, although the monthly border crossings remained relatively unchanged, partly due to the fact that sharp rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to accommodate children in sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors themselves were unrecorded immigrants and were afraid of the threat of their own stay in the country if they wanted to be a child's sponsor.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their families would have to submit fingerprints and that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Matthew Albens, a senior immigration officer and customs officer, witnessed before the Congress last week that the agency arrested dozens of people who applied for the sponsorship of minors without membership.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the arrested have no prior criminal record.
"Almost 80 percent of individuals who are either sponsors or family members of sponsors illegally reside in the country, and most of them are foreigners with criminal records.
That is why we continue to pursue those individuals," said Mr. Albens.
In order to deal with children more quickly, the authorities introduced new rules that some of them would be required to appear in court within one month after they were arrested, not within 60 days, as security officials say the previous standard was voted.
Many of them will appear through a conference video call, not personally, in order to issue their case for legal status before the immigration judge.
Those who are considered unfit for relief will be deported immediately.
The longer the children stay in custody, the more likely they will become upset and depressed, which may lead to violent escapes or attempts to escape, the shelter workers and reports that have appeared from the system in the past few months say.
Lawyers say such problems have increased in larger objects such as Thornillo, where there is a greater likelihood of neglect of child facing difficulties.
They added that moving children to the tent city without providing them with enough time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to their friends could increase the traumas most of them are already facing.
Syria told US, French and Turkish "occupational forces" to withdraw immediately
In his address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid al-Mulem has called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the country's war has lasted for eight years.
Mualem, who is also acting as Deputy Prime Minister, said foreign forces were illegally staying in Syria's territory on the ground that they were participating in the fight against terrorism and that "they would act accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and without setting conditions," he told the assembly.
Mualem insisted that "the war against terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people lost their lives since 2011, and millions were displaced from their homes.
He said Damascus will continue "to lead this world battle until we clear all Syrian territories" from both terrorist groups and "every illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, most of whom are trained and advised by Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in the territory of this country destroyed by the war.
Regarding the issue of refugees, Mualem said the conditions are good for them to return and he accused "some of the Western countries" of "spreading Iranian fears" that encourage refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They are politicizing the question that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union warned that Syria would not receive reconstruction aid until a political agreement was reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on setting up a buffer zone in Idlib's last major rebel campaign created an opportunity for progress in political talks.
The Russian-Turkey agreement has prevented a major attack by the Russian-supported Syrian forces against the province where three million people live.
However, Mualem stressed that the deal has "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that the military action will be directed towards the jihadists, including the Nusra Front fighters associated with Al-Qaeda, who will "be rooted".
UN representative Stefan de Mistura hopes that he will soon convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of government members and opposition in order to prepare a lasting constitution for Syria and open the way to elections.
Mualem determined the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the panel's work should be limited to "reviewing members of the current constitution," and warned of the consequences of further interference in the same.
Why Trump's gonna win a second term
According to that logic, Mr. Trump will win the 2020 elections again unless his presidential mandate is temporarily interrupted by implicence and scandal, which is likely to be hoped for by a large part of the Liberals.
What will undoubtedly be "the most dramatic finale in the presidency that has ever been seen!"
From now on, there's no sign of fatigue in the audience.
Since 2014, the impact time rating has increased more than double and reached 1.05 million in CNN and has almost tripled and reached 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Nilsen says that Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in impact time, which is 1.7 million more compared to the period four years ago, and The Rachel Maddow Show of MSNBC reached the top cable rating with about 3.5 million viewers in the evenings when important news is announced.
"This is like a fire that people feel attracted to because this is not something we understand," says Neil Baer, the leading television producer of the "Designated Survivor" drama of "ABC" for a cabinet secretary who becomes president after the Capitol is destroyed by the attack.
Nel Skovell, a veteran in the writing of comedy and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking into the Hollywood Boys' Club," has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
She asked why.
"He answered, "Because I think he's really funny," Mrs. Skowel told me.
There's a certain amount of fun in the whole mess.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, stories coming out of Washington can determine the future of the Roe versus Wade case, whether immigrant families can reunite, as well as the welfare of the global economy.
Exclusion from all of this is a luxury that only privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you are no longer an uninformed citizen when you've been watching a six-hour panel of experts who are debating the use of the source of "deep background" by Bob Woodward for his book Fair, a bomber jacketed by Paul Manafort's skin from $15,000 (a dress with fat arrogance), as he called "The Washington Post", and the implications of Mr. Tramp's anatomy by Stormy Daniels.
I, for example, will never be able to see Super Mario the same way.
"Part of what he does and what makes you feel like watching a real show is that every night he brings you something new," said Brent Montgomery, Chief Executive Director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and Maker of Pawn Stars for the tramp show's rotating team and day-to-day transformations (NFL coaches, compliments Kim Jong-un).
You must not allow yourself to miss an episode because then you will not be able to compensate.
When I visited Mr. Fles this week, it was sunny and the temperature was 80 degrees outside his house on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was locked in and watching "MSNBC" while shooting "CNN".
He could not stop watching, at least not when Brett Cavano was supposed to face the Senate Justice Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was in critical condition.
"I remember making all those crazy shows in the past and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization."
"I thought it was a joke, but it turned out they were right."

Influenza of foreign funds in the toughest mid-term elections in the Upper House race
It is not surprising that the 17th Congressional Area in Pennsylvania is receiving a large amount of funds thanks to the reorganization of congressional areas from where there are two candidates in the race for the same place.
For this recently reconstructed urban area in Pittsburgh, the Democratic Representative Connor Lamb, who took place in another area of the extraordinary elections last spring, is running.
Lamb is competing with another candidate, Republican Kittfus, who currently represents the old 12th Congressional Area, which is largely connected to the new 17th Congressional Area.
The maps were modified after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January decided that the old areas were manipulated for the benefit of the Republicans, which is contrary to the constitution.
The race in the new 17th Congressional Area is a tough competition for funding campaigns between the party's main sponsors, the Congressional Campaign Committee of the Democratic Party (‘DCCC’) and the National Campaign Committee of the Republican Party (‘NRCC’).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the 18th Congressional Region of Pennsylvania held in March, which was characterized by broad media coverage.
For more than a decade, this place has been occupied by a Republican, and President Donald Trump has won an area unlike 20 points.
Political experts give the democracies little advantage.
The United States decided to punish El Salvador for supporting China, and then gave up.
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing under low pressure by Washington.
Mr. Trump in June 2017 had a friendly meeting with Panama's president Juan Carlos Varela and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners drove out the management team of the Trump organisation.
State Department officials decided to withdraw US heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of "the recent decisions not to recognise Taiwan anymore," said Heder Nawert, State Department spokesman in his statement at the beginning of this month.
However, only with regard to El Salvador were punishments, which received US aid of around US$ 140 million in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, including a reduction in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have a detrimental effect on the country in Central America and high unemployment and homicide rates in the country.
As internal meetings were progressing, North and Central American representatives postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity in order to hold a similar gathering last year, which was considered a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from heading towards the United States.
But by mid-September, senior administrative officials stressed that they wanted the conference to progress and effectively put an end to any thought about El Salvador's punishment.
Vice-President Mike Pens should address the conference scheduled for mid-October as a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the assembly, the diplomats say.
And the three American representatives quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without bringing news of heavy messages or punishments from Washington.
The spokesperson for the White House for Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American representatives, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal thoughts about the state of anonymity.
Their positions were supported by an external analyst who was close to the administration and who was also talking about the state of anonymity.
Learn History
The next thing that might happen is to publish the Special Adviser Robert Miller's report on possible obstruction of justice by Mr. Tramp, which is currently very strong evidence in public records.
Mr. Miller is allegedly also pointing his investigation into the fact that Mr. Trump's campaign is linked to Russia in its attack on our elections.
If the composition of Congress has changed, Mr. Trump will have to shoulder responsibility in that body as he prepares to appear before the voters again, and perhaps even before the jury composed of his colleagues.
There are many uncertainties here, and I do not want to suggest that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable, not to his colleagues in Europe.
All of us on both sides of the Atlantic need to make certain choices that will affect the duration of this struggle.
In 1938, German officials were ready to strike Hitler if the West opposed him and supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of the massacre that followed.
The course of history revolves around such points of change, and the unmistakable march of democracy is accelerating or delaying.
Americans are now facing several such points of change.
What if Mr. Trump gave up Deputy Public Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mr. Miller's investigation?
Rosenstein is on the hot chair after this paper announced that last year he proposed secretly to film the president and speculated that he was unfavorable about what he was doing.
Mr. Rosenstein says the information published in "The Times" is incorrect.
"How will we act if Brett Cavano's new investigation requested by the F.B.I. is incomplete or unjust, or if he proves his innocence before the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the middle of the election for the Congress that will charge Mr. Trump?
If we fall into all these tests, democracy is waiting for a long winter.
But I believe it won't happen because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me to light candles for Saturday at a table with a systic logo.
With such an inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about the future?"

Graham Dorans of "Rangers" with optimistic attitude in front of the Rapid Vienna conflict
"Rangers" are hosts of the Rapid Vienna match on Thursday, and they are aware of the fact that after the unresolved game against "Villarreal" in Spain at the beginning of this month, victory over Austria will strengthen their position to qualify in Group G in the League of Europe.
Graham Dorens, a middle-ranking player for knee injury, was prevented from appearing in the season until the unresolved game 2-2 with "Villarreal", but he believes that "Rangers" can use that result as a jumpboard towards greater achievements.
"That was a good point for us because "Villarreal" is a good opponent," the 31-year-old player said.
"We entered the game believing that we could achieve something and returned with a winning point.
We might have been able to give a little more in the end, but the unresolved result was probably a fair one.
They were better in the first half, and we gave our best in the second half, and we were better.
On Thursday, another great European night awaits us.
I hope we win three points, but it'll be a tough game because they had a good result in the last game, but I'm sure with the support of the fans we'll come back and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely a difficult year in view of everything that happened — my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now there is a positive factor in the place.
The team is good and the boys really enjoy it; training is good.
I hope that now we can move forward, leave the past season behind and succeed."
Women can't sleep at night because of this fear associated with pension savings
Although participants in the study had a clear view of the way in which they wanted to be cared for, few spoke to family members about it.
About half of the participants in the study conducted by the Nationwide said they had talked to their mates about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want their family to take care of them, but they don't take steps to discuss the same," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationalwide Animal Insurance Company.
Here's where you should start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide for you if you do not share your wishes with them in advance.
Work with your counselor and your family, and discuss where and how you can get it because such choices can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Include your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for those expenses.
Your choice to finance long-term care can include a traditional long-term care policy, a hybrid life-insurance policy in cash, which can help you cover your expenses or provide yourself with your own funds, if you have them.
Manage your legal documents: Avoid legal battles at the beginning.
Take full care so that you can empower a trusted person to supervise your medical care and ensure that health professionals respect your wishes if you are not able to communicate.
Think, too, about your financial resources.
In this way, they would choose a person with confidence to make financial decisions on your behalf and pay your bills if you are not able to do so on your own.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your older parent needs urgent medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about the medicines he drinks and his allergies?
Note these details in a written form to be prepared.

A man shot several times with an air rifle in Ilfracomb
A man was shot several times with an air rifle as he returned home from his departure.
The victim of about 40 years of age was in the Oxford Groov area of Ilfracomb when he was shot in the chest, stomach, and arm.
Police officers described the shooting, which occurred around 02:30 BST (british summer time) as "accident act."
The victim didn't see his attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police appeal to the Witnesses to help.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died of a severe earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials reported, expecting an increase in the number of victims.
Due to the interruption of the communications, aid workers cannot get information from Dongala County, a region north of Pala, which is closer to the 7.5-degree earthquake epicenter.
More than 16,000 people from Palau were evacuated after the disaster.
Several key facts about Palu and Dongala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulavesi, located at the end of the close bay on the western coast of the island of Sulavesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40-year-old when it was hit by the earthquake and tsunami.
Dongala is a district that extends more than 300 kilometers (180 miles) to the coast of the northwest of the island of Sulavesi.
The district, which represents an administrative region within the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of income for the economy of the province of Central Sulavesi, especially in the coastal region of Dongala.
The extraction of nickel is also an important activity in the province, but mainly concentrated in Morovali, on the opposite coast of Sulavesi.
Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency says that Palau and Dongala have been hit by tsunami several times over the past 100 years.
In 1938, tsunamis killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongala.
tsunamis also struck West Dongala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is in the seismic Pacific ring of fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years are:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on 26 December provoked tsunamis that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean, more than half of them were residents of Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra by the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island, on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-degree earthquake hit the southern part of Java, the most populated island in Indonesia, causing tsunamis that destroyed the southern coast, killing almost 700 people.
2009: 7.6-degree earthquake hit the area near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake hit one of the Mentawaj islands near Sumatra, causing tsunamis that reached up to 10 meters and destroyed tens of villages, killing about 300 people.
2016: Earthquake with a flashlight hit the Pidi Jaya District in Aceh, while causing deserts and panics because it reminded people of the deadly earthquake and tsunamis in 2004.
This time the earthquake did not cause tsunamis, but more than 100 people were killed by fallen buildings.
2018: Great earthquakes hit the tourist island Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and caused thousands of tourists to be temporarily trapped.
Sarah Palin's oldest son was arrested for charges of family violence
Trek Palin, the oldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice-President Sara Palin was arrested for charges of assault.
Palin, 29, from Vasil, Alaska, was arrested in suspicion of family violence, interfering in a report on family violence and resisting arrest, according to a report published on Saturday by police officers in Alaska.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police and report alleged crimes, he picked up her phone.
Palin is at Mat-Su detention facility with the possibility of leaving if he pays $500, KTUU said.
On Saturday he appeared in court, where he said he was "definably innocent" when asked how he was explained before the court, they said from the network.
Palin faces three A-class violations, which means he can be sentenced to a prison sentence for up to a year and a 250,000-dollar fine.
He is also charged with a B-class violation, a one-day prison sentence and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time they've had criminal charges against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case before the Alaska Veteran Court is now under way.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, interfering with the report on criminal acts of domestic violence and possession of arms under the influence of alcohol in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend said he allegedly hit her on the face.
Sarah Palin was criticised by the vet groups in 2016, after she said that her son's violent behavior stems from the PTSN, a consequence of his service in Iraq.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after the earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 - degree earthquake caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been cut off, and the number of victims is expected to increase in the next few days.
The earthquake hit the area near Central Sullivan, which is located northeast of Indonesia’s capital, Jakarta.
Social media broadcast videos showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for the beach festival in Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are looking for a rare death penalty for the suspect of a terrorist attack in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York are looking for a death penalty for Syfolo Saipov, the suspect of a terrorist attack in New York in which eight people died, a rare sentence that has not been committed in the federal crime state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly used a home depot's rental truck in October to launch an attack on the West Side motorway in Lower Manhattan and to pass through the pedestrians and bikers on his way.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will need to prove that Saipov "intended" the eight victims and "intended" serious bodily injuries, according to a report on the intention to request a death penalty delivered in the South District of New York.
According to court documents, there is the possibility of a death sentence on both grounds of the indictment.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal grand jury filed an accusation against Saipov on 22 grounds, including eight charges of murder for the purposes of retrieval, which are usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, as well as an accusation of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
"Detailed planning and thought were needed to carry out the attack," the prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov did it as "grossful, cruel and deceptive."
"Syfolo Habibulaevic Saipov challenged, injured, damaged and lost the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nikolas Cleves, En-Lore Dekat, Daren Drake, Ariel Erley, Hernán Ferci, Hernán Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucho," the state's announcement on its intention said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since there was a death penalty case in the South District of New York.
The accused, Calid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers, but eventually he was sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for July and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been executed after being sentenced to a espionage conspiracy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both were sentenced to a death sentence with an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
The police reported that he had told the researchers that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after seeing videos of ISIS on his phone.
The police also reported that he had asked to place the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
He explained that he was innocent on all 22 grounds of the charge.
David Paton, one of the allied public defenders represented by Saipov, said they were "evidently disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek a death penalty instead of accepting confession of guilt and sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of release will only continue the trauma of these events for all involved," Paton said.
Saipov's defense had previously asked the prosecutors not to seek a death penalty.
Party MP Tori says Najgel Faraj should be responsible for Bregzit's negotiations
Nigel Faraz today, during the protest of the Tori party's conference, promised that he would "mobilise the people's army".
Former party leader Ukip said politicians must "feel the heat" of the Eurosceptics, where one of Teresa May's MPs suggested he is responsible for negotiations with the EU.
Conservative supporter Peter Bon of the march in Birmingham said the United Kingdom would have been "outside the EU" if Mr. Faraz was the secretary for Braggzit.
But the challenge faced by Mrs. May in terms of bringing her deeply divided members together was highlighted by counter-Bregzit members of the Tori party who joined a special protest against Breggzit held in the city.
The prime minister is trying to continue implementing the Chekers plan despite the attacks by pro-Breggsit people, counter-Breggsit people and the EU.
The Allies insisted that it would continue its efforts to reach agreement with Brussels despite strong reactions and that it would force the Eurosceptics and the Labour Party members to choose between its package and its chaos.
Mr. Bon said at the Pro-Breggzit the Left Means Leave Assembly in Solihal that he wanted to "reject the Chekers plan".
He suggested that Mr. Faraz should be involved and that he should be given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was in charge of the negotiations, we would have been out of the EU so far," he said.
The Ambassador of Wellingborough added: "I will support Bregzit, but we must reject the Chekers plan."
Expressing his position against the EU, he said: "We did not fight in world wars so that we would now be subject.
We want to create our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bon rejected the suggestion that the public opinion changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people changed their opinion and wanted to remain in the EU is completely inaccurate."
Andrea Jenkins, a member of the Tori and pro-Bregzit party, was also present at the march and told reporters: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to people.
The Chekers plan is not well accepted by the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not well accepted by our party and our activists who are actually those who go out on the streets and who owe our victory to the elections.
Please give up the Chekers plan and start listening to us."
In a message addressed to Ms. May, she added: "The prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr. Faraz of the assembly said that politicians must "feel the heat" if they intend to hand over the decision that was made to the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of trust between us, people, and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Bregzit, and we're here today to tell them that "we won't let you get away with it."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is about to betray Bregzit, feel the heat.
"We mobilize this country's people's army, which has enabled us to win the Bregzit and which will not stop until we become independent, self-government and proud of the United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, counter-Bregzit people marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour assembly downtown.
After the group's meeting, a small number of activists who wore banners called "Torians Against Braggsit" appeared this weekend.
Lord Adonis, a member of the Laburist Party, laughed at the conservatives about the security issues facing the opening of the conference regarding the party's application.
"These are people who tell us that they can establish IT systems and all the technology needed for Canada plus, for the border without control, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a complete farce.
There's nothing called a good Braggzit," he added.
Warren plans to think well about the presidential candidacy
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says "will think well of the candidacy for president" after the November elections.
Boston Globe reported that the representative of the Democratic Party of Massachusetts was talking about his future during the city assembly in Western Massachusetts this Saturday.
Warren, an honest critic of President Donald Trump, will be running again in November against the Republican Party's official Jeff Dil, who was co-chair of the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She was at the centre of speculation that could replace Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holiok was her 36th meeting with voters after Trump came to the presidential office, where maintenance uses the format of a city assembly.
One of the audience asked if he was planning to run for president.
Warren said it's time for "women to go to Washington to fix our corrupt government, including putting women on top."
Arrested suspect for the shooting and death of basketballer Sims from the LSU team
The Baton Rouge police said on Saturday that the suspect for shooting and death of basketball player Wade Sims from the LSU team that happened on Friday was arrested.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced Diton Simpson's 20th arrest at the 11 o'clock press conference.
They posted a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help to identify the man from the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus early Friday morning.
"Ved Sims had a gunshot wound in his head and as a result of the same death," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, "247sports" said.
Wade was involved in defending his friends and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being present at the scene of the crime, possessed weapons, and shot at Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and arrested in the Parish Police Department of the Eastern Baton Rouge.
As a 192-inch-high junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played 32 games with 10 events during the past season, i.e. on average 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 caught balls after the match.
Grand Pri in Russia: Luis Hamilton is closer to the world title after the team with its orders secures victory over Sebastian Vetel
From the time that Walter Botas qualified in front of Louis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that Mercedes' team's orders would play a major role in the race.
From the semi-position Botas had a good start and almost left Hamilton on the cedilla while defending his position in the first two circles and invited Vettel to attack his co-player.
The wind entered the box first and let Hamilton fight the movement at the end of the group, something that should have played a decisive role.
Mercedes entered the box one round later and came behind Vetel, but Hamilton went forward after the action of one who made Ferrari's driver reluctantly leave the interior of his free risk to remain side by side after the double move to defend himself on the third corner.
Max Versapen started from the back row of the network and on his 21st birthday at the end of the first round ended in seventh place.
Then he led most of the race and directed the tires to his car in order to reach the finish line and reach Kimmy Raikonen, taking fourth place.
He finally entered the 44th round box, but couldn't increase the rate in the remaining eight rounds, so Raikonen came to fourth.
It's a hard day today because Walter's done a great job all weekend and he's been a real gentleman letting me pass.
The team has made a truly exclusive decision to have its two in the race," Hamilton said.
That was a really bad speech on the body.
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Diana Finnstein at the Saturday meeting on her insistence that she did not publish a letter from Christine Blassy Ford accusing the Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavano of sexual assault.
In his speech at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to Ford's testimony before the Senate Justice Committee, but commented that what is happening in the Senate has shown that people are "bad and unfair and dishonest."
"There is only one thing that can happen, and the wonderful thing is that in what is happening in the Senate in the last few days you can see anger, people who are angry and angry and ruthless and sincere," he said.
"When you see releases and leaks of information and they say "Oh, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me."
Do You Remember?
Diana Finstein, did you publish this information?
You remember her answer... did you publish the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't publish it."
Wait a minute, then.
Did we publish it... no, we didn't publish it," he added, imitating the senator.
Until Finestein was sent a letter of information on the charges against Cavano by Ford in July, and they were published in early September, but Finestein denied that the flow of information came from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't publish her story," Finnstein told the committee, "The Hill" said.
"She asked me to keep them confidential and I did what she asked for."
But it seems that the president did not believe her denial, so he commented on the same meeting on Saturday: “I will tell you one thing, it was a really bad talk on the body.
She may not have done it, but it was the worst speech I've ever seen on the body."
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court candidate, who was charged with three women's sexual abuse, the president suggested that the Democrats use instructions to achieve their own goals.
"They are determined to restore power in any way.
You can see their evil, shame, they don't care who they're gonna hurt, who they're gonna have to step back to regain their power and control," the president said as Mediaite said.
"Dundee Stars" 5-3 "Belfast Giants"
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants match against Dundee
Dundee Stars rewarded for losing the match in the elite league on Friday against Belfast Giants by winning the 5-3 match in Dandi on Saturday.
"Giants" have gained advantage from two goals achieved by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bovillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Coney took advantage of the host before Dwyer to restore the leadership of the Giants.
Francoa Bushar has equally for Dundee before Lucas Lundwald Nielsen to secure their victory with his two goals.
This was the third defeat in the season under the elite league for Adam Kifi's boys, who returned with the victory over Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth meeting between the two sides of the season, with Giants winning in the previous three matches.
The chance for Dwyer came in the fourth minute, i.e. at 3:35 with the addition of Kendal McFol, which was secured by David Rutherford while Bovillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
This was a quick opening of the match, Sullivan secured the host's leadership at 13:10, before Matt Mercart to assist Kauni to achieve the result at 15:16.
Dwyer took care of the Giants to take the lead until the first break, when he reached the second goal for the night at the end of the first period.
The host regrouped and Bushard returned them with a powerful game and goal, with the result at 27:37.
Couni and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nilsen for the first time to secure the leadership of Dundee in the match late in the second period and he secured the victory of his team in half the last period of the fifth match .
Giants, who lost four of their last five matches, will play their next match on Friday on a home field in Milton Kanes.
Flight controller killed by helping hundreds of people on the plane to escape the earthquake
A flying controller in Indonesia is famous as a hero after he died helping a plane with hundreds of people to fly safely.
More than 800 people have died, and many have disappeared since the great earthquake hit the island of Sulavesi on Friday, causing tsunamis.
Strong sequential earthquakes continue to ravage the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing to save their own lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave the position in the control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufrei Airport in Palu that was constantly sneezing.
He remained in his position to ensure that the Batik Air aircraft with flight number 6321 that was then on the runway would fly safely.
Then he jumped out of the control tower at the moment he thought the tower was crashing.
He died later in the hospital.
Johannes Sirait, spokesperson for Air Navigation Indonesia, said it probably saved hundreds of lives, Australian ABC News said.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter got to Palau.
"This news broke our hearts," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of victims can reach thousands, and disaster mitigation agency says access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Butong is limited.
"It is believed that the number of victims is increasing because many bodies are still under the urinals, while many cannot even access them," said Sotopo Purvo Nugroho's spokesman.
The dams that reached up to six meters devastated Pala, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are carrying aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother said about Sky News: "The quick help carries bodies every minute.
There's not enough clean water.
The mini-circuits are robbed everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said about CNN: "The Red Cross in Indonesia is quick to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get even worse."
Indonesia’s president, Yoko Vidodo, arrived in Palo on Sunday and told the national army: “I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all evacuation-related tasks.
Are you ready?" said CNN.
At the beginning of this year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Micronesian plane crash: "Air Niugini" now says a man disappeared after the fall of the plane in the lagoon
The airline that operated the plane that fell into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says a man has disappeared, after previously declared that the 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the plane that tunnelled.
The Air Niugini said they could not find the male passenger from Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it works with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to try to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or citizenship.
Local boats helped save other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at Chuck Island Airport.
On Friday, officials announced that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers stayed at the hospital on Saturday and that everyone was in stable condition.
The cause of the accident, as well as the exact order of events, remains unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy reported that the plane hit the lagoon near the track.
Some Witnesses thought the plane was missing the runway.
American passenger Bill Janes said the plane was flying very low.
"It's an extremely good job," Janes said.
Janes said he and others were able to cross the water that reached them half and head for emergency exits on the plane that flew.
He said that the stewards were panicking and shouting, as well as that he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that sailors working near the port reconstruction also helped save the ship by taking people aboard the coast before the plane sinking about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Air Safety Network show that 111 people have died in an accident of airlines registered in the PNG in the last two decades, but none of them have included Air Niugini.
Analyst established a time frame at night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor ended by presenting the case on Saturday for the retrial of the man who was accused of having burned a woman in Missip alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst from the U.S. Ministry of Justice, witnessed for hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
He pointed out to the jury that he used phone records to connect the movements of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers the night she died.
Rowlett said he received information about the location of several mobile phones showing that Teleis was with Chambers on the night of her death, which is contrary to his previous statements, "The Clarion Ledger" said.
When it was reported that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford was interrogated on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked whether Tellis was telling the truth saying he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he knew Chambers about two weeks when she died.
Phone records show that they only knew for a week.
Rowlett said some time after Chambers died, Tellis erased Chambers' messages and calls, as well as her contact information from her phone.
"He erased it from his life," Hale said.
The defence should present its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the jury to decide on the case later that day.
"The High Breed: What is a conscious hip-hop?
Hip-hop trio wants to kill the negative attitude of this genre by including positive messages in his music.
Bristol's "The High Breed" claims that the hip-hopt is far from its origin as a music with political messages aimed at solving social problems.
They want to get back to his roots and repopulate the conscious hip-hop.
Artists such as "The Fugees" and "Common" have recently experienced their life through artists such as "Akala" and "Lowkey".
Another black woman?
New York Grandmother sues a married couple for being fired after sending a "racist" message
A New York nanny complains about a married couple because she was fired on the basis of discrimination after she received a message from the mother who complained that she was "one more black woman".
The couple denied that they were racist, saying the lawsuit was actually a "surcharge".
Linci Plasco-Faxman, the mother of two children, was disappointed when in 2016 after the first working day of the new nurse, Giselle Morris, learned that she was black.
"NOEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her to Mrs. Morris, and that twice.
After she realized what Plasco-Faxman had actually done, feeling "uneasy" she fired Mrs. Morris, saying that their friendly nanny, who is an African-American, had a bad job and that instead she expected the nanny to be from the Philippines, said "New York Post".
Mrs. Morris was paid for her first working day and was then sent home to Uber.
Now Morris sues the couple and seeks compensation for the loss of $350 a day for six months, a commitment that will involve her living with her family, what she was initially engaged in, but without an agreement.
"I want to show them not to do such things," she said for "Post" on Friday, while adding "I know it's discrimination."
The couple returned to the charges of racistness, saying that Ms. Morris' dismissal was a reasonable procedure because they feared that they could no longer trust her after they had offended her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't think.
She's not racist.
We are not racist," said husband Joel Plasco for Post.
"But would you trust your children in the face of what you were rude, even when you were wrong?
Your new baby?
Let's be real."
Said the lawsuit was "suffering", Plasco said his wife had given birth to the baby only two months ago and that she was in a "very difficult situation".
"Will you attack someone who is in such a situation?
That's not very nice," the investment banker added.
Although the legal case is still ongoing, the public immediately condemns the couple of social media, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington publishers fear that readers will not be able to connect to a sword that speaks, is found in the new letter
Karen Jankel, the daughter of Bond, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said regarding the letter: “It is really hard to put yourself in the place of someone who reads the book for the first time before it is published.
It's very interesting that we now know all this about the huge success of Paddington.
After saying that her father who worked as a cameraman for BBC before getting inspiration to write a little toy book in the form of a sword, would still be optimistic if his work was not well accepted, she added that the 60-year-old of publishing the book was "and bitter and sweet" after his death last year.
For Padington, whom she describes as "very important member of our family," she adds that her father felt silent pride over his potential success.
"He was a really quiet man and he didn't want to be missed at all," she said.
"But since you felt "Padington" so real, it was almost like having a child who achieved something in life: and you are proud of him even though success does not owe you alone.
I think Padington's success was taken in this way.
Although it was about creation and the fruit of his fantasy, he always attributed his merits to the Paddington himself.
My daughter was on a deathbed and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
Upon landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors were vainly trying to save her life.
"The hope was calling me regularly to tell me that the situation is very bad and that it is expected that she will not survive," said Ednan-Laperuz.
"Then Nad called me to tell me that she would die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
I said, “Tashie, I really love you very much.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
The effect of the medications that doctors gave to keep her heart pumping slowly decreased, and they left her system.
She died earlier, and this meant that all her systems are giving up.
I just had to sit down and wait, knowing the fact that all this is happening.
I couldn’t scream, scream, or cry because I was surrounded by family and people.
I really had to stay away."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperuz, grieving for the loss of her daughter, got on the plane with the other passengers, unaware of the difficult situation she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I pointed my head at her, and the tears did not stop.
It's hard to explain, but while I was on the plane, I felt immense compassion for Nade.
I felt he needed my love and understanding.
I know how much you loved her."
Saddened women put cards on a bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who have lost their loved ones to suicide make efforts to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Hamfris put cards on the Wells Bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler was 13 years old when he started suffering from depression and committed suicide at 18 years of age.
"I don't want any parent to feel like I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Sydney, says her son had great potential to become a cook, as well as an infectious smile.
"Everyone remembered him for his smile.
People always said that his smile could light up any room."
However, he gave up his job before he died because he was "in a really dark place."
His brother who was then 11 years old was the one who found Tyler in 2014 after he took his life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I constantly fear that this will have a sequential effect."
Mrs. Davis draws up the cards "to let others know that there are people out there who can talk to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit still, you have to start talking."
Mrs. Hamfris, who is Mrs. Davis' long-term friend, lost her partner Mark who was married 15 years soon after his mother died.
"He did not say he felt unhappy or depressed, or said nothing," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He reached the bottom of Christmas when the children opened their presents, and he did not look at them at all and establish any contact with them."
She said that his death was a huge trauma to all of them, but they had to find a way to get through it: “This is what destroys the family.
It leaves us broken.
But we must continue to fight."

Brett Kavano's future is uncertain since the FBI launched the investigation
"I thought that if we could actually get something like what he was looking for, or research with limited time, with limited scope, we might be able to achieve a little unity," Mr.Flake said on Saturday, adding that he is afraid that the committee "disappears" in terms of the rooted partisan-free state.
Why didn't Kavano and his supporters of the Republican Party want the FBI to conduct an investigation?
Their flexibility depends only on the timing.
The mid-term elections should be held in just a few weeks, or on 6 November, and if Republicans are expected to face failure, then they will be significantly weakened in their efforts to elect their man as a member of the highest court in the country.
George V. Bush is calling the senators, while lobbying to support Mr. Kavano who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and who met his wife Ashley, who, in turn, worked as Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI publishes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate where there are now 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavano can obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate vote, enabling Vice President Mike Pens to change the unresolved outcome and enter the Supreme Court.
The number of refugees in North Korea is "decreasing" under Kim's leadership
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has decreased since Kim Yong-un came into power seven years ago, a South Korean MP said.
Park Bjeong-seug, quoting data from the South Korean Union Ministry, said that last year there were 1,127 border crossings compared to 2011, when there were 2,706.
Mr. Park said more stringent border controls between North Korea and China and higher tariffs on human smugglers are key factors.
Pyongyang didn't comment in public.
Most North Korean refugees are currently receiving citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most run across China, where there is the longest border with North Korea and which can be easily crossed compared to the well-protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between North and South Korea.
China considers these people illegal migrants, not refugees, and often repatriates them.
The relationship between the North and the South, which is still technically at war, has improved considerably over the past few months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss topics that focused on stopping denuclearisation negotiations.
This was followed by a historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Yong-un in Singapore where they generally agreed to work towards achieving the goal -- the Korean peninsula without nuclear weapons.
But North Korea Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho charged on Saturday with sanctions imposed by the United States for stagnation in progress since then.
"If there is no confidence in the United States; there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such conditions we cannot only disarm ourselves unilaterally," Mr. Ri said in a speech before the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Cavano "historic" and said he was not fit to serve in the Supreme Court
The minority leader in the House of Representatives called the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavano "historic" and said that if his temper is taken into account, he is irresponsible to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said this in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't think that if a woman acted that way, they would say it was "historical," Pelosi said about her reaction to Cavano's testimony before the Senate's Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavano emotionally denied the allegations that he sexually attacked Dr. Christine Blassie Ford when they were teenagers.
Kavano was very emotional at his introduction, sometimes even shouting and missing while talking about his family and his high school years.
He also clearly condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling the allegations against him "grossful and coordinated destruction of his reputation" organised by the liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost in the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said she believes that Kavano's testimony is proof that he can't serve in the Supreme Court because he has shown himself biased against the Democrats.
"I think he is disqualifying himself with those statements and the way he attacked the Clinton family and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi did not answer the question of whether she would try to remove Cavano from office if the allegations against him were confirmed and if the Democrats got the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say this: if he does not tell the truth before Congress or the FBI, then he is not only responsible for serving in the Supreme Court, but is not responsible for serving in the court where he is currently in office," Pelosi said.
Kavano is currently a judge in the District Court of Appeal in Washington.
Pelosi added that as a democrat she was concerned about the possible convictions that Kavano would bring against the Act on Access to Health Care or Roe vs. Wade, because it is considered to be the subject of conservative justice.
In hearings to confirm his candidacy, Kavano did not answer the questions as to whether he would annul any of the Supreme Court's decisions.
"Now is not the time for a hysterical, passionate man to enter the court and expect us to say, "it's really wonderful, isn't it," Pelosi said.
And women should use it.
It's really a sharp criticism, months and years of gathering anger, which she can't free herself without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Mrs. Steinem said 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual, do I?"
She continued: “A woman who was doing executive work helped me a lot, and who told me that she was crying when she was angry, but she was able to develop her technique, so when she got angry and started crying, she said to the person who was talking to her, ‘ Maybe you think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she keeps crying.
I think that's brilliant."
Tears are allowed as a vent for anger in part because they are essentially misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories of one of my first jobs in the office where the men dominated was when I started crying with unbearable anger and an older woman, a cold manager from whom I had always had some fear, grabbed me by the neck and dragged me to the stairs.
"Never let them see you crying," he said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll enjoy the fact that they've been able to reach you."
Patricia Schroeder at that time was a Democratic Congressman from Colorado and worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in a foreign affair on a ship called "Monkey Business" and withdrew from the presidential race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, realized that there was no reason for her not to consider the idea of running for president.
"That wasn't a well-considered decision," she said 30 years later in a laugh.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it "Snow and Seven Dwarves."
Given the fact that the campaign had been launched long ago, it did not have enough financial resources, so promised it would not be in the race unless it collected $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She learned that some of her supporters who gave her men $1,000 would give her only $250.
"Do they think there should be a discount for me?" she wondered.
During the speech she announced that she would not start a formal campaign she was so overwhelmed by emotions, or thanks to the people who supported her, frustration from the system that it was so difficult to raise funds and target voters, rather than delegates and anger towards sexism, she began to cry.
"If you saw me you'd probably think I had a nervous breakdown," recalls Mrs. Schroeder of how the media responded to the case.
"You'd think Klinex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember wondering what they'd write on my tombstone.
"She's crying?"
How a trade war between the United States and China can be a good job for Beijing
Opening the fire with the beginning of the US-China trade war was overwhelming, and even though the battle is far from over, the conflict between countries can be useful for long-term Beijing, experts say.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, gave the first warning at the beginning of this year by exposing key exports to China, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The situation has been significantly escalating over this week by introducing new tariffs for $200 billion (150 billion pounds), with half of the goods coming from the US from China have been effectively identified.
Beijing returned to nature each time, or recently imposed tariffs from five to ten percent of American goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to return to the United States on an equal footing, and it is unlikely that the second largest economy in the world will give up the same in a short time.
Making Washington withdraw means accepting his demands, but public worship before the United States would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays well, pressures from the US trade war can result in positive support for China in the long term because the interdependence of the two economies will be reduced.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions for the start of a sudden economic downturn in any of the countries is much more dangerous than previously identified by observers," said Abigail Grace, a research associate focusing on Asia at the Centre for New American Security, which is a tank tank.
Syria is "ready" to return refugees, Foreign Minister said
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and makes efforts to help rebuild the country that remained desolated by the long war that lasted more than seven years.
Speaking before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid al-Mulam said conditions in the country are improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and safer, which is due to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to renew the areas devastated by terrorists in order to bring the situation back to normal.
Now all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives are secure.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
An additional six million people living in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Mulam said the Syrian regime welcomes aid in the reconstruction of the desolate country.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries sponsoring the rebellion.
Europe has achieved a significant victory of Ryder's buy in Paris
Europe's team won the United States team in Ryder Cup 2018 with a final result of 16.5 versus 10.5 in Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
So far, the United States has lost six times in a European field and has not won Ryder's 1993 European Cup title.
Europe has recovered the primacy since Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached 14.5 points needed to win over the United States.
The American star Phil Mikelson, who faced difficulties during most of the tournament, pointed the ball into the water in pairs-3 to the 16th hole, losing Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari pointed out in all circles, becoming one of the four players that achieved the 5-0-0 result after the tournament was organised in the current format in 1979.
US Jordan Spit lost 5-4 of the lowest ranking player on the European team, Torbyorn Olesen from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, the world's highest-ranking player, lost 2 and 1 of Ian Poulter from England, which might be the last time he played the Ryder Cup.
Spanish veteran Sergio Garcia, a member of eight Ryder Cups, became the European who won the most prizes on the tournament with 25.5 points won during his career.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't stop.
This year was really hard.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so glad we got the title back.
Team game is the most important and I am happy to be able to help," emotional Garcia said after Europe's victory.
He is now relegating the place of his fellow citizen John Ram, who on Sunday one beat Tiger Woods, the American golf legend, with a result of 2:1.
"I feel incredibly proud of defeating Tiger Woods, I grew up looking at him as a game," 23-year-old Ram said.
Woods lost in all four matches in France and now has a 13-21-3 career record at Ryder Cup.
It's an amazing statistics of one of the best players of all time, who won 14 big titles, ranking Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. team spent the weekend trying to direct the game to low grass terrain, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a high-quality golf course throughout the tournament.
US team captain Jim Furik after his team's disappointing game said, "I'm proud of these guys, they really fought.
During a period of the morning, we made it difficult for the team from Europe.
We were fighting.
He's digging down for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played really well.
We'll regroup, I'll work with the American Professional Golf Association and our Ryder Cup committee and we'll continue.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
We have to admit it.
They beat us up.
