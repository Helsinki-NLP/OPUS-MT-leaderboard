The members of the Gales Assembly are concerned that they take them for monocreches.
Confusion among some of the members of the Assembly, currently referred to as AM, on the suggestion that they should change the name by MWP (Member of Parliament of Wales).
The debate took place on plans to change the name of the assembly by the Gales Parliament.
Members of the Assembly of the whole panorama are afraid to be the object of ridicule.
A member of the Labor Party said his group was concerned that the new name "rhyme with Twp and Pwp".
For those who don't know Welsh, "twp" means "crazy" and "pwp" means "crazy".
A member of the Plaid Cymru party showed that the group set "was not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative said his group kept an "open mind" about the change of name, but stressed that from MWP to Muppet there is only one small verbal leap.
In this context, the letter "w" in Welsh is pronounced in a similar way to the English word of Yorkshire from the letter "u".
The Assembly Committee, which is currently drafting the legislation to introduce the changes in the name, declared: "Of course, the final decision on any descriptor of the members of the Assembly will depend on the members themselves."
The law of the Gales government of 2017 gave the Gales Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on these proposals which showed great support for the appointment of the Gales Parliament.
With regard to the issue of the title of AM, the committee preferred members of the Galès Parliament or WMP, but the MWP option received a majority of support in a public consultation.
It seems that the AMs are suggesting alternatives, but the struggle to reach consensus could result in a headache for the president, Elin Jones, from which he is expected to deliver the bill on changes in a few weeks.
The Law on Reform will include other changes in the functioning of the assembly, such as the rules on the disablement of the AM and the design of the committee system.
The AMs will get the final vote on what should be called when they discuss legislation.
Macedonians welcome the Urs in reference to change the country's name
The voters will vote on Sunday if their country's name is changed to "North Macedonia Republic".
The popular vote will decide to settle a dispute that has lasted for decades with the neighboring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour represents a claim from its territory and repeatedly opposes its requests for accession to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who in the plebiscite opposes the change of name, said he would ignore the vote.
However, the rapporteur's supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of name is no longer the price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's camps keep silent while Harlem's churches continue to fight
"The elders I spoke to said that before there was a bar and a church on each corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today, not one thing or the other."
He said he could understand that the bars would disappear.
"Now people socialize in other ways," he said.
"Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhoods to which people usually go."
As for the churches, I'm afraid the money from the sale of assets doesn't last as long as the leaders expect, and "before or after they'll be back where they started."
He added that churches could be replaced by apartments with communities full of owners of people who would not help the neighborhoods remain sanctuaries.
"The vast majority of people who will buy the apartments of these buildings will be white," he said, "and therefore will accelerate the closure of all these churches, because it is unlikely that new owners will become members of these churches."
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis, a metropolitan community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation changed in the 1930 ’ s.
A nearby black congregation was formed with the building.
St. Martin was occupied by a black congregation headed by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott at the 125th Street Tents, a commercial street in Harlem that was resistant to hiring and climbing black people.
A fire produced in 1939 left the building very damaged, but as Father Johnson's frescoes made plans to rebuild it, they carried the carriage.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin, proudly baptized the carriage as "the camps of the poor."
The expert who played the chariot in July called it another way: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
Professor Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan also pointed out that it was the first carillon of the world played by a black musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who changed it for the largest carillon of the Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said no one occupied his place in St. Martin.
Those who lead St. Martin's occupation over the past few months are a group of architects and contractors, some led by the lay leaders of the church and others by the episcopal diocese.
The parish council, the body that rules the parish and is made up of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July showing his concern that the latter "is trying to affect the costs" of the meeting, even though he did not participate in the recruitment of the architects and contractors who sent the diocese.
Some fries complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A shark wound a boy while fishing lobsters in California
The police reported that a shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while practicing submarine fishing in search of langostas in California on the first day of the season of that cruise.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he spent about half an hour diving with friends on Saturday morning when he heard the boy asking for help with screams, when he swam with a group of people to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was just an emotion to fish a languid, but that he soon realized that he was shouting, "They're bothering me!
They hired me!'
Hammel said he noticed when the boy arrived.
"Berrell to everyone who came out of the water: 'There is a shark in the water!' said Hammel.
The boy was transferred into a helicopter to the Soviet Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
The type of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The rescuer, Captain Larry Giles, said in a press conference that they divided a shark in the area a few weeks ago, but that they determined it wasn't a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic damage at the top of the torso.
Officials closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach, Casablanca, to Swami's, Ecinitas, for 48 hours to undertake an investigation and also for security reasons.
Giles observed that there are over 135 species of sharks in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plan to enter the UK's beauty market
Sainsbury's is competing with Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams with beauty runners similar to the two big stores full of specialist assistants.
As part of the considerable interference in the UK's beauty market, which is up to 2,800 million pounds and continues to grow as fashion sales and home products fall, the biggest racers with beauty products will be tested in 11 tents across the country, and will then pass to others next year if they are successful.
The investment in beauty is produced at a time when supermarkets are looking to fill in the booths that in their day occupied by televisions, microwaves and home products.
Sainsbury's stated that it would double its offer of beauty products to reach 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweeterman and Dr. PawPaw.
The current collections of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with exclusive areas similar to those that can be seen in tents like Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its Boutique makeup range so that most of the products are suitable for vegans, something more and more demanded by the newest customer.
In addition, the perfume shop, The Fragrance Shop, will try concessions in two Sainsbury's establishments; the first opened in Croydon, not south of London last week, while the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, this year.
Online shopping and a change that translates into buying small amounts of food daily in small shops means that supermarkets have to do more to convince people they visit.
Mike Coupe, executive president of Sainsbury's, said that institutions will increasingly look like malls, as supermarket chains are trying to compete with discount tents like Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has already introduced Argos and Habitat sales points in hundreds of tents, since he bought the two chains two years ago.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to modernize its pharmaceutical and beauty departments was a failure.
Sainsbury's launched a joint initiative with Boots in the early 2000s, but the association came to an end after a dispute about how to distribute pharmaceutical incomes in its supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sells its pharmaceutical business formed by 281 tents in Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
It was noted that Lloyds would participate in the plan by adding a wide range of luxury cosmetic brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in 4 tents.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director of Sainsbury's, said: "We transform the image of our beauty runners to improve the surroundings for our customers.
We also invest in specially trained personnel that you can turn to for advice.
Our range of products is designed to adapt to all needs and attractive and practical locations means that we are now a cosmetic destination that challenges old shopping habits."
Peter Jones "whispered" after Holly Willoughby retired from business of 11 million pounds
The star of the Dragons Den program, Peter Jones, went "further" after the television shower Holly Willoughby withdrew from a business of 11 million pounds with his life-style brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for his brand of household clothes and accessories True.
His company was compared to Goop, Gwyneth Paltrow's brand.
This morning's 37-year-old presenter used Instagram to announce his resignation.
Holly Willoughby left the star of Dragons' Den, Peter Jones throwing chips away from his life-style brand in the last minute to focus on his new gold contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources indicate that Jones was "angrily" when the television gold girl admitted during a tense meeting held on Saturday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that his new business, valued at 1.5 million pounds, meant that he had no time to dedicate himself to the home clothing brand and accessories of both, True.
The business was compared to Goop, Gwyneth Paltrow's brand, and it was projected to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at 11 million pounds.
When Willoughby, 37 years old, went to Instagram to announce that he had left True, Jones took a plane to Britain and headed to one of his vacation residences.
One source said, "Truly was different from one of Holly's priorities.
It would be your long-term future for the next two decades.
His decision to leave left an atonists to all the people who participated in the project.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There was a warehouse full of merchandise in Marlow's offices ready to sell."
Experts believe that the abandonment of this morning's presenter is among Britain's most profitable stars could cost the company millions of pounds, due to the considerable investment in products that come from kitchens and candles the clothes and textiles for home, and which could further slow down their launch.
And it could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin are parents of three children and have had a close relationship with Jones and his wife, Tara, for ten years.
Willoughby created True with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as president in March.
The couples were together on vacation, and Jones has a 40% share in Baldwin's TV producer.
Willoughby will become the M&S ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as the presenter in ITV's program with Celebrity.
A source near Jones declared last night that "we shouldn't comment on your business."
A complicated conversation "and then we fall in love"
He played with the criticisms he would receive by the media for making a comment that some would consider "a little of their own president" and for being so positive about the Norcorean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said by putting his voice on "telegrapher."
"I didn't give up anything."
He noted that Kim is interested in holding a second meeting after his initial meeting held in June in Singapore, which Trump considers a major step towards North Korea's denuclearization.
But the negotiations for denuclearization have been halted.
More than three weights after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's major diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, communicated to world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North does not see the "response" by the United States of America to the first steps of North Korea's disarmament.
On the contrary, he pointed out, the United States continues to impose sanctions aimed at continuing to exert pressure.
Trump has adopted a much more optimistic vision in his speech.
"The things with North Korea are going well," he said.
"We're going to war with North Korea.
They would have killed millions of people.
Now we have this excellent relationship."
He said his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim had positive results: ending the tests with missiles, helping free hostages and returning home to the remaining U.S. soldiers.
And he defended his unusual strategy in talking about the relationship with Kim.
"It's very easy to act like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people out trying to get into this amphitheatre, we'd have about 200 people standing here," Trump said pointing out to the crowd that he was right in front.
A earthquake and a tsunami destroy an island in Indonesia leaving hundreds of dead
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were informed that they did not need them.
Although more than 10 percent of the Lombok population has been displaced, no national disaster has been declared, which is an indispensable condition for catalyzing international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they left very clear that they would not ask for international help, so it is a challenge," said Mrs. Sumbung.
While Save the Children is gathering a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet clear if foreign personnel can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster management agency, assured us that Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies can contribute with their help.
Given the constant earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is very poorly prepared to face the wrath of nature.
Although shelters for tsunamis were built in Aceh, it is not usual to find them on the other side.
Although a warning was issued, the absence of a tsunami alert siren in Palu probably contributed to the loss of life.
In the best of cases, traveling between many of the islands of Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that was highlighted in Lombok to meet the victims of the earthquake will go to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the place of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo's election campaign revolved around improving the deterioration of Indonesia's infrastructure, producing money on roads and railways.
But Mr. Joko's administration is affected by a great lack of funds at the end of next year's re-election.
Mr. Joko is also affected by the continued sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority adopted a way of living the most conservative faith.
More than 1,000 people were murdered and tens of thousands were forced to leave their homes because of clashes in the streets of Christian and Muslim bands, using machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
View: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge marks the goal of the empathe in front of Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat at the Premier League in front of Chelsea with a goal in minute 89 on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge got a ride from Xherdan Shaqiri while still about 27 metres from Chelsea's gate with his team losing 1-0.
He hit the balloon with his left leg before he shot the second pole.
The balloon flew over the area as it moved toward the top left corner of the network.
The ball ended up falling over a Riszabalaga Kepa that jumped into the air and entered the net.
"Just trying to get to that position, to organize us, and players like Shaq always play the ball forward as much as possible, so I tried to win as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"Come near Kante and say a touch without thinking too much and I just shot."
Chelsea won 1-0 at rest after the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in 25 minutes.
The Blue Fronter passed the Talon Ball to Mateo Kovacic in this game, before turning close to the middle of change and running into the Liverpool field..
Kovacic built a wall in the center of the field.
He made a beautiful passage deep leading Hazard to the area.
Hazard overcame the defense and ended up in the second floor marking a shot with the zurda that Alsson Becker was unable to stop.
Liverpool meets Naples in the group stage of the Champions League on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the San Paolo de Naples Stadium, Italy.
Chelsea will do her own thing with Videoton at UEFA Europe League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
The number of deaths of Indonesia's tsunami rose to 832
The number of deaths in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832, as the national disaster management agency reported on Sunday morning.
Many people would be trapped between the ruins of the buildings that came down with a magnitude 7.5 earthquake that occurred on Friday and caused waves up to 6 meters, according to a press conference told the spokesman of the Sotopo Purwo Nugroho.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is covered with garbage from ruined buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old murder suspect after a woman died in a car accident
A murder investigation was opened after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 in the morning with white gun wounds in John Street, and arrested a 32-year-old suspected of murder.
The police asked the people in the area to see or hear something about that one step ahead.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said, 'The investigation is in its early stages, but I would like to make a call to get in touch with us any one near John Street in Birkenhead who sees or hears anything suspicious.
I would also like to ask anyone, especially the taxi drivers, to catch anything with the camera of the command box that is in contact with us, since they could have key information for our investigation.'
A police spokesman confirmed that the found body belongs to a neighbor of Birkenhead and that it was found within a property.
This afternoon, friends who thought they knew the woman came to the scene to answer questions about where she was found that morning.
The investigation continues while the police say they're in the process of informing family members of the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police told him they wouldn't let anyone in or out of the building.
The man ran out of words when he found out what had happened.
The residents just know they can't get back into it in a few hours.
A police officer has been heard to tell a man that the area is considered a crime scene.
There's a woman on stage crying.
I don't stop saying 'it's horrible.
At 2 p.m., there were two police vans inside the cordon with another right outside.
Several officers remain within the cordon watching the apartment block.
To anyone who has information, you are asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, who calls 101 or who anonymously contacts Crimestoppers on the phone number 0800 555 111, quoting the 247 of September 30.
The statue of Cromwell of Parliament becomes the last monument affected by the struggle for "rewriting history"
His ban would be poetic justice for his Taliban destruction of so many religious and cultural objects of England carried out by his fanatic and Puritan followers.
But Cromwell Society qualified Mr. Crick's suggestion to "disappear" and "try to rewrite the story."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate on the withdrawal of statues that Oliver Cromwell's figure located outside the Westminster Palace would become an objective.
The iconoclasty of the British civil wars was not ordered or carried out by Cromwell.
Maybe they would have sacrificed Cromwell wrong by the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a proof of the opinion that existed in the 19th century, and part of the story of a figure that many consider to be still worthy of honor.
Mr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more by the end of the 19th century than now, as a defender of parliament in the face of external pressure, in this case, of course, it was the monarchy.
Whether or not this is a complete representation is the subject of a continuous historical debate.
What's clear is that the 17th-century mid-term conflict has defined the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognized figure that represents a side of the divide.
Your achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration."
A Chinese farmer is being killed by a killer pig
According to local media, a pig attacked and killed a farmer on a southwest Chinese market.
Last Sunday the South China Morning Post reported that the man, identified only by his name, "Yuan," was found dead with a blood-stained artery close to a cut in the Liupanshui market in the province of Guizhou.
A fat pig prepares to put the vaccines to pigs in a tent on May 30, 2005, in Xining, province of Qinghai, China.
Apparently she traveled with her cousin on Wednesday from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door that gave him another adjacent knife.
He said there was a big man with blood in his mouth.
The forensic analysis confirmed that the pig, nearly 250 kilos, attacked the farmer until he was killed.
"My cousin had his legs bleeding and sneezing," said the cousin, called "Wu," to Guiyang Evening News.
The recording of the security camera shows Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to get him to eat his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market director told Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent him from attacking anyone else, while the police gathered evidence on the scene.
It seems that Yuan's family and the market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Even though they're not very common, there's already been cases of pigs that attack humans before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in the farm that the couple had in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years ago, an almost 300-kilometer pig hit a Welsh farmer against the tractor until his wife arrived and spooked the animal.
After a farmer from Oregon had been eaten by his own pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs don't usually be aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a trigger.
"They're just playing.
They're like children, very curious... they don't intend to hurt.
You just have to have the respect you need," he said.
The remains of the Rosa hurricane will bring strong and generalized rains to the southwest of the United States.
The forecasts indicate that the Rosa hurricane weakens as it overflows the cold waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring torrential rains to the north of Mexico and to the southwest of the United States during the next few days.
At 5:00 a.m. on Sunday, east hour, Rosa was a Category 1 hurricane with winds exceeding 135 km/h and was located about 620 kilometers from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa's expected to head north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a dam begins to take shape over the Pacific Ocean and move east, towards the East Coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the peninsula of Lower California on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to push tropical moisture to the north, which will penetrate south-west of the United States.
Rosa will bring more than 250 l/m2 of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Next, the interaction of tropical moisture with the valgade will create abundant and generalized rains in the southwest in the next few days.
At the local level, precipitations between 25 and 100 l/m2 will cause dangerous sudden floods, waste streams and the possibility of land spills in the desert.
The great tropical humidity will cause precipitation that will reach 50 or 75 l/m2 in point areas, especially in parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
In parts of the southwest, rain is expected from 50 to 100 l/m2, especially on most of Arizona.
The possibility of sudden flooding with deterioration conditions due to the dispersed nature of tropical rain.
We strongly recommend adventure in the desert under the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rains could form cannons that could become fluctuating rivers, and electric storms would bring local rainstorms and dust.
The valley will bring strong local rains to parts of the southern coast of California.
Total precipitation could reach more than 12 l/m2, which in turn could cause the flow of minor debris and skewed roads.
These would be the first rains of the wet station in the region.
Dispersed tropical rains will begin to reach Arizona in the last hours of Sunday and early Monday, before the rain extends at the end of Monday and Tuesday.
The abundant rain will arrive at Four Corners on Tuesday, which will last until Wednesday.
October will witness major temperature fluctuations in the U.S. due to Arctic cooling, although the tropics will remain quite warm.
At times this implies significant temperature changes in short distances.
On Sunday we can see a great example of radical differences in temperature in the center of the United States.
There will be a temperature difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
During the next few days, the constant summer heat will try to reappear and expand again.
For the central and eastern part of the country, a warm October start is expected, with temperatures exceeding 26 degrees from the south-east plains to the north-east.
New York could reach 26 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 12 degrees above the average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates a high probability of temperatures above the average east of the country during the first half of October.
Over 20 million people saw Brett Kavanaugh trial
More than 20 million people followed on six television channels the passionate witnesses of the judge appointed to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that allegedly took place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, political stagnation continues and the chains interrupt their usual programming for a new last Friday's time: an agreement designed by Senator Arizona, Jeff Flake, to get the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Committee that he's 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh made toys drunk and tried to get his clothes off at a party at the institute.
In a loving witness, Kavanaugh said he was absolutely certain that this was not happening.
Nielsen reported on Friday that more than 20.4 million people would have seen it.
The company counted the average audience in CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other chains that retransmitted it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen tends to have trouble measuring people who watch TV from offices.
To make an idea, it's a hearing similar to that of a football final or Oscar's ceremony.
Fox News Channel, which largely supported Kavanaugh's appointment, led all chains with an average of 5.69 million spectators during a trial that lasted all day, according to Nielsen.
ABC was second with 3.26 million.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94, MSNBC 2.89 and CNN 2.52 million according to Nielsen.
After the trial, interest remained.
Flake was the central figure of Friday on TV.
After the office of the moderate Republican made a statement indicating that he would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, it was captured by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning, being backed by protesters when he tried to enter a path lift at the hearing of the Judicial Committee.
He stayed with his eyes down for a few minutes while he was being recuperated, television live at CNN.
"I'm here before you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
They said, "You have the power while there are many defenseless women."
Flake said that his office made a Flake statement, before the elevator closed, he added that he would have more than to say in the committee's hearing.
All television and cable channels broadcast live hours after the Judicial Committee had to vote to advance Kavanaugh's appointment before the full Senate to submit the vote.
But Flake said that he would only do that if the FBI was investigating the allegations against the nominee next week, something that called for a minority of Democrats.
Flake was partly convinced by the conversations he had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a later conversation with Coons and several senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's election had power, because it was clear that Republicans wouldn't have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump opened an investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister accuses critics of playing politics with Brexit
In an interview with Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused anyone of criticizing his plans to abandon the European Union to "play politics" with Britain's future and to prejudice national interest.
Prime Minister Theresa May arrived at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with her on the cover of the paper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson insisted on attacking the so-called Chequers plan for Brexit saying that the proposal that Britain and the EU should collect oranges from the other side was "totally absurd".
Wayde Sims Murdered: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson as a suspect of the LSU player's death
The police arrested a suspect in the shooting that ended Wayde Sims' life, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
According to Baton Rouge police department, 20-year-old Dieteon Simpson was arrested and imprisoned for a second-degree murder.
Officials broadcast the video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and the police said that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police recovered the glass from the scene and said they contained Simpson's DNA, according to the affiliated channel of CBS, WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, the police said he admitted to being the author of the shooting that killed Wayde.
The defense reported that he had a $350,000 loan imposed on him.
The Forensics Office of the East Baton Rouge parish issued a preliminary report on Friday that indicates that the cause of death is a bullet wound in the head that reached the neck.
The department praised the fledgling unit of the Louisiana state police, at the state police crime lab, the Southern University police are to their neighbors for their help in getting the arrest.
LSU's sports director Joe Alleva thanked the local authorities for his "difficulty and seeking justice".
Yeah, he was 20 years old.
The 2.01 wing was created in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the LSU.
Its average last season was 5.6 points and 2.6 turns.
On Friday morning, LSU's basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "defeated" and "smoothed" by Wayde's death.
"That's what we've been worried about all along," Wade said.
Sulphur volcano grey on Mexico City
The ashes that throw the Popocatepetl volcano have reached the southern neighborhoods of the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre advised Mexicans to leave the volcano on Saturday after they detected activity on the crater and registered 183 gas and ashes emissions within 24 hours.
The center was monitoring several tremors and tremors.
The pictures of the social networks showed fine layers of ashes in the suburbs of Mexico City like Joachimilco.
Geophysics detected an increase in the activity of the volcano located 72 kilometres to the west of the capital since a 7.1 earthquake shook the center of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Facing the Catalan police and separatists before the independence referendum's anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protestors pro-independence confronting the anti-disruption police and while thousands joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarizing vote on Catalonia's secession.
A group of proseparatists masked by police anti-disquieting gunshots and painting in dust that created clouds of dark dust in the streets that tend to be haunted by tourists.
There was also some chills later that same day with the police, who used their dicks to hold the lair.
For several hours, pro-independent groups that were co-rooting "Ni forgotten nor forgiveness", faced Unionist protesters who were shouting "Long Life to Spain".
Fourteen people had to be cared for by minor injuries received in the protest, according to the local press.
The tension continues to flourish in the independent region one year after the referendum of October 1st celebrated by the Catalan separatists, although considered illegal by Madrid.
The voters opted out of independence, although the participation was low and the opposition to the secession boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the vote at the electoral tables throughout the region in violent confrontations.
Pro-independent groups camped all night on Friday to avoid a demonstration of support for the national police.
The event also occurred, but they became obliged to take a different path.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who turned to his wife's independenceist demonstration, said he had no hope of Catalonia's independence.
"Last year we lived one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying for joy when they were able to vote, but now we're hit," he commented.
Despite obtaining an adjusted victory, although decisive, in the regional elections last December, this year the Catalan pro-independent parties fought to maintain the momentum, with many of their most known leaders in self-imposed exile or detained in waiting for trial by their participation in the organization of the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the demonstration in support of the police with his cell phone, said the conflict was fueled by politicians from both sides.
"There's more and more tension," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial prison since last year, announced that the following year would be presented to the European Parliament.
"Presenting myself as a candidate for European elections is the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression we have suffered from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: they arrest a man after a car hits a house

It's also possible to shoot a beast against the car at some point.
Menga's goal gives Livingston a 1-0 victory over the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston is to win
The rising Livingston surprised the Rangers by taking Steven Gerrard to his second defeat in 18 matches as a coach of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal was to get Gary Holt's team to come up with a level after the Hibernian, in second place.
Gerrard's team is still out of the house this year at the Premiership and next Sunday they face the leader, the Hearts, who separates them from eight points.
But before the Rangers get the Rapid Vienna in Europe League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingstone continues to be invited to the sixth consecutive party division; the main coach, Holt, has not yet met the defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller with me.
Livingstone lets you escape opportunities from the weakened visitors
Holt's team must have made a lot of progress before they scored, since with their control they caused all kinds of problems to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson opened the way, but his cross shot did not cross the threshold of the gate; then the shot of Alan Lithgow came out driven by a head of Craig Halkett from the other side of the gate.
The host team agreed to let the Rangers play in front of them, aware that they could put the visitors in danger in the standing ball games.
And that's how the decisive goal came.
Rangers gave a free shot and Livingston made a bag in which Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined their efforts to fix Menga, who hit the balloon and scored from the center of the area.
At the time, Rangers dominated the possession but met with an impenetrable defense that avoided much work for the guard, Liam Kelly.
That pattern continued in the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos forced a stop from Kelly.
Ranger's guard, Allan McGregor held with his feet a shot of Scott Pittman, and Lithgow sent the ball out another shot at Livingston's stop.
Many crossings were carried out in the Livingston area that were continuously cleared, while two requests of penalty were rejected: one by hand and the other by a Halkett entrance to the Glenn Middleton replacement.
"Fenmenal" by Livingston: analysis
Alasdair Lamont for BBC Scotland from Tony Macaroni Stadium
A performance and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
And unitedly, they were excellent and they continue to exceed expectations in their ascending route.
His game style and players have only changed since he returned to the highest category, but part of the merit is Holt in the way he pushed the team since his arrival.
He had a lot of heroes.
Halkett, the captain, proudly led a perfectly organized defense while Menga gave them no breath at all to Connor Goldson and Joe Worall.
Rangers missed inspiration.
Despite working well on occasions under the order of Gerrard, on this occasion they did not reach that level.
The last pass failed. They only managed to penetrate the host team once. A call was made to the Rangers, which is located in the middle of the table.
Erdogan receives an ambiguity welcome in Colonia
On Saturday, September 29, there were smiles and blue skies during the meeting of Turkish and German leaders for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to resolve the relationship between NATO allies.
They identified many issues, including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's access to the EU.
Then Erdogan headed for Colony to launch a new giant mosque.
The city gathers the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police claimed security reasons to avoid a crowd of 25,000 meeting in front of the mosque, but many Erdogan supporters came to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan (many of them Kurds) also raised their voices condemning both Erdogan's policies and the decision of the German receiving government in the country.
The duel of demonstrations reflects the division before a visitor hailed as a hero by some German Turks and criticized as an autocrat by others.
Traffic accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies in a car crash
A cyclist died in a collision where a car was surrounded in London.
The accident took place near the crossroads between the Beswood Street and Evelyn Street, a transit road from Deptford to the south of the city, around 10:15 a.m. (summer time in Britain).
The driver of the car stopped and the paramedics arrived, but the man died in the act.
The accident occurred months after another cyclist died in an avalanche with escape on Childers Street just over a mile and a half of the accident on Saturday.
The metropolitan police revealed that the officers were working to identify the man and inform his family.
There are street closures and buses have been diverted, and drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers are injured in disorders
Six prison officers were injured in a high-security inmate, according to the prison officer.
The disorder started at Worcestershire's HMP Long Lartin around 09:30 (summer time in Britain) on Sunday and continues.
A "Tornado" unit of specialized officers came to deal with the disturbances, in which eight prisoners are involved who are contained in a pavilion.
Officials received attention from slight facial injuries.
A spokesperson for the prison service said: "The prison staff was particularly trained to deal with a continuing incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members had to be cared for by injuries.
We don't tolerate violence in our prisons, and we're clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and could spend more time between bars."
HMP Long Lartin hosts more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June it was known that the director of the prison center had to be hospitalized after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, anti-disquieting officers had to go to prison to calm down a riot in which the staff was attacked with billiard balls.
The Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (the places affected by the drought could benefit)
It's rare that tropical depression affects Arizona, but it's very likely that it will happen early next week, when the remaining energy of the Rosa hurricane passes through the South-West Desert leaving the possibility of sudden floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued alerts of sudden floods for Monday and Tuesday of western Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, the south of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is hoped that Rosa will pass directly over Phoenix on Tuesday and arrive at the last hour of Monday with rain.
The Phoenix National Meteorology Service reported on Twitter that only "ten tropical cycles maintained the state of depression or tropical storm on a 320-kilometre radius of Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that spread over a radius of 64 kilometers from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Meteorology Service include 50 to 10 l/m2 rain, with quantities isolated up to 150l/m2 on the Mogollón Board in Arizona.
Other areas of the South-West Desert, such as the Central Rocks and the Grand Conca could reach 25 or 50 litres, with possible total isolated 100 l/m2.
For those who are out of danger of sudden floods, the rain of Rosa could be a blessing, since the region is very affected by the droughts.
Although floods are a very serious problem, some of this rain may be beneficial, since the southwest is experiencing droughts.
According to the U.S. Dry Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme dry, the second largest category," weather.com reported.
First, the Rosa hurricane will play land on the California Low peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, who will still have the force of hurricane on Sunday morning, with a maximum wind of 136 km/h, is 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and heading north to 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm is meeting with cold water in the Pacific and therefore losing strength.
For this reason it is hoped that I will touch land in Mexico with tropical storm force in the evening or the night of Monday.
It could rain with great intensity in some areas of Mexico, assuming an important risk of flooding.
"The total precipitation is expected from between 75 and 150 l/m2 from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, and can be found with up to 250 l/m2", reports weather.com.
Then Rosa will head north through Mexico as a tropical storm before arriving at the Arizona border the first hour of Tuesday as a tropical depression and then she will continue to go up through Arizona and enter the South of Utah the last hour of Tuesday night.
"The main danger of Rosa or what remains of her are the strong precipitations in Baja California, northwest of Sonora and in the Southwestern Desert of the United States," the National Centre for Furacáns reported.
It is hoped that these rains can cause sudden water drums and waste streams in the deserts, and land debris in mountainous lands.
Aggression in Midsomer Norton: four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested under suspicion of attempted murder you find a 16-year-old boy with white gun wounds.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, Saturday around 04:00 (summer time in Britain).
It was taken to the hospital, where it remains "stable".
According to Somerset police, three boys aged 17, 18 and 20 were arrested during the night in the Radstock area respectively.
Officials asked for the collaboration of anyone who had a recording on the cell phone of the event.
Trump claims that Kavanaugh 's anger and bitterness' of the Democratic Party
"To vote for Judge Kavanaugh is to vote to reject the despicable and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said in a Mitin in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump stated that Kavanaugh "suffered the mesquindity and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout his appointment process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, where he categorically and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that she sexually assaulted her decades ago, being teenagers.
Ford also testified in the trial on his charge.
The president said on Saturday that that day the "United States" were witnesses of Kavanaugh's brilliance, quality and bravery.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the best judges of our time with a history of impotent public service," he said, addressing the crowd of admirers of West Virginia.
The president referred indirectly to the appointment of Kavanaugh as he spoke of the importance of the Republican results in the half term elections.
"It takes five weeks for one of the most important elections in our lives.
I don't care, but I really do," he said.
"That's why I'm going everywhere fighting for big candidates."
Trump argued that the democratic mission is to "oppose and obstruct".
It is expected that the first parliamentary vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh takes place before Friday, according to CNN an assistant of the Republican Party.
Indonesia’s system and tsunami cause hundreds of deaths and the number continues to grow
The authorities reported on Saturday that at least 384 people died, many of them dragged by giant waves that broke into the beaches, when a great earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people gathered on Friday to attend a festival on the beach of the town of Palu when waves of up to six meters broke down on the ground to the luscofusco, taking the lives of many and destroying everything to its passage.
The tsunami followed a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"Yesterday, when the threat arose, people were still with their activities on the beach and did not run away immediately, so they died," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesperson of Indonesia's disaster relief agency BNPB in a round of arrest in Icarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, it dragged cars, trunks, houses, it pulled everything it found," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami went high sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
Some people went up to the trees to escape the tsunami and managed to survive, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The air photographs disseminated by the national disaster management agency showed a lot of ruined tents and buildings, torn bridges and collapsed bridges and a mesquite surrounded by water.
The replicas continued to rock the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquake series was felt in an area of 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) stated that the energy released by the enormous Friday's earthquake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb launched on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, located at the end of a long and narrow bay, could magnify the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "quantifying" and said thousands of homes, hospitals and hotels came down.
Some of the victims were found trapped under the ruins of the ruined buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho announced that the victims and damage could be greater along the north coast of Palu, a zone called Dongala and which is closer to the epicenter of the sysm.
The communications were "totally paralyzed and no information" by Dongala, Nugroho added.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," said Cruz Redella in a communiqué, adding that his staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse," he said.
The agency was severely criticized on Saturday for not being aware of the arrival of a tsunami in Palu, even though officials said the waves arrived at the time the warning was issued.
In a recording of a fan shared on social networks, you can hear a man standing on the last floor of a building screaming frenziedly warning of the arrival of a tsunami to the people who were on the street.
In a matter of minutes, the water hits the edge leading ahead of buildings and cars.
Reuters was not able to verify the authenticity of the recording immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major closure that led to the cut-off of communications throughout Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the rescue tasks.
The authorities claim that the army has already begun to send cargo aircraft from Iacarta and other cities, but the evacuations continue to urgently need food and other basic needs.
The airport of the city has reopened but only for relief tasks and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo plans to visit Palu's evacuation centers on Sunday.
Indonesia's tsunami victim balance exceeds 800.
It's terrible.
During the journey that World Vision staff traveled to the city of Palu, where the employees were rescued in shelters of wool raised in the courtyard of their office, they contemplated scenes of total devastation, Mr. Doseba commented.
"They told me they saw many houses destroyed," he said.
It's terrible.
Even when the groups began the unpleasant task of continuing assistance in the event of a disaster, some complained that they were preventing Paul from travelling to foreign humanitarian workers with great knowledge and experience.
According to Indonesian legislation, funds, supplies and personnel from abroad can only fluctuate if the place of disaster is declared a national disaster zone.
And that hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a disaster at the level of a province," said Aulia Arriani, a voice from the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government says, "Okay, this is a national disaster," we can open up to international help, but that time has not yet come."
When the second night fell in Palu after the earthquake and the tsunami of Friday, family and friends of the missing were caught in the hope that their loved ones were one of the miracles that shed light on the depressing argument of natural disasters."
Saturday they took a kid out of a sweatshop.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who had been under the trash for two days with her mother's body beside her.
Gendon Subandano, coach of the Indonesian national parapent team, trained two of the missing parapentists for the Asian Games, which ended early this month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandagi added that some of the people trapped in the Roa Roa hotel were his students.
"As a person with extensive experience in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon told how, in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel among the parapentist community, he desperately tried to send messages from WhatsApp to Palu's competitors, who were participating in the beach festival
However, only one grey mark was shown in the messages instead of two blue marks.
"I think that means the messages have not been delivered," he added.
Stealing $26,750 while reloading a cashier in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning some thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink worker who recharged a boxer in Newport on the Levee, according to a news release from Newport Police Department.
In the press release, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote that the driver of the car had empty a boxer in the leisure complex and was prepared to deliver more money.
While he was busy, another man came running from behind Brink's employee and stole him a bag of money he had to deliver.
According to the note, witnesses saw several suspects leaving the scene, but the police didn't realize how much they were involved in the incident.
If you have any information about your identity, please contact the Newport police calling number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West renames Ye
The Kanye West frog changes its name for Ye.
To announce the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "To be first known as Kanye West."
It's been a while since West, 41 years old, is known as Ye, who used as the title of his eighth album, published in June.
The change occurred before its appearance on Saturday Night Live, where it is expected to launch its new Yandhi album.
He will replace the singer Ariana Grande with the program, which cancelled his assistance for "emotional reasons", according to the program's creator.
Besides being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West had already explained earlier that the word had a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'yes' is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'ti'," he said that same year West was talking about his record with Big Boy radio player.
"So it's you, it's us, it's us.
I passed by Kanye, which means the only, only Ye, which is a reflection of the goodness that exists in us, of evil, of confusion, of everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
Kanye is another of the famous rapists who changed their name.
Sean Combs was previously known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, even though this year he announced he prefers to call Love and Brother Love.
An old West collaborator, JAY-Z, also stood up by putting and removing the script and using the capitals.
AMLO undertakes not to use military forces against civilians
Mexico's elected president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, committed himself to not again using military force against civilians when the 50th anniversary of a bloody rebate against students arrives.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Square that "I would not use the military again to oppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the troops fired on a peaceful demonstration in the square killing about 300 people at a time when student movements were raving across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support Mexican youth by giving monthly help to the boys who study and open more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities drag boys to criminal gangs.
The US should double the investment in I.A.
According to the investor and professional of IA Kai-Fu Lee, ex-Employed by Google, Microsoft and Apple, U.S. should double the amount you invest in IA in view of China's growing activity in the field.
The comments were made after several parts of the U.S. government announced IA, even though the U.S. lacks a formal IA strategy.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan the previous year: it aims to be number 1 in innovation in IA in 2030.
"Duplicateing the budget in research in IA would be a good start, since the other countries are much more behind than the United States, and we are looking for the next great advance in IA," Lee said.
Duplicate funding could double the odds that the next IA achievement would be made in the United States, Lee told the CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is Director General of Sinovation Ventures, who invested in one of China's most prominent companies: Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an IA system that won the American Othello player with higher scores and was later executive at Microsoft Research at the Google branch in China.
Lee recognized old U.S. government technology contests as the Robotic Challenge of the Advanced Defence Research Agency and asked when it would be next to help identify the next visionaries.
In the United States, researchers usually have to work a lot to get government bags, says Lee.
"China is not who is taking academic leaders, but companies," he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technological companies have hired university geniuses to work in IA.
Lee pointed out that changing immigration policy could also help the United States to boost its efforts in IA.
"I think they should offer residence cards to doctors in IA," he said.
The State Council of China published its Plan for the Development of Artificial Intelligence of a New Generation in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences of China offers funding to people from academic institutions in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defence set up an artificial intelligence centre that is intended to include industry and university partners, and the White House announced the formation of the selection committee for artificial information.
And this month, DARPA announced an investment of $2,000 million in an initiative called AI Next.
Instead of NSF, I've currently invested over $100 million a year in research in IA.
Meanwhile, the US legislation that sought to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not been moving since months.
The Macedonians vote in favour of changing the country's name.
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday in a referendum if they wanted to change their name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", a movement that would resolve a dispute with Greece for decades and that would block applications for admission in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbours represents a claim from its territory and vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The governments of the two countries reached an agreement in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the change would prejudice the ethnic identity of the majority of the slave population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign raised doubts as to whether the result would reach a minimum of 50 per cent needed for the referendum to be valid.
The question contained in the paper of the referendum was: "Is it in favour of joining NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
The name change defenders, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that it is a price worth paying for admission to entities such as the EU or NATO of Macedonia, one of the emerging countries of the fall of Yugoslavia.
"Today I saw voting for the country's future, for Macedonia's youth, so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, many Members of Parliament have said that they would achieve the result of the vote and that they would make it definitive.
Change of nine would require a two-thirds majority of parliament.
The State Electoral Commission stated that at 1 p.m. no irregularities were recorded.
However, participation was only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent of the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters deposited their vote.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old capital voter, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko deposited their vote for the Macedonian referendum on the change of country name that would open the way for their accession to the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and placed chairs in front of the tents mounted for those who boycotted the referendum.
"We are in favour of joining NATO and the EU, but we want to do so with our head up and not through the service door," Kavadarkov added.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not accept us as Macedonia, we can go to other countries like China and Russia and become part of the Eurasian Union."
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO accession will bring the necessary investment to Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate above 20 percent.
"I think the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of joining the EU and NATO," Zaev commented after depositing his vote.
He said a positive result would be "confirmation of our future."
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research revealed that between 30 and 43 per cent of voters would participate in the referendum, the figure below the requirement.
Another survey conducted by the Macedonian television channel Telma indicated that 57 per cent of the people consulted planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said I would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the result must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failure in the referendum would represent the first major blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since it came to power in May of last year.
See: Sergio Agüero, Manchester City player, crosses all of Brighton's defense and ends up marking a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling took account of Brighton's defense with the Manchester City 2-0 on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
He made it seem ridiculously easy to mark the goal of minute 65.
The Argentine front received a pass in the middle of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between three Brighton defenses before he went to the open field.
Then Aguero was found surrounded by four green shirts.
He set out for a defense before crossing several more on the border of Brighton's area.
Next, he turned the ball over to his left and found Sterling.
The English advancer used the first touch area to return the balloon to Aguero, who hit the Brighton Mathew Ryan guard with a shot to the right of the network.
"Yesterday he's going through some problems on his foot," said the city coach, Pep Guardiola, to reporters.
"We're talking about playing 55 or 60 minutes.
And that's when it happened.
We were lucky he'd scored at that moment."
But it was Sterling who gave the bluelists the initial advantage in the front of the Premier League.
That goal arrived in minute 29.
Aguero received the balloon at the depth of Brighton's field at that game.
He sent a beautiful passage through the right-hand side to Leroy Sane.
Sane gave several touches before driving Sterling to the opposite position.
The bluelists put the ball in the doorway before they left the camp.
The city will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to give Rockies the party.
With the Nationals outside the struggle for elimination, there were not many reasons to force another ownership.
But a competitive Scherzer always hopes to launch Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there's still some involvement in the elimination of the Rockies, which leads to an advantage party to Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western League Division.
The Rockies secured at least one of the comedy positions with the 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but they're still trying to close their first division title.
"Even though we don't play anything, at least we can play the tire knowing that the atmosphere in Denver with the crowd and the other team would probably be playing at the highest level I've played this year.
Why won't I want to compete in it?"
The Nationals have not yet announced who the opening will be on Sunday, but they seem to be inclined to let Scherzer be what he launches in a situation like that.
Scherzer, for whom his start number 34 would be, made another bullpen session on Thursday and will probably launch Sunday on his usual day of rest.
Washington's right is 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 entries this time.
Trump celebrates a myth in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation surrounding the elected Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, as he spoke of the importance of the outcome in the half term elections.
"Let's play everything we did in November.
Five weeks are missing for one of the most important elections in our lives.
This is something big, big... I don't really do, but I do, and that's why I'm going everywhere fighting for big candidates," he said.
Trump went on to say, "You've already seen this terrible radical group of democrats, look what's happening now.
And they are determined to regain power by any means necessary, evil, and miscarriage.
They don't care who gets hurt, over who needs to pass to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control and we'll never give it to him."
The mission of the Democrats is to oppose and obstruct."
"And they've seen it for the past four days," he said, qualifying the Democrats for "fighting, ravaging, slandering and lying."
He mentioned the Senate Judicial Committee by quoting Senator Diane Feinstein for his name, who received strong support from the public.
"Do you remember your answer?
Did you filter the document?
Mmm. Come on, what?
No, mmm, no, wait... it was the worst body language, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labor Party isn't so open anymore.
It is not tolerant of those who express their opinion
When Momentum activists from my local party voted to censor me, the truth is, I wasn't too surprised.
After all, I am the last of a number of Labour Members that we are not well received, and everything to say to our opinion.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated in a similar way because he faced anti-Semitism with determination.
In my case, the censorship motion criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn
on the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security and on Europe, randomly on issues that Jeremy discussed with previous leaders.
The announcement for the Nottingham East Labour Meeting on Friday indicated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For most of the eight years I have been a laborer, the committee's Friday night meetings have been exactly that way.
Unfortunately, that is no longer the tone of many meetings, and the promise of a "more kind and gentle" policy has been forgotten a long time ago, if it ever began.
It is increasingly evident that the labor party does not tolerate different opinions and is judged if all opinions are acceptable to the party leader.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader of the party, when partners who were going to share a similar political vision began to expect me to be portrayed and adopted positions with which I would never agree, whether in the field of national security or the single EU market.
When I speak in public, and actually in a little bit the same as I say, there's a tremendous abortion and attacks on social networks censoring central politics, telling me it shouldn't be in the Laborist Party.
And I'm not alone.
In fact, I know I'm happier than some of my companions, because the comments that are addressed to me tend to be political.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of the companions facing a torrent of racist or sexist comments every day and who do not give up.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how the levels of insult have been normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labor Party had to promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer so open and that with every move of "untrustable" or every change in the selection rules, the party becomes closer to the eyes.
Over the last few years, I've received a lot of advice that urges me to keep my head shut, not to be so frank, and then "everything would be good for me."
But I didn't get involved in politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labor Party 32 there are still at school, led by the neglect of thatcher's government that literally let my class fall, I have tried to demand better public services for those who need them most, both being local councillor and government minister.
I've never hidden my policy, not even in the last election.
No member of Nottingham East could be confused with my political positions and I do not agree with the party's current direction.
To those who promoted Friday's motion, the only thing I would tell you is that while the country is on its way to a Brexit that will affect our homes, businesses and public services, I don't understand that desire to waste time and energy questioning my loyalty to the party's leader.
But in fact, the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my voters, whether they are members or not of the party: I am proud to serve them and I promise that no political threat or convenience will deter me from acting in accordance with what I consider to be the best interests of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: An Ayr Call
The last two attempts may have changed the final result a little bit, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this fine team of the Tenent Premier League.
Now they're leading the table and it's the only open team in the ten.
Finally, it was the superiority of his defense, as well as the risk, that led the team to victory, and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be happy.
"So far we have been tested in our party and we have followed invitations, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie, from Melrose, said, "You must recognize that Ayr has taken advantage of opportunities better than we have."
The 14-minute trial by Grant Anderson, transformed by Frazier Climo, put before Ayr, but a yellow card for the Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, handed over to the Warriors' party, allowed Melrose to speak the numbers and Jason Baggot caught up with the wrong launch.
Climate increased the advantage for Ayr with a penalti, before, just in the middle of time, he turned a single shot, leaving marker 17-5 in favor of Ayr on his rest.
But Melrose began well in the second half and Patrick Anderson's trial, transformed by Baggot, reduced the advantage to five points.
Then there was an extended stop due to the serious injury that Ruarid Knott suffered, who left the field in the pavilion and, from the beginning, Ayr advanced further through a test by Stafford McDowall, transformed by the climate.
Captain in function of Ayr, Blair Macpherson, received a yellow card and Melrose took off from having another player with a trial of Bruce Colvine that wasn't consumed, at the end of a period of much pressure.
However, the local team came back and when Struan Hutchinson received the yellow card for placing the climate when he didn't have the balloon, McPjherson scored a trial from the penalty line at the back of Ayr's maul.
The climate marked it, as it did almost from the beginning, after Kyle Rowe picked up the launch in the David Armstrong area and sent it to Gregor Henry's third line to get the fifth test of the local team.
Still Game's protagonist starts a new career in the restoration industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran seems to be ready to enter the restaurant industry after discovering that he was appointed director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor interprets Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which writes and co-protagonizes with his old partner Greg Hemphil.
The second announced that the next nine months will be the final one, and it seems Kierman plans another life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Arigingmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment, although a Scottish Sun source said Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow's "prosperous restaurant business".
'The sea is ours': inland Bolivia expects the court to take the path to the Pacific
The sailors were watching a shipyard covered with equipment in La Paz.
The public buildings are a blue flag.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are nailed to the slogan: "The sea is our right.
It's a duty to recover it."
In Bolivia without the sea, the memory of a lost coast in Chile in a bloody 19th-century conflict of resources continues alive, just as the desire to sail again through the Pacific Ocean.
Perhaps those hopes are at its highest point in decades, as Bolivia expects an international court decision to justify October 1 after five years of deliberation.
"Bolivia has the necessary impetus, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, awaits a positive release," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see CIX's judgment on giant screens across the country in the hope that the Hague Court will pronounce itself in favour of Bolivia's claim and that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile will be forced to negotiate Bolivia's concession from a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who faces a controversial battle for the reelection next year, also has a lot in play in Monday's judgment.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts find it unlikely that the court would give Bolivia the reason, and that it would not change much if that happened.
The United Nations agency headquarters in the Netherlands has no power to negotiate Chilean territory, and it has stated that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the CIX judgment comes only six months after the final arguments we hear indicates that the case "was not complicated", says the Chilean expert on international law Paz Zárate.
And far from promoting the cause of Bolivia, the last four years could have been delayed.
"The topic of access to the sea has been blocked for a long time by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate says.
Morales' belligerent rhetoric undermined Chile's good will, he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will resume the talks at some point, but it will be very difficult to keep them after that.
The two countries have not been able to exchange ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representative of Bolivia in Haia, rejected the idea that the court had made an unusually fast decision.
On Monday, Bolivia will have "a fantastic opportunity to open a new phase of relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of conflicts with mutual benefits."
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, another of the most popular presidents in Latin America, was using this subject for political purposes.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific," he added.
"The sentence is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen unless it can trust the United States.
North Korea Foreign Minister Ri Yong says his nation will not proceed to nuclear disarmament if it can't trust Washington.
Ri spoke Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to fulfill the promises made during a summit in Singapore among its leaders.
This comment is produced at a time when U.S. State Secretary Mike Pompeo seems to be about to resume the stagnant nuclear diplomacy for more than three decades after the summit with North Korea leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it's "a utopia" that the continued sanctions and objections of the United States to a statement that ends the Korean War can bend to the North.
In Washington he resisted the statement without Pyongyang taking the first step towards disarmament.
Both Kim and President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is generalised skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about giving up an arsenal that the country probably sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pumpeo plans to travel to Pyongyang next month to prepare a second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris' fashion shows reveal the latest line of giant hats that will soon be in the tents.
If you want to increase your collection of hats or cover yourself completely from the sun, don't look any more.
Valentine's and Thom Browne's designers discovered in the gateway a series of extravagant accessories for their spring-summer 2019 collection that admired the public with the purest style of the Paris Fashion Week.
The impossible shadows filled Instagram this summer and these designers took their most amazing creations out to the gateway.
Valentine's main piece was an exaggerated hat bead adorned with a wide beaver imitating feathers that flooded the heads of the models.
Among other large-sized accessories there were shoddy sandals, a magic hat and even a pine, but they were not designed to protect the head of the cold.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of strange masks... just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had their hairy lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than the tall coat.
One of the creations looked like a complete dive team, with the glasses and the tube, and another a melt ice cone.
And if it's the fashion of the huge, it's lucky.
The fashioned people predicted that giant hats could reach the tents.
The disproportionate hats come right after the Bomb, the straw hat with an abate of 60 centimeters that takes everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult mark behind the impossible hat that invades all social networks has brought out another great creation: a ball beach bag almost as large as the model fitted with a bath suit that carries it.
The orange raffia bag decorated with raffia flakes and finished with a white leather handle, was the highlight piece of the Spring Spring 2019 collection of Jacquemus' La Riviera in the Week of fashion in Paris.
The famous Stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I hope that the hats and big beach bags will arrive at the tents next summer, because the designer had such a big impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for oversize accessories.'
John Edward: Language skills are essential to the citizens of the world
The private schools in Scotland maintain a history of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another collection of outstanding results in the examinations, which is only reinforced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community matters.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Private Schools (SCIS by their English stamps), strive to offer the best level to students and their parents.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for higher education, the career they choose and their place as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a well-measured study plan, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable theme within schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that gets him to his head.
But if you speak to him in your own language, he will reach his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot depend solely on English when we want to establish relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Of the results of the recent reviews this year, we can see that languages are at the top of the board and at the highest approval rates in private schools.
Approximately 68% of students who studied foreign languages received an excellence.
The data, compiled from the 74 schools that make up SCIS, show that 72% of the students obtained an honorary degree in Mandarin, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish also achieved an outstanding degree.
This shows that Scottish private schools support languages and consider them key skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
At present, languages are being considered as subjects such as science, technology, engineering and mathematics in private and all kinds of school programmes.
A survey carried out by the UK Employment and Training Commission in 2014, indicated that among the lack of language knowledge, 17% of the reasons why entrepreneurs are costing them to cover their vacancies.
So language skills are increasingly essential to prepare youth for their future careers.
These skills are essential in a globalised world, as there are more job opportunities that require languages.
Regardless of the chosen career, learning a second language will have a real advantage in the future with a lifetime skill like this.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will put a bilingual person directly at the head of the competition.
According to a survey of YouTube among over 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75% didn't speak any foreign language as well as to keep a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a percentage of two digits, in this case a 15%.
That's why it's so important to invest in a language for kids today.
Knowing a number of languages, especially those of developing economies, gives children more opportunities to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, teaching languages differ according to school.
Some schools focus on the most classical modern languages, while others rely on languages that are considered more important for the United Kingdom by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what the interests of their children are, private schools always have a number of languages to choose and specialist teachers in this field.
Scottish private schools specialize in providing a learning environment that prepares children and teams with the skills they need to win, whatever their future holds.
We cannot deny that at this moment, in a global business environment, languages remain vital to the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "international communication skills".
Private schools will continue to offer this diversity and excellence to Scottish youth.
It's a good thing to do.
John Edwards is director of the Scottish Council of private schools.
Lebron begins with Lakers or Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for the sailors who want to see LeBron James playing with Los Angeles Lakers for the first time.
Team coach Like Walton announced that James will play the first pre-war match against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it's still up to decide how many minutes he'll play.
"It'll be more than 1 and less than 48," said Walton on the Lakers' official website.
Laker reporter Mike Trudell posted on Twitter that James would probably play a few minutes.
After training at the beginning of the week, they asked James for his plans about the premeditation of six Lakers parties.
At this point in my career, I don't need pre-time games to be ready," he said.
Trump's election events arrive in Virginia, on YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts a series of campaign mints tonight at Wheeling, West Virginia.
It will be the first of the 5 mins scheduled by Trump for next week, including stops in cities like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote of confirmation suspended for his candidate to cover the vacancy of the Supreme Court, Trump intends to obtain support for the next half term elections, as the Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress when voting in November.
What time is Trump's mitin in West Virginia and how can you see it on the Internet?
The Trump Mitin in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for Saturday 29 September 2018 at 7 p.m. ET.
You can see Trump's mitin in West Virginia following via live streaming on YouTube.
Trump will probably discuss the subject of this week's trial to the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who has become stressed by the allegations of inappropriate sexual conduct and who is holding the Senate's confirmation vote for one week while the FBI investigates.
But the main objective of this series of mitins is to help the Republicans deal with the November elections with a new impulse.
Therefore, these five mines that Trump will give next week have the objective of "dynizing volunteers and supporters while the Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and in the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so important to your agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible to the campaign season," said Reuters a Trump campaign speaker who preferred not to be appointed.
The middle of the night, which will be held at Wesbanco Stadium, could bring together the supporters of "Ohio and Pennsylvania and get coverage from the Pittsburgh media", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in a month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state in which he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate from West Virginia to the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, last in the polls.
"It is not a good symptom for Morrisey that the president must come to support him in the investigations," said Simon Haeder, a politician at the University of West Virginia to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows endurance to fight and keep the hope alive until individual Sunday parties
After three individual sessions, Saturday's 4:00 p.m. could have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The oscillating impulse pendulum is a completely invented sports concept, but in what athletes really believe, and especially in competitions like this.
So where would they say the impulse is now?
"They had a six-point advantage and now they're four, so I guess we're taking that as a little impulse," said Jordan Spieth as he walked at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has four more points of advantage at stake.
The Americans, said Spieth, feel they have a bit of wind in their favour and much to cheer up, among other things, the technique of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each account with three points four.
Spieth turned lethal from tea to green and is preaching with example.
Those gutural screams were made stronger as he moved forward his round, making a crucial putt to pummel the fourth party when he and Thomas were two points below after two.
When he got the putt that made them win the game at 15, he threw a similar scream, the type of scream that says he thinks the American team isn't out yet.
"You just have to concentrate and worry about your party," Spieth said.
It's the only thing that's left of these players now.
18 holes to leave stuck.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, Ryder Cup's indisputable story.
The strange but adorable European couple have four and cannot be mistaken.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't make a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and not last nine holes on Friday morning.
That journey, and the way their energy seems to flow to the crowd and from it, confirms them as rivals beating Sunday, and there could be no more popular players to win a victory when the sun sets on Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Mostly both at the same time in different holes.
However, speaking of European glory is still premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly disbanded Sergio Garcia, the hero of the fourballs in the morning, when he paired up with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first trip ended with the Spanish and the Swedish in a hole they've never been close to leaving.
But on Sunday there will be no one to help get out of the hole.
The fourballs and the fursomes are so fascinating to see from the close of the interactions between the couples, the advice given, the not and the way a strategy can change in a moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and they have a significant advantage the last day, but this foursome session has also shown that the US Team has the strength to fight, things that some, especially Stateside, have doubted.
Europe has an advantage of 10-6 the last day of Ryder Cup.
Europe will enjoy a good advantage the last day of Ryder Cup after leaving the fourballs and the foursomes with a 10-6 advantage over the United States.
The inspired duo formed by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led to two victories over a Tiger Woods with difficulty in climbing four points to the Le Golf National marker.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who was trying to preserve the trophy they lost two years ago in Hazeltine, dominated an American team that failed in the morning fourballs, putting the 3-1 series.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the fursomes, winning four matches, but they couldn't cut the edge.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points from Sunday's 12 individual games to preserve the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novel to win four points followed, while Molinari and Molliwood, after a sensational weekend, are the second pair to win four points of the four original games in Ryder Cup history.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed into fourballs, they matched the perfection to defeat a depleted Woods and the American novelty Bryson Dechambeau with 5+4 more categorical.
Woods, who fought two parties on Saturday without any punishment or glory, showed occasional cracks of brightness, but now lost 19 out of 29 parties in fourballs and foursomes and five follow-up.
Justin Rose, who rested in the morning's four-balls, came back to meet his wife Henrik Stenson in the fursomes and struck a defeat in front of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, numbers one and three in the world.
Europe could not always win on a pleasant day of breeze in southwest Paris.
The three times champion Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas fixed the reference point for the Americans getting two points on Saturday.
They won a 2&1 victory over Spanish John Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and they won Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the foursomes after losing the first two holes.
There were only two times in Ryder Cup's history where a team would raise four points in the individual, even though as the current owner of the trophy, Furyk's team just needs to keep it together.
However, after being the second best in two days, a counterattack on Sunday seems to be out of reach.
North Red says no to unilateral disarmament if you don't trust
North Korea's Foreign Minister reported on Saturday to the United Nations that continued sanctions increased their distrust in the United States and that the country would not deliver its nuclear weapons under those circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho informed the annual General Assembly that North Korea would take "important steps to show its good will" last year, such as stopping nuclear tests and missiles, dismantle nuclear testing camps and commit to the proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we don't see the corresponding answer by the United States," he added.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under such circumstances, there will be no unilateral disarmament first on our part."
While Ri resumed the well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to "gradual" denuclearization by which North Korea would be rewarded as it took action, its statement seemed important, since it did not reject unilateral denuclearization as it did with Pyongyang in the past.
Ri made reference to a joint statement made by Kim Jong One and Donald Trump at the first summit between an active US president and a North Korean leader held in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim committed himself to the "denuclearization" of the Korean peninsula" while Trump secured North Korea's security.
North Korea has long been looking for a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has declared that Pyongyang must first lay down its nuclear weapons.
Washington also refused to relax the severe international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on "denuclearization first" and increases the pressure through sanctions to achieve its objective of coercive success, and even if they oppose "declaration of the end of war," said Ri.
"The perception that sanctions can make us kneel is an impossible dream for those who don't know us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions are exacerbating our mistrust."
Ri did not mention the plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump that the US leader mentioned in the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
However, he spoke of three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader, Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If the other part of this topic of denuclearization were South Korea and not the United States, denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached a dead point."
Still, Ri's tone of speech was radically different from that of last year, when he told the United Nations General Assembly it was inevitable to attack the United States with North Korean missiles after the "evil president" Trump called Kim "man fire you on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, which last year threatened with "complete destruction" North Korea, praised Kim for her courage to take steps to disarmament, but said there was still much work to be done and that sanctions should be maintained until North Korea is denuclearized.
Wednesday Trump said there was no time for that, and that "the same takes two years, three or five months."
China and Russia discuss whether the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang with the measures taken.
However, on Thursday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council that: "The enforcement of the Security Council's sanctions must continue with firmness and without exception until we observe total, final and verified denuclearization".
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions in North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to cut funds for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and then commented that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompey has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that he had made progress, only a few hours before North Korea accused him of making "mafia demands."
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to dismantle a missile site, as well as a nuclear complex, if the United States adopted the "relevant measures".
He pointed out that Kim had told him that the "relevant measures" he was seeking were the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and the progress towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to rest enough
This year, a new course at Harvard University is making all its students sleep more in order to combat the growth of masquerade culture to study all night stimulated by caffeine.
One academic found that university students number one in the world often do not know the basic aspects of how to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard School of Medicine and a specialist at the Brigham Hospital and the Muller, designed the course, which he believes is the first of this kind in the United States.
It was inspired to start the course after giving a talk about the impact that lack of sleep had on learning.
"At the end of the course, a girl came up and said to me, 'Why are you just telling me this now, in my last year?'
He said no one had told him about the importance of sleeping, which surprised me," he commented to The Telegraph.
The course, which was launched this year for the first time, explains to students the basic aspects of how to acquire good sleep habits helped with academic and athletic performance, as well as improves general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard School of Medicine and executive director of university health services, said that the university decided to present the course after discovering that students had an important lack of sleep during the week.
The duration course involves a number of interactive tasks.
In a section there is a picture of a bedroom, where students click on cupcakes of coffee, curtains, trainers and books to get information about the effects of caffeine and light and how the sleep deficit affects athletic performance, as well as the importance of having a routine at bedtime.
In another section, the participants are informed how the lack of prolonged sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, brain failure, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that it will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we think they have the right to know this information, just as we have the right to know what the health effects are if we choose to smoke tobacco," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride of spending the entire night awake still exists, says. And it adds that modern technology and the increasing pressure for students that involved lack of sleep was an increasing problem.
Ensuring that he sleeps enough and that he has a good sleep must be a student's "secret weapon" to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, it signals. Even to avoid swallowing, because lack of sleep makes the brain enter in an iniquitous way, which makes him hungry constantly.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studied chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Cheisler design the course, after attending one of his classes last year's first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to drive a course across the campus.
The next step, wait, is to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Cheisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm to lie down, as well as when they wake up. Similarly, it is recommended that they be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" that emits the electronic screens and LED lighting, which can imbalance the circadian rhythm and cause problems to sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal is to destroy Gerard's men
The Rangers suffered another sad episode when Dolly Menga's attack relegated Steven Gerrard's disarmed team to a 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
Ibrox's team wanted to record their first home victory since the 4-1 victory in St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as a coach, which he left his team at eight points from the Hearts, leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership, the Scottish League.
Menga attacked seven minutes before rest and a low-inspired Ranger alignment never gave the feeling that he was empathizing.
While the Rangers went down to sixth place, Livingston went up to third place and is only behind the Hibernian with a different goal.
And it could have been a lot worse for the Rangers after the Calum Spence line judge had to have treated for a head injury under the supposed launch of an object.
Gerard made eight changes regarding the team that dragged Ayr to the semifinals of Betfred Cup, the Scottish League Cup.
On the other hand, Holt was with the same 11 from Livingston who took out a point to the Hearts last week and would have been delighted with the way his organized assembly drowned their opponents at all times.
The Rangers may dominate possession, but Livingston did much more when they had the balloon.
They could have marked in just two minutes when Menga's first-time short passage sent Scott Pittman to the doorway of Allan McGregor, but the middle camper wasted this great opportunity.
A powerful free shot from Keaghan Jacobs arrived at Captain Craig Halkett, but his defence partner, Alan Lithgow, only managed to nail him in the second suit.
The Rangers took control, but they seem to have more hope than conviction about their game in the offensive area.
Alfredo Morelos no doubt felt that they would have to have asked Penalti at 15 minutes when he and Steven Lawless were shocked, but the arbitrator, Steven Thomson, ignored the Colombian claims.
The Rangers only fired two shots at the door in the first half, but the former guard of Ibrox, Liam Kelly, just had trouble with Lassana Coulibaly's head end and Ovie Ejaria's attack.
While Livingston's opening in minute 34 could have gone against the logic of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for their hard work.
Rangers failed again in the face of the strong formation of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher fitted the balloon to Scott Robinson, who kept cold blood to choose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard acted on his break by changing Coulibaly for Ryan Kent, a change that almost had an immediate effect when the Zurdo made a pass to Morelos, but the impotent Kelly ran from his line to block it.
But Livingston kept devouring visitors by playing exactly the kind of game they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett picking up a long ball after another.
Holt's team could have extended the advantage in the final moments, but McGregor stood up perfectly to reject Jacobs before Lithgow heads from the cornet.
Rangers' replacement, Glenn Middleton, claimed another penalty when he was dating Jacobs, but Thomson made the fat look again.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page of our Sunday Morning almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and counter... it was the day when the physical future of Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as Geiger counter.
A pier of science since then, Count Geiger also became a fundamental element of pop culture, such as in the 1950 film "Bells of Crownado" ("The Crown Camps"), which was named after those seemingly isolated vampire scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is that in the world?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these earpieces, you can hear the effects of atoms emitted by the radioactive activity of minerals."
Evans: "Say, I'm sure you're rocking now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days after his 63th birthday.
But the invention that bears his name survives.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" the defective cells
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" the defective cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immunological system to recognize defective cells as part of treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory
You can "see" a common protein to various types of cancer and inject it again
A test vaccine is showing promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize defective cells, has seen her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, which are changed in the laboratory so they can "see" a common protein to various types of cancer called HER2 and then reject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute at Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "incentives the growth of various types of cancer", including those of breast, ovaries, lung and colorectal, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to the extraction of immune cells from patients and "ensignals" to approach cancer cells worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West made a speech in favor of Trump when using a MAGA (Make America Great Again) hat after its appearance in the Saturday Night Live (SNL) program.
And the result wasn't good.
During a Saturday Night Live program, they supported Kanye West in the study after a confusing presentation in which he praised US President Donald Trump, and said he would present himself as a candidate in 2020.
After playing the third song of the night, called Ghost Town, in which he carried a hat from Make America Great Again, he criticized the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"I often talk to a white man and say, "How can you like Trump if he's racist?"
If I were worried about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago," he said.
SNL started the program with a satire named Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star joked at Brett Kavanaugh's witness to the U.S. Senate Judicial Committee on sexual assault claims made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even though it hasn't been broadcast, Chris Rock went up the images of Western criticism on social networks.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to joke about West with this publication.
In addition, West complained to the audience that there had been a bad time in the builders because of their hat.
"They spent with me in the builders.
They said, "Don't go out with that hat."
They scared me!
And then they said I was going to the picnic," Washington Examiner said.
West continued: "Do you want to see how I'm going to pick up?" saying that I was going to "use my superman hat, because it means you can't tell me what I have to do."
Try it out with love."
His comments led to applause in the audience at least twice, and the members of the SNL list seemed to be ashamed, he informed Variety magazine, with the following testimony that a person who was there gave to the publication: "All the study remained in absolute silence."
They had appointed West as the last replacement for Ariana Grande, whose old boy, raptor Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West left a lot of people perplexing with an interpretation of song I love it ("I love"), dressed as a Perrier water bottle.
West received the support of the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who wrote the following tweet: "For one of the bravest spirits: Thank you FOR FAILING MAFIA"
However, the presenter of an interview program, Karen Hunter, wrote a tweet saying that West was simply "to be who it is and that is absolutely wonderful".
"So I chose not to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothes or by supporting his art) who I think is embracing and spreading an ideology that is harmful to my community.
It's free.
Just like us," he added.
Before the show, the rapist announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that it was now "to be officially known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name; he follows Diddy's steps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Snoop Dogg had the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the last legend of the music, Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then the artist previously known as Prince.
Charges for attempted murder for torture at the Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.

The accused is expected to appear before the Belfast Court on Monday.
The Public Prosecutor's Office will review the charges.
The star of Game of Thrones, Kit Harington, attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword handling role as Jon Snow in the violent fantastic medieval series of HBO Game of Thrones.
The 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of a maquisist hero, saying that these roles on the screen translate into what it seems that young people often have to be hard to respect.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that "something has failed" and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the age of #MeToo (#EuTamén).
Kit, who recently married the co-protagonist of Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, admitted that she felt "a bit strong" to address the problem.
"Personally, I feel pretty strong at this moment, when we are wrong with masculinity," he said.
"What do we teach men when they grow up, in terms of the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that television can partly be responsible for increasing male toxicity thanks to its very male characters.
He continued: "What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on television and on the streets; what makes young people feel that they have to be that particular part of being a man?
I think it's really one of the big questions of our time; how did we change that?
Because, of course, something went wrong with the boys."
In the interview, he also admitted that he will not make any precuela or sequel of Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, claiming that "a lot of horses and battlefields".
As of November, Kit will stage a reposition of True West, of Sam Shepard, who tells the story of a filmmaker and his brother, who is a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that he felt that his meeting with his wife, Rose, was the best of Game of Thrones.
"I knew my wife in this program, so, in a way, she provided me with my future family and my life from here forward," he said.
Rose interpreted Ygritte, the love of Kit's character, Jon Snow, into Emmy's winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the land of Leslie's family heritage in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% in new cases
China has announced an increase of 14% in the number of people living with HIV or AIDS.
It affects more than 820,000 people in the country, health authorities have declared.
40,000 new cases were notified only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases have been sexually transmitted, which marks a change in the past.
Traditionally, HIV has been rapidly spread by parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contracted HIV in this way had been substantially reduced to zero, the Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, in the interim, the number of people living with HIV or with AIDS in China increased by 100,000.
The sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was discriminated against in China in 1997, but they ensure that discrimination against LGBT people was extended.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that between 70 and 90% of men who have sexual relations with other men will end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of the disease come from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV mediation as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters is disappointed that a member of the staff is filtering data from the senators of the Republican Party, "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
On Saturday, U.S. representative Maxine Waters reported allegations that a member of his staff had published personal information from three United States Republican Party senators on the legislators' Wikipedia pages.
The Democrat of Los Angeles Democrat said the statements were being made by websites and commentators of the "ultradreit".
"Truths, lies, and more infamous lies," Waters commented on a statement on Twitter.
According to the U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham, from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person in Capitol Hill, the headquarters of the U.S. government, during a Senate panel hearing on sexual misconduct charges against the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The filtration appeared a little after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Puntit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of the publications was associated with the Waters department and revealed information from a Waters staff member, Capitol Hill reported.
"This unfounded accusation is totally false and a complete lie," continued Waters.
"My staff member, whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these false and fraudulent accusations, was not responsible for any way of filtration of this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and a complete lie."
Waters' statement immediately raised online criticisms, including those of the former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This nonsense was made angry," wrote Fleischer.
"You understand that you have no temper to be a member of Congress.
When they accuse someone of something he didn't do, he shouldn't get angry.
It should not be challenging.
You must not question the defendant's reasons.
It must remain attractive and serene."
It seemed that Fleischer was comparing Water's reaction to the criticism of the democrats of Judge Kavanaugh, to whom the critics accused him of feeling too angry during the hearing of Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who was presented to unbundling Waters in the mid-term elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Very strong if it was true," he said on a tweet.
In his statement, Waters said his department warned "the law enforcement entities and the appropriate authorities of these fraudulent charges.
"We will make sure that the guilty are discovered," he continued, "so that they are legally held responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all and every member of my team."
Criticism of Johnny English Strikes Again (Johnny English: Again in Action), the parody of spy without power of Rowan Atkinson
It is already traditional to seek Brexit's transcendence in new films from a British point of view and it seems that this can be applied to the return of the frankness of this parody and comedy of action by Johnny English, who started in 2003 with Johnny English and returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn ("Johnny English Returns").
Will Satisfying Ironic become about the apparently stupid issue that we are on the new export opportunity of the nation?
Anyway, the incompetent character of Johnny English's eye jump and rubber face renewed his license to ruin things for the second time. His name is already a clear indication that this is a general comic book designed for non-anglophone cinematographic territories.
Of course, it's the stupid secret agent who, despite his starring claims of glamur audulator, has a bit of Clouseau, Mr. Bean's boyfriend and a piece of that guy who contributed with a single note on the topic of Fire Cars at the opening ceremony of the London Olympics 2012.
It is also originally based on the cosmopolitan and mysterious international agent Atkinson once interpreted into Barclaycard's now forgotten television ads, where he was sowing chaos at his step.
There's a couple of good moments at Johnny English's last date.
I love it when Johnny English approaches a helicopter while he's wearing a medieval armor suit and the rotor's steps make a brief leap against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift to physical comedy jumps into sight, but it gives the impression that humor has little strength and is strangely superfluous, especially when this kind of "serious", like 007 and impossible mission, are already using comedy convincingly as one of its ingredients.
It seems as if humor was directed to children, instead of adults, and in my opinion, Johnny English's extravagant adventures are not as clever or concentrated as Atkinson's movie jokes when incarcerating Bean's character.
Now the permanent topic argument is that Britain has serious problems.
A cyber pirate is infiltrated into the network of supersecret web spies in Britain and reveals the identities of all British agents in the area, for the distress of the agent in service, an unfortunate little role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the culmination of a prime minister of Pompey and in conflict, who already has a total political unpopularity crisis: Emma Thompson gives the best of himself with this character that almost looks like Theresa May, but you can't do much with the script.
Your informed intelligence advisors that, as all spies have been engaged in active, they must get someone out of retirement.
And that refers to the incompetent Johnny English in person, who now works as a professor in some snob institution, but gives extra-official classes about how to become an infiltrated agent; in this part there are some jokes, when English offers the Academy of Mirrors to a rock school.
They take English back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and meet with their old and suffering companion Bough, interpreted again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man with a submarine captain, an enthusiastic role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little lost.
So the Batman and Robin of the misdemeanours of the Secret Service of His Majesty return to action, meeting the beautiful fatal woman of Olga Kurylenko, Ophelia Bulletin.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously succumbing to the charm of the technological multi-billionaire charisma that says he can solve British computer problems: the late Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odesis of ridiculous falcaturats: costumed by comrades, they catch fire at an ostensible French restaurant; they create a riot that illegally puts them on board the luxury yacht of Volta; and English causes total anarchy by trying to use some virtual reality helmets to familiarize itself with the interior of the Volta house.
Obviously, all the arrests come out of this last sequence, but in a kind and scandalous way that it is, it seems to be pulled out of a children's television program.
The result is quite regular.
And, as happened to the other films by Johnny English, I couldn't help but think: the British cinema industry can't offer Rowan Atkinson a role that really makes justice to his talent?
The Labor Party denies that it is designing a plan for the British to work four days a week, but it covers five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labor Party is considering a radical plan that will make British people work four days a week but cover for five
Apparently, the party wants entrepreneurs to spend their savings through the artificial intelligence (IA) revolution to the workers by offering them an additional day off.
In this way, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but would continue to receive the same salary.
The sources say that the idea would be "adjusted" to the party's economic agenda and its plans to bend the country in favour of the workers.
The Congress of Trade Unions supported four-day shifts per week as a measure for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
An important source of the Labor Party told The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"It won't happen overnight, but a four-day working week is an ambition that adjusts to the party's approach to balance the economy in favour of the worker, as well as to the party's general industrial strategy."
The Labor Party would not be the first to support this idea, since the Green Party promised a four-day working week during its campaign for the 2017 general election.
So, at present, the Labor Party does not support ambition in its entirety.
A spokesperson from the Labor Party said, "A four-day working week doesn't go into party politics and is not being considered by this party."
The chancellor in the shadows, John McDonnell, used the Labour Party conference last week to strengthen his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to regain the power of "anonymous directors" and "speculators" in public service companies.
The plans of the chancellor in the shadow also involve the possibility that the current shareholders of the water companies do not recover all their investment, as a laborist government could carry out "deductions" due to perceived irregularities.
It also confirmed plans to place workers in company councils and create inclusive ownership funds to deliver 10% of private sector company shares to employees, who pay annual dividends at a value of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy are counting on "60 Minutes" if the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh could make them change their mind.
The FBI's investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed at least one week's final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court. The question is whether the Department's findings could influence the Republican senators to withdraw their support.
On Sunday, during an interview, the reporter of the "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could bring out something that would lead them to change their mind.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said I'd go to the hearing, I talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the charge came out and asked him if he had done it.
It was firm, determined, round."
However, Graham's vote seems to be irrevocable.
"My opinion of Brett Kavanaugh is determined and would make an explosive accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened; but I know the following: Brett denied it all the time," Graham added in reference to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And the people he mentioned couldn't verify it.
It happened 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and did something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event that has an impressive star poster that will act and an equally impressive mission to end world poverty.
In its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see thousands of people coming to the Great Lawn area of Central Park, not only to enjoy performances such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real objective of the event of ending poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who actively fight it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), the assistant audience had to complete a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call or any other significant way to help create awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But what is the degree of success achieved by the 12-year-old Global Citizen to achieve its goal?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is a Geneva way to persuade people to ask for action or is it just another case of "clitivism", people who think that it makes a difference when signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has been saying that it has registered more than 19 million "actions" of its followers, promoting a set of different goals.
He claims that these actions helped to encourage world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion established to influence lives of more than 2250 million by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and announcements arising from its actions, of which at least $10 billion were already disbursed or recovered.
The group estimates that so far the guaranteed funds have had a direct impact on almost 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a United Kingdom investor and executive society that committed itself to "helping children develop to their maximum potential", with the promise to provide Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving over 4700 tweets from Global Citizen.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national authorities and Global Citizen's supporters like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into a note on the page of history," the ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, told the crowd during a live concert in April 2018 in London.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken to improve the nutrition of mothers and children in the United Kingdom, the government announced funds for the The Power of Nutrition project that will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In answer to one of the common questions on your website, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: "It will be a long and difficult path and sometimes we will fall and fail.
But in the same way as it happened with the great anti-apartheid movements and in favor of the civil rights that precede us, we will achieve it, because together, we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae are some of the artists who will perform at this year's event in New York, which will be presented by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy to carry out a "block" to make Russia's energy exports more difficult, the US Interior Secretary announced
"If necessary," Washington may use the Navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, revealed the US Interior Secretary, Ryan Zinke, as Washington Examiner quoted.
Zinke claimed that Russia's commitment to Syria, especially where legitimate government bodies operate, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they're in the Middle East is that they want to negotiate with the energy in the same way they did it in Eastern Europe," he said, according to the report.
Besides, according to the officer, they have the ways and the means to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability, along with the Navy, to ensure that the seaways are open and, if necessary, block them to ensure that their energy does not go to the market," he said.
Zinke thus addressed the participants of the event organized by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group called itself the "voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He compared Washington's strategies to deal with Russia and Iran, considering that in practice it is the same.
"The economic option in Iran and Russia is, more or less, to exploit and replace fuels," he commented, at the same time referring to Russia, saying that "there is only one tactic" with a hydrocarbon-dependent economy.
Statements were made while Trump's administration was on a mission to boost exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, in order to replace Russia, the cheapest option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump's administration officials, including the president himself, tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "unadequate" Nord Stream 2 oil pipeline project, which, according to Trump, turned Berlin into a "cow" from Moscow.
Moscow repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2 oil pipeline, which was set up to double the capacity of the existing oil pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a simple economic project.
Kremlin argued that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is only argued for economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the idea that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said Russian Minister of Energy Aleksandr Novak, during a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry, who took place in September in Moscow.
The US position received Germany's reaction, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The German industry leader organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI, for its German stamps), urged the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a great problem when a third state intervenes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, BDI president, after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will carefully examine his candidacy to the presidency in 2020, says Senator of Massachusetts
On Saturday, Senator of Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren, said that he would carefully examine his candidacy to the presidency during the mid-term elections.
During a public assembly in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider his candidacy.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and repair the broken government and that includes a woman in power," said The Hill.
"In November 6th, I will carefully examine my candidacy to the presidency."
Warren commented on President Donald Trump during the public assembly, saying he was "carrying this country in the wrong direction.
"I'm very worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren was frank in his criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren commented on a tweet "of course there's a need for an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, in a survey published on Thursday, it was shown that most of Warren's own voters do not believe it will be presented in 2020.
Fifty percent of Massachusetts' "probable" voters said the senator would not submit his candidacy, according to a poll by Suffolk University Political Research Centre and Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported that candidacy.
The investigation showed more support for the candidacy of the former governor, Deval Patrick, with 38 percent support for a possible candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other prominent names of the Democrats in connection with a possible candidate in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide before January, informed the Associated Press Agency.
Sarah Palin cites the post-traumatic stress disorder (TEPT) of Track Palin in the middle of Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after making a list in September
Monday night, arrested and accused of an incident of domestic violence
"With what my own son is going through, with what he's going through again, I can see myself reflected in other families who feel the consequences of the TEPT and some of the injuries that our soldiers are returning," explained to the audience in a half-hearted Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin said his arrest was a taboo topic and that his son and other war veterans "were turned different, hardened, wondering if there was any reason why the militia and airmen, as well as other members of the army, offered the country".
They arrested him on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused him of domestic violence against a woman, which interfered with a report of domestic violence and possession of a gun while he was drunk, according to Dan Bennett, spokesperson of the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and the District of Colombia challenge the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Colombia support a judicial appeal against a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims of domestic violence or criminal organizations.
On Friday, 18-state representatives and the district presented a friendly report from the court in Washington to support an asylum-seeker who challenged politics, he informed NBC News.
The full name of the applicant part of Grace's Pricing Sessions v. that the American Civil Liberties Union (United States for Civil Liberties) presented in August did not reveal itself against federal policy.
He said his wife "and her children members of a violent criminal organization" abused her, but the US officials refused her asylum request on July 20th.
He's been arrested in Texas.
Lawyers from the states that support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum-seekers for the United States, such as nations facing generalized problems with criminal organizations and related to domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy withdrew a 2014 decision from the Board of Immigration Appeals which allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The District Attorney General, Karl Racine, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international legislation".
"Federal legislation requires all asylum applications to be awarded according to the particular facts and circumstances of the application, and that prohibition violates that principle" was explained in the court's friendly report.
The prosecutors continued to debate in the report that the policy that rejects the entry of immigrants damages the US economy, explaining that they are likely to become entrepreneurs and that they "provide labour".
In June, the general prosecutor, Jeff Sessions, ordered the immigration judges not to grant more asylum to the victims who were victims of domestic abuse and the violence of criminal organizations.
"The asylum is available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political opinion," Sessions declared in their policy announcement on 11 June.
The asylum has never been designed to alleviate all the problems (including all the serious problems) people face every day around the world.
Rescue efforts desperate in Palu as the number of victims doubles in a career to find survivors
For survivors, the situation was getting worse and worse.
"The circumstances are very tense," says Risa Kusuma's 35-year-old mother, comforting her February baby in the city's fell evacuation center of Palu.
"Every minute comes an ambulance with bodies.
And clean water is scarce."
The residents were seen returning to their ruined houses, collecting their stolen property, trying to save anything they found.
There are hundreds of injured people and hospitals, damaged by magnitude 7.5 earthquake, are flooded.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Harris, who broke his back and shoulder, rested outside the Palu Military Hospital, where the patients were treated in the open air due to continuous and strong replicas.
The tears filled his eyes as he explained how he felt that the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save us.
The ruins of the wall have crushed me, I think," said Harris to the Associated Press, and added that his family was in a wedding in the city.
"I heard my wife ask for help and then just keep quiet.
I don't know what happened to her or my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
US Ambassador accuses China of abusing "propagandistic ads"
A week after a Chinese official newspaper published a four-page announcement in a U.S. newspaper preaching the benefits of US-China trade, the US ambassador in China accuses Beijing of using American press to spread propaganda.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, referred to China Daily's payment supplement at the Des Moines Register, the most sold newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of joining the U.S. Congress elections, which will be held on 6 November, because China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to intervene in the US elections marked what that country's officials had done in Reuters as a new phase of a growing Washington campaign to coerce China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to publish advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently trapped in a growing trade war testify to the level of tariffs in their respective imports.
According to experts from China and the United States, China's compensatory tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were designed to harm state exporters like Iowa, which supports the Trump Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and Iowa Ex-Governor, one of the main exporters of agricultural products to China, said that Beijing had harmed workers, farmers and North American entrepreneurs.
In an article written by Branstad and published in the Sunday edition of the Moines Register, it was pointed out that China is "intensifying this harassment campaign by broadcasting propaganda ads in the free American press".
"By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government takes advantage of the appreciated American tradition of freedom of expression and of the press by publishing a payment announcement at the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, in the post of newspapers located at the end of this street in Beijing, there are few dissident voices and there is no real reflection of the dissident opinions that Chinese may have on China's worrying economic path, since the media are under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he adds.
Even so, he says that "one of China's most important journals has declined the offer to publish" his article, even though he has not confirmed that it is a journal.
Kavanaugh's disaster makes women's Republican vote to be lost in a few days' term of office.
Although many of the major Republicans support and defend Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, despite the various allegations of sexual assault, analysts warn of a violent reaction, especially of female voters, in the next half-term elections.
The reactions around these accusations were numerous and most Republicans were positioned to proceed with the vote.
"These things can't be undone," said Grant Reeher, professor of political sciences at Maxwell University School in Syracuse in an article published on Sunday in The Hill.
Reeher also claimed that the last hour of Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) for an FBI investigation would be sufficient to calm the spirits of angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, nor will they forget it in the near future nor in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, chief advisor and national spokesman of the Progressive Group MoveOn, in the newspaper Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, the opponents, at the "Acercase November!" flu, appeared in the Senate corridor, while the Republicans, under the control of the Judicial Committee, decided to proceed with the appointment of Kavanaugh, despite the witness of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, informed Mic.
"The motivation and enthusiasm of the Democrats will surpass any expectations," said Stu Rothenberg, a neutral political analyst.
"It's true that it's already high,
but it's still going to be more sealed, especially among the indecisive voters of the neighborhoods or those between 18 and 29 years old, who, although they don't like the President, don't usually go to the polls."
Before Ford's public witness detailed his allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court candidates, analysts suggested that it would be possible to have a violent reaction if the Republicans continued to confirm.
"This has become a disaster for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former member of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of the week in the NBC News channel.
"This goes beyond the vote of the committee, the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh will sit in the bench of the accused or not. The problem is how the Republicans managed this and how they treated it," said Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities USA, who helps choose the Democrats in the news channel.
However, it seems that the Americans are divided between believing the testimony of Ford or of Kavanaugh, even though they are more inclined to support the latter.
A new YouTube survey shows that 41% of the people surveyed believe in Ford's witness entirely or probably, in front of 35% who support Kavanaugh's witness.
In addition, 38% think that Kavanaugh was most likely lying during his testimony, in front of a 30% who thinks the same thing about Ford.
In the light of the pressure exerted by Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the charges filed by Ford, as well as those of at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, informs The Guardian.
Last week, Ford testified before the Senate Judicial Committee under oath that Kavanaugh attacked in a Hebrew state when he was 17 years old.
On the other hand, Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed Genitals at a university party when he studied in Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web Creator wants to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the last project of this technology legend, is a Solid-based company, Berners-Lee's open-source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people can access what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee had a chance that the intention he's hiding Inrupt is "dominating the world".
"We have to do it," he said about the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "on-line personal data store" or POD.
Contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music and other personal and professional tools can be included.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are available in a single browser at the same time.
All this makes this personal data store unique is that the user has full control over who can access what information.
The company describes this as a "personal empowerment through the data".
The idea of Inrupt, according to its president John Bruce, is that the company provides adequate resources, processes and skills to help Solid be available to everyone.
The company is currently made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security company owned by IBM, some developers hired to work on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week on, developers from around the world could create their own decentralized applications with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that neither he nor his team spoke with "Facebook nor Google about entering or not a complete change that would modify their business models from one day to another.
"We don't need your permission."
In an article published on Saturday in Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps to protect the integrity and quality of a new solid-based web."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet into the World Wide Web Consortium community at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has stood up as an influential voice in the debate on network neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee continues to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium community, as well as Web Foundation and Open Data Institute organizations.
"I'm very optimistic about this new web age," Berners-Lee added.
Honor Bernard Vann, a cleric decorated with the Victoria Cross in World War I
The only Church of England clergyman who was decorated with the Victorian Cross during World War I received a posthumous tribute in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and Reverend Bernard Vann was won on September 29, 1918, in the Bellenglise and Lehaucourt attack.
However, he was murdered by a sniper four days later without knowing that he was granted the highest British military decoration.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren were responsible for discovering a memorial monument in his honor at a show in Rushden (Northamptonshire).
Michael Vann, one of his grandchildren, highlighted the symbolism of discovering this monument just 100 years after his grandfather's estate that deserved his title.
According to London Gazette, September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann addressed his battalion through the Saint-Quentin channel "through a dense fog and under the game of an intense fire of meteors".
Later he rushed to get to the line of fire and, with a "great courage," directed the line forward before rushing with a cannon and no one's help, and throwing down three persons from the enemy's position.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was murdered by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something he could never live with, but a lesson like that."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also placed a crown of flowers after the parade, which led the young Brentwood Imperial band.
Michael Vann said he felt "very honored to participate in the parade" and added that "the value of this genius hero demonstrates the support of so many people."
Peppa Pig cut the list to MMA's favorites at the best time
Imagine you're taking all night smart to enjoy Bellator 206's full show, and when you get to the best part, something prevents you.
San Jose's cartel included 13 fights, being six mains, and was streaming live in the United Kingdom in Channel 5.
But at 6:00 in the morning, just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were going to see their faces, the viewers of the United Kingdom were perplexing when they saw Peppa Pig.
Some were not impressed after having spent so many hours of expertise waiting to see the fight.
An amateur described the change in these childish drawings on Twitter as "a very bad joke."
"The state regulation ruled that this content was not appropriate for 6 a.m., and that is why he had to change to child programming," said Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice-President of Marketing and Bellator Communication, when asked for the retransmission.
"Peppa Pig, that's it."
Scott Coker, President of Bellator, said they will take into account UK viewers in future programming.
"I think we can solve it when we think about repetition," Coker said.
"But if it's 6 in the morning there, we can't solve it until Sunday, which will already be Monday for them.
But we're working to find a solution.
When the change occurred, I began to receive many messages and not all were pleasant.
We were trying to solve it because we thought it was a technical error.
But no, it was a government problem.
I promise it won't happen again.
We're going to limit ourselves to five fights instead of six.
It's a lot of anger."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior because of her sexuality
Tom Daley, an Olympic jumper, says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality, but this made him find the motivation to triumph.
This 24-year-old athlete says he didn't realize that not everyone was like him until he got to the institute.
Invited to the first broadcast of the 4 Radio 4 Desert Island Discs program led by Lauren Laverne, she explained that she started talking about the rights of homosexuals to give hope to others.
He also shared that being a father helped him to relativize the importance of winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the usual presenter of this program, is low for illness.
As guest of Laverne's first program, Daley shared that she felt "less" to the rest of the people because "it wasn't socially acceptable that you liked children and girls."
He even said, "To this day, that feeling of inferiority and being different is what moved me and gave me the strength needed to achieve success."
I wanted to prove that it was "someone" so that people wouldn't feel disappointed when they discovered their sexuality.
With two bronze Olympic medals, he became a prominent LGBT activist and used his appearance in the Commonwealth of Australia games to ask the most countries that decriminalized homosexuality.
He decided to speak because he felt lucky to be able to live openly and without fear of impact, and wanted to give hope to others.
The three times champion of the world said to fall in love with the American performer Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013, "it was all a surprise."
Daley married this winner of a Oscar last year and said the 20-year difference between them was never a problem.
"When you live so long" (with only 14 years of age he first participated in Olympic Games and his father died of cancer three years later), it's hard to find someone of your age who experienced similar altipation.
The couple had their first son in June, Robert Ray Black-Daley, and this birth made Daley completely change his perspective.
"If you asked me last year, my greatest motivation would be to win a gold medal," he says.
"But now I know there are much more important things than an Olympic gold medal.
For me, my medal is Robbie."
His son bears the name of his father Robert, who died in 2011 at 40 years of age because of brain cancer.
Daley's father didn't accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked his son to do was get tickets to London in 2012, he wanted to be in the first row.
"I wasn't able to tell you I wouldn't be here to deal with that first row," said Daley.
"I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and was at that very moment, at the moment of his death, when I realized that it was not really invincible," he added.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"At that moment I knew that was the dream of my life: jumping in front of a crowd in my country participating in the Olympics, there was no better feeling," he said.
The choice of Heather Small's Proud song is not in vain either, because it's the melody that accompanied him during his preparation for the Olympics and still puts his hair on.

A low-grade Mickeyson ended up in Ryder Cup bank this Saturday
U.S. Phil Mickelson will hit a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he needs to improve his technique so that he doesn't turn into an unfortunate event.
Mickelson, who participates in the two-year event for the 12th time, stayed at the bank by decision of Captain Jim Furyk and was unable to participate in the fourballs or the foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being the center of action, as many other times for the United States, the five-time champion spent the day encouraging and working to improve his movements.
Although it was never the most accurate of players, not even at the time of his career, at his 48 years of age he did not fit into the adjusted Le Golf National field, where the high grass usually punishes the wrong shots.
And if this wasn't enough, Mickelson got into the ninth match on Sunday at the exact Francesco Molinari, British Open winner, who joined Tommy Fleetwood to win the four matches this week.
If the U.S., four points below the start of the 12 individual parties, begin with a good footing, the action of Mickelson could be absolutely crucial.
Furyk trusted his husband, even though he couldn't say much more.
"He understood perfectly the role he played today, gave me a palm in his shoulder, passed over my arm and told me that tomorrow he would be ready," said Furyk.
"I fully trusted myself.
It has a prominent place in the Famous Hall and has contributed a lot to the teams last week.
I probably didn't think I'd play two games.
I thought I'd play more, but that's the way things are and that's how we thought they should be.
Like everyone else, he wants to be out there."
On Sunday, Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record in the largest number of games played at Ryder Cup.
You could mark the end of your career at Ryder Cup, a career that never reached the level of your individual palmer.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven-halfs, although Furyk claims his presence also provides untangled support to the team.
"He's a funny, sarcastic person, with a genius and he likes to date people, he's a good guy to have on the team," he explained.
"I like to see how well the younger players have spent it with him this week.
It's much more with a good player."
The Captain of Europe, Thomas Bjorn, fears the disappearance of the advantage
Thomas Bjorn, European Captain, knows from experience that a considerable advantage on the last day of Ryder Cup individuals can easily become an uncomfortable journey.
The Great Danes started in 1997 in a Valderrama game, where a team captained by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but they ended up reaching the finish line with a minimum advantage winning 141⁄2-1311⁄2.
"You keep thinking that we had a great advantage in Valderrama; just like in Brooklyn, where we lost, but in Valderrama we won a little," Bjorn said, in the photo, after seeing the 2018 promotion win 5-3 on Friday and, yesterday, 10-6 at Le Golf National.
History shows that this hasn't finished yet.
Tomorrow we have to go for everybody.
We have to go out and do the right thing.
This will not end until the points are in the bookmark.
Our goal is to win that trophy, and we have to focus on it.
I'm not tired of saying it, I'm focused on our 12 players who are on our side, but I'm also very aware of what's on the other side: the best players in the world."
Enthralled by the performance of their players in a hard golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never sing victory before.
Tomorrow we face another beast.
Tomorrow is the day of individual actions, and there we also have to prove our worth.
It's great to be with a partner next door when things go well, but when you face things individually, then you can prove your ability as a golfer.
That's the message you need to deliver to players, who get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind, and he must also get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk will seek that his players have a better individual performance than their companions, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who added three points.
The Furyk himself was in about two extremes of those rounds of the last day, being part of the winning team in Brooklyn, but ending as a loser in the European miracle in Medina."
"I remember each of the damn words," he answered when asked if he remembered as Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, gathered the players face to face the last day.
"We have 12 important games, but you'd like to have a quick start like that of Brooklyn or Medina.
When you see the impulse going in a direction, there's a lot of pressure on those middle parties.
We prepare our alignment by taking this into account and placing the players as we thought, we want to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas has the task of trying to lead the fight and confront Rory McIlroy in the first match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans, in the upper half of the ranking.
"I decided this order because I think it covers all the way," explained Bjorn about his selection for individuals.
The new warship of Germany postponed once again
The latest German Army vantage point should have been delivered in 2014, to replace the old warships of the Cold War, but it will not reach at least next year due to defective systems and increasingly expensive, local media reported.
The post of the "Reinland-Pfalz", the leading ship of the baden-Wuerttemberg class frogs, was postponed until the first half of 2019, according to a military spokesman to Die Zeit.
The ship should have been incorporated into the Navy in 2014, but subsequent problems after delivery have affected the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg class ships, which the Army commissioned in 2007, will replace the old Bremen class frogs.
It is understood that they will have a powerful cannon, with different anti-era missiles and anti-buke missiles, as well as with hidden technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, it should be possible to spread the newest frogs up to two years out of the source ports.
However, as Die Zeit points out, these continuing delays mean that the warships with the latest technology, and that they will allow Germany to project its power abroad, will be outdated when they enter service.
The unfortunate F125 Fragata was reported last year, when the German Army officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
It was the first time that the Navy returned a ship to a builder after delivery.
Little did I know about the reasons behind this return, but the German media spoke of "critical defects in software and hardware" that made it impossible to use the warship in a combat mission.
Software defects were particularly important, since Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships will be operated by a crew of 120 sailors; that is, half of the necessary personnel in the old Bremen class frogs.
In addition, it was discovered that the ship had a dramatic excess weight, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the Navy to add improvements in the future.
It is thought that the Rhineland-Pfalz of 7,000 tons weigh twice as much as the similar class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the total cost of the project, which includes crew training, is also becoming a problem.
It is said that the amazing amount of EUR 3100 million is already reached, compared to the initial 2200 million.
The problems of the newest frogs are particularly important in the light of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is making water.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, admitted that the Navy is being left without ships capable of disbanding.
The officer claims that this problem is growing, since old ships have been withdrawn, but not replaced by others.
Even so, he complained that none of the baden-Wuerttemberg class frogs could join the Navy.
National Trust is spying on the secret life of the bites
A new research that is being carried out in a highlands farm in Scotland is about to reveal how the bats use the landscape to look for food.
The results are expected to shed light on the behavior of these unique mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
This study, led by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, will follow the Pipistrellaus pygmaeus and Pipistrellaus pipistrellaus, as well as the Myotis daubentonii and Plecotus auritus in the gardens of Inverewe in Western Ross.
Special recording equipment will be placed in key locations around the property to monitor the activities of the bats during the season.
NHS personnel and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys with manual detectors.
An analysis of sound by experts from all recordings will determine the frequency of the calls from the bites and what is being done by each species.
A habitat map will then be developed to create a detailed image of the landscape scale of your behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS Nature Conservation Advisor, expects the results to show that habitat areas are more important to bats and how they use each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of the habitat management work, such as the creation of meadows and what is the best way to keep forests for turtles and other associated species.
The populations of bats in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have decreased considerably in the last century.
These animals are threatened by construction and development works affecting children and loss of habitat.
Aerogenerators and alumina also pose a risk, as well as traps for flies, some chemical treatments of building materials and domestic cat attacks.
The bats aren't blind,
But because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when hunting.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technique to locate insects and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, is taken very seriously by the bites.
It has ten trained experts, who conduct periodic surveys, inspections of children and, on occasion, even rescues.
The organization even has the only and first reserve of Scottish turtles in Thrave Summer in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten species of turtles in Scotland.
David Thompson, State Manager, says this is the ideal territory for them.
"In Thrave we have a great area for bites," he says.
"We have old buildings, historic trees and a wonderful habitat.
But there are many things we still don't know about bites, so the work we do here and other properties will help us better understand what they need to prosper."
It stresses the importance of controlling the presence of bites before performing maintenance tasks in the properties, since it is possible that the unintentional destruction of a single motherhood child could kill up to 400 women and children, which could exterminate a whole local population.
The bites are a protected species and it's illegal to kill, blame or disturb them, as well as destroy their children.
Elizabeth Ferrell, Scottish official of the Bat Conservation Trust organization, encourages people to help:
"There's still a lot to learn about bats and, in the case of many species, we don't know how they're going to their populations."
Ronaldo despises demands for rape and his lawyers are prepared to apply for German publication
Christian Ronald describes the allegations of rape against him as false, claiming that the only thing people want is to get to know themselves using his name.
Your lawyers will ask the German magazine Der Spiegel to publish these accusations.
The president of Portugal and Juventus was accused of violating Kathryn Mayorga, an American woman, at a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is alleged that the footballer paid the woman $375 000 so that he didn't say anything about the incident, Der Spiegel published it on Friday.
Hours after his publication, Ronaldo, 33 years old, picked up this fake news in a live video from his Instagram account, which counts 142 million followers.
"No, no and a thousand times no.
What was said today is false," he told the camera five times the winner of the Gold Ball.
"People want to get to know each other using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by just saying my name, it's part of my job.
I'm a happy and respectable man," the player added smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for charges, which they qualify as "an unacceptable declaration of suspicion in the area of privacy" according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would claim compensation for "moral damage due to an amount corresponding to the severity of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
The alleged incident would have occurred in June 2019, at a suite of the Palm Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After he met at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga would have returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her annually, according to the documents submitted to Clark County District Court.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo, after the alleged incident, bowed down saying he was 99% a knight, but that 1% betrayed him.
The documents ensure that Ronaldo confirms that they both maintained sexual relations agreed upon by both parties.
Mayorga also maintains that she came to the police and that she had photographs of the wounded, but later she entered into an extrajudicial agreement because she felt terrified of the reprisals and was concerned about the public scan.
The 34-year-old woman says she seeks to revoke the agreement while continuing to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged crime, Ronaldo was about to meet with the Royal Madrid since Manchester United, and this summer he incorporated the Italian giant Juve into an agreement of 100 million euros.
Brexit: Car manufacturers would leave the United Kingdom
The United Kingdom would regret forever the loss of its position as the world car manufacturer's leader in Brexit, according to business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it is worrying that Toyota UK would say to the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop the production of its Burnaston plant, near Derby.
"It's necessary to reach an agreement," added Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that if Brexit did not reach any agreement, the impact of the delays at the border could cost jobs.
Burnaston plant, responsible for the production of the Auris and Avensis models in Toyota, produced approximately 150 000 vehicles last year, of which 90 % was exported to the rest of the EU.
"In my opinion, if Britain abandons the EU by the end of March, we will be witnesses to how production stops at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Director General of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers also expressed their fear of leaving the EU without reaching an agreement on the functioning of trade between borders, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW confirmed that he would close his mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
One of the main concerns of car manufacturers is the risk of the sub-minister chain if no agreement is reached in Brexit.
Toyota's production line is very adjusted, every 37 minutes pieces of UK and EU suppliers arrive for cars made of measure.
If on 29 March, the United Kingdom leaves the EU without reaching an agreement, the border could be affected and delays and lack of pieces could be generated.
The company claims that it would be impossible for Toyota to maintain a normal rate more than one day on the Derbyshire plant, so production would have to stop.
Clark says the Theresa May Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "calibrated precisely to avoid such checks at the border."
"It is essential to have an agreement, and we want it to be the best agreement, so that we can enjoy the current success but also make the most of this opportunity," said the BBC Radio 4 today.
"The experience of Toyota and other manufacturers is that it is necessary to continue these excellent sub-ministeral chains."
Toyota could not estimate how long production would be stopped, but warned that in the long run the added costs would reduce plant competition and could even cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, employed by Burnaston for 24 years and union coordinator of Unite, said his members are increasingly concerned: "By experience, I know that once these jobs disappear, they never return.
A government spokesman said they presented a precise and credible plan for the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the EU.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could get upset again.
The White House has said that Donald Trump's high-risk meeting and the Undersecretary of Justice Rosenstein could be delayed a week later because of the fight for the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special lawyer Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the elections, the links between Russia's assistants and Trump, and the possible obstruction of justice by the president.
If Trump fired the attached general prosecutor, as if he didn't, which would put Mueller's independence at risk, he fed the rumors in Washington for months.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein spoke of using a microphone to record talks with Trump and the possibility of deposing the President by Amendment 25.
However, Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he came to the White House, among reports that indicated he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump, who was in New York on Thursday.
Trump said he would rather not have to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed in order to avoid a shock with the hearing of the Senate's judicial committee where Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford testified, one of the women who accused him of improper sexual behavior.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week investigation into the FBI's complaints against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the Senate vote.
Sarah Sanders, Trump's press secretary, appeared in Fox News Sunday.
Before the question about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said, "There is not yet a fixed date, it could be this week or a week later, given all that's going on in the Supreme Court.
We'll see, but you know I like the press being informed."
Some journalists have questioned that statement, since Sanders has been taking since September 10th without celebrating a press conference.
When presenter Chris Wallace asked him why,
Sanders said that the lack of information session was not due to a reversal of the reporters' grandioseness, although he added that it would not be her who denied that attitude.
You also suggested that the direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The President gives more interviews than the previous President," he said, even though he did not quote any source that would record that data.
They will continue to hold briefings, Sanders said, but insisted that "if the press has the opportunity to ask directly to the president of the United States, that is much better than asking questions to her.
You're witnesses of how we've been doing this over the last few weeks, and that'll replace a press conference where you can talk directly to the president of the United States."
Trump usually answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
However, private press conferences are scarce.
Perhaps the president showed the reason this week in New York, with a free appearance and on strange occasions in front of the assembled journalists.
A letter from the Health Secretariat to calm the spirits before Brexit
The Health Secretariat addressed a letter to EU workers in the NHS in Scotland expressing the country's gratitude and expressing its desire to remain in the country under Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter within six months of the United Kingdom leaving the EU.
The Scottish government has committed itself to covering the cost of covered status applications for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on abandonment continued, and it is planned to reach decisions this fall.
However, the UK government, for its part, also intensified its preparations for a possible situation of disagreement.
I know this is a period of concern for everyone.
That is why I want to reiterate how much I value each member's contribution, regardless of his nationality.
The fellow citizens of the European Union and beyond provide an indisputable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here with us."
Christian Abercrombie underwent an emergency surgery after a head injury
Christian Abercrombie, linebacker of Tennessee State Tigers, was subjected to an emergency surgery after suffering a head injury during the defeat of the Saturday (31-27) in front of the Vanderbilt Motors, Mike Organ of Tennessee reported.
Rod Reed, coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the break.
Apparently, he fainted when he got to the tape line.
The trainers and the medical staff gave him oxygen on the band line before taking him on a camel to conduct a later evaluation.
A Tennessee State technician reported to Chris Harris, a WSMV journalist in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was recovering from surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Even so, he added that there are still no details of the type or extent of the injury, and that Tennessee State is trying to discover when that injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year student of red shirt, is in her first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five entries in total on Saturday before leaving the game, which raised to 18 his total of the season.
A stamp tax will be applied to foreign buyers who purchase a property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp tax when they buy a property in the United Kingdom. This extra money will be used to help homeless people due to new conservative plans.
This measure will neutralize the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters
Increased seal tax applies to people who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Treasury expects to raise up to 120 million pounds a year to help homeless people
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp tax when they buy a property in the United Kingdom. Theresa May will announce that this extra money will be used to help homeless people.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters with promises to promote more accessible housing and focus on people with high incomes.
The increase in stamp tax will apply to people and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and the money collected will serve to support the Government's campaign to reduce the number of people sleeping on the street.
The recharge, which is added to the current stamp tax, including the highest levels introduced two years ago for the second dwellings and the purchases for rent, may be up to 3 %.
Farma expects change to reach up to 120 million pounds a year.
About 13% of the new constructions carried out in London are marketed by non-residents in the United Kingdom, which is causing an increase in prices and making it difficult for people who want to buy a house for the first time to have more difficulty accessing the real estate market.
Many rich areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "phasma cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers spending most of their time outside the country.
This new policy was applied just weeks after Boris Johnson was asked to apply a cut in the tax on land transfer to help new people acquire their first home.
He accused the great builders of keeping the prices of the high houses by buying land and not using it, and urged Mrs. May to eliminate the percentages of tax income on the houses of moderate price to settle the "golden housing sector" that lives in Britain.
Mr Corbyn announced an attractive series of reform proposals on housing, including the control of tenants and the prohibition of defamation where the tenant is not guilty.
He also wants to grant the rabbits greater powers when building new dwellings.
Mrs. May said, "Last year I said that I would devote my mandate to restoring the British dream: that life should be better for every new generation.
And for that to happen, it is necessary to set up the disastrous housing market.
Great Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work and start a life here.
It is not fair, however, that it is as simple as it is for people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as for companies based on foreign origin, to buy housing as for British workers.
For too many people, the dream of being the owner of a house is too far away, and the indignity that is supposed not to have a roof continues to be too real."
Jack Ross: "My last ambition is to be able to train Scotland."
Sunderland's manager, Jack Ross, said his "last ambition" is to become Scotland's selector at some point.
This 42-year-old Scotch is enjoying the challenge of revising the northwest club, which currently occupies the third square at League One, three points from the head.
He arrived at the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St. Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last summer.
"When I was a player my dream was to play for my country.
I've played the B game once, and that's all," Ross told the BBC Scotland Sports Sound program.
"I grew up seeing Scotland play in Hampden many times with my father when he was a child, something I always wanted to live again.
But that opportunity will only come if I succeed in running a club."
Among Ross' predecessors in Sunderland's training position are Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic says he didn't feel any concern about these so-consolidated figures in such a big club after rejecting previously proposed Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Does success for me at this time depend on whether I can return this club to the Premier League?
Because the structure and installations of the club are undoubtedly the very own of a Premier League club," he said.
"It won't be a simple task to arrive, but it's probably just that you think I've achieved success here if I can get the club back to the Premier."
Ross has only been a coach for three years after a period of assistance in Dumbarton and a period of 15 months within the technical staff of Hearts.
In that period it helped Alloa recover from the descent to the third division and managed to get St Mirren to stop being about to come down to win the championship title next season.
Ross claims to feel more comfortable now than ever during his career as a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"I probably found myself in a real crucillation," he recalled, about taking over the Alloa.
"I really thought training was perfect for me, even more than playing.
It sounds weird because I didn't feel bad, I made a reasonable living, and I enjoyed some success.
But playing can be hard.
There are a lot of things you have to go through every week.
I continue to suffer from stress and work pressure, but I like training.
I've always liked training and now that I'm doing it, I feel more comfortable than ever in my adult life."
You can listen to the full interview in Sportsound on Sunday 30 September in Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13:00 (British summer time)
According to one survey, the perfect time to take a painting is 5:30 a.m.
The summer heat wave increased consumption in British pubs with more difficulties, but put more pressure on restaurants.
Pubs and bars experienced a 2.7 percent increase during July, but consumption in restaurants decreased by 4.8 percent according to the figures.
Peter Martin, a member of the CGA Commercial Advisory Board, responsible for compiling the figures, said: "The sunny days and the stay of England in the football world for longer than expected caused that in July a pattern similar to that of the month of June, in which the pubs enjoyed an increase of 2.8 percent in consumption, although the restaurants suffered even greater punishment.
The fall of 1.8 percent in the business volume of restaurants during June has worsened during July.
Pubs and drink bars were the best results obtained with higher consumption increases than the reductions experienced by restaurants.
Food-specialized pubs also suffered the sun, although not as dramatic as restaurant operators.
Looks like people just want to go out for a drink.
In controlled pubs and bars, drinking increased by 6.6 per cent during the month, and food consumption decreased by three per cent."
Paul Newman, employed by RSM for analysis of leisure and hospitality activities, said: "These results suggest a continuation of the trend that has been taking place since the end of April.
The time and impact of major social and sports events continue to be the main factors in relation to outside home consumption.
It is no surprise that groups of restaurants continue to suffer, however, a fall of 4.8 per cent per annum will be particularly painful if you add to this the constant increase in costs.
The warm and long summer could not have arrived at a worse time for the restoration business and the time will tell you whether the moderation of the temperatures experienced during August will provide the necessary breathing for the sector."
The total growth of sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent during July, reflecting the acceleration in brand launches.
The Coffer Peach Tracker Industry sales indicator for pubs, bars and restaurants in the United Kingdom collects and analyzes data on the performance of 47 operational groups with a total profit of over 9,000 million pounds and is considered the sector reference point.
One out of every five children have accounts of secret social networks that hide their parents
One out of every five children (some of them only 11 years old) have secret social networks accounts that hide their parents and teachers according to a survey.
A survey conducted by 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in the number of "Insta fake" pages
This news has led to an increase in the fear that sexual content will be published
Twenty percent of students claimed to have a "principal" account to show their parents
One in five children (some of them just 11 years old) are creating accounts on social networks that keep adults in secret.
A survey conducted by 20,000 secondary students revealed an increase in the number of "False Insta" accounts (with reference to the Instagram Social Exchange Network).
This news caused an increase in the fear that sexual content is published.
Twenty percent of the students said they used a sweaty "principal" account to show their parents while they had other private ones.
A mother who met with her 13-year-old daughter's secret account found a teenager who asked her to "violate."
The research, carried out by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters" and Headmistresses" Conference (HMC) of Independent Schools, found that 40 percent of boys and girls between 11 and 18 years of age had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
HMC's head Mike Buchanan said: "It's alarming that there are so many teenagers who try to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Elid Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" on the council of the Scottish Federation of Athletics
Eilid Doyle was elected to the council of the Scottish Federation of Athletics as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the board of directors.
Doyle is the most successful Scottish athlete and President Ian Beattie has defined this decision as an excellent opportunity for those who run sports to benefit from their wide international experience over the past decade.
"Eilid enjoys a huge respect within the Scottish community, the UK and the world level, and we are sure that Scottish athleticism will benefit greatly from its integration into the council," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I have a lot of desire to be a spokesperson for athletes and I hope I can contribute and help direct sports in Scotland."
The American, who won 200 meters and 400 meters in the 1996 Atlanta Games between a total of four Olympic gold and currently working as a usual commentator for the BBC, suffered a transitional ischemic attack that prevented him from walking.
He wrote on Twitter: "One month ago I suffered from an apoplexy.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time could determine if I could recover and until I graduated.
It was exhausting work, but I was able to recover completely, I learned to walk again, and I'm currently doing austerity exercises.
Thank you for your encouraging messages"
An announcement of a mother milk extractor in which women with cows are divided into public opinion on the networks
A breast milk extractor company divided public opinion into networks with an ad that compares infants to cows with those who are dying.
To announce the launch of the proclaimed "first secret portable breast milk extractor of the world", Elvie published an ironic announcement in the style of a musical video to demonstrate the freedom offered by the new mother milk extractor.
Four real mothers dance in a hearth full of rage for cows at the rhythm of a song with letters like the following: "Yes, I moved myself, but I don't have a tail" and "Because if you haven't noticed, they're not deaf, they're my breasts."
The choir continues: "Museum, fly, I'm feeding babies, fly, fly, I'm mowing my friends."
However, the announcement, which was published on the company's Facebook page, caused controversy on the networks.
With 77,000 reproductions and hundreds of comments, the video produced different reactions among viewers. Many of them claimed that it showed the "horrors" of the dairy sector.
"Using cows to advertise this product was a very mediocre decision.
Like us, they need to be pregnant and give the light in order to produce milk, but in their case we stole their children days after giving the light," wrote one.
The Elvie milk extractor can be discreetly placed inside a mother’s milk substitute (Elvie/nai)
Another viewer commented: "Clearly traumatic for the mother and the baby.
But yes, why aren't they used to announce a milk extractor for babies who stay with their babies?"
Another viewer added the following: "What ad with so little touch."
Other spectators defended the ad, even a woman said the song seemed "very funny".
"I think it's a great idea.
If I was still breast-feeding, I'd buy one.
Taking out my milk made me feel just like a cow.
The ad's a little fired, but I interpreted it as a joke.
I think it's a great product," wrote one.
Another commented: "This is a fun announcement addressed to mothers who extract their milk (often in their places of work or in bathrooms) and feel like "voices".
This is not an announcement to praise or judge the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, this group of women revealed that they were dancing with discreet extractors inserted into their subjects.
The concept behind the campaign is that many women who extract their milk claim to feel like cows.
However, Elvie's milk extractor is completely silent, he has no cables or tubes and he can discreetly fit into a mother's suspense, which gives women freedom to move, subject their babies and even go out there while they're taking out their milk.
Ana Balarin, Mother's executive creative partner and director, commented: "Elvie extractor is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By describing the parallelism that exists between women and milk cows, we wanted to focus on the extraction of milk and all the challenges that involve it, while we demonstrated in a manner that was maintained and close to the incredible feeling of freedom that the new extractor will offer.
It's not the first time Elvie has taken over the headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two creatures showed up at the gateway to designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children quietly moved to a camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained increased despite the fact that the monthly number of border crossings remained relatively unchanged, partly because of the strict rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration made it difficult to assign fathers to children.
Traditionally, most of the fathers were also paperless immigrants and were afraid of endangering their ability to stay in the country by taking a step forward to claim a child.
This risk increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that potential parents and other adult members of their homes would have to send their fingerprints and that these data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior officer of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Control Service, testified before Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who asked to arrest minors without company.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no criminal record.
"About 80% of the people who are fathers or who are part of their home are found illegally in the country, and most of them are foreigners who have committed crimes.
That is why we will continue to pursue these individuals," said Mr Albence.
In order to process the children more quickly, the officials introduced new rules that would require any of them to appear in the trial before a month passed from their detention instead of 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to the refugee workers.
Many will appear through videoconference instead of in person to try to legalize their case before an immigration judge.
Those who fail to meet the requirements for assistance will be quickly deported.
The longer they stay in custody, the more likely they will be to become anxious or depressed, which may lead to violent kidnappings or attempts to flee according to the refugee workers and reports of the system published over the past few months.
Lawyers have said that these fears increase in centers of larger dimensions such as Tornillo, in which there is more possibility that the symptoms of a child going wrong pass unnoticed due to its size.
They also added that moving the children to the camp area without giving them enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to friends could cause a trauma that many continue to suffer.
Syria requests the United States, France and Turkey occupying forces to withdraw immediately
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulem, addressing the UN General Assembly, also asked Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country is currently in its eighth year.
Mouelem, who also held the post of Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces were found in Syria alone illegally, with the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that they would "occupy them in an appropriate manner".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the assembly.
Moalem insisted that the "war on terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions of them have had to flee their homes.
He also said that Damascus would continue to "fight this holy battle until we clear all Syrian territories" of terrorist groups and "from all illegal foreign presence".
The United States has approximately 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly to train and advise the Kurdish forces and the Arab Syrians who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in this country devastated by the war.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem stated that the conditions appropriate for their return were given and he blamed "some Western countries" for the "dissemination of irrational fears" that caused refugees not to return.
"We use the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They are politicizing what should be a simple humanitarian matter."
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not offer help in rebuilding Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition has been reached to end the war.
UN diplomats claim that the recent agreement reached between Russia and Turkey to establish a neutral zone in the last major rebel base of Idlib allowed the political talks to continue.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a large-scale attack by Syrian troops supported by Russia in the province, in which three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clear limit dates" and expressed his hope that the military actions would be destined for the jihadists, including the Al-Nusra front soldiers linked to Al-Qaeda, who would "be rooted".
The UN envoy Staffan de Mixture hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to draw up a draft post-war constitution for Syria and to facilitate the holding of elections.
Moualem outlined the conditions to ensure the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, stating that the work of the body should be restricted to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and alerted against possible interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
Following that logic, Mr. Trump would be able to re-election in 2020 unless, as many liberals will be waiting, impeachment and scandals put an end to their early presidency.
Which would no doubt be "the most dramatic end of a presidency"
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue among the observers.
Since 2014, hearing indices in prime time have multiplied by more than two, to reach 1.05 million viewers in CNN and almost tripled to reach 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million premium-time viewers, an increase of 1.7 million over four years ago according to Nielsen, and the MSNBC Rachel Maddow Show's program led the cable channel audience indexes with 3.5 million viewers during the nights when important news occurred.
"It's like a fire that attracts people because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, a drama showrunner for ABC "Designed Survivor", who is a secretary of the ministerial cabinet who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Inll Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club," has another theory.
Remember a taxi trip in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver said he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? He asked you.
"He said, "Because he makes me laugh," Mrs. Scovell said.
There's entertainment inside the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else that appears on television, the plots that appear in Washington can determine the future of the Roe v. Wade case, if immigrant families can get together again and the state of the world economy.
Disconnecting from reality is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
Still, it assumes something that goes beyond being an informed citizen spending six hours seeing a panel of experts discussing the use by Bob Woodward of "anonymous" sources for his book "Fare", Paul Manafort's 15 000-dollar avalanche jacket ("a full of arrogance," said Washington Pos) and the implications of the sleek descriptions of Stormy Daniels on Mr. Trump's anatomy.
I won't look at Super Mario the same way.
"Part of what makes it seem like a reality show is that you're giving something new every night," commented Brent Montgomery, senior executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", a space that deals with the changes in characters and daily argumental turns of Trump's show (the conflict with N.F.L., the praise to Kim Jong-un...).
You can't afford to lose an episode or you'll stay behind.
When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, he made the sun and a temperature of 26 degrees outside the house on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was locked in the house watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He was unable to get out while Brett Kavanaugh was about to face the Senate Judicial Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging from a thread.
"I remember when we were doing all these crazy programs at that time and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss said.
"I thought it was a kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

Foreign money comes to many to finance the candidacy of the House for the elections of half the lexiculatory
It is not surprising that the 17th Congressional District of Pennsylvania is receiving a large flow of money due to the reorganization of a congressional district with two representatives in positions in the career to occupy the same position.
This district located outside Pittsburgh that has recently been reorganized is represented by Democratic candidate Conor Lamb, who achieved his position in another district in a special election held last spring.
Lamb is represented against another representative in functions, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is largely superior to the 17th district.
The maps were reorganized after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that Republicans manipulated the electoral districts in favor of them.
The election career in the new 17th Congressional District held a campaign funding festival between the parties' main financial arms, the Democratic Campaign Committee of Congress (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after winning an adjusted victory in the March special elections for the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania, which enjoyed a wide follow-up.
That post was occupied by a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won in the district for 20 points.
Political experts give the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States assessed the possibility of penalizing El Salvador for its support for China and then pushed back.
Diplomatics warned that the Dominican Republic and Panama would already recognize Beijing, with little response from Washington.
Mr. Trump held a pleasant meeting with the president of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, in June 2017, and even held a hotel in Panama until his partners threw in the Trump Organization steering team.
Officials of the Department of State decided to order to return to the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama "for recent decisions not to recognise Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the spokesman of the department in a statement made this same month.
However, only the possibility to apply sanctions against El Salvador, which received approximately US$ 140 million during 2017, including to control drug trafficking, development and economic aid, was disputed.
The proposed sanctions, including cuts in financial aid and visa restrictions, would be very negative for the Central American country and its high unemployment and homicide rates.
As the internal meetings progressed, US and Central American officials postponed the holding of a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to hold a similar meeting last year, which was considered a step forward in efforts to prevent the emigration of people to the United States.
But in mid-September, important administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to move forward, effectively putting an end to any possibility of applying sanctions for El Salvador.
It is scheduled that Vice-President Mike Pence will lead the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, in a symptom of the importance given to him by the administration, the diplomats said.
The three US envoys discreetly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new message or harsh punishment from Washington.
A spokesperson for the White House of Mr Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate, which were described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to talk about internal deliberations at all times and when the anonymity of the participants was maintained.
His accounts were corroborated by an external analyst near the administration and he also agreed to speak whenever his anonymity was preserved.
Study history
The next negative case could be the report by Special Adviser Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of Mr. Trump's justice, which is currently abundant evidence in the public file.
As you can see, Mr. Mueller is also leading his investigation to find out if Mr. Trump's campaign has conspired with Russia in his attack on our elections.
If Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will have to report to that agency just when it has to be prepared for the elections, and you may finally have to face a popular jury.
There are many unknowns and I do not want to suggest that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable, as is the case with his European counterparts.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the battle.
In 1938, German officials were determined to give a coup d'état against Hitler if the Western front resisted and supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We have failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of subsequent killings.
The course of history revolves around these points of inflection, and the inexorable progress of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
The U.S. is facing several of these inflection points right now.
What will we do if Mr. Trump fires the Deputy Attorney General of the State, Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein took the water to his neck since this paper reported that last year he suggested to record secretly to the president and speculated that he was incapacitated for office.
Mr. Rosenstein said the information of The Times is not true.
"How will we respond if the investigation that has just been requested by the F.B.I. on Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or is not impartial or if its appointment to the Supreme Court is confirmed in spite of the alleged allegations of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the semi-legislative elections for a Congress that demands responsibility for Mr. Trump?
If we do not overcome these tests, democracy will be subjected to a long winter.
But I don't think we'll fail, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that also occupied my house, which I knew from the embassy.
He survived, emigrated to the United States, and, 60 years later, sent me to capture Shabat candles on that table that included an esbastic.
With that legacy, how am I not going to be optimistic about the future?"
Norman Eisen, an experienced partner of the Brookings Institution, is the president of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and the author of "The Last Palace: Europe's Turbulent Century in Five Lives and One Legendary House."
The Rangers Graham Dorans player is optimistic about the quick Vienna meeting.
Rangers receives Rapid Vienna on Thursday knowing that a victory against the Austrians, after the impressive empathe achieved in Spain in front of the Villareal this same month, would put them in a very favorable position to be classified in the Group G of Europe League.
A knee injury prevented Central Campist Graham Dorrans from starting this season until the 2-2 empathate in front of the Villareal, but he believes Rangers can use that result as a trampoline to get more important things.
"It was a good point for us, since Villareal is a good team," said the 31-year-old player.
"We entered the party believing that we could get something positive and get a point.
We had the chance to win at the end, but, in general, the empathy is probably a fair result.
They were probably better during the first half, but in the second we were superior.
Next Thursday will be another great European night.
We hope we can reach the three points, but it will be difficult, because they have achieved a good result in their last match, but with the support of our audience, I am sure we can fight to achieve a positive result.
Last year was hard between everything that happened to my injuries and the changes made to the team, but there is an excellent environment right now.
The team is good, the boys are having a good time and the training is good.
We hope to be able to fight, forget the past season and succeed."
Women are concerned about their savings for their retirement
Despite the fact that the survey participants were clear about how they wanted to be cared for, few people spoke to their family about the matter.
About half of the participants in this study conducted by Nationwide claimed that they commented with their partners on the cost of prolonged care.
Only 10% said they talked to their children about it.
"People want you to take care of a family, but they're not taking the necessary steps to have that conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationalwide Life Insurance Department.
You can start with the next one.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can't prepare your family so they can take care of you if you don't communicate your wishes in advance.
He cooperates with your advisor and your family to wake up where and how to take care of them, as these decisions can be a determining factor in determining the cost.
Call your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for that.
Among the funding options for long-term care are a traditional long-term insurance policy, a life insurance policy that is hybrid in cash to help cover these expenses or self-security covered with your own funds, whenever you have the money.
Negotiate your legal documents: Avoid legal battles.
Get a health care representative to appoint a trusted person to supervise your medical care and make sure that professionals meet your wishes if you are not able to communicate.
It's also worth signing a notary power to manage your finances.
You'll have to choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and make sure your bills are paid if you're incapacitated.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine that your parent has a medical emergency and goes on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about your medicines and allergies?
Please note that this information is detailed in a written plan to be prepared.
"Not only is the financial issue at stake, but who are the doctors that care for it?" asked Martin.

A man receives several shots with an air rifle compressed in Ilfracombe
A man received multiple shots with a compressed air rifle as he walked back home after going out at night.
The victim, about 40 years old, was found in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, in Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
The agents described the shooting, which occurred approximately at 02:30 (British summer time) as a "random act".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
Your injuries are not serious, and the police are looking for possible witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
A powerful earthquake and tsunami that affected the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to official sources, caused the death of at least 384 people, a figure that is expected to continue to increase.
Because of the cut-off of communications, rescue bodies were unable to obtain any information from the Dongala Regency, a zone located north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake of 7.5 degrees magnitude.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Then we provided them with some key data about Palu and Dongala on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Célebes, which is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Célebes, with an estimated population of 379,800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donghala is a regent located more than 300 km north-west coast of the island of Celebes.
This region, a region less than one province, had an estimated population of 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main pillars of the economy of the Central Célebes province, especially in the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but they are concentrated mainly in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Célebes.
Palu and Dongala have been affected by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years according to the Indonesia Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongala.
A tsunami also affected the west side of Dongala in 1996, causing the death of nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Fire Cinth of high seismic activity, so it suffers earthquakes regularly.
These are some of the main earthquakes and tsunamis that have suffered in recent years:
2004: An important earthquake on the west coast of the province of Aceh in Indonesia, in the north of Sumatra, which occurred on 26 December, caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries, causing the death of 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes affected the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of 6.8 degrees magnitude struck south of Xava, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that devastated the southern coast, causing the death of almost 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of 7.6 degrees of magnitude near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake of 7.5 degrees magnitude affected the islands of Mentawai, located in front of Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of people and caused the death of approximately 300 people.
2016: A mild earthquake affected Pide Jaya's regency, located in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, as people remembered the devastation caused by the earthquake and tsunamis of 2004.
There was no tsunami on this occasion, but more than 100 people died as a result of the fall of buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes occurred on the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, which caused the death of more than 500 people, most of them in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists shot temporarily.
They arrest Sarah Palin's older son for domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice-President Sarah Palin, was arrested for aggression.
Palin, 29-year-old, natural from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested suspect of a domestic violence offence, preventing the submission of a complaint for domestic violence and for resistance to authority, according to a note published by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report alleged crimes, he took the phone off.
Palin remains in pretrial custody in Mat-Su Pretral Facility units with a bail of $500, according to KTUU.
He was brought before the judge on Saturday, in which he declared himself "not guilty, since then" when asked, he informed the chain.
Palin faces three minor crimes of type A, which means he could go to jail for up to a year and receive a fine of $250,000.
He was also charged with a minor B crime, punishable by a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges against Palin are presented.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska War Veterans Tribunal.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic aggression, preventing the submission of a complaint for domestic violence and possession of arms in a Hebrew state in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend's gonna accuse him of putting a fist on his face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of veterans in 2016 after linking her son's violent behavior with post-traumatic stress disorder that suffered after serving with the army in Iraq.
An earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia causes hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after the earthquake that affected the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The 7.5-degree earthquake caused a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are not available, and it is expected that the balance of the dead increases with the passing of the days.
The earthquake was just ahead of Central Célebes, northeast of Indonesia's capital, Iacarta.
There are videos around the social networks where the moment of impact is displayed.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a festival on the beach of the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are trying to apply a few times the death penalty to the suspect of a terrorist attack in New York City.
The federal prosecutors in New York are trying to apply the death penalty to Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York that caused the death of eight people, a penalty that has not applied in the state since 1953.
Saipov, a 30-year-old, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bicycle car at the West Side Highway Avenue in Lower Manhattan, following the lives of the pawns and cyclists he found on his way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to demonstrate that Saipov "intendedly" killed the eight victims and caused serious injuries "intendedly", according to the notification of the intention to apply for a death penalty presented in the South District of New York.
Both crimes involve the possibility of applying the death penalty according to the judge's document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury presented Saipov with a charge of 22 crimes, including eight crimes of murder in collaboration with an organized crime group, practice commonly used by the prosecutors in organized crime cases, and a crime of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required a "notable planning and premeditation", they declared the prosecutors to describe the way Saipov carried out the "atrocious, cruel and defamatory" attack.
"Sayful Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco" as indicated in the notice of intent.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
A decade ago the South District of New York didn't process a death penalty case.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug traffickers, but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was applied in a federal case in New York was in 1953, in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a marriage that was executed after being convicted of conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, who was born in Uzbekistan, showed a lack of repentance during the days and months following the attack according to court documents.
He told the investigators that he felt good about what he had done, as the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that in order to carry out the attack, he was inspired by the videos of the ISIS that he showed on his phone according to the charge.
He also asked to see the ISIS flag in his hospital room, the police said.
He has declared himself innocent of 22 crimes.
David Patton, one of the federal lawyers responsible for representing Saipov, indicated that they were "evidently disappointed" with the indictment's decision.
"We believe that the decision to ask for the death penalty instead of accepting a declaration of guilt with perpetual chain without possibility of revocation will only prolong the trauma caused by these events for all the people involved," Patton commented.
Saipov's defense team would ask the prosecutors beforehand not to apply for the death penalty.
A Tory parliamentary states that NIGEL FARAGE should be put in front of Brexit's negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize an army of people" today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former leader of the UK Independence Party said that politicians had to "taste the pressure" of the Eurosceptics (when one of Theresa May's own parliamentarians suggested that he should handle negotiations with the EU.
The ordinary Member Peter Bone said in front of Birmingham's demonstration that the United Kingdom would "have already left" the EU if Mr Farage were Brexit's secretary.
But the challenge facing Mrs May of reconciling the divided ranks of her party was evidence of joining the Tories in favour of remaining in the EU to an independent protest against Brexit held in the city.
The prime minister is fighting to maintain the commitments of his Chequers plan between the attacks of Brexit, the opposite and the EU's supporters.
His allies insisted that he continue to fight to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the negative response, to force Eurosceptics and workers to choose between their plan and chaos.
Mr. Bone said in the concentration of the Left Means Leave of Solihull movement that he wanted to end the Chequers plan.
I suggested that Mr Farage should have been told to take responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If it had been given charge, we would already be outside the EU at this time," he said.
The member of the Wellingborough Parliament added: 'I will continue to defend Brexit, but we must abort the Chequers plan'.
Showing its opposition to the EU, he said: "We do not fight world wars to serve.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Mr Bone has rejected the suggestions that indicated that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their mind and wants to stay in the EU is completely false".
The member of the stories and the Brexit Brexit Andrea Jenkyns' party also turned to the march, since he told reporters: "The only thing I say is: prime minister, listen to the people.
"The Chequers plan does not enjoy popularity between public opinion, the opposition will not vote in favour of it, is unpopular between our party and our activists who, to begin with, are those who occupy the streets and allow us to be elected.
Cancel the Chequers plan and start listening."
In a message addressed to Mrs. May, he added: "The prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr Farage said at the concentration that it is necessary to make politicians feel uncomfortable if they intend to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"At present this is a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit's decision and here we're meeting today to tell them we won't let them go out with you."
In a message addressed to an enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make our political class, who is about to betray Brexit's decision, feel uncomfortable.
"We are mobilizing the army of people in this country who gave us the victory in Brexit and will not rest until we become a proud, independent and autonomous United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the EU's remaining supporters made a move through Birmingham before celebrating a two-hour concentration in the city centre.
Several activists waved cards with the Tories Against Brexit (Tories Against Brexit) message after the group's launch this weekend.
Laborator Lord Adonis was baffled by the conservatives for the security problems they suffered in a party application at the beginning of the conference.
"This is the people who tell us that they can have the IT systems in order and all the best technology for Canada, to have a free border, to enjoy free market without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's an absolute farce.
Brexit's concept does not exist," he added.
Warren plans to think seriously or present himself to the presidency
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said he would seriously think about his candidacy to the presidency after the November elections.
Boston Globe reports that the Democrats of Massachusetts spoke about their future on Saturday during a municipal meeting in a town in the west of Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will present the reelection in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of the Trump campaign in 2016 in Massachusetts.
It focuses on the speculations that set it up as Trump's successor in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was its 36th meeting with its electors using the council format since Trump took over the presidency.
An assistant asked him if he was planning to introduce the president.
Warren replied that it is the time that "we women go to Washington to solve the problems of our government, and for that we need a woman in the presidency."
A death-related Sims shooting was performed, the LSU player
Baton Rouge police, The Angels, announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested by the murder of Wayde Sims, the LSU's basketball player on Friday.
Baton Rouge's police department announced 20-year-old Dieteon Simpson's arrest in a press conference held at 11:00 (ear east).
They posted a video of the shooting on Friday asking for help to identify a man who went out on the images.
Yes, 20 years old, he was shot near the Southern University campus in the first hour of Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a bullet wound in his head and finally died as a result of this," said police chief Murphy J. Paul to the media on Saturday through 247 sports.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to the scene with a gun and admitted to shoot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incidents and put under custody in the police department of East Baton Rouge Parish.
Yes, a two-metre teenager who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games with 10 titrations last season and had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Great Russian award: Lewis Hamilton comes to the world title thanks to the team orders, which enabled him to win over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the time that Valtteri Bottas ranked in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes' team orders would be decisive in the career.
Bottas, who was leaving the pole, had a good exit and almost left Hamilton alone as he defended his position during the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel entered boxes first and let Hamilton run with traffic in the back of the group, something that would prove decisive.
Mercedes stopped in boxes one time later and went out behind Vettel, but Hamilton followed him after several round maneuvers that caused Ferrari's driver to leave free of ill gain inside the risk of being delayed after a double defensive maneuver on the third curve.
Max Verstappen left from the last row of the exit grid and rose to the seventh square at the end of the first round on the day of his 21st birthday.
Then he led the career during a large part of this thanks to which he kept his tires in order to make it faster in the final part and advance Kimi Raikkonen to the fourth position.
He finally went into boxes around 44 but couldn't take any position in the last eight rounds, which ended with Raikkonen in the fourth square.
It was a difficult day, because Valteri did a great job all weekend and he was a real knight.
The team did an extraordinary job to get the first two squares," Hamilton said.
An improper body language
President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Diane Feinstein in an act celebrated on Saturday by his insistence that he did not filter Christine Blasey Ford's letter in which he accused Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, of sexual abuse.
In a speech given in an act in West Virginia, the President did not speak directly of the witness given by Ford in front of the Senate Judicial Committee and commented instead that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were "miseries, repugnants and liars".
"The only thing that could happen and the most beautiful that's happening in the Senate in the last few days, when you see indignation, when you see that people who are angry and who are miserable, disgusting and lying," he said.
"When you see these publications and filtrations and they say, 'Oh, I didn't.
I didn't go."
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you do any filtration?
Remember your answer... did you filter the document? "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't.
Wait a minute.
We filter it?...No.", he added imitating the senator.
Feinstein sent him the letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh made by Ford in July and filtered in early September, but Feinstein denied that the filtration came from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't filter his story," Feinstein said to the committee as reported in The Hill newspaper.
"I asked you to keep your privacy and do what you asked me to do."
But his denial did not seem to sit well with the president, who commented the following during the act of Saturday night: "I told you that body language was not the right one.
He may not be filtered, but he used the worst body language I've ever seen in my life."
Continuing with his defense of the candidate for the Supreme Court, who was accused of misconduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using charges for their own purposes.
‘They are determined to regain power by any means necessary.
They are evil and repugnant, they don't care who they hurt, they have to try to regain power and control," said the President of the Second Mediate.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars repaired the defeat suffered on Friday at the Elite League against the Belfast Giants winning the match back for 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants gained an early advantage through two goals Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie empathized to the local set before Dwyer restored the giants' advantage.
Francois Bouchard pushed for Dundee before two goals of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen allowed them to win.
It was the third defeat in the Elite League of the season for the men of Adam Keefe, who managed to get back to win Dundee for 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with a balance of the three victories before the Giants.
Dwyer's initial goal was 3:35 thanks to Kendall McFull's assistance, and the second came four minutes later by Beauvillier after David Rutherford's assistance.
In a period of agitation, Sullivan put the local team back at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt attended Cownie to mark the goal of the match at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants got ahead in the marker before the first break when he scored his second goal at night at the end of the first period.
The local team has regrouped and Bouchard repatriated the game with a goal through power play at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen advance to Dundee for the first time at the party at the end of the second period and secured victory through the fifth goal of their team in the middle of the last period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five matches, will play at Milton Keynes' next match, which will be held on Friday.
An air traffic controller dies to make sure hundreds of passengers on a plane can escape an earthquake
A Indonesian air controller considered a hero after he died to make sure that a plane loaded with hundreds of passengers could safely disembark.
The balance of dead people is 800 and there are many missing after a great earthquake shook the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong replicas continue to feel in the area and are many people trapped under the waterfalls of the city of Palu.
Although his workmates fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonio Gunawan Aggin refused to leave his post at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport control tower of Palu, which was violently balanced.
He stayed in his seat to make sure that the flight 6321 of Batik Air, which was on the exit track at that time, could safely disembark.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought he was going to crash.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesperson Yohannes Sirat said it is possible that this decision would save hundreds of lives, reported Australia's ABC News channel.
We prepared a Balikpapan helicopter in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
"It breaks our heart when we understand it," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the death penalty may be thousands and the country's disaster management agency has said that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The victim's balance is believed to continue to increase because there are many bodies under the helmets and many of them could not be reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesman of the agency.
Waves up to six meters have devastated Palu, where a massive burial will be held on Sunday or Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are transporting aid and live.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said to Sky News: "At every minute an ambulance is bringing bodies.
Drinking water is scarce.
People are picking up the minimers."
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Red Cross is fighting to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could become much worse."
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo came to Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the evacuation-related tasks.
Are you ready?" he told CNN.
Indonesia suffered earlier this year earthquakes in Lombok in which more than 550 people died.
A plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now claims that there is a missing after a plane crash in a lake
The aircraft that operates a flight that starved itself in a Pacific lake in Micronesia now claims that there is a missing one after previously claiming that the 47 passengers and crew will leave without incident the plane that was sinking.
Air Niugini said in a statement that from Saturday afternoon they were unable to locate a passenger.
The airline reported that it was working together with the authorities, hospitals and local researchers to try to locate this man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more detailed information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Zone ships helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crash against the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
The authorities claimed on Friday that seven people had to be taken to a hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers continued in the hospital on Saturday and that they were all stable.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events continue to be unclear.
Both the plane and the U.S. Army confirmed that the plane landed at the lake before arriving on the landing track.
Some witnesses say the plane passed the landing track.
Bill Jaynes, a passenger of American nationality, commented that he came in very little time.
"That's something extremely positive," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that both he and other passengers managed to move between the water that reached their waist down to the emergency exits of the plane that was sinking.
He also remembered that the flight attendants were shouting and frightened, and that he suffered a slight wound in his head.
The U.S. Army reported that some sailors who were working close to the site on the improvement of a pier also helped in the rescue by using an inflatable boat to transport people to the coast before the plane sank about 30 metres.
According to Aviation Safety Network data, 111 people died in aircraft accidents registered in Papua New Guinea in the last two decades, but none affected Air Niugini.
An analyst composed the chronology of the night in which a woman was burned alive
The prosecution sent for evidence on Saturday to repeat the trial of a man accused of burning alive a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
During the trial he described to the jury how he used the records of a mobile phone to compensate for the movements of the 29-year-old accused, Quinton Tellis, and the victim of 19, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Rowlett stated that he received data from the location of several mobile phones that showed that Telllis was meeting with Chambers the night of his death, contradicting his previous statements as reported by The Clarion Ledger.
When these data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford went down the road on Saturday and testified that that day was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lieving, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis said he knew Chambers about two weeks ago when he died.
Mobile phone records indicated that they only met for a week.
Rowlett stated that a while after Chambers died, Telllis deleted the messages, calls and contact information from Chambers on his phone.
"She was taken from her life," Hale said.
It is scheduled that the defence will begin its final claims on Sunday.
The judge showed that he expected the judge to be seen to be tried by the jury that same day.
The High Breed: What is the conscious hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative perception that the genre has by filling its music with positive messages.
The High Breed, a Bristol group, claims that the hip hop has distanced itself from its sources with political messages and combating social problems.
They want to go back to their roots and get the fighting hip back to be popular.
Artists such as The Refugees and Common have recently experienced a rebellion in the United Kingdom through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black?
A New York Child Caretaker asks for a couple after a "racist" message
A New Yorker child nurse is going to claim a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a message that was not addressed to her from the mother in which she complained that she was "other black."
The couple refuses to be racist and compares the demand with an "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Faxman, a mother of two children, showed her anguish by discovering that the guardian of children Giselle Maurice was black when she presented her first day of work in 2016.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON, OTHER NEGRA," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a message.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her to Mrs. Maurice twice.
After realizing his mistake, a "uncomfortable" Plasco-Faxman fired Mrs. Maurice, claiming that the guardian who had just left, who was African-American, had done his job wrong and who was expecting a Filipino according to the New York Post announcement.
Mrs. Maurice paid the day off and sent her home to a Uber.
Now Maurice is going to ask the couple to get compensation for the dismissal and she needs a $350 compensation per day for the six months of internal work for which she was initially hired even though there was no contract through.
"Look, I want to show you that these things aren't done," he told the Post on Friday, to add "It's a case of discrimination."
The couple responded to the charges of racism by claiming that dismissing Maurice was the most reasonable, since they were afraid they could not trust her after she was offended.
"My wife would send you a message that I didn't intend to send.
He's not a racist.
We're not racist," said Joel Plasco's husband to the Post.
"But would they leave their children in the hands of a person to whom they had offended, even though it was due to a mistake?
Your baby just born?
Come on!"
After comparing the demand with an "extortion," Plasco stated that his wife had just had a baby two months ago and that she was in a "very difficult situation."
"Will they go for such a person?
That's not very ethical," the investment banker added.
While the legal process continues, the public opinion court quickly denounced the couple on social networks, attacking them by their behavior and the logic applied.
Paddington's editors feared that readers would not be identified with a talking bear as they could end up in a new card
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, commented on the letter: "It is difficult to put on the skin of a person who read it for the first time before it is published.
It's very fun to know now what we know about the enormous success of Paddington."
After claiming that his father, who worked as a camera for the BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book on a small toy bear, would be optimistic in view of the possibility that his work would be rejected, he added that the 60th anniversary of publication of books was "agridoze" after his death last year.
From Paddington, to whom he describes as a "very important member of our family," he added that his father was discreetly proud of the success he finally achieved.
"He was a quiet man and nothing suspicious," he said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if you had a son who gets something: you're proud even though you didn't really do it.
I think he felt Paddington's success a little that way.
Although it was a creation of his own and a product of his imagination, he always gave all the credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and she had to fire me over the phone
After the landing, his daughter was quickly taken to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 of Nice, where doctors worked unsuccessfully to save his life.
"Nod would regularly call to say that it was very bad, that he was not expected to survive.
"Then I received Nad's call to tell me I was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, my love.
I'll meet you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications the doctors gave him so that his heart would continue to slow down were slowly consuming and leaving his body.
I'd died a while before and now I was turning off.
I just had to sit down and wait, knowing it was happening.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I had to endure."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperous, at that moment of battle for the loss of her daughter, entered the plane with the other passengers, without noticing the calvary she was suffering.
"No one's detected it," he said.
"I had my head down and I fell pale at all times.
It was hard to explain, but it was during the flight when I felt this impressive feeling of solidarity for Nad.
That I needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much I loved her."
Posts of distressed women to avoid suicide on a bridge
Two women who lost loved ones because of suicide are working to prevent others from doing the same.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys take cards on a galley bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers they can call to ask for help.
Tyler, Mrs. Davis' son, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression, and he committed suicide at 18.
"I don't want no father to feel like I have to feel every day," he said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, commented that her son was a promising cook with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that his smile was going up any room."
However, he left work before he died and was "a very deep depression."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, found his brother after he committed suicide.
Mrs Davis said, "I have the constant concern that there will be a side effect."
Mrs. Davis created the cards "to inform people that there are people you can come to and talk to, even if you're a friend.
Don't be silent, you need to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been Mrs. Davies' friend for years, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after her mother's death.
"You didn't comment on me being sad or depressed or anything like that," he commented.
"A couple of days before Christmas, we detected a change in his attitude.
Christmas day came to the bottom (when the children opened their mouthpieces, made no visual contact with them or anything)".
He said his death was a huge trauma to them, but they must overcome it: "The family was destroyed.
They've set us up.
But we have to keep moving forward and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh hangs from a thread while the FBI launches the investigation
"I thought if we could get something like what I was asking (an investigation for a limited time and limited range), we could get some unity," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee was "degrading" because of the parallelization of the parties.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to conduct the investigation?
His reticence is due to a matter of time.
Five weeks are missing for half-legislatory elections (November 6th).If as expected, Republicans get bad results, they will be seriously weakened in their attempts to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush was calling senators, exerting pressure to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, thanks to whom, he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen when the FBI carries out its report?
A vote will be taken in the Senate, which currently employ 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not clear yet whether Mr. Kavanaugh can reach at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice-president, to break the tie and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
The number of deserters in North Korea is low under Kim's mandate
The number of North Korean deserters destined for South Korea has been reduced from Kim Jong One's access to power seven years ago, according to a South Korea legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from the South Korea Unification Ministry, said 1,127 deserts will occur during last year, away from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the strengthening of border controls between North Korea and China and the increase in tariffs charged by people on the other side of the border were key factors.
Pyongyang made no public comment.
The vast majority of North deserters are finally offered South Korea's citizenship.
Seul states that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most of them went through China, which has the largest border crossing with North Korea and which is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone existing between the two Koreas.
China considers the deserters to be illegal migrants instead of refugees and often repatriates them compulsorily.
The relationship between the north and the south (technically continuing in war) has improved significantly over the last few months.
This same month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to hold talks focused on the negotiations on the elimination of nuclear weapons that were parked.
This occurred after the historic meeting in June between the president of the United States, Donald Trump, and Kim Jong-a celebrated in Singapore, where they agreed to work hard to eliminate nuclear weapons in the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the sanctions imposed by the United States for the lack of progress since then.
"If we do not trust in the United States, we cannot trust our national security and, under these circumstances, there is no possibility that we will disarm ourselves unilaterally first," said Mr. Ri in a speech delivered in front of the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and claims that it is not appropriate to access the Supreme Court
The leader of the minority in the House, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and ensured that he was not fit for his nature to access the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview held on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival of Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman ever behaves like that, she would be called hysterical," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's statement before the Senate Judicial Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the charges of sexual abuse on Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
During the initial statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, at times almost shouting and talking while describing his family and his years of high school.
He also explicitly condemned the democrats of the committee, cataloging the charges against him as a "killing of the grotesque and coordinated reputation" organized by liberals angry with Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential elections.
Pelosi stated that he believed that Kavanaugh's statement showed that he could not access the Supreme Court because it demonstrated that he had prejudices against the Democrats.
"I think he's disqualificating himself with those statements and the way he attacked Clinton and the Democrats," he said.
He objected when he was asked if he would try to challenge Kavanaugh if he was confirmed in the post and if the Democrats got the majority in the House of Representatives.
"What I have to say is this: if you're not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then it's not appropriate to be not only in the Supreme Court, but in the court you're currently in," Pelosi commented.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Washington D.C. Appeals Circuit Court.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about the possible resolutions that could be adopted by Kavanaugh against the law of protection to the patient and the care of accessible health or the Roe case against Wade, since it is considered a conservative judge.
In the context of confirmation, Kavanaugh ignored questions about whether certain decisions of the Supreme Court would be annulled.
"It is not the time for a hysterical person to access the court and still hope that we say, look at that well," said Pelosi.
And women need to do it.
It's about a justifiable diet, months and years of anger overcoming, and you can't expel it without crying.
"We'll see when we get angry," Mrs. Steinem said 45 years later.
"I don't think it's that weird, do I?"
He continued, "I got a lot of help from a woman who was executive somewhere, who said she was crying when she was angry, but who developed a technique that consisted in that, when she was angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, "You're probably thinking I'm sad because I'm crying.
But I'm angry."
And then I went on.
I thought it was brilliant."
The tears are allowed as an escape valve for anger in part because they are essentially not understood.
One of my nicest memories of one of my first jobs in an office dominated by men, in which I began to cry with an impossible anger to describe, was that a larger woman grabbed me from behind my neck, a higher place that always caused me a slight fear, and led me to the corner of the stairs.
"You never let them see you crying," he said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll comfort you.
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic Congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was taken on an adventure outside of marriage in a boat named Monkey Business and was withdrawn from the presidential career, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, thought there was no reason why she could not be considered to be present to the presidency.
"It wasn't a well thought-out decision," I said among the laughs 30 years later.
"There were already seven candidates in the career and the last one they needed was another.
Someone called it "Brancaneves and the Seven Years."
Because the campaign was advanced, it was delayed in fundraising, so he swore he wouldn't be in the race for the presidency unless he managed to raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
He found that some of those who supported her contributed $1,000 to male candidates would only contribute $250.
"What do you think, that I have a discount?" he asked.
When he made his speech to announce that he would not present a formal campaign, he was overcome by emotion (thankful to the people who supported it, frustration with the system that made it difficult to collect money and address voters instead of delegates and anger for existing sexism) who remained speechless.
"You'd think you'd suffered a nervous crisis," reminded Mrs. Schroeder of how the press reacted to her.
"You'd think Kleinex was my sponsorship.
I remember thinking, what would they write on my stone?
"Do you hear?"
How the trade war between the United States and China can be positive for Beijing
The initial bombings of the trade war between the United States and China have been overwhelming and, although the war is far from over, a distance between countries can be beneficial to Beijing in the long term, experts say.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, launched the first warning at the beginning of this year by recording Chinese key exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation was produced this week with new tariffs affecting an equivalent of $200,000 million, recording half of the articles coming to the United States from China.
Beijing has been attacking every time in the same way, the most recent rising rates from five to ten percent in $60,000 million in American products.
China has promised to imitate US measures and it seems unlikely that the second largest economy in the world will change in the short term.
To get Washington to step back, it would be necessary to surrender to his demands, but to bow publicly to the United States would be much more embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Still, experts say that if Beijing knows how to play its cards correctly, the pressures of trade war with the United States could favour China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the necessary conditions to start an economic crisis in the two countries is actually much more dangerous than it was previously recognized," said Abigail Grace, a researcher centred in Asia from the Center for New American Security, a center of study.
Syria is "list" for refugees to return, says Foreign Minister
Syria claims it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help to rebuild the country devastated by a war of more than seven years.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulem said the country's conditions are improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is much more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
Now all the necessary conditions are laid down for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and their livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people continue to live in the country and need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would appreciate the help it could receive to rebuild a country that is devastated.
But he pointed out that he would not accept conditional assistance from countries supporting the uprising.
Europe achieves victory at Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won Ryder Cup 2018 defeating the US team by a final score from 16,5 to 10,5 at the Le Golf National club located outside Paris, France.
It is the sixth consecutive defeat of the United States in European territory and it has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe recovered the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, which was the most battle he offered during the tournament, sent the ball to the water in the hole 16 of par 3, losing his match against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer shined in all its series, becoming one of the only four players who achieved a 5-0-0 since the current tournament format was implemented in 1979.
US Jordan Spieth was defeated by the player with the worst ranking of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen, from Denmark.
The first world ranking, Dustin Johnson, lost 2+1 against Englishman Ian Poulter, which is possible to play his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran with eight Ryder Cups quarrelled, Spanish Sergio García became the European player with more tournament wins, with 25.5 points.
"I don't usually cry often, but today I can't help it.
It was a tough year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for selecting me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to be able to get the drink back.
The important thing is the team, and I am happy to be able to help," said an excited Garcia after the European victory.
He passed the witness to his compatriot John Ram, who was able to defeat the US Gulf Tiger Woods legend for 2+1 on Sunday's individual party.
"It's amazing how proud I am today to be able to defeat Tiger Woods. I grew up to play that boy," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost his four matches in France and now has a 13-21-3 record at Ryder Cup.
It's a strange statistics for one of the best players of all time, a 14-major winner, just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had trouble all weekend not to get out of the streets, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a high-caliber golf course throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk said after the frustrating performance of his team: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning, for a while, they made it difficult for Europeans.
We fought.
I took off my hat before Thomas.
He's an excellent captain.
Your 12 players played very well.
We will reorganize, work with the PGA of America and with our Ryder Cup Committee and we will proceed.
I want these 12 boys and I'm proud to be captain.
It's to take out the hat.
They were superior."
