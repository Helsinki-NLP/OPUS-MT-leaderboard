A man has many desires that he does not even want to realize, and it would be wrong to assume otherwise. He wants them to remain only desires; they have value only in his imagination; their realization would be a bitter disappointment to him. Such a desire is also the desire for eternal life. If it was fulfilled, man would become completely sick of endless life, and he would want death.
As long as a man lives, he hopes.
