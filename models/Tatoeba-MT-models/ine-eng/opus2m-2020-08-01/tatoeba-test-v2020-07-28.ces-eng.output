Do you know who the parents are?
No words say how amazing you are.
I'd like a fruit juice.
Is she gonna shower tomorrow?
The letters of Sumery invented were used in many languages in the ancient Middle East.

What does TATOEBA mean?
Where have you been all afternoon?
You found a nice guy.
He did it out of jealousy.
She washed her dirty hands before eating.
I didn't talk to anyone about it.
Don't get too used to it.
I'm thinking about taking a few days off.
Tom never speaks French to me.
Tom left the high-level desk open.
It's not over a beer bottle after work all day.
She doesn't know any of us.
I've been happy with my job so far.
Do you really need help?
To be you, I'll ask him.
Leave them to us.
Here's a map.
Come on, let's get out of here.
I didn't go to the meeting even though they invited me.
Are you still here?
I thought you were going with Tom.
I have to go to the next station.
That dream was a mystery to me.
You must have paid a lot for him.
Tom's obviously lying.
Right and then right and then?
I need you tomorrow.
Why don't I have any food in the fridge?
It was just an accident.
I'll have to call you back.
Tom says he'd like to win.
Tom's gonna be thirteen in the afternoon.
Cut the meat on thin plates.

Moscow is the capital of Russia.
Buy as much as you want.
Tom was worried about the subject.
We're having a lot of beer.
Would you send Tom to my office, please?
I bought it to Tom.
You shouldn't behave selfishly.
Old habits are being measured quickly today.
Tom still has a lot of work to do.
You'd better get out of here right now.
Tom's childless.
I like reading.
We cut the wire.
I don't like to bother you.
Tom won't help us tomorrow.
Tom stopped crying.
The train had to stop because there was a fallen tree on its wheels.
What did Tom scream at?
He's an ideal husband for me.
She's not as beautiful as her older sister.
I brought you lunch today.
We're going to a party in costumes from the seventeenth century.
Are you satisfied with your body?
Can I talk to Tom?
I used to admire Tom.
He tried hard to climb a tree.
Translating the Czech text is very difficult.
Tom's probably the only one who knows the truth.
Tom was standing there, too.
We know everything, Tom.
I'm glad you warned me.
I missed breakfast.
You lied to me.
It's a beautiful language.
I'm not going home for a week.
Who sent you there?
We complained to the manager about the noise in the next room.
You're a kind person.
Can you ask Mary to ask Alice?
His skills qualify him for this job.
The dolls are falling.
She was alone in the dark.
Tom didn't dare tell Mary the truth.
Open your eyes.
I know Tom's wife.
Do you have a pen?
They're not helping.
I like that tie.
We didn't behave as well as we wanted.
Please close the door when you leave.
I'll be back tonight.
Did you have a fight with Joan?
You don't owe me anything.
You scared me.
The girls I met today were students.
The area is covered by black clouds.
I need it more than you do.
You bought a car.
I'm afraid I'll stay here forever.
Tom gave himself a kiss.
What should I do in this situation?
Are you going to school by train?
Tom's not going to school today.
I'm mad at Tom.
Who's Tom visiting?
It could be Tom, not Mary.
What if you invited me to a glass?
Why doesn't Tom want to answer Mary's questions?
Is she married?
Tom wanted to know where Mary was and what she was doing.
I can't answer this question.
I don't know for sure what Tom bought.
There's another question.
It won't surprise me when it happens.
He's free.
These people don't normally say.
Ask your mother.
Tom washed his feet carefully.
Did you have breakfast this morning?
Jana was happy as a bloke when she got a record contract.
I wish you'd come with us.
He spends a lot of time with his computer.
We wouldn't be in this mess if you were helping us.
I don't know what to do anymore.
He's visiting his uncle.
They're all out.
Tom couldn't hear it, but Mary did.
I can give you an autograph if you want.
I saw him three years ago.
How could anyone live in such a place?
It's been raining for two days.
I know exactly what's going on.
Have you ever sung in French?
I'm used to this cold weather.

Tom doesn't like to work.
My heart is French, but my ass is international.
If you have a problem, I want to know what.
Tom hit Mary by the hand.
I'm totally happy myself.
You did what you had to do.
We need to understand that we're still learning.
Tell Tom I won't be there.
Tom played with Mary tennis yesterday.
What's your dad's name?
There were half the walls.
I spoke to him in English and found out I could make a deal.
Tom had to run.
I see the book.
Did any of you ever talk to Tom?
You should apologize.
This area is freshly wet.
She knows who you are.
I want you to see her.
Well, you'll regret it.
You're deaf.
We should win.
All answers must be written in accordance with the instructions.
Answer the questions.
Everyone would be happy if Tom left and didn't come back.
Did you bring the book?
I'm not afraid to open my mouth.
Their father is Czech and their mother comes from Hungary.
I'm thinking about getting divorced with her.
I bought myself a bag.
Do you know where your father comes from?
What are you doing?
Did you do it?
There were absolutely no doubts.
This letter is personal, I don't want anyone else to read it.
If I know, he's not married.
I can't say anything wrong about Tom.
Get up there and you'll see it better.
He's old enough to stand on his own feet.
Once we saw what Tom's got on him, we got a laugh.
Tom's wrong, isn't he?
It's better to be dead than to live red.
They agreed to postpone the wedding.
If I were you, I'd go home.
It'd be great if you did it for me.
Tom knows what he wants to say.
The wedding took place last week.
I'm still eating.
The horse's rolling.
I borrowed it from the mine.
I'm bored.
I write my vow.
I'm not like that anymore.
You won't believe what Tom just told me.
Mary doesn't have anyone to talk to, but she doesn't feel lonely.
If it doesn't rain tomorrow, we'll go to the pool.
Try talking to the police.
You like elephants.
I don't want to change anything.
Bartender, I'll get something to drink.
Do you like strawberries?
She was bigger.
I assume he's gone home.
I was in the woods.
Tom got drunk.
He asked me to wait there before he came back.
I made a terrible decision.
I'd rather go back inside.
She doesn't have to.
I know she's nice.
I'm not going to school on Sunday.
He's got his own house.
I don't usually do it tonight.
Why do you want me to ask them for help if we can handle it on our own?
I was waiting for them to tell the truth.
Put it under the corner.
I'm so glad you're here.
It's a rash.
Tom didn't want to lose Mary.
Tom's home.
Throw that balloon to Tom.
I'm insulting her.
Was the police involved?
We like kids.
I wish I were a better person.
You're stealing, huh?
Tom has to participate.
You should talk to your lawyer first.
You're a good journalist.
That's what Tom's used to.
I love this book.
The waste is stuck again.
When I got home from work, I found out someone had stolen our apartment.
Read the book.

I know you're still not happy.
Can the message be true?
Easy on, easy on, easy on, easy on.
Do you remember seeing me before?
I want to help, but I'm busy right now.
If it wasn't for her help, I'd never pass the test.
