Novák helped Trabzonspora to the other place, he also hit Škoda
Defender Filip Novák helped the goal in the last round of the Turkish football league Trabzonspora as vice-master.
His team won 2:1 at Kayserispora Square and held the third Besiktas behind him.
The attacker Milan Škoda gave after the ice break from Slavia the tenth branch for Rizespor, who saved himself, even though he was at 1:3 on the grounds of Fenerbahce.
Novák confirmed the excellent productivity of the seventh goal in this league year.
In the 63th minute, the Kayserispor golman just shot a bullet and the Czech footballer from the corner set the ball on the net.
The household managed to settle five minutes before the end, but in the sixth minute, Trabzonspor set off the victory on his side when he successfully arranged the break four on one.
The damage at the beginning of the second half of the match with Fenerbahce was equal to 1:1.
The argument did not last long, but it did not have to hate him, because three points were left behind because of the results of the rivals.
The wedding of the Sunday duel of the Master Basaksehir on the Kasimpas Square.
Well hidden caves at the deserter in the woods at New Bor was not really inhabited
In the north of the Czech Republic, in the foothills of the Lužic Mountains, near New Bor, in the Českolipsk, in the woods leading the Brabian road, several sandstones are hidden.
Natural and artificially created.
And we give ourselves up behind that man-made hand.
The place is called Jeskyna at the desert.
In fact, there was never a deserter here, and the cave served as a hidden, more precisely a hidden chamber of grain.
The cave is sealed from the side to the rock guard and accessible by the stairs of the tower.
But it's practically impossible to see until the last moment.
He'll betray her to the narrow stairs leading to a rock gallery from where she just enters the rock.
Although it seems that the chamber is far from human settlements, at the time of creation it could have been on the upper plane where wood is today, field.
"The fact that the facility has no window and not even a traditional place of heat clearly shows that no deserter could ever survive winter here," explains historian Kamil Podrožek from the Philosophical Faculty of Evangelism Jan Purkine in Ústí nad Lab.
A single-space facility has only a stone curtain behind it, which is probably used for the storage of the furniture.
"I see it as a chamber to store some food or products from the field," says Kamil Podrožek.
There are visible traces of tools on the walls.
The cracking of the peacock was for a totally simple and fast focus.
It was enough to use the spasms properly and slowly blow the sands off.
Depending on the length of the foot after the tip and the method of cutting, it is possible to define the period of formation of the cave.
According to history, it's probably about the end of the 18th century.
The cave is freely accessible, and according to the disorder that appears in it, there is sometimes a person sleeping there in modern times.
If you are approaching the cave of the shore from one of the forest roads and we will take you under the cave of the current stream and not far from the tomb road, you will surely find the trail down too.
And by way of the wood you must still be caught by the nearby Havrian rocks.
Kokoj Minarík is after a heavy fall in Germany in artificial sleep
"Philip is now in the best hands.
The Institute is set up in similar cases, and we also have a happy family in Hanover.
This makes it very easy for me to take care of the daughter of Finj," the server quoted Jezdci.cz as saying Minaríkov's wife Katji.
"Everyone's doing the best they can, Philip now needs time to rehabilitate.
It doesn't make any sense to make any predictions.
Anyone who's ever met the problem of brain trauma and patients in artificial sleep knows that the situation can change.
Philip is a great warrior.
We all have to be patient now and give him time," said a woman in her 50s.
For the financial support of the wounded Minarík, he called on Twitter and the star Frankie Dettori, who won the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes in Ascot on Saturday, which he compared to the legend of Lester Piggott.
On the Gofundme server, nearly 70,000 euros have been selected to date.
The target is 100 thousand euros (2.6 million kroner).
Video decision taken to the footballers Sassuola four goals, lost 0:2
Soccer Sassuola football players won four times a match in Naples, but finally they had to calm down with the defeat of 0:2.
Not one of their goals will decide after consultation with the video because of the offset.
According to the Italian media, this is a record failure of technology, so many VARs have never been killed by one team.
"VAR was tougher at Sassuolo than a road radar and punished him as no other team.
New technology markets records," magazine dello Sport wrote in a comment.
"The festival of unknown targets of Sassuola.
VAR has never been so hard on one team," added Corriere dello Sport.
Neapol caught the lead on Saturday at 8 a.m., after half an hour of the game, but it seemed Sassuolo had settled.
The goal of Filip Djuricic was not recognized after the attack by the video director for the offset.
For the same reason, then, they didn't pay any more Djuricic's intervention and Francesc Caputa and Domenica Berardi's strike.
On the contrary, they added another target.
Electromobiles are reporting a new record.
The most popular in history in the Czech Republic
"The growth has been driven both by 30% increase in the number of stations on our network and by a trend of more frequent charging at public stations, as well as by the accelerated development of the registration of new e-autos," said Chez Tomáš Chmelik, head of clean technology.
Other major players such as PRE and E.ON, the manufacturer of Tesla's electric cars, as well as Bill and Lidl's supermarkets are also reported on the market.
Operators of classic pump stations are again represented by the company MOL.
She doesn't have the numbers yet.
"Our electricity network has just begun to build waves," explained Jan Juskova, a spokesperson.
However, the editor of Dinik has obtained data exclusively from all 216 electrical stands operated by the company ČEZ.
It comes out of them that drivers from the stations took on an average of 13,5 kWh.
This corresponds to the arrival of about a hundred kilometers of a smaller electric car.
If we remember a small draw up to 1 kWh, there will be an average charge of two and a half hours.
The woody majority of the tanking then ran free of charge.
If the motorists had already paid for the pickup, their typical loss was about 330 crowns.
Electromobility is mainly in the main city.
In Prague there are all five of the most heavily developed companies in the Czech Republic, which have their popular walls and all the regional cities.
He knows Olomouc between the regions.
On the other hand, the least interest is in the remote station in the border, such as in Bohumín or Prachatics, which often remain unused throughout the day.
More than four thousand electric cars are currently registered in Czech Republic.
In the first half of this year alone, 1274 new e-cars arrived.
In a comprehensive survey by Dinik "Cheši in motion", eight percent of readers said that they consider buying electric cars into the family.
Only a third of the respondents, however, know where to find the nearest charging station in their neighborhood.
Not just for better water retention.
In Prague, environmental activists protested
According to the organizers, the current government's steps in the protection and recovery of the Czech territory and in addressing the climate crisis are not enough, the speakers called for a more intelligent approach.
Actions called The Last Drop took part in representatives of major organizations such as the Spirit Movement, Greenpeace or Green Party, as well as smaller local companies.
"We have here, for example, people who have been standing for a long time against the expansion of the Tours down, there are people who are standing against the spherical pursuit of the Uher Ostrich, there are people who are standing against the construction of illogical tunnels," said Marik Wolf.
It stated that the main requirements of the protesting are the establishment of a plan for the retention of water in the country, the dramatic change in agricultural policy and the system of aid towards sustainable agriculture and the fastest transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy.
"The government is supposed to protect people's interests, not inconsiderate and devastating business," she said.
At the Maloslateral Square, a petition stand was placed calling for representatives of the Czech State to establish a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and restoration of the Czech soil and landscape.
The people present were equipped with transparency with passwords such as "The End of the Deployment" or "The Less Coal, More Tiles".
From South Moravia to Prague, Jan Škoda came from the company For water for people who protested against the plan of the scircopic exercise in Hodoninsk.
"It threatens the source of drinking water for 140,000 people," he said.
He added that gardens represent the fifth most efficient source of drinking water in the Czech Republic.
According to him, the planned shear effort is only about 500 metres from the gardens and according to the findings, it is certain that the quality of the water will be threatened.
He came from the village of Valec to Karlovarska Vojtěch Vesely for the so-called agro-ecological farmers.
He warned of small farms that are notable for profit and profit and are stockpiling the inhabitants directly on the spot.
"Small agro-ecological farms are able to feed the entire population normally, while on top they do not cause such damage in the form of the countryside and the environment," he said.
Three people died on a plane crash at the house in Germany
At the fall of an ultralight plane into a dwelling house in western Germany, three people died today, and two others were injured.
They reported that local life-saving components reported that there are probably two crew members among the dead and one resident in the house.
Letoon landed on the roof of the building in Wesel, North Porný-Westphalia.
The basement apartment, which was one of the five apartment units in the house, then caught fire.
The Hassians have already managed to get the flames under control.
The local fire chief Robert Mayboom reported that the two flight crew members were apparently killed.
The third victim is according to the police, the woman who lived in the house.
The Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung (WAZ) magazine, referring to the mayor of Wessel, wrote that it was the mother of a self-employed woman whose two-year-old daughter was saved from the apartment with slight injuries.
An emergency landing was found near the accident, which served as a brake when landing.
The police are based on the fact that they come from a plane crash.
There was room in the plane for two people.
The machine started off at the airport in Marl.
The newspaper Rheinische Post, with a call for obvious witnesses, stated that before the announcement, the plane was hit by a hot air balloon.
However, this information has not yet been confirmed.
WAZ, with a call for other witnesses, wrote that the plane crashed into the air before it fell on the ground.
The Czech conciliator misaccounted for some payments twice on Saturday.
Error has already been removed
On Saturday afternoon, the Czech conciliator misaccounted for some payments twice.
According to the bank spokesperson Lucas Cropík, the problem could have been with thousands of transactions.
The fault has already been removed and the money has been returned to the customers.
The problems with double counting the ticket payments were recorded on Saturday afternoon.
"Yesterday (Saturday) we made an update of the system last night and all these double payments returned immediately to our customers.
It's all working right now," Krupík said on Sunday afternoon.
The exact number of clients that the bank has deducted money from bank payments twice does not know the bank’s spokesperson, according to his estimate, was a lower thousand transactions.
The causes of the problems are corrosive.
"It could have been a combination of more factors," said Cropik.
The Czech Shroud is the largest bank in the Czech Republic according to the number of clients.
At the end of March, she had 4.6 million.
The owner is the Austrian financial group Erste Group Bank, which is the key player in the banking market in Central and Eastern Europe.
On Monday, the troops will present a three-stage emergency system against coronavir
"They will gradually be based on the power of community expansion at regional level.
We are working on this together with the epidemiologists and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics," Vojtich said in ČT.
It will be called semafor, each region will be marked with green, orange or red color according to the risk of coronavir.
The Minister added that he would still talk to epidemiologists about the classification of individual countries.
He assumed that the orange color would have only the Moravskoslez country at the moment and would be close to Prague.
There will also be individual measures on the map for regional hospitals, hospitals, social facilities and employers.
"We want to deal with this at regional level, because the situation in them is not uniform," Vojtice said.
Vodník and Karolínka
When the hydrogen Jonah and the miller's daughter, Carolinka, look at each other, they don't have that simple.
In the love of Jonah, his father, the foolish watertender of Hastrbuch, Karolínka no longer has any hope that her dear Jonah is not a man.
Even though there's young Libor who will do everything to protect the entire universe, especially Caroline, from this waterfall.
What about intrigue and lies?
Especially if he can prove that Caroline Jonas rejected and gave priority to him, to a successful Liborian.
In the meantime, it is clear to everyone who can drown the midnight Konvička, contaminated with moisture, a fire of flour and other lottos.
The divining of the villagers arranges a hunt for a watertight man, and an irreparable watertight curse will come upon Jonah’s head.
And now Konvic's sweetheart, Caroline, it's all right!
How can you blurt out old Hastribuch, convince neighbors about Jonah’s innocence, find Jonah and release him from the curse?
The story was recorded in September 2010 in the ČT studies and abroad by the fishermen of Brezina, in Obdenic in Sedlčanska and in the beautiful setting of the historical mill in Hoslović.
The Bridge Autodrome will launch a new e-shop
Customers of the bridge autodrome can use a new e-shop on its website.
It will also purchase free and testing cars or motorcycles on a large racing district, which was previously possible only in the case of an autodrome worker in the start-up tower.
"We have come to improve the e-shop so that it is user-friendly, and at the same time we have expanded the portfolio of products and services, which can be managed through it.
At the same time, we have prepared a bonus for our customers in the form of a discount of 1,000 crowns for all the safe rides from our offer.
The discount coupon can be found on www.autodrom-most.cz," explained AUTODROM MOST Jan Svobodová, a commercial and marketing director.
The e-shop website is now transparent, the customer is easily oriented in it.
"An e-shop visitor will choose the focus on the page.

In case of replacement of the selected product or service, the customer may choose one of the four options.

Most of the disease is mild, only three percent of those infected must be hospitalized.
Either the Czech Republic expands the smaller form of coronavir, or the summer dose of the sun has significantly improved our immunity.
The infection department of the patients is half-empty, even though the numbers are infected by growth.
"This situation today and in April is quite different and it is given primarily by the number of hospitalized people," confirmed Minister of Health Adam Vojtich.
It is worth recalling that on 11 April, when the first wave of the epidemic hit us, all the Russians, the troops were taken, the Republic was closed and the Czechs were using disinfection for the year ahead.
Yet ten people died a day.
Now the daily increase in the number of infected is higher, but every day with covid-19, up to two people die.
The highest number of people infected still has Karvinsko, similar numbers have already been reported by Jihlava due to a fire in the local Alzheimer's Centre, where 57 people are already infected - 40 clients and 17 employees.
Another home for the elders was closed by the hygienics in Montenegrin in Královéhradeck.
The disease has confirmed tests with one of the nurses.
"We travel, we restrict movement, we have all the hygiene measures," said the home director of the pensioners Martin Schâněl.
According to him, none of the clients at home yet have symptoms of disease.
The general tests will start by the hygienics tomorrow and then decide on further measures.
The increased number of infected people is also affected by hospitals.
The Oncology Institute in Brno today launched an automatic camera system at the entrance, which will know if people are wearing a seat belt when entering.
The record reports to the South African hygienics who have recorded fifty cases of coronavir - most of them are foreign workers of a labor company.
In total, 131 infected people arrived on Saturday - that is, half the Friday number - but less is being tested on the weekend.
The champion!
Van den Bergh doubles my head, Andersona smetl
The big surprise of the tournament, on behalf of Dimitri van den Bergh, led to an excellent performance even in the fight with the player, who won the second most prestigious company in the PDC in 2018.
The opening of the match was balanced side by side, the crash came at 8:7 point for the Belgian archer.
Van den Bergh took a 13-chip leg break and had a cover ever since.
His opponent literally broke his game and the significantly more experienced "Flying Scott" was only hard to get to the doubles.
The way in which she had "the Creator of dreams" in her lap also testifies to the fact that her divorced Anderson played his first maximum until the 24th.
Moreover, the young Belgian managed a very high checkout.
Last time, he was losing his eleventh leg, in a state of unfavourableness, but "he caught a big fish" and closed 170.
At the end of the game, Anderson saw tremendous frustration.
He was just throwing his arrows and his walking rival behind his triumph was completely sovereign.
Van den Bergh immediately changed the first of the three darts and got his name - he wrote his big dream.
The win of the trophy named after Phil Taylor is more valuable to the Belgian chief than being his first winning major.
It still pays so much that the last player who managed to beat van den Bergh is Karel Sedláček.
The charges against Nantes for the fire of the cathedral, the man confessed
The cathedral of St. Peter and Paul in the heart of Nantes began to burn last Saturday and the fire seriously damaged the original windows of the 16th century and destroyed the fences.
The suspects of the fire investigated the fire because the fire was running through the temple from three different places.
At the same time, the police at the entrances did not find any signs of anyone being raped in the cathedral.
The defendant is a volunteer at the local diocese, twenty-nine-year-old Rwandan refugee.
The police arrested him shortly after the fire, but then she missed him without starting a criminal complaint.
The prosecutor now informed that on the basis of new evidence, the man was arrested again on Saturday, admitted and faced charges of fire.
In case he's found guilty, he'll be threatened with imprisonment for up to ten years and a high fine.
According to his lawyer, the man is sorry for the crime and decided to cooperate fully with the investigators, wrote Le Monde.
Vojtich: We present "semafor" on Monday for epidemiological measures
The new system is to play the role of the Pandemic Plan because of its absence from government and the Ministry of Health Critics.
"They will gradually be based on the power of community expansion," the minister explained.
He added that at present, for example, the Moravian region or Prague would reach a middle, orange level.
The system is designed as a regional because the situation in each country varies significantly.
On the system, the Ministry cooperated with epidemiology and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (UZIS).
A specific measure will be imposed at each level by the Minister, whether it is the obligation to wear gloves or the organisation of special departments in hospitals.
Minister Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) called for the establishment of an epidemiological plan in the Prima Party TV series, according to which people should have clear information on what measures they can expect if the epidemiological situation worsens.
The daily increase in confirmed cases in the Czech Republic has grown in recent days, although the number of hospitalized remains low.
The Vojts commented that there is no major incident in the area of declaring an emergency or re-calling the crisis team.
The government, in view of the increasing number of people who have been infected since Saturday throughout the Czech Republic, has again introduced an obligation to wear gloves on internal actions of over 100 people.
Since Monday, the capacity of these actions will be limited to 500 people, now making up 1,000 people.
The government’s approach, when it was not clear until the last moment, what measures and when they began to pay, and when they were not even declared, came up with criticism.
"I think that in a situation that is relatively tense, the main factors should create on the contrary a sense of security and the confusion should be compared on the contrary," said Senator Marek Hilšer in Questions.
The measures can now vary according to the region, for example in Prague from Sunday to Sunday, the obligation to carry frogs also in non-resident medical facilities, for example in hospitals or in doctor’s checkpoints.
The obligation to wear gloves when visiting health and social facilities or medicine has been introduced since Friday also in the Liberian and Usteck countries.
In the Highlands of Jihlava, it is necessary to wear gloves in indoor public spaces, in MDDs and in medical facilities since 14 July.
On the contrary, in the Moravskosleske region, the anti-epidemic measure was released, as in the Central Czech Republic in Kutnohorsk.
The Czech Government has also approved a so-called ‘semafor’ for Europe at the beginning of June, which colourfully distinguishes the level of risk of infection in individual European countries and therefore regulates the rules applicable to entry into the Czech Republic from those countries.
In countries with low and moderate risk, the authorities do not require a negative test on or instead of a quarantine test for Czech citizens from 15 June.
They're required to return Czechs from high-risk countries.
At this point, all EU Member States are now in the low-risk category of infection.
Tech parties in Benešovska continue.
Plays on third-party capacity, finished on Monday
Hlaváčkova Lhota (Benešovska) Technoparty at Hlaváčkova Lhota to Benesovsk continues on Sunday evening.
He's still playing a third of the original 12 music systems.
According to evening estimates, there are about 500 people left here after 8:00 p.m., the original rough estimates were three hundred, they were 900 in the morning, said police spokesman Lucie Novaková.
Originally, the technologists were supposed to end on Sunday afternoon, at that time, really part of the music systems were quiet.
"Some have already left and others are about to leave.
Music production is still in part.
We expect it to happen gradually to disconnect and pick up the music systems," Novaká said.
"Police officers are still continuously monitoring outgoing visitors in order to prevent drivers from driving under the influence of alcohol or conventional substances.
Drivers have the opportunity to undergo preventive breath tests before leaving," she added.
There are dozens of police officers on the scene, foreign police on the scene, transport and police on the scene, and in advance are also passwords with the service dogs.
"During today's day, the police checked 470 people moving at the site of the action and 485 vehicles, 270 drivers were subjected to breathing tests, of which six were seated under the influence of alcohol," Novaká said.
A total of 95 police officers tested the presence of fake and psychotropic substances, one of which was positive.
Police have also solved 14 traffic offences.
At the request of the technical partners, the police carried out 300 preventive breath tests and four preventive tests on the presence of fraudulent and psychotropic substances.
There were about 2,000 people at the event on Saturday morning.
If the number of participants hadn't been reduced, the police would have hit it.
In the TV series Prima Party said so by the Interior Minister Jan Hamáček (ČSSD).
However, the number of participants decreased by 1,000, the police assessed that there was no need for action and did not ask for it by a health station or health ministry.
On Sunday, the Czech TV (CHT) reported that the technoparties also expanded to surrounding lands whose owners did not agree with the use of the technoparties.
It is possible that the owners of the surrounding land will claim compensation for the damage.
The technologists arrived at Hlaváčkova Lhoty on Friday night.
The police were watching a loophole in Blaži in Benešovsk on Friday, where the tech parties took place last year.
Fortunately, it is about 20 miles [30 km] from Hlaváčkova Lhota, where the technicians finally settled.
According to Novak, no one came to Blaži.
Serpenting: Girl's finished in the hospital!
"The first case this year was recorded on the railway.
The snake in the foot of the girl, the year 2010, which the parents themselves brought to the dark base of the rescue service," said Deník, a regional health rescue service spokesman, Mária Svobodová, who then transferred the child to a hospital in Klatovech.
The snake is the only poisoned garden in the Czech Republic, and it is just in Shumave that these animals appear in a higher number, so it is good to take care of during the walks.
No major danger, however, is at risk from these animals.
The chance that snakes will bite you is not too high, when you're in regular contact they're afraid of themselves.
And if he's got room for it, he likes to go away for the loud sweating.
He'll only attack if he feels a lot of danger - for example when you're wrong about it.
Even if it is not a tragedy, its poison is very effective against small sheep, but people do not die.
This can only be done if a person has a particularly weak organism, or if he suffers from an allergy.
The risk of danger is therefore mainly for children, seniors and allergies.
"A person has frequent feelings of vomiting, thirst, fever, stomach pain and diarrhoea after heart failure, and in particular allergic reactions can lead to anaphylactic shock," said Deník Miriam Gredová from Klatov's hospital.
The man threatened to throw the cows out of the window.
After the cop lil wine and throw away the dishes
After 23:00, an intruder entered the apartment and the man stopped.
The Cajans immediately took over the care of the health care professionals, reported in a press release by the Regional Police spokesman Markét Janovská.
The man didn't want to cooperate with the police, after the police counsellor threw away the dishes, knives, or poured them out of the window with wine.
His threats several times during the negotiations were reinforced by his touching the child from the window.
One day he even went out on his own to see the parapet of the window where he was returning.
The police are still investigating men.
He doesn't want to publish any more information yet.
Stosur gives preference to the daughter before the tennis season
Australian tennis player Samantha Stosur will not be affected by the coronation of the affected season this year.
Sixty-year-old US Open 2011 champion who became a mother in June but doesn't want to finish her career yet.
Next year, he plans to return to the courts and believes that thanks to his family and daughter, tennis will be more enjoyed than ever.
Two weeks ago, Stosura announced on social media that her partner Liz Astling was born in the middle of June to a daughter of Genevieve.
"I'll stay at home, spend time with my family, I'll be with all those little fans our Evie will live in the next six months and I'll just enjoy it," the former world unit said in four quarters on the website of the Australian Union.
The WTA Tour will be restored from March to the late 3rd of August by antucks tournament in Palermo.
Sapa Store: The meat, fish and eggs of unknown origin has been discovered.
"One of the vehicles entering the area carried 1320 pieces of unidentified hatchery eggs, and also under inappropriate conditions.
These eggs will also be disposed of in the Assassination Company," the State Veterinary Administration said.
When checking the stand with live fish, it was found that the seller does not have any evidence of the origin of the goods and is not registered for the sale of live fish.
The market is considered to be a problem from a veterinary point of view for a long time.
For example, during the fall the veterinarians discovered an illegal food sale, which contained almost half a tonne of unmarked food without evidence of origin.
In most cases, the date of consumption could not be determined, some of the products had a last-period durability and were affected.
For five kilograms of sepsis, the duration was exceeded by three years.
Last May, the vets with policemen in the market area held 80 kilograms of food without proof of origin, including dried fish, olives or frozen ducks, which were part of the ball.
Putin called the Greens before starting a case in Donbas, Kreml criticises planned elections
Russian President Vladimir Putin phoned his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenski about the situation in Donbas, where he is about to start paying new advances from midnight.
Putin, according to Kremlu's statement, criticised, among other things, the Ukrainian Parliament's decision to hold local elections; Kyev informed that Zelensky had called for the release of detainees.
On Wednesday evening, Ukrainian and Russian negotiators agreed to support the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OBSE).
The measure should start after midnight on Monday night, be "full and general" and should open the way for compliance with other provisions of the peace agreements.
Putin said in the Zelenski debate that the Ukrainian Parliament's decision to hold local elections would oppose the peace agreement from Minsk and threaten the prospects for resolving the conflict in eastern Ukraine.
Last week, the Ukrainian Parliament decided that the upcoming elections to the local authorities would not be carried out in the territory of the Peruvian rebels.
The Minsk Agreement assumes that Kyiv will regain control of Ukraine's border of occupied separatists with Russia after it gives these regions broad autonomy and organises local elections here.
According to the Union Agency, the Green Office stated that the two States agreed on the benefits of the imminent Donnelas and on the need to take further measures to support peace in this region, such as demining the fighting areas or decommissioning of units from the front.
Zelensky also called for the release of Ukrainians detained in eastern Ukraine, on the occupied peninsula of Crimea and in Russia itself.
The Minsk Agreement has helped to stop fighting, but in occasional shootings and gunshot attacks on both sides of the front, people continue to die.
The Donbasa conflict has claimed more than 14,000 deaths since the spring of 2014.
Ukraine and the West accuse Russia of military support for separatists, which Moscow rejects.
Zelensky has made his priority since the end of the war in Donbas, but has not yet come to the most fundamental breakthrough in the negotiations.
The unexpected master of the ten is Rykl, the seven power of Novotná
Defender of the last two titles Due to not getting to the end of the Saturday programme four months, Koppecky did not jump the foundation on Sunday.
Ten years ago, the Latvian representative Reinis Kregers, who is preparing himself for the Joseph Karas watch group, was on the record.
Rykl had two bronze medals out of the U.S.R. so far, this time he was the only tenman who got across the seven-month border.
Another medal was won by William Straský and Peter Urbanek.
After the competition, he recalled the absence of Adam Sebastian Helcelette and Jiří Sykora.
"It's a shame there weren't guys here and Cope didn't set up because that would have looked completely different.
But the title tastes very good, I especially appreciate having a person 30 centimeters away.
Then I was still satisfied with the point and I was most disappointed by the disc, I was sub-mediated there," he admitted on his facebook.
On the first day of the week, she won with more than a hundred weight of Katerina Cachová, although she suffered from a wounded ankle on her feet.
In the remote sector, however, she wrote only 570 cm, did not cross 40 meters, and did not enter the final osmist.
The novel collected 5878 points and won 241 points in front of Catherine Dvořák.
She's gone a long way, 631 cm is the best Czech performance of the year.
"I really wanted it to be around 630.
Yesterday I started pulling a trigger, but I'm very happy that I didn't feel it at all and that it didn't even make me feel like it," Novotna said on her facebook.
To the Czech arrived bio LPG, promises ecological operation
The liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) is a very well-known alternative fuel in the Czech Republic.
It is particularly popular for its mainly lower price against petrol or oil, given a significantly lower consumer tax, but its benefit is also in lower CO2 emissions per kilometer.
Like gasoline and oil, it also has its ecologically safe option -- "bio LPG".
However, it is quite a news item - firstly on the European market was presented to the Czech Republic, and according to the Czech LPG press report, it arrived a few days ago.
"In these days we received the first fifteen tons of bio LPG that will be distributed in conjunction with the classic fossil LPG at our pump station," says Jiří Karlík's association from Primagas.
However, bioLPG cannot be taken as bioethanol or bionaphtha.
According to the association, the chemical side is consistent with the classic oil LPG, which is now fuelled by a number of motorists in their cars.
That's why it's also possible to mix both versions at random.
"The only difference against the classic LPG is the way of production," says Bio LPG Ivan Indraček, president of the Association.
It also speaks of one of the major benefits of LPG against other alternative fuels.
It is easy to transport and store, and distribution infrastructure is also relatively good, for example when compared to hydrogen or electricity.
This gas is currently obtained as a by-product for the production of bioethanol from residues of food and sugar beet.
In the future, targets should also be produced, such as cellulosic biomass, i.e. wood waste.
On the other hand, classical LPG is partly produced as a by-product in oil refining, partly separation in the extraction of natural gas.
As a result, depending on the production technology and the source of the car’s operation to the bio LPG, 40-70% is more environmentally safe than the carbon rate to the LPG and up to 90% compared to oil.
However, it is not about CO2 emissions from the exhaust of the car, but about the fuel production ecology, i.e. the part "well-to-tank" (Czech "source to tank").
One of the largest producers of bio LPG currently belongs to petrochemical companies Eni, Total and Nest.
According to a recent update of the National Action Plan on Pure Mobility (NAP ČM), Unipetrol is exploring the possibility of production and its Lithuanian refinery.
According to the estimates of the association in Czech Republic, about 170 thousand LPG vehicles are driving; the Ministry of the Environment states in the NAP ČM a slightly higher number, about 200 thousand.
According to the transport ministry statistics last year alone, nearly 6 thousand car conversions were carried out on the LPG drive.
In the Czech Republic it is possible to tank LPG at approximately 950 different operators.
Soldiers audited the number of infected, number fell by 1775 cases
The Minister of Health Adam Vojtich (for the UN) ordered the Ministry to review the numbers of coronavir infected.
New statistics were published on Sunday by the Ministry of Health on its website.
The number fell from Saturday afternoon from 5254 to 3479 cases, which is 1775 less infected.
At present, there are 3422 patients in the Czech Republic.
"After a jump in the number of cures, there is a revision of data that recently the hygienics have failed to update," said the chief of health statistics Jaroslav Dušek.
By Sunday afternoon, 15 212 people were infected with coronavir in Czech Republic, 11,419 were cured and 371 patients with Covid-19 had unfortunately suffered.
Mobile polling units or correspondence.
Politologist and sociologist sought options for a pandemic period
In order to allow people in quarantine to vote in the October regional and Senate elections for coronation, according to Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister Jan Hamáčka (CSSD) there is a need to amend the law.
Parliament could discuss it in August or September in an accelerated regime.
He introduced it on Sunday at the Prima Television Party.
He wants to talk to the Ministry on Tuesday about a possible solution with the representatives of the parliamentary parties.
"Whatever we do, it will have to mean a change of electoral law," Hamaček said.
The Senate, on Wednesday, called on the government to find a solution under the applicable legal rules.
However, the Minister said that there would be a need to amend the provisions of the law, according to which people in quarantine could not vote for their health status.
The prohibition of choice should be maintained, for example, for patients with open-label tuberculosis.
Daniel Prokop, in the OVM series, stated that the possibility of a corresponding election has been postponed since 2004.
Even the current bill, which is in the basement, then counts with its introduction for voting abroad, but not in the Czech Republic.
At the same time, the Prokop considers the concerns of the UN or the ČSSD (because it would rather have been recorded by other types of parties, according to experience abroad) from the corresponding election as overrated.
It is, therefore, against the possibility of an electronic vote where there is a significant possibility of abuse.
Michal Klima said that it is now necessary to invent ad hoc mechanisms (elections) that could be carried out already this year and with the least health risk.
The main thing is to be prepared for 2021 when the parliamentary elections are to be held in the Czech Republic.
Correspondence choice (whether in a foreign country or also in Czech Republic) is considered to be one of the functional methods.
As a further example, he sees the election units already mentioned or the possibility of a representative vote within the family.
He added that it is possible to learn how similar situations - elections at the time of the crown virus - were solved in Croatia, Poland or France.
As a result of the spread of coronavir infection, different types of elections have already been postponed in 67 countries around the world.
Protests in Bulgaria: The pig's ears were throwing demonstrators at the government building
The participants of the demonstration against Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyk Borisov and his cabinet were targeting the building of the government of the pig's ears.
It was another series of protests against the "mafian style of government", which have been played in Sofia and other cities for almost three weeks.
The organisers are planning a central state blockade, the DPA agency has introduced.
Today's protest, which took place 18 days after itself, was less attended by Radio Free Europe/Radio Freeboda than before.
At 8:00 p.m. there were about 300 people, some streets had to be closed for transport.
The demonstrators in front of the building government staged a theatre scene, where they symbolically imprisoned Prime Minister Boris and General Prosecutor Ivan Gessev in connection with the arrest of two Romanian Presidents, who is a strong political opponent of the government.
Both resignations are part of the basic requirements of protestors.
They also called for the abolition of the notified health reform and the end of corruption in the construction on the Black Sea coast.
The protest organizer Nikolaj Hadjigenov said today in a public declaration that on Wednesday there is going to be a "top-level escalation" in the form of a "celon-national demonstration in Sofia and blockade throughout the country".
He reiterated his demand for Boris's resignation and his government, as well as the writing of early elections.
Those proper ones should be carried out in March 2021.
Boris's already told me he wasn't willing to resign.
He justified this by, among other things, the need to carry out the Bulgarian pandemic of cod-19 and resulting from the economic crisis.
On Friday, however, he exchanged five members of his government team, although the protestant's resignation did not calm down.
At the beginning of this week, Boris's government stopped in Parliament voting on confidence in Parliament.
Coach Boloni Mihajlovic doesn't want games without spectators anymore
Football coach Boloni Siniš Mihajlovic already has enough Italian league games without spectators.
The Serbian spy hopes that from the new season, fans will return to the stadium.
"What we're currently operating here is not football.
I already have full teeth of games without spectators.
It's a sexless football, it doesn't give me any emotion, no joy.
Those fights are worse than coaches.
Playing like this is terrible and I don't think I'm the only one who thinks it," Mihajlovic said before today's fight against Lecce.
After the coronavir break, they follow the series A matches in quick follow-up, and although they play until evening, their actors are exposed to heat.
"We play every three days in a terrible wind.
Under such conditions, they don't even know what the teams are on.
By the end of this season.
These measures had to be taken to win the competition, but I hope that from September onwards the fans will be back," said the viewer, who in the past led Fiorentina or AC Milan.
For Mihajlovice, this season is unusual because four months of treatment for leukemia.
"In spite of my illness, the breakup of the league and everything else, our team managed to move up.
We want to continue growing and we need players to be stronger mentally," he said.
We've become the target of a cyberattack of foreign states, Iran claims.
Since the end of June, fires and explosions have been reported by Iranian military, industrial and nuclear equipment, as well as oil refineries, power plants, factories and businesses.
Some Iranian factors have indicated that the fire that broke out this month in the underground nuclear operation in Natanz could cause cybersabotage.
The reason for a number of other incidents has not yet been explained.
Iranian Ministry of Foreign Language Abbas Mussávi told Iranian media reporters that the infrastructure of the Islamic Republic is facing "thousands of cyberattacks" every day.
He added that it's not about a new phenomenon and that most of them are able to reflect.
In recent months, according to the Museum, several broader cybernetic attacks have been reported, which have resulted in "certain governments and groups" being analysed.
However, Reuters did not report any further details on possible contractors.
The mustache also added that fires in forests, refineries and other places are common in summer.
The Iranian state agency IRNA's article this month discussed that Iran's enemies, such as Israel and the United States, could be behind recent incidents.
Not one of these countries was directly accused of specific attacks in the article.
Iran and the United States interrupted diplomatic contacts shortly after the 1979 revolution when Iranian militant students attacked the US Embassy in Tehran and held 52 Americans for 444 days.
In the long run, tensions between the two countries developed in 2018 after Washington withdrew from the 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and the world powers and brought sanctions against Iran, which had a strong impact on its economy.
Another significant escalation came this year after the US Army killed Iranian General Kasem Solejmī and a member of the leadership of Iraqi militia Abu Mahdi Muhandise on 3 January.
Iran then set off on January 8th at the base of Iraq, where the Americans act, the amount of missiles.
When the United States withdrew, tens of U.S. soldiers were injured.
Israel considers Iran to be its chief enemy and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanjahu is the main supporter of the 2015 International Nuclear Agreement with Iran.
According to the Israeli Prime Minister, Iran is attempting to develop an atomic bomb, which Iran rejects.
The TPCA car has extended the production stop until May 25th
Toyota Peugeot Citroën Automobile (TPCA)’s koline car again extended the production delay due to coronavir.
The production lines should be relaunched on Monday 25 May in the morning.
The race will accompany dozens of sanitary measures, said the speaker cars Tomáš Paroubek.
The product is due to the pandemic of coronavir since the evening of 18 March.
The company originally intended to renew it on Monday, 18 May.
The reason for the extension of the stay is according to Paroubka closed border and closed dealership, so no one has to sell the car.
According to Paroubka, the company will produce 100 percent from the beginning, i.e. two shifts.
Coronavir is a key market in the company, such as Italy, the United Kingdom or Spain.
Mayor Michael Kašpar (Change for Kolín) said that the production surplus in the TPCA is not signed up for life in the city.
"At first it was known, it was empty in the city.
But gradually the streets are filled, especially since Monday, when it's a lot of fun.
So the city is full," Kašpar said.
According to him, there are no complications with foreign workers who stayed in their homes.
"In those two months we didn't have to solve almost any problem," Kašpar said.
For example, the JuvenileSlavska Škoda Auto, which also interrupted production due to the coronary crisis, restored it on Monday, 27 April, in all three of its production plants in the Czech Republic.
Not one of the races works for 100 percent of its capacity.
The reconstruction of the production in Skoda accompanied more than 80 sanitary measures.
On the night of Monday to Tuesday in Mladé Boleslavi and Kvasiná, the first time after the restoration of production was the third, i.e. the night shift.
In the TPCA, about 2,500 people are currently working and the company is one of the largest exporters in the Czech Republic and at the same time employers in Cologne.
Cancer killed a bride shortly after the wedding: She left a message to her family
More than two years ago, she was fighting the ultimate cancer of Gemma Sisson, and when it seemed that cancer had been defeated, the disease came back.
A 20 - year - old woman who loved culturalism finally ended up in bed in a hospital where she had enough to take her life's love.
I'm sorry to have to go down.
A few hours after her death, on her social network account facebook appeared shocking message for the closest.
Gemma Sisson from English Leeds loved culturalism.
With a friend of Rick Moore, who lived with him for more than 16 years, they traveled through competitions around the world.
Ninety-year-old woman was sporting and living in health, but she was diagnosed with cancer in April 2018.
Gemma started exhausting therapy, radiotherapy, hoping to heal.
After months of treatment, it really seemed that Gemme was able to win over cancer, but in August 2019 the cancer returned and this time attacked a fifth.
The culturalist and personal trainer, according to British daily Mirror, underwent a ten-hour operation of the Paterra and then re-started drastic treatment.
However, everything was empty.
At the beginning of this year, at her 90 ’ s, she was told by doctors that she had a few months to live.
Finally, in April, a blonde woman decided to go to the Leeds Hospital, where she was visited every moment by her family, who even arranged for her wedding with her love Ricky.
The marriage lasted two months.
Ricky last took Gemma to their two-month anniversary at the restaurant.
Four days later Gemma died in his arms.
Just a few hours after her death, on her social network account, she discovered a contribution that Gema wrote for her family.
"If this was published, it means that I finally died after weeks of too long fighting.
Although I'm gonna have a broken heart to leave my loved ones here, I'm gonna be so happy to get rid of what this terrible illness has caused me.
I cannot thank enough Ricky, who was on my side all the time and gave me a huge amount of love and support during that terrible time," she wrote on the social network that pain and suffering finally stopped and she found peace.
"I am also grateful for all the support I have received from all my social network followers," she wrote, saying that everyone should respect his life and live it fully.
Machines for art sell passports, amulets from mushrooms and pexes
With hundreds of crowns, most of the leading Czech designers will receive a rolling cap.
The images and other creations are made directly for the Artemis, so they know in advance that they have to go into size 8.5 to 5.5 centimeters.
Every piece is numbered and signed.
"In the package there is always curatorial text about the artist and then work alone," said the curator of the project Petra Wižová.
Artmat works with the principle of chance.
The buyer can thus be surprised by what artistic work he gets.
Currently it may be necessary to become the new owner of fancy illustrations by Alexandra Staplové or miniviews from Theresa Bonavourt, which can also be sent.
Artist Punx 23 in collaboration with Dora Duck has prepared a pexeso associated with the Prague Pass.
The cards need to be dealt with with home signs.
Ilona Polanski created an artmat tattoo collection.
Marie Ladrova and Juliana Chomová are selling a bag of spirituality: the first of the artist offers a protective amulet from the trodnat and magic card, the second series of illustrations based on her Spiritist comic.
Payments in health will grow by up to five percent next year.
Major elevations are unrealistic according to Vojtecha
Health payments could grow by up to five percent next year, said Minister of Health Adam Vojtèch (for the UN) in Questions of Václav Moravce on Czech TV.
The demand for an increase of up to 15 per cent is considered unrealistic.
He also said that the state should try to be self-sufficient in providing protective aid.
According to him, hospitals now have their supplies.
"I think that growth may be about five percent," the minister said.
According to him, it is necessary to reflect the current situation when it has taken place since March to select a certain pandemic of coronavir and a government regulation against its spread.
The insurance receipts went down at that time.
"I'm going to have a 15 percent increase at this point in reality," Vojtice said.
The average monthly benefit of a doctor in acute bed care according to data from the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (UZIS) is likely to reach 88 312 crowns this year, sisters 47 498 crowns.
The difference between the payment of a sister in state hospitals and wages for other founders will be up to seven thousand crowns.
The data from UZIS also show that the loss of nurses in hospitals has been halted.
The average wage in the Czech Republic was 34 125 kroner in 2019 according to data from the Czech Statistical Office.
In June, representatives of the experts indicated that they would require a minimum increase of 10 per cent for 2021, ideally 15 per cent.
In the long run, they criticise the significant difference between the distribution of doctors and nurses in state hospitals, which must be guided by pay tables and contractual wages in hospitals, countries or private ones.
They therefore also require that the payment tables be uniform for health professionals.
For nurses this year, the difference will reach up to seven thousand crowns a month.
For example, doctors, but last year, wages grew faster than wages.
According to the president of the Czech dental chamber Roman Schmucler, the experts should understand how it is currently being done.
Recently, because of the effects of the cotton epidemic, the survey approved an increase in the annual state budget deficit to record 500 billion crowns, of which 1.75 billion is to be paid by health professionals in hospitals and social services.
The Board of Health Care Providers according to Schmucler with a flat rise in wages will not agree next year.
According to him, the remuneration should be decided on by the hospitals and medical facilities themselves and the money should also be paid to them through the municipal notice.
He also pointed out that hospitals currently have a lot of protective aids.
The President of the Government of State Reserves (SSHR) Pavel Švagr said this week that the administration does not currently have any health assistance.
He's waiting to complete the selection procedure.
According to Vojtecha, suppliers in the world are now able to deliver goods better than in March when they were bought out.
According to him, the state should try to be as self-sufficient as possible and also buy from Czech companies.
They could take over the soldiers by blowing up a smart quarantine.
We're ready, they say.
"A wise quarantine works, of course, is what to improve.
We'll discuss it with the army tonight.
The army is working perfectly and it is a question of whether they should not manage it all again," the president of the government said on Sunday in his Facebook series Ča people.
According to him, it is not possible to connect enough IT systems and hygienic stations, which need to gradually switch to more modern operating methods.
The problems were, according to the Prime Minister in the Moravskosles region, where they are one of the current outbreaks of the epidemic.
The Ministry of Defence spokesperson Jan Pejšek told the ČTK that there is no weekly conference information and that the government should discuss the matter on Monday.
The army is ready to take this step.
The smart quarantine project was taken over by the Ministry of Health on 25 May.
Until then, a wise quarantine was run by a 90-member central steering team set up under the army as an advisory body of the government, which was led by former ministers of Roman Primula.
The moving project was criticised by the Minister of Interior Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) on Sunday.
And he insisted that he could be taken back by the army.
Inadequacies in the project had previously been permitted by the government's authority for IT and digitisation Vladimir Dzurilla, who has him at his disposal.
"The system works, but it's still working.
Twenty years of this has happened independently and unsystemically, now we've been trying to unite for a few months.
It's not pressurized.
People on the move, poor people on the move on the move adapt these new systems and actually catch the mistakes," he said.
Macura's island prime minister won't run again, he doesn't want to "get involved in politics"
The current island primacy of Tomáš Macura (ANO) will not run in the next municipal elections.
The reason is the effort "not to be fooled by politics," said the server Respect.cz.
Macura, at the same time a member of the presidency of the UN Movement, has been the Prime Minister of Ostrava since November 2014.
In the municipal elections in 2018, he received almost a third of the vote by a leading candidate of the UN movement in Ostrava.
Macura originally wanted to function for only four years.
"I told myself that I would hold on to one functional period and with the experience of business here during that time, I could reverse everything and put it on my feet," Respect said.
He added that during the second election period he was allowed to negotiate to some extent.
"But it's the maximum for me.
I don't want to be a fool in this policy," said Macura, who in the discussion himself referred to himself as a heavy introvert, which does not require frequent contact with people.
According to the Respect, for a longer time Macuro is being speculated about the possible end of the UN movement.
The server recalls that Macura has repeatedly criticised the movement of the UN, such as for the association with the movement of the SPD or for the support of Milos Zeman in the presidential elections.
As one of the few UN personalities, he supported Zeman's opposition candidate Jiří Drahoš in the elections.
Macura is not planning to leave the UN movement she entered in 2017.
"As long as I feel that I can change something in motion, that it's not a completely empty fight, and that no one dares me to end it, I have no immediate motive," Respect said.
Sixty-six-year-old Macura studied at the University of Prague.
Before becoming an island prime minister in 2014, Macura acted, inter alia, as director of Walmark pharmaceutical company.
He also sat in the organs of other companies.
Back to Brno Uber offers transport services
By the end of July, Uber will return, which offers transport services.
This is the result of the amendment of the law, he introduced on Thursday in the press statement by the Council of Brno for the Transport of Petr Kratomíl (ODS).
Against Uberu in Brno, the taximen protested, pointing out that Uber did not meet the conditions such as a taxi or a taximeter.
However, the amendment of the law has changed the conditions for the operation of ordinary taxis and alternative taxis since July.
In the last few weeks, he has completed several discussions with Uber's representative.
"On their basis, this company decided to return to Brno at the end of July this year with its services.
This step is the result of a change in the law which allows this company to operate legally.
The city was familiar with this change and we believe that the company will operate its services within the given limits," Kratohīl said.
Uber acted in Brno in the past.
The taximen protested against him because of the non-labelling of vehicles as a taxi or a missing taximeter.
The court issued the preliminary measures that prevented Uber from driving in the city.
Brno initially supported the taxi driver, but at the end of the year, Prime Minister Markéta Vanjková (ODS) said that the city would want to take steps to make Uber work in Brno.
According to later court decisions, Uber was able to drive in Brno, but the company did not use it.
Now he's coming back on the basis of a change of law.
As of July, it is clear that with classic taxis with a light and a taximeter, it is easier to operate a transport service ordered and paid exclusively through mobile applications.
Too much booming celebration in Brno: the flying chair hit a meter from a man on a walker
From the fourth floor of the apartment, she flew out on Saturday night in Brno's office chair and reached about a meter from the hallway.
He was followed by a walker who called the officers immediately.
Immediately after arriving at that address in the western part of the city, she noticed an open window under which she was still lying in the chairs and next to several drawers and non-slips.
"The hand, which was carried from the room in the fourth step, indicated that there was a relatively noisy celebration inside.
The officers went on their way to the apartment and asked three young men from the age of sixty to ninety years for an explanation," spokespersons of Jakub Ghahn told them.
Request for appeal Rafaje speaks Babiš with ČSSD
Prime Minister Andrej Babiš (ANO) plans on Monday with coalition Social Democrats to discuss a request for the proposal to revoke the head of the Antitrust Office (UOHS) Petra Rafaje.
The Rafaje was called upon by non-profit organisations to hold anti-corruption councils, as well as the Ústek country.
Social Democrats say the exchange in front of the office is on the ground.
According to the information of the ČTK Rafaj, on Monday, he was not invited to the Government's Office.
His second mandate will end in the middle of next year, according to the law he cannot be named the third.
His appeal is within the competence of President Milos Zeman.
In addition to the call for non-profit organisations, the Prime Minister received a letter with a similar requirement from the Ústeck State.
That's why they've been making Rafaj's cases since the last time.
Last week, the Prime Minister refused to make a request by getting acquainted with the materials and government parties to do so with "some opinion".
He also stated that he had not yet discussed the challenges with the president, that he had no meeting with him at the nearest time.
According to the UOHS statement, there is no reason why Rafaj was not accused of anything.
The servers IHNED.cz and Aktuální.cz wrote last week that the police were interested in Rafaj's meeting with Jiri Chunk.
The meetings were linked, inter alia, to the decision on competition for the project of a controversial new lynch hospital of eight billion, which Cunek strongly promotes.
The mayor admitted to the meeting, according to him, they jointly resolved his "senatial activities".
So does Rafay.
The Office of the State of Ústek to appeal to Rafaje called on the government at the end of June.
It also requests the reform of the Authority's decision-making mechanisms.
The decision of the ÚOHS regarding public contracts according to the Heitman Square for the transport of Jaroslav Kominka is not transparent and has signs of will.
Last March, the police raided the antitrust office because of a tendency to choose a myth.
This year in June, the server Aktuální.cz pointed out that Rafaj is using apartments written on the company of the influential background player ČSSD Alexandra Čuba.
A deposit of 3.5 million per apartment in Brno was paid out of Rafaj's account.
As of 9 July 2009, Rafaj, President of the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition, appointed the former President of the former Member of Social Democracy in June 2015.
In a few years' time, Rafaj's second six-year mandate will be over.
The Antitrust Act states that the President may appeal to the President of the Office on a proposal from the Government.
It may be revoked only if it does not function for more than six months or seriously violates the dignity of its function or the independence and impartiality of the Office.
The staff were collaborating in the library of Blana.
Helps with air conditioning
The new technology will be 740 thousand and will be in operation in the second half of August.
"It's good news for me.
With three kids, we go to the library in downtown Blanca regularly.
In the warm months, however, it was practically impossible to endure.
There was a terrible wind and a bad air.
Winding didn't work.
That's why I love climate change," said one of the Lebanese readers Petr Novotny.
According to the director of the book Luke Dlapa, the temperature in the building was often sprinkling to over 30 degrees.
The southern wall of the object is glassy and in the sunny days it acts as a glass.
"The sun is also supported by the bending of the building for a large part of the day.
At the same time, it is a major problem for the individual department to blow up because overnight it has to be closed for safety reasons.
Often so we have been in the library since the morning to thirty degrees," Dlap said.
The worst part was the studio and the reading room on the third floor.
And at the height of the showroom and the director's office.
The unpleasant climate was also in the children’s room, which is under the roof of the building.
"Sometimes it happened that the librarians at work were collaborating and ending up in a job incompetence.
The problem also arose regularly in the cultural room at lectures that visit dozens of people.
After a few minutes, she couldn't breathe," said Dlapa.
Originally, the representatives of the city wanted to make air-conditioning this year in all the library spaces.
In the end, there will be only three rounds of five.
"Because of limited funding, climate change will only have the most problematic areas.
The studio and the reading room on the third floor.
Furthermore, the cultural room and the Children's Department have a higher patronage," Jiří Svoboda informed the Bulgarian Investment Board.
He added that in the first phase, workers in the fall installed air technology and adjusted the electrical installation.
About 360 thousand crowns.
The city library Blanca has almost three thousand registered readers.
It's about nine hundred to fifteen years.
Chicago's resistance has eliminated the crown virus.
Crawford is coming back to the game
Not every infected sportsman comes out with the truth.
Especially when it's a player from NHL who is silent about the health of the players as a grave and doesn't publish anything at all.
Like one of the little ones came out of the Crawford series.
A 50-year-old cousin from Montreal was present only at the first traineeship, since then missing in the compound.
"I'd like to inform you all that I've been positively tested on Covid-19 and that's why I've spent the last fourteen days locked up in my house," he explained the reason for my absence.
Fans don't have to worry about his health anymore.
Crawford's ready to throw himself back into full load.
"It's amazing that I'm back.
I'll do everything I can to get in shape as soon as possible," I added.
The experienced golman has won with Chicago two Stanley Cups, a sure part of the branch is already the tenth season in line.
Blackhawks is waiting for St. Louis's duel first, then they'll be in front of Edmonton.
Thousands of people protested in Israel against the prime minister
Thousands of Israelis in several places protested against unemployment, corruption and the way Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addresses the coronation of the crisis.
The demonstrations took place, inter alia, in front of Netanjahu's private villa in Caesarea, near its official residence or park in Tel Aviv.
In Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, protests have been taking place regularly for several weeks.
Their participants demand Netanjahua's resignation for the process in which he is accused of corruption and fraud and also for the government's solution to another wave of the coronary epidemic.
"Baby, go home," wrote an AP agency one of the demonstrators to his transparency, referring to Netanjahu's commonly known nickname.
"Everyone sees that the emperor has lost his clothes," he said.
Seventy-year-old Netanyahu is Israel's first prime minister to be sentenced to office.
He is accused of three cases of corruption, fraud and mistrust.
All charges are rejected and marked as a witch's hunt.
According to local media, the process can last up to three years, and over 300 witnesses are called.
Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed in Israel, with about nine million inhabitants, in almost 60,500 people.
455 people died in connection with the plague.
In March, the Israeli government introduced quarantine measures that helped to reduce the daily growth of infected people.
After the gradual release of restrictions from the end of April, but especially at the end of June, the number of people affected began to grow significantly again.
Netanyahu's criticism argues that the government has not helped enough, for example, the survivors with quarantine measures.
The challenger also argues that the government in the framework of the fight against coronavir issues conflicting guidelines.
The driver broke down the car about the tree and died.
The body had to cut off the fires from the back

The driver probably flew at a low speed down to the forest and broke the car over the tree.
He's dead in place.
They had to fire the fires out of the back of the body, among other things cut off the roof.
The circumstances of the accident are being checked by the police.
They ordered a drink that would explain, apart from others, whether a man would not drive under the influence of alcohol or other conventional substances.

Pietro Filipi cancels discounts and betting on sustainability
The Czech clothing brand Pietro Filipi wants to focus on sustainability and will allow itself to change the strategy.
He's breaking down and he doesn't want to scratch one collection after another anymore.
The fact that fashion industry is one of the biggest environmental polluters is no news.
There are billions of pieces of clothing in the furnaces and warehouses every year.
Looking at slow fashion, often distorted access to clothing, but in recent years it changes relatively quickly.
About half of Peter’s goods sold to Philip for a full price.
The other half, which was sold by discounts, just doesn't buy.
The company does not want to draw one collection after another and at the end of each season the products will be sold at their production price.
In addition, according to the owner of Michal Mitchky, new and old collections and blind follow-up are rapidly changing fashion trends.
"Most traders with discounts are already counting on buying goods, so much higher margins are included in the full price.
So it's actually a little bit of a trick," says owner Pietro Filipi Michal Micka.
In addition, the company wants to support local business.
"Every product is made of carefully selected quality substances and designed by local designers.
We stress that much of our collection is made of so-called basic pieces - that is, clothes that are overtime and overseasonal.
Worldwide is a segment of premium brands of absences of any kind typical, the price of the product simply corresponds to its quality and the discount is not necessary," says Micka.
The huge graffiti represents the flight of the RAF Kurta Taussiga
"The task was to create something at the end of the year.
And I remembered our complaining pilot fighting in the ranks of the British Royal Air Force in World War II.
The proposal liked city management," said Vacek, who completed his work after fourteen days of intensive creation.
He consumed about 300 liters of color and 50 sprays.
Kurt Taussig was born in 1923 in Teplích-Shanov.
He left town when he was 15.
During the war because of his Jewish origin, the Nazis dragged him to an international camp where he was held for several weeks.
However, he and his brother were able to avoid concentration camps because of Nicholas Winton's organization.
In 1939, Taussig arrived in Great Britain, where he volunteered to join the Royal Air Force (RAF), and later studied pilot training in South Africa and Palestine.
He was involved in war operations in early 1945.
After the Soviet revolution, he visited Czech and native Teplice several times, who gave him honorary citizenship.
The 60-year-old Kamil Vacek, known as Camo in the street art industry, has been working as a spy in the teplic streets for over 20 years.
He started with graffiti on surfaces that were then part of the Jaroslav Kubera (ODS) prime minister for these purposes.
Storm Hanna arrived at the coast of Texas
Hurikán Hanna arrived on the southwest coast of Texas on Saturday afternoon at local time (before midnight SELČ at night).
He hit the Texas island of Padre Island, about 20 miles [24 km] north of Port Mansfield, and weakly on the tropical storm.
According to meteorologists, however, it poses a major danger to coastal inhabitants.
He brought with him strong wind and intense collisions; together with local floods, electrical accidents and various material damage were reported by the AP agency, including damaged ships.
The governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, announced a natural disaster and recommended voluntary evacuation on Saturday for 32 periods in southwest Texas.
The most powerful warning was received by people from the coastal zone between Port Mansfield and the Mesquite Bay, but in general he was meant to hit the area nearly 500 kilometers long before moving slowly over northeastern Mexico.
"Although Hanna is now a tropical storm, strong rain and wind, rising levels of hunger, dangerous proximity and a single tornado can pose a threat," warned the U.S. National Centre for Hurricanes (NHC).
This morning the local time (in the afternoon SELČ) moved in the area of the American-Mexico border and followed it with a wind speed of 85 kilometres per hour.
Hanna became the first Hurricane this year in the Atlantic.
Over the Gulf of Mexico, she was driven by wind at speeds up to 145 kilometers per hour, but she was gradually weakened as far as 112 kilometers per hour, which removed Hanna from the Hurricane category again.
Local authorities have called for storms to cross the home and not to forget the hygiene measures associated with the prevention of the spread of coronavir.
Texas belongs to those states in the United States that use the pandemic disease covid-19 as much as possible.
Due to the current security measures and the need to comply with the derogations, there is also a great challenge and possible evacuation.
supervisory shelters were opened in hotels, schools and gyms.
In the Texas period Hidalgo was also one of the buildings adapted as a shelter for evacuated patients who had a positive test for coronal virus or were otherwise exposed to infections.
The local authorities have called on all evacuated to hide with them the rumps and disinfectants, if possible.
"We don't even have that far behind us.
We expect catastrophic floods," quoted AP Chrise Birchfield, who works for the National Weather Service (NWS) service in Brownsville.
Predictions say that in some places it could be up to 300 millimetres of precipitation for a few hours, in some cases nearly 500 millimetres, which could flood a number of seabeds along the coast, along with the ravages of the sea.
Land to borrow Colonel Lipkov's general value
President Miloš Zeman will borrow Colonel Paul Lipkov's general value on Wednesday.
This results from a review of the expected events of the Ministry of Defence.
The reason for lending the value of the Brigadier General is the August turn of July to the post of Deputy Commander of the Allied Multinational Division of the North in Poland.
The July Act still acts as a representative of the commander of the Land Forces of the Czech Army.
The increase in Zeman at the end of June was proposed by the government.
July from the beginning of August replace Brigadier General Karl Greekk to the position of the commander of the multi-national division of the northeastern Poland Elblag, who directs the units of the Alliance's pre-eminent presence in the territory of Poland and Pobaltí.
Greece became the Director of the National Office for Cyber Safety and Information Security (NUKIB) in March.
The government has proposed to the president that Lipkov should borrow the value of the Brigadier General.
Under the Civilian Act, a higher value may be borrowed by a soldier during the term of office of the elected officer or during the period of performance of the service task requiring the loan of a higher value.
The post of Deputy Commander of the Alliance Division shall correspond to the general value.
The soldier to whom the value was lent has the same rights and obligations as if he were appointed to that value.
However, he has no claim to adjust the salary that would correspond to the values.
The borrowing of the value takes into account the reason for which it was granted.
" Colonel Lipka demonstrates high professional readiness and is a model for subordinates.
A significant contribution is made to the performance of the tasks of the armed forces of the Czech Republic, including cooperation with foreign partners and ensuring the participation of the army in foreign operations," the Ministry of Defence said in June to propose an increase.
The mid-term increase will take place at 12:30 in Prague Castle, attended by the Minister of Defence Lubomír Metnar or Chief of Staff Aleš Opata.
EU countries have coronavir standards for aviation
The countries of the European Union agreed on common hygiene standards for aircraft travel, which are designed to help limit the spread of new coronavir.
It was announced by German Minister of Transport Andreas Scheuer.
Among the agreed standards are the compliance with the derogation or the carriage of rumps on the aircraft and at the airport, but the average seats on the aircraft will not have to remain unobtained.
She's been reporting on that agency, Reuters.
"I am pleased that my colleagues have adopted a German proposal for Europe and that we could agree on these uniform standards," Scheuer said at the European Aviation Conference.
The German Ministry of Transport then added that the agreement was concluded by officials and that ministers still had to formally approve it.
The agreed measures shall include a requirement to cover the mouth and nose of passengers for six years, to comply with the recommended derogation from safety checks and landings at the airport.
The aircraft must also provide sufficient fresh air and all information must be available in several languages.
The airlines will also be able to accommodate the middle seats.
The common rules agreed by the officials shall meet at least some of the requirements of the airlines.
Different standards have caused confusion.
The arctic peaks dropped the temperature record, measured almost 22 degrees.
"In Longyearbyen a 41-year-old record fell," the Norwegian Meteorological Institute said on Twitter.
In the evening, the temperature rose to 21.7 degrees Celsius, adding a record of 0.4 degrees from 1979.
The hill of the 2,000-year-old Longyearbyen is the largest city in the Spicberk, located about 1300 kilometers from the northern plain.
Spicbers heat faster than almost any other place on Earth.
This fact highlights the dangers arising from the warming of other ends of the Arctic - from Alaska to Siberia, the last report of the Norwegian Centre for Climate Studies states.
The average temperature in the Spicberkas has grown from the 1970s to five degrees.
By 2100, it can even rise by ten degrees, unless the discharge of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere is reduced.
The increase in temperature in the Spicberk may result in permanent freezing of soil, which threatens the stability of many buildings, roads or airports and may cause even greater quantities of lava and sutures of soil.
Climate warming also threatens the Arctic fauna, such as ice bears or turtles, which are dependent on the ice cover of the ocean.
Brits returning from Spain are waiting for a mandatory two-week quarantine
The British cabinet also called on citizens to avoid all roads to mainland Spain, which are not necessary, due to the risk of spreading the disease of covid-19.
So the Canary and Balearic Islands are not mentioned, but after their return, people must be isolated for two weeks.
The new rules enter into force at midnight.
"The protection of public health is our absolute priority.
We have taken this decision to prevent the possible spread of the virus in Britain," the British diplomat stated in his statement.
"We have always made it clear that in case it is necessary, we will immediately remove certain countries from the safe list," she added.
As noted in the British newspaper Metro, the latest announcement will affect thousands of British travel plans.
Spain is one of the most popular holiday destinations.
The British are concerned, among other things, whether they will be paid sick if they have to end up in isolation for 14 days after their return from their vacation.
For example, Neil Hunter from Sittingbourne made a ten-day vacation at Lanzarote, and they had to leave on Tuesday.
They've been ordered since December.
"We were supposed to go all over the family, my wife Amanda and the daughter Bethany, but to be honest, after this announcement, I don't know what's going to happen.
I'm working as a mechanic and I don't think my employer will agree that I'll be back on vacation for two weeks in quarantine," quoted Metro Hunter.
In relation to Spain, there are concerns that the country is at the beginning of the second wave of epidemic.
During the last two days, there have always been over 900 newly infected people in 24 hours.
Authorities in some areas have already introduced coronavir measures, such as Catalan trying to limit all night life and prevent people from meeting in large numbers.
The Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs has recently pointed out the increased risk of infection in Catalan, Aragon, Basque and Madrid.
Model of electricity purchase from Dukovan government
On Monday, the government runs a model for the purchase of electricity from the planned new nuclear power plant Dukovany.
The proposal of the law shall be calculated by the fact that in the case of a purchase price higher than the price of electricity on the market, the difference shall be paid by all consumers through tariffs.
In the second case, where the purchase price is lower than the market price, the impact on the consumer will be otherwise.
The electricity power is an unregulated part of the final price of electricity for the customers.
The Deputy Prime Minister and Industry Minister Karel Havlíček (for the UN) and the energy company ČEZ have previously stated that the most likely option is that people will be saved by building for electricity.
On the contrary, analysts point out that the long-term view of electricity prices in the markets is always non-existent, which has shown developments in the past several times.
The intention had been criticised by environmental organizations before.
"The purchase price can be both under the market price of the power plant and above it.
Final impact at the time of application of the rule can be both negative and positive.
The impact will be spread between customers according to the size of the safe - either for lower consumption or for electricity consumption - for higher consumption of electricity," the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MPO) said on the basis of the material.
The Havlíček pointed out in May that it assumes that the wholesale price of electricity is growing and that people in Dukovan are making a profit.
Otherwise, there will be an impact in tens of crowns per family year, which he believes is far less than people pay each year in electricity bills to support so-called supported resources.
He had previously estimated that the purchase price could move between 50 and 60 euros (approximately 1320 to 1600 Kč) per megawatthodine (MWh).
The proposed material does not contain any proposal for the amount to be contained in the purchase contract.
The price of electricity at the Prague Energy Exchange for 2021, at which traders are now the most stocked, currently accounts for around 45 euros (asy 1190 Kč) for MWh.
"In contrast to the purchase price and market prices of the power plant in the amount of ten euros, an average household allowance with consumption of 3.3 MWh per year - can correspond to four-member households, standardly equipped with electrical appliances, including electrical safety boards and pipes, which however does not use electricity for heating and heating hot water - a few 100 Kč/year," wrote the foundation for the MPO government.
"We live in an extremely turbulent time.
Pandemie coronavir has shown us how vulnerable the global economy is.
For this reason, I consider the long-term forecast of market prices to be an explicitly speculative issue," the ČTK said previously executive director of the Energy financial group Tomáš Voltr.
The proposed law calculates that the purchase would be carried out by the MPO, and that the legal person owned by the State at the pre-specified price would be entrusted to it.
The contract between the investor and the State guaranteeing the conditions for the purchase of electricity would be concluded for a minimum of 30 years, with a possible extension of ten years, including repeated, but not limited to the end of low carbon production.
The low carbon production design defines as a nuclear power plant connected to an installed power system with a minimum power output of 100 megawatts (MW) after 2030.
The Havlíček earlier stated that the new Dukovan block should have a power of 1200 MW and produce nine terawatthodine electricity annually, which would correspond to the ten expected Czech consumption.
The block should be placed on the market in 2036.
The model of financing the new Dutch bloc approved the government on Monday.
The facility should be able to finance the construction without charge, with a two-percent interest per operation.
With the funding model he disagrees with the opposition, it also disturbs the possibility that Dukovany would build Russian or Chinese companies.
The State should share 70 per cent of the building.
The remainder should be paid by CEZ, which will also bear all possible additional costs.
CEZ Director General Daniel Benes said in May ČTK that the expected amount for building a block at current prices is about six billion euros (approximately 162 billion kroner).
The agreements between the State and the Czech Republic on the construction of a new Dutch bloc will be signed on Tuesday.
The Ministry of Local Development has downloaded material to support tourism in the media in two billion
Material, according to which the Ministry of Local Development (MMR) planned to lose in the media, on the Internet and billboards for advertising on holiday in the Czech Republic of two billion crowns, was withdrawn from the review procedure.
Minister Klara Dostálová (for the UN) of the List of Reports.cz said he is still working on the material.
The eKlep document (e-book of the legislative process) was pointed out on Friday by the Zvrovrzy.cz server.
The Ministry of the Plan justified the loss of traffic due to coronavir.
During the coronavir crisis, revenue loss and the media were recorded.
The proposal called for criticism of the opposition and travel representatives.
According to the proposal, which is now available on the website clidacstat.cz, MMR planned to give money to CzechTourism via public travel agencies for advertising on television, advertising, printing, internet, billboards or stations.
The biggest part of the money, and that's 700 million crowns, they'd get TV.
Most people would get private TV from Nova and Prima.
Printed journals and weeklys would get 400 million and the same part would give MMR for PR articles, advertising banners and videos on websites.
The broadcasters would receive 350 million for a media campaign, most of which would be a private station again.
The remaining 150 million would be used for outdoor advertising on billboards, LED screens and platforms on stations or in meters.
The campaign to support travel in the Czech Republic should start in mid-August and last a year.
"The material is still working on, certainly not in the format that should be presented yet," Vastalová said without further details from the News List server.
The material criticised the opposition, according to the head of TOP 09 Markets of Pekar Adams, media from the trust funds of Prime Minister Andreje Babiš (ANO) would benefit from advertising.
"I firmly believe that this apparent humiliation will be achieved in the fall at the time of the election of the morning between eyes," she wrote on twitter.
The source denies that it is actually aid to the media affected by the crisis.
"It may also be a coincidence, I don't know anything about media support," Dinik N said on Friday.
According to it, the budget is two billion indicative.
"Of course we're still counting it, it can be less and more.
It's a work material," she added.
On the initiative of saving tourism, there is no media campaign to support domestic tourism.
"We want two billion for companies in travel, not an excessive advertising campaign," said Tomáš Barčík, president of the initiative on Sunday.
If there are two billion crowns in the state budget, they should direct companies, not the media, to write an initiative in an open letter to the government.
The worm of life, the cock of a beer and death as grass
The third album entitled And death is the stem of the grass of the Brno poet, the tireless organizer of cultural activities and the publisher of Jaroslav Erika Friče, who left also a year ago, on 24 May.
In Frič's discography is the fifth item, and as in previous titles there is also the main emphasis on Frič's poetry, which is the very outstanding interpreter.
Frič, the year of 1949, was obviously influenced by the American beat generation, but this inspiration passed through his own, personal experiences and also very neutral expressions of faith.
However, he was far away from being agitated, talking or writing about faith, about God, was always very intimate, nonaggressive, completely tolerant.
I think in this context of Bohuslav Reynek (as opposed to Jan Zaradník), the masters will pass.
Frič's album offers records of authorship from 2006, but also performances with musicians who have always been very sensitive to it, whether it was cellist Josef Klíč or Honza Barton and Vítězslav Holata.
I will help - like - the words of the island poet Peter Hrushky about the long songs of Frič.
"The pride and inexhaustible bitterness of them," writes Hruška, "was upon the condition of our world threatened by enmity.
The world, which is increasingly falling into dense consumer vanity and cruelty, is increasingly away from what his soul has been created - from the mystery of faith, humility and human proximity.
There was a pattern in them of those who knew that the values for which they were created were little interested, but who also knew that they could not be told only because of the general interest.
Those poems reminded us that a person may have to lose everything precious, but it is not inconceivable how he will find it.
If he sells himself to a general decline, he is skeptically resigns, he is afraid to shut up, or he remains for the last time in calm and proud duration on what he believes and loves."
Parubek is not my advisor, said Hamaček
Former Prime Minister and President of ČSSD Jiří Parubek is not a paid social democracy adviser.
The President of the Party and Minister of the Interior Jan Hamáček only communicates with him and reads his opinions and articles.
Hamaque said that today on Prime Party TV.
About Paroubek to be Hamaque's advisor, the server informed the List of Reports.cz on Friday.
"Sometimes we write an essay, he sometimes sends me some material and I read it," Hamaček said today.
He added, however, that it is not official and paid cooperation.
ČSSD considers that it does not have the means to waste it for similar purposes.
"Sometimes I read his opinion, so many people like that," he said.
In the next discussion with the ODS MEP, Jano Chernoch told the Minister that many members of the ODS are still "uncoverably listening to the views of Václav Clause".
He thinks it's okay because it's an experienced policy and a former president of the party, which is also Paroubka's case.
The fact that the media are making an affair, he marked the mark of this year's harvest season.
Server List of News.cz wrote on Friday that Paroubek plays the role of Hamačkov's informal consultant.
He also wrote that, in the fourth place, the party's candidate in the Austrian country is headed by a certain president of the dark cell Petr Bend, who is associated with Paroubk and acted as vice-president of his party LEV 21.
The Hamaque said today that the composition of the candidate will not comment until it is ready and approved.
Duplantis has a mile ahead, it's a kick in the ass, it's a Swedish challenger.
The 22-year-old American pointer has ambition and potential to be one of the most important competitors of the new ruler.
He already knows what it's like to defeat a two-year-old Duplantis, who beat her last year at the meetings of the NSAA.
"We had a battle a year ago, then he won and I was the second, and then we went through it.
In both cases it was a very good match," describes Nilsen, who secured his victory with a performance of 5.95 meters.
Since then, however, Duplantis has fired a sharp raise and is currently isolated in the highest point spheres.
In just 20 years he became a world recordman, this February 8th in Toruni won over a six - foot - 17 - foot - long [6.17 m] ladder, added another centimeter in Glasgow a week later.
"He jumped six meters in 18 years when he graduated from high school," recalls his teammate Nilsen for the World Athletics web site.
"It was clear that as soon as he grew up with a boy in a man, all his potential and talent would decrease.
Twenty years is a good age for jumping the world record," he thinks.
Whether Nilsen's score of success is more accurate than the one that is proud of Duplantis, the American sets similar goals.
So far, he pointed out his options at the NCAA matches, which he regularly won, in February this year he improved his internal personal record at 5,93 m. Last August he won a gold medal in Panamanian games in Lima, already in 2017 he won an American ride to the world championship where he finished 13.
Then the closest lover is to taste the Diamond League for him first.
"It is certainly my priority to get to the professional circle and race as much as possible in the Diamond League, because there you can make a name," she admits.
"If you can succeed at this level, you can certainly follow the same steps as the Olympics, the world championships or Panamanian games."
But because of the pandemic, these top holidays are being postponed, which gives Nilsen and the other points time to improve.
But will it be enough to get the Duplantise, which can easily turn the race under five circles into just a silver fight?
"Everyone is trying to achieve it, but I don't think it will be possible as soon as possible," Nilsen thinks.
"That boy's been jumping for 16 years, and he's got a mile ahead of everyone else."
And before Tokyo starts 2021, he'll want to raise it even more.
A woman lost a statist from the invalid retirement of a disabled son.
There's a court waiting for her.
The money that a 33-year-old man receives from the state as a disability pension is primarily intended to improve the quality of his life.
A woman is threatened by eight years in prison for a felony.
Because of his poor health, the court rescued the sick man’s conscience and established his mother’s guardianship, who was to manage his sons’ money, among other things.
"A woman from mid-November 2013 to January this year used part of her son's disability pension funds for her needs and prepared it with 440 thousand crowns," said police spokesman Dana Ladmanová, arguing that the accused woman had a special duty to protect the injured's interests as a guardian.
According to the order of the court, the son had an account, but his pension had been transferred to his own account.
"After paying the costs associated with the stay of the son in the health care facility and the replacement of the necessary medicines, the remaining funds were used for the purchase of vehicles, electricity consumers and on the way home," the complainant said.
That he can't use his son's money for his own sake, the woman confessed.
But she hesitated to help them pay for their family expenses.
"We had problems with our income to push the pace of the household.
We've never bought anything superstandard.
It was always about things my son would approve of.
I thought it was family money.
I didn't know I was going to commit a crime," the woman explained to the police.
She promised her son's money would come back.
North America has been inhabited for 30,000 years, hard scientists after finding tools
Findings from the Chiquihuite cave in the Mexican state of Zacatecas include 1930 weapons instruments, including fine blades that could be used for cooking meat, and spicy objects that could serve as toys of spears or spears.
Scientists have found that the oldest tools come from 33,000 to 31,000 years ago.
"There are only a few products here of this old man.
But they are here," said the archeologist Ciprian Ardelean from the University of Zacatecas and the chief author of one of the two studies that were published on this subject in Nature magazine.
The youngest tools reach 12,500 years old.
According to experts, the people of the Chiquihuite cave, located at a large sea level, lived for 20,000 years.
So far, the widely recognized theory has been that the first representatives of Homo sapiens crossed the fortress bridge from the area of Russia today in Alaska about 13 500 years ago.
Archaeological evidence, including unique caves used to kill mammals and other prehistoric animals, showed that this Bolivian culture then expanded in much of North America.
This model, however, has been found in recent decades when several old plantings were discovered, which were between two and three thousand years older.
In the second study published in the journal Nature, there are 42 different locations throughout North America that demonstrate human presence on the continent between 26,000 and 19,000 years ago.
Scientists believe that small numbers of people could have come to the North American fortress before they were supposed to.
Some of them could have gotten a ship to America.
"It is obvious that people in America were long before the development of a so-called Bolivian culture," anthropologist Ruth Gruhnová from the University of Alberta said to new findings.
So far, the interest in the airline is filling up an optimistic scenario, a tough salesman.
The prices are gradually falling
She sells airplanes in the Czech Republic growing every week.
On the other hand, last summer’s interest is still almost half-hearted, but demand increases by up to 20 percent each week.
The development after the crisis thus, according to the sellers, fills the most optimistic scenarios.
The prices of flights are falling gradually too.
Amongst the most sought-after destinations are according to sellers in particular of the South European countries.
According to the data Kiwi.com, Spain, Italy and Greece lead.
At the Letuska.cz portal are the most sold flights to the Croatian Split.
In other countries, then, Britain is the most sought after, but it has always been one of the most sought after destinations.
The average price of flights is also reduced.
At the Letuska.cz portal, approximately half a month, around 6250 crowns were moved, between 3,000 crowns less.
This is mainly due to an increase in demand for a European destination, which now accounts for about 85 per cent of sales.
However, even prices in some European places, such as Spain or Italy, have dropped by about five in recent weeks.
The crisis has also affected the behaviour of customers who now buy airplanes with much lower preference than before, as they are afraid of further developments in the coronary situation.
According to previous information Kiwi.com, the purchase time of the flight was reduced between about ten days.
"This confirms our future trend, when people will order flights with much lower preference, will require greater flexibility, less risk," said Vice-President of Kiwi.com Mikhal Shindelář.
Currently there is an average booking time before departure 21 days.
Along with sales growth, the number of renewed airlines from the Czech Republic also rises.
At the Prague airport there are currently regular lines to more than 60 destinations.
Last summer's season is about half of the destinations.
Big finals already tonight!
Follow the archery battle live on New Sport
The second most prestigious tournament within the PDC ended at the big final.
It features an experienced 19-year-old Scottish archer Gary Anderson and a surprise tour, a 60-year-old Belgian Dimitri van den Bergh.
Gary Anderson first took Justin Pip off, then hit his neighbor in the tabloid.
However, James Wad also advised himself, and at the quarter end he fought with Simon Whitlock, who had sent home a world unit.
"Flying Scott" was in the semifinal where he was facing Michael Smith.
At the last moment, however, he escaped the tombstones from the shovel, continued to dominate and after the result 18:16 he fought a place in the final tournament which he had already ruled in 2018 when in a wonderful battle he defeated Mensura Suljovice 21:19.
The biggest surprise of World Matchplay is Dimitri van den Bergh.
The Belgian talent uses the tournament and perhaps knowing that he has nothing to lose helped him to play on a totally fantastic wave.
A 16 - year - old gunman first surprised the world's sixth Nathan Aspinall, pushed Joe Cullen into the dramatic battle, and hit Adrian Levise in the quarter-final.
A big check was semi-final.
Glen Durrant immediately showed his strength at the outset, but then, in a calm Belgian series, he got a jump, which he held to the finish without much trouble.
Van den Bergh showed his strength in high scores, which he struck with occasional uncertainty over doubles.
Cases of coronavir occurred at least from the beginning of the week, decreased number of tests
Since the beginning of March when the new coronation virus was first discovered in the Czech Republic, 15 212 people have been reportedly infected.
Nearly 9,600 of them have already been cured, 368 patients have died.
At present, there are 5,254 people who are sick.
It comes from data on the Ministry of Health's website.
The daily number of newly confirmed cases in this week exceeds four times the number of cases in two hundred.
The maximum was 281 cases on Friday.
On Thursday, 235 were tested positive, 246 earlier and on Tuesday 206.
On the first working day of this week, 169 were infected.
In the Czech Republic, 9 590 people have been cured of their covid-19, which is 63% of all those infected so far.
In most cases, the disease had a slight duration.
According to the latest data from the Ministry of Health, 151 people with coronavir are in the hospital, 19 of them rated doctors as serious.
There are several outbreaks of covid-19 in the Czech Republic.
The most infected in the last seven days are still the estimated 100,000 inhabitants of Karvinska, which is almost 59.
Following is the period of Jihlava with 56 and Frýdecko-Místecko with 36 infected with 100 thousand inhabitants in the last week.
As a result of an increase in the number of infected, a new measure against the spread of coronavir has been applied in the Czech Republic since Saturday.
People have to wear gloves on internal collective actions of over 100 people, it's about cultural and sporting events, but also weddings and funerals inside buildings.
From Monday on, the capacity of these actions will be limited from the present thousand people to half.
Already in the world, the number of people who have been provenly infected with a new crown virus has exceeded the 16 million limit.
It was introduced by the American University of Johns Hopkins, which monitors the development of pandemics globally.
The balance of the victims who died of covid-19 disease is estimated to be 645 thousand.
The most recent million infected have arrived in statistics in just three days; the 15 million threshold fell on 22 July.
In recent days, the United States, which has already registered more than 4.1 million infected, has the highest rate of rapid case growth in Brazil with 2.4 million and India, where, according to the authorities, nearly 1.4 million people have been infected.
The infected are now at a record rate.
The World Health Organization this week announced that from Thursday to Friday, more than 284 thousand new cases have been brought worldwide, which is the highest daily balance since the beginning of the pandemic.
This development can be attributed to the fact that the spread of the disease is at the top in countries such as the United States, Brazil or India, according to the Reuters agency, but the number of new cases has grown in almost 40 countries worldwide last week.
This applies, for example, to Australia, Japan, Bolivia, Sudan, Bulgaria, Belgium or Israel.

Health damage to air fresheners and deodorants
Health is not only a threat to poor air quality in rural areas, but also at home.
She pointed out this by an Israeli expert on human health by Carol Abraham, quoted in The Jerusalem Post.
According to Abraham, who deserved the establishment of the Israeli Ministry of Environmental Protection, it is necessary to focus on harm in the homes right now, when many people spend more time working from home.
Abraham referred to the research of the United States Environment Agency (EPA), according to which the quality of domestic air is up to five times worse than that of the countryside.
The World Health Organization (WHO) considers that the poor quality of air in its homes kills 3.8 million people annually.
"Because of the epidemic of coronavir that caused many and still forced to work from home, people have to spend more hours in their homes than before, so it is time to focus on the quality of the air in their homes," Abraham said.
In Israel, it says that the quality of "home air" is almost unoccupied.
Dangerous, however, may be the things that people usually come into contact with — spices, air fresheners, disinfectants, deodorants, or pesticides.
"The poisonous gas also emits clothes that we regularly carry into the cleaner," Abraham said.
The most vulnerable are children, older members of the household, and people with respiratory problems.
Otherwise, the health of individuals may begin to suffer from problems such as headaches, nausea, dryness of the nose, nose bleeding, vomiting or skin allergy.
In the long term exposure to non-healthy substances may be impaired by internal organs and central nervous system.
Not all pests come from objects inside the home, the source may also be the material from which houses are built.
