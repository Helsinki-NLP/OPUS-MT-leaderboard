The product cost less than 20 euros.
The fee corresponds to 40% of the value of the goods....
I'm #PRS_ORG# wholesaler and so it's not a problem for me.
You only need a number or instruction which I should attach to the package so that it can be traced back by you.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# for €249 a few days ago.
Today it costs 179€.
I honestly find that very annoying.
Do I have to cancel the order and reorder for the better price or is there another possibility of the credit?
I also believe in principle that children should not be allowed to take on a parental role for their little sisters.
However, I think it is also good for large sisters to take care of the little ones.
Take a short look, help out a little, bring the bottle, etc.
So they learn responsibility, help in the family with and are involved.
As long as they can still be enough children themselves, I don't see any problem.
If your K1 is busy for the short time alone and it's OK for him, that's good.
You can do the best you can if it suits your children.
It's not like he's gonna turn K2 and go to sleep for hours.
It's probably just legal.
Maybe that's why the psychologist's statement comes too.
Because if something really should happen like a fire, burglary, earthquakes, alien invasion, etc. it would actually be too much responsibility for K1, to take care of K2.
Whether this is a risk you want to take is, of course, your judgment;)
Please help me find the title of a book again!
I remember reading a Crimea / Thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost all the action, but I don't want to feel the title partout anymore, maybe someone here knows...
The story was about fear and therapy.
At the beginning of the story, a pet killer commits suicide by crossing over with feed and going to his ruddy cats.
The case is taken up by a Commissioner who, after a brief investigation, has provided his therapists with a clinic where he treats patients with fear.
The Commissioner has a small nest that also has a fear (before fire) and landed at this therapist.
There comes to be more suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is commissioned to go to the site of the suicide and document the photos on the Internet before each suicide.
In any event, it turns out that this therapist operates a kind of underground treatment group where patients have a chip planted in the brain, the brain suppresses a fear center, and the patients finally face their fears in the most extreme way.
(A woman jumps out of the window another one goes for death)
This fear is referred to in the book as "the fight".
At the end there's a big showdown in the clinic that had to do with a fire.
This is the gross act I am quite sure that the book was originally written by a French author/author.
If this action was known to someone or even to me someone could betray the title of the book, I would be very happy.
Oh, well, I don't have the password for Wlan.
I need to contact my husband first.
But it can take.
What steps do I have to take after?
Is it also possible to recover the price difference ?
Child, 4 J., splitter under the needle
The child, four years old, has over the entire length of wood splitter under the dome nail (outside).
They tried to pull him with a brush.
It's very hard to catch.
He didn't hit and hurt.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try.
No more chance.
It's going to be a doctor tomorrow.

The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family.
Through the combination of digital decoder and sound module on a conductor we reach dimensions of only 30mm x15.5mm and can therefore be built into almost every loop of the track ranges H0 and 0.
LokSound 5 decoders are offered with all common interfaces and always come with an 11x15mm large "sugar cube" loudspeaker next to the shell cap.
Like all family members, the LokSound5 is a real multiprotocol decoder.
It controls the DCC data format as well as Motorola®, Selectrix® and M4.
In the DCC format, 14 to 128 driving stages are as obvious as 2- and 4-point addresses and up to 32 functions.
Thanks to RailComPlus®, the decoder is automatically logged into a suitable digital centre.
It controls all DCC programming modes and thanks to RailCom® you can read the CV values on the main track with appropriate centrals.
For centrals that only program the CVs of 1-255 can exist Help registers.
Motorola® users benefit from up to 28 driving stages at 255 addresses.
Three additional Motorola® addresses allow the release of 16 functions.
An built-in programming mode also allows reprogramming with the honorable Control Unit 6021.
The M4 protocol allows automatic registration of mfx® compatible centrals.
The LokSound 5 decoder recognizes the Marklin® brake lines as well as the ZIMO® HLU brake command or the Lenz® ABC system.
It is also possible to brake with DCC brake components or with equal voltage.
In addition, it also stops with a Selectrix® brake diode.
An ABC pendulum automatically allows the automatic pendulum between two railway stations.
The LokSound 5 decoder can be used on analog equal and interchange currents.

Because of Omicron: Johnson wants to drive refreshment
Always new cases of Omicron provide politics and science in Britain.
Thus, by the time of the new year, all qualified adults in England are to receive an award.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to advance even faster in the face of the Corona outbreaks in view of the rapid rise in Omicron numbers.
Every adult in England will be given the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, if at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, Johnson said on Sunday in a pre-recorded video message to his countrymen.
So far the target date was at the end of January.
In addition, the British Government will provide support to speed up vaccination campaigns in the parts of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
In view of the Omicron variant, one faced an emergency, which is why the immunisation must be strengthened urgently, said Johnson.
The good news is that the level of protection can be increased again with a third dose of vaccine.
"Let's blow it up now!" said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 other Omicron cases were recorded in the United Kingdom, with the total number increasing to 3137.
Compared to today, this was an increase of 65 percent. dpa
will the full amount be refunded from the purchase price at the time of collection?
I am for everyone to introduce themselves to prognomas
I sent out an application.
Today the invitation came to a conversation by mail.
I want to answer the e-mail.
Unfortunately, the name is not "Peter", but a somewhat more complicated name.
I have Googled him and wherever he/she has a cultural background it is either a man or a woman.
I don't know how to write the e-mail now.
Can you help me?
** I'm a foreigner and I don't want to keep an official above the feet.
Conclusion: everyone should introduce himself with prognosis.
It has a total of 5 books.
Four of them go.
Only one thing I bought today is not going
Apparently the chair had an unexplained lack of sales.
How else can such a pulse damage occur after 9 months?
Only on the #PRS_ORG#.
But it's been working since approx.
14 days no more.
That's why I always bought the last books on the website and then read on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# and wanted to buy 8.
However, there was no more.
Now they are available again and I would like to add 2 chairs to your order and take this into account.
[CW] The feeling if I can't help.
Content Warning: I will write something detailed about domestic violence here.
I just have to write something from the soul.
I (21) come into contact with victims (and victims) of domestic violence more often for professional reasons.
A topic that really bothers me and unfortunately too often occurs that many victims are not allowed to help themselves or think we could not help them.
I'm pretty clear that we can't do everything and it's not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my profession that move me more than if I can do nothing in such situations.
I see the blue spots, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in conversation under four eyes, with the perpetrator far beyond sight and hearing, I cannot reach all.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear, fear of rache, fear of leaving the usual social environment before the children get out of it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone is, in part, very close to the tears, all are worth living without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't just have to take violence.
Often I wish I could help myself anyway... I know I can't.
But it's never gonna make it easier.
Please, always think that you are worth living without violence that is so incomprehensible.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What does the series point to "League of Legends"?
Many Fantasy, many complicated names, a stunning discovery: "Arcane", the series from the "League of Legends" computer game universe, was recently launched on Netflix.
Why do we look forward to the two posts that have already been announced?
basketball-Bundesliga: Derby-debakel der MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg at the Merlins Crailsheim
At least on Youngster Johannes Patrick was engaged.
Nothing again: For the second time within not even three months the giants lost in Craisheim - and how!
Prior to the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick had said, with a look back on the Pokal-delay at Hacro Merlin's Crailsheim in early October: "We've got some anger in our stomach."
It then did not stand after the game - but increased again in the face of 61:72 (28:38) -down in the basketball league.
With more than the naked result, the way of appearance disappointed.
A representative was called a statistics that expressed the whole dilemma: The three-quota was just 13 percent, 4 hits (all by young John Patrick) in saying and writing 31 attempts - yet questions?
The answer John Patrick delivered: "We were simply not concentrated enough after the win at Tenerife, and we have not implemented what we have trained".
That's to move the ball.
Otherwise, he reacted to Sebastian Gleim: "To win a funny game for the second time against Ludwigsburg," said the happy coach.
"It felt like 10,000 people before."
Only 750 visitors were allowed on Saturday in the Hohenlohe Arena, but they came at their cost.
Not least because of BBL Topscore T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and led the game of his team.
"The best gamemaker I've ever trained," Gleim praised.
While in Patrick's team, the performers such as Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) lost their performance all over the line.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) the giants prevented a total debacle and came to eight points after they had already left 39:59.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon came to 12 points.
A lot of time to hate remains unhappiness.
Already on Wednesday (19am) the giants receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, then also in Ludwigsburg maximum 750 spectators.
We used to have another email address, but I changed it.
Yeah, I already reported a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all security claims were rejected.
We have been legally informed again and have therefore written it again.
We were originally notified a year and a half ago.
Always as from the egg: Max Raabe becomes 59
He is able to inspire his audience with new interpretations of drummers from the 20s and 30s.
He is currently on his way with the program "Good day, dear happiness" - if he can perform.
In fact, Max Raabe would like to celebrate his birthday on the stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But it won't happen.
The planned concert was held in May 2022 - "on official instructions", to prevent the Corona virus.
Others of his performances planned in the Advent period must only appear once, as it is called on the singer's website, which will become 59 today, and his musician (www.palast-orchester.de).
From January then, artists want to follow their deadlines already set by 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on December 12, 1962 in the North Rhine-Westphalia moon, Max Raabe has already sung much and gladly as a youth.
In Berlin he studied opera singing, in 1986 he founded the Palace Orchestra together with Kommilitons.
Since then, the Bariton has established itself with its repertoire of drummers and songs in the style of Comedian Harmonyists.
He was awarded many awards.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached – just like his success album "For Women, this is not a problem" (2013) – the second place in the charts.
He made it out of the niche in the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, the blonde hair coming back strictly and thinking about labels, Max Raabe is not to be forgotten from the current German-speaking music landscape anymore.
With the program "Good day, dear luck" he has been on Tour. dpa since 2020
Hello #NAME#, is it also possible to get a small piece of furniture before?
It will be complemented with existing furniture and so we could check beforehand whether it is colourful
It still doesn't work. I can't just look at the cover sheet, but I can't see leaves.
Federal Building Minister Klara Geywitz: No new apartment is created by design
The new Federal Building Minister Klara Geywitz (SPD) spoke against the acquisition of large housing groups, as was required in Berlin in a national decision.
"With an arrangement there is no new apartment, it only changes the ownership structure," Geywitz said in an interview with the "day mirror" (Sunday).
My goal is to assure tenants that their rent will remain payable in the coming years.
A colorful mix of private tenants, associations or housing companies, for example, is the best protection against monopolies.
In Berlin, the coalition of SPDs, Greens and Left Party intends to set up an expert commission to deal with the outcome of the People's Decision.
However, if the situation is not relaxed, Geywitz did not terminate the conversation with the FDP in the Ampler Coalition on further reinforcements in the rental law.
The Coalition Treaty provides for a rental price brake until 2029, a limitation of rental increases in stressed housing markets and the extension of the rental mirror.
I will speak to the Minister of Justice to implement this as soon as possible.
If the rental market still doesn't relax, "we'll talk to the coalition partners about further steps," stressed the SPD politician.
Hello, I wanted to order something, and after a few days I found out that I forgot the last step in the payment.
Unfortunately, the product is no longer available.
Do they know when it will be ready again?
Or will it come again?

At least 100 dead by Tornados in Kentucky
In a devastating storm system, many tornados have been pulled by the United States.
In Kentucky alone, more than 100 deaths could be reported.
The pictures of it remind us of a war zone.
On Saturday night in the United States, several tornados set up severe deserts and possibly claimed up to a hundred deaths.
The storms leave some 320 kilometres of desert snow, especially in Kentucky.
His Governor Andy Bessear said after a visit to the disaster area, wherever the tornado was through, everything was gone.
Houses, shops, government buildings - just away.
Parts of industrial installations, roofs are in the trees.
It is hard to imagine that this is possible at all.
He alone counts Kentucky in the Member State with up to one hundred deaths, the official figures rising on an hourly basis.
Hello, I just saw that she sold out Vitrine #NAME#.
That's very bad.
Will it still be produced?
Or was it taken all the way out of the range?
Is it possible to order this glass in another country?
How long have you been reporting?
If the delivery cannot be done in my apartment, I have to cancel the order!
I understand that. Can I just order the blanket now and get to Germany, which is in the basket?
I had returned an article on the contact form or gave up a return and wanted to ask if it would arrive or be processed because I had not yet received confirmation.
Firms pay immunization premiums and change advertising policy
While the Federal Government continues to reject proposals for a vaccine premium, companies in Austria have taken the initiative themselves and offer their employees money prizes.
Thus they are on a line with the social partners ÖGB and the Chamber of Commerce, which today called for financial incentives for vaccination.
Also, the transformation of advertising slogans into immunization calls - after a German example - should increase the willingness to use corona impressions.
He's changed into a company he's been reading about.
That doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Wait and drink tea.
It's been a year.
He obviously didn't get stuck in his old place, and he was looking for something else.
You can do the same.
And that he didn't like you at the time: no matter.
He didn't like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please accept the cancellation.
This will then be legally relevant.
I'm finishing a screenshot.

Help with First Own Campaign
Boron to the breast!
I'm just leading a group of 4 friends the adventure over the grab pass and I want my heroes to lead seamlessly into a campaign written for the players.
We play DSA 5.
The big bow is made to write the evil weights and their motivations, the individual acts invented, and now I am writing the entry time and stopping at the first encounter over my own feet.
The premise is that the heroes are supposed to bring a plant with cereals from Gratenfels into a small village near the Thuran Sea.
The next action is to be taken there.
Some miles away from the village, the heroes are going to run a group of Goblins and lure them into a backdrop.
I would like to give players the opportunity to solve the confrontation in different ways: Convincing, acting, threatening to recognize the danger early, whatever affects the players.
Group strength: 8 regular Goblins, 2 with muscles, 6 with bows and cables armed
If you don't notice, the Goblins will climb up the heroes in a caveway and fling to every three left and right bows will arm the vehicle while two with muscles stop the vehicle.
If it comes to fighting and the heroes are subject, I have two solutions
1. The heroes are all found unconsciously and then by the son of the village school, half, and healed.
The career is, of course, gone.
2. Should a defeat be irrevocable just like this half with two of his servants and comes in to help the heroes in the struggle.
The career's still there, everything's great.
How appropriate do you keep your god ex machine from solution 2?
Is the encounter too much as an entry into the adventure?
The Goblins group will later play a decisive role, so it is not just canon feed.
EDIT: wow, I didn't count on so many answers, especially not with so many great suggestions and tips.
I will guarantee many of your ideas and now have more confidence in my narratives.
I built the lamp again.
And it's stuck together again.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
That's why I'd like to send them back.
Then if you can get the feedback back, then I can pack the lamp and bring it to #PRS_ORG#.

at one time the riss was there
I'm just sitting on it.
Here the lower part was damaged, so almost the part was damaged with storage room.
Is everything then taken back or only the warehouse part?
I'm generous with Sky Sport F1
Hello, dear F1 fans, over the season, the quality on the German Sky has fallen more and more, so I want to make some air with this post.
For the first time today in the middle of the F2 race, the transmission was interrupted in order to start the F1 pre-reporting on time.
Although the delayed start and the start of the schedule were far behind the schedule, it would still have been possible to show the last ten minutes (planned) as well as the decision of the championship (!).
However, it seems that for legal reasons, the F1 has a priority and therefore has to restrict everything else, so Sky DE probably did not have a choice here.
Still stupid, especially Sky UK has transferred the race to the end.
Nevertheless, a small praise: the commentator Olivier Zwartyes has accompanied the difficult situation with the serious accident.
Then, in the F1 again, there was regular knowledge among the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so they both didn't know that you could change the tires under a red flag.
Although there was this situation in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both came to the conclusion that the tires could change the tires when there were corresponding radio statements on this topic to Hamilton.
At Sky UK and RTL, both commentators immediately knew that there was this possibility for dives.
I believe that such basic rules should be easily known when commenting on the F1 on a pay TV channel.
It is also not the first set-up rate, which is now possible or prescribed according to rules, both have simply permanent uncertainties in the subject of rules.
In general, the artistic comment style of Roos does not like it, but suggests that the taste is.
But I really like Heiko water from RTL better.
In addition, there are constant albernities that simply leave both unprofessional effects, such as ordering coffee at reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuHD" by Ralf Schumacher.
Just the latter puts a lot of anxiety in the comment that he obviously does not take this seriously.
Not least, the advertising simply takes over at Sky, in the exhaust round is Sky the only broadcaster going into the advertising, as can be heard at F1TV only the German soundtrack without comment has to come out right after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do that.
These two broadcasters in the trainings also make less advertising than Sky, and that as free-TV broadcasters.
Although you have to praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, that alone does not let me overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of the Sky Sport F1 program is also very nice and full of repetitions.
In total, Sky is really the worst German-speaking sender that transmits the F1.
Unironically, RTL makes a better job in the four races that they can still transfer.
In any case, the grandiose F1 season makes much less fun than it would be possible with a reasonable transmitter.
I'd be interested in your opinion.
On this page: #PRS_ORG# pendant light, brass and multicolored glass x 1
Hello, I have an article that should be delivered last week and which is still not delivered.
I've contacted the chat twice and nothing so far.
The First Lady told me it was sent on Monday, the second lady told me yesterday that she would check and send an e-mail and she never answered.
Hi, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12.12.19.
One of these has already shown a defect after a relatively short time (the substance has a hole in the front part of the chair).
I'm asking for support.
Fan pumps are ideally suited to provide an additional aquarium with oxygen.
It is also possible to operate a filter system via airlift.
This series is offered in 3 variants by us.
Look at the table at the end of the offer.
There you can see the performance in comparison.
If the pumps are strong enough, you can operate all the plants.
If you have a large aquarium you can use pumps with 2 or more exits so you can connect several outlets.
The MK series has one, two or four outputs, depending on the model air pump, but also offer to place an accent in the aquarium, e.g. with an air conditioning (see us at the shop) or with a decor that converts the air bubbles into a function.
Here would be a treasured silence, a muscle or something.
The MK series has a special, soundproof construction and thus ensures low operating noise.
The installation is very simple.
The fan pump is connected by means of a 4/6 mm air hose to an oven etc....and it can already run out.
The fan pump should be the same or higher as the water mirror and be applied outside.
If the fan pump is deeper than the water level, a tail valve should be placed between them.
Just cut through the air hose and put the valve in between.
This would prevent once the water would run backwards, which runs out of the pool through the pump...
If the air pump should be applied freely, you should, as well as other air pumps, be covered and protected from moisture
The MK series pumps are pure power packages that consume little energy
Even if we specify here in ebay the processing time with 3 days, it will be packed daily and the packages will be picked up here every day.
Everything is going well, it's going very fast.
We just want to prevent a little so that no one is right, just because it took a little longer.
It would be like this, not everyone has an understanding for all the employees who also work in the shipping system...of course there is no corona here.
Please do not rate bad just because the delivery is delayed, which is only based on the package services.
Of course you'd like to joke about these services, even if we say at the moment, they've damned it hard.
This is also very different regionally.
Don't be mad at anyone, stay healthy and we all hope that there are even better times.
How long does it take to order the yellow with and without arms?
Can you order the legs here in light?
Amazon founder Bezo sends astronaut daughter and moderator to the worldall
The daughter of the first American in all, a TV moderator and four other passengers have taken a short trip into space.
They were transported on Saturday by the rocket system "New Shepard" by the company Blue Origin by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The start and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of the US state of Texas.
Under a radiant blue sky, Bezos took the freshly cut astronauts in their reception after their return.
"Welcome back," said Bezos, dressed in a blue suit when he opened the Luke to the capsule.
Under the applause of friends, family members and employees of Blue Origin, the six passengers climbed out and surrounded the Amazon founders.
According to Blue Origin, they were ten minutes and 13 seconds on the way and reached a height of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of the 1961 Nasa astronaut to all flying Alan Shepard (1923-1998), after which Blue Origin's rocket system was named, and the 50-year-old TV moderator Michael Strahan were honorists of the company, who had paid four other passengers for their tickets: space engineer Dylan Taylor, Investor Evan Dick, technology contractor Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
How much they paid for their ticket, Blue Origin didn't share.
Laura Shepard Churchley recalled her father's mission after the short flight.
He has worked hard on his efforts and must do everything himself.
She just flew away like that, the 74-year-old said with a laugh.
Michael Strahan also expressed his enthusiasm.
He'd love to go back to everything again, the moderator said.
"New Shepard" flies up to 100 kilometers high
The "New Shepard" rocket system is largely automated.
The capsule separated during the flight from the rocket reached an altitude of about 100 kilometres above the earth, temporarily with no gravity, before the reusable object landed again from large parachutes.
The International Aviation Association and many other experts view the earth as a border to space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was already the third ordered all-out of Blue Origin: On the first day of July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, along with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
In the second in October, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner was the world-famous "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", as well as former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, entrepreneur Glen de Vries, and Deputy Chief of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics advocate Besos and Blue Origin to advance the business with space tourism largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard to the climate.

Someone who works in biochemistry or studied biochemistry
I'm currently studying biochemistry in the first semester and I find the field quite exciting and also not bothering myself in the laboratory (have already the inorganic chemistry practice behind me).
Of course, I had already been informed before the study about career prospects, but I also thought at the time that I would definitely like to study and be promoted.
But at the moment I have doubts, especially amusing me with my professional prospects.
On the one hand (Studycheck etc) you always hear super professional opportunities and the profession is totally sought, on the other hand you always hear from unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid places.
That's why I'd really be interested in:
1) What are you working on right now?
2) Are you satisfied with your work/content?
3) What have you studied/What training have you had?
4) Would you do all this again?
Thank you very much for your answers!
I am currently really uncertain and superior to 2022 to cancel the study and to make a training for the specialist.
If you have experience there, write the same :)
Extra stress before holidays & holidays weekend
This topic came up to me last week.
But now I had to use my long weekend to relax.
That's why it's only a date.
Not just before big holidays, like Christmas holidays, there is great stress in our business.
As it seems, there are also days before holidays plus bridge days.
It was like this: Last week was Maria Skye, which is called "Auffahrt" in Switzerland.
On Friday, most people and businesses make a bridge day, which is therefore semi-official.
Last week there was a long four-day weekend in the house.
So what happened last week?
All over the stress.
Lauter e-mails, which had to leave before departure, order here order there, everything *unconditional* before the long weekend.
Because... I because?
Because "next week then" sounds like so much time and that shouldn't be?
Or because people want to do as much in a short week as in a normal week?
Not only did I get stressed on Wednesday, but I also got very excited.
What is this self-reliance for holidays?
Then why do we still have a celebration if we cannot afford it properly?
The stress came not from the top, the colleagues were all so independent.
My question is simple: Are we the Swiss?
Is this our reformed-evangelical way?
Or do you know that in the north too?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Turkish home - but still has no gifts.
"It's beautiful, even if there's no snow in Erfurt, then you just drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringia forest," said the actress and singer Hit Radio FPH.
She will agree to the feast by backing up and bastele with her son.
"I love that," said Catterfeld.
Until the special days, however, they still have something to do: "For the first time I have no gifts, I have to finally get rid of them."
NECTON-BIO supports a smooth running of the mouses and re-training.
NECTON bio contains all vital vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 μg of biotin/kg.
NECTON-BIO gives the bird a smooth and shiny feeder.
The majority of poultry damage is due solely to nutritional defects.
Since the feed consists of a protein-containing substance, a particularly rich and balanced diet of the bird is a prerequisite for the formation of an unfavourable poultry.
For a functional metabolism, the daily food must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
Most of the animal losses occurring during the mice are based on poor or unbalanced protein intake and/or inadequate supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NECTON bio, the adverse proportion of amino acids in most plant feed products is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
No other vitamin preparation should be administered during the administration of NECTON-bio.
NECTON bio is cold water-soluble and can be administered simply via drinking water or soft feed.
Thank you very much. I found it.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work
DDR working model Altbau E-Lock E 95 03 DRG/ DR, which was in use in Schlesien and middle Germany, the very rare lock is probably from the model track conversion proposal ME Heft 11/1968, used with track and missing parts see photos, function good, The E 95 series is a heavy-duty electric locomotive of the German Reichsbahn Society (DRG) designed for the traction of heavy coal trains in the Schlesian network, possibly also from the small company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is located in the DB Museum Hall (Saale) and we are working in an operational way
The German Reichsbahn Company had in 1924 commissioned the AEG to submit proposals for an electric locomotive that could be able to carry 2,200 tonnes of coal trains and 530 tonnes of passenger trains at 45 km/h.
At maximum speed, 65 km/h were required.
Thus, in March 1926, the DRG determined the delivery as 1Co+Co1' locomotive with a battery drive AEG with the delivery of the mechanical part, the Siemens vacuum cleaners with the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered which received the operating numbers E 95 01-06.
They all survived World War II and then returned to the territory of the later DDR.
In 1946 the locomotives arrived in the Soviet Union as a repair tool.
They returned to Germany until November 1952.
The Reichsbahnau improvement plant Dessau has found the value of processing of all six locomotives.
[4] The three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were developed in 1959, while the other machines served as spare parts.
The E 04, E 44 and E 94 were first built up in larger numbers.
Only when E 94 was to be considered that the number of processing could not be increased further, E 95 fell into the focus of processing.
[4]The locomotives were first stationed in the Leipzig-Wahren railway station.
They arrived at Halle P in 1960.
They were used in their own circuit plan before coal trains from the hostage valley towards Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
The complicated control of locomotives proved problematic with increasing age.
This has often been the case in the case of switch-actions.
Then the Beimann with Hammer and Holzkeil on this locomotive had to re-open the shield during the ride.
The damage to the motors often occurred and led to monthly accidents in the locomotive.
[5] Since sufficient new locomotives were available at the end of the 1960s and a clear extension of the electrical operation was not planned at that time, the train was able to abandon old locomotives and most split types, leaving E 95 out of service.
In addition, the Deutsche Reichsbahn wanted to occupy electric locomotives only once more, which would have caused a problem in the train operation due to the difficulties mentioned above with the machines and the conditions of vision of the driver.
[5] After leaving E 95 02 and E 95 03 in mid-1969, they followed the E 95 01, which left the service on 5 October 1970.
Therefore, the proposed new name 255 001 was never used.
Until the E 95 02, all locomotives were destroyed.
The E 95 02 was installed as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a soft heating system at Halle Main Station.
It took some time to convince those responsible at the Reichsbahn that the E 95 was a museum locomotive.
In 1979 the first external reprocessing of locomotives started with the aim of presenting them to a vehicle show at RAW Dessau.
[5] She has since belonged to the Dresden Transport Museum as a non-operable museum locomotive.
In 1986 the internal completion of the locomotives was completed.
In the DB Museum Hall (Saale) the locomotive is maintained.
Since 1995, employees of the Bw Halle P Tradition Community have been working on the operational processing of locomotives.
In April 2015, the locomotive could be presented for the first time at an exhibition in the Museum-Bw Arnstadt with new interior and exterior painting, with the transformers being checked and five engines capable of operating.
-The locomotives were in use until 1945 on the Schlesi mountain track and the drifting sideways, where they proved to be due to their reliable drive and low maintenance effort.
In February 1945 the machines were converted to the medium German network in Leipzig.
Main area of use was first Schlesien

Yes, the F parts are
I got a bed from you.
However, there were problems with a part.
The middle bar is held by two feet. Unfortunately these are too narrow and the bar cannot be mounted on the feet.
What are we doing now?
I can't build the bed.
The center bar is held by two feet, these are unfortunately produced incorrectly.
The centre bar does not fit into the intended holding.
So I'll get a new one.
When will they be sent forth?
No, no, no, no, no.
That is, according to the assembly instructions the right of form, they were just too narrow
But that doesn't matter.
Main thing they fulfill their purpose
They're not flat with me.
Could I get this?
Hello #NAME#, shall I explain the problem to you again?
Housing fire with two slight injuries and high damage
Two people were easily injured in a fire in a dwelling in Oberbayern.
In addition, an estimated damage has occurred in the sixth euro area, as reported by the police on Sunday.
The fire had probably spread from a carport to the nearby residential house in Kinsau (Lech Landsberg County).
Two residents were brought to the hospital on Sunday with light smoke poisoning.
The exact question of fire was not known at first, but the police did not come out of a deliberate fire.
The Kripo Fürstenfeldbruck has undertaken further investigations.
But it will come much later.
And I have to pay shipping again.
To unlock fake news - Biontech-CEO published Impf photo
Uğur Šahin published on the social network "LinkedIn" a photo of his first vaccination at the beginning of 2021
Bientech-Chief Uğur Şahin had not yet made public his immunization status.
Now the company published a photo showing its corona impression.
The illness of a friend moved him to do so, Shahin told him.
The CEO and co-founder of Bientech, Uğur Şahin, published a photo showing how he received a vaccine against the Corona virus.
In the social media there was false information that I was allegedly not vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I have received 3 doses of the Biontech Pfizer Implant," Šahin wrote on Friday in an article in the network "LinkedIn".
"For a few months, friends have forced me to post a photo of me that I will be vaccinated against these false rumors."
So far, he has rejected this because communication should not revolve around him.
But a call last week changed his opinion: "I was deeply distressed when I learned that an old school friend of mine was fighting for his life.
He has been fighting a severe covid-19 disease and has been on a beat for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not vaccinated, Shahin continued.
He didn't ask for the reasons.
"The most common cause, however, seems to be fear, which is often cut by misinformation and suspicion."
Fear can only be overcome by facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
On the Internet an interview with the German Welle, in which Uğur Şahin says he is not vaccinated.
However, the video was produced in December 2020, as did the Deutsche Welle itself.
"I am not legally allowed to receive the vaccine itself at this time," Shahin said at that time.
There is a priority in Germany in the vaccination of the vaccine.
Meanwhile, the prioritisation has been lifted for a long time - and the Biontech Chief has been allowed to improvise himself three times according to appropriate data.
Fire in a power plant: tens of thousands of people without electricity
In several municipalities in Nordrhein-Westfalen the light went out on Friday evening: no electricity left and in many cases no heating.
A fire had set up a circuit assembly station.
After a fire with severe damage in a power station, tens of thousands of people in the Rhine-Sieg-Kreis in North Rhine-Westphalia have to leave for about 24 hours without electricity.
On the day of the fire, 41,000 affected residents and residents in several municipalities went out to light.
The supplier Westnetz reported that many emergency power units were in operation on Saturday until the large-scale disruption could finally be completely repaired at late evening.
Firefighters and assistants of THW provided support in the municipalities.
The authorities offered support places in schools and called for neighbourhood assistance.
The provider thanked the victims for their patience and the helpers for their use.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We also thank the affected municipalities, the circle, the firearms and the THW for their tireless use," said the head of the area of primary technology, Florian Witt, in a statement on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damage will take place for a few more days, as the Westnetz monteurs were able to take some leads only temporarily back into operation at first, he explained.
A technical defect led to the fire according to company information.
Power is running again
On Friday at 7.15 p.m. the fire broke out on Friday, according to Westnetz, in the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid station, parts of the 10,000-volt switch system were badly damaged.
There are heavy cleaning and repair work required.
In parallel, a connection to a 30,000 volt voltage level has been created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is back.
Since Saturday 6 p.m., more than 21,000 people in Much and Rupichterrot have had electricity again.
Another 20,000 inhabitants of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid have been gradually switched on from 21.30 a.m. to 21.30 a.m.
Since 23.15 p.m., the last electricity has been affected by the outcome.
Over 80 montre von Westnetz and partner companies have been in use.
After the construction of an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon, the authorities also called for neighbourhood aid.
"It is important now that citizens and citizens in their neighborhood care for older or lonely people and communicate with local firearms when help is needed," said Land Council Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
In the construction and operation of emergency power units, mainly the residents of old houses were focused.
In addition, temporary facilities have been established in schools according to the authorities for those people who have not been able to provide themselves or who need power-dependent medical devices or who are referred to medical care.
Good day!
Unfortunately, the roof is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy those with you and pay for them in euro?
It's the day cover #PRS_ORG# in blue.
I hope you also have a nice day and please stay healthy
But I can't mount this under the table.
It's a custom #NAME#.
There are 3 executions.
We wanted those with tablet diameters from #NUMBER#
we got 155cm diameter.
Today my #PRS_ORG# came in, but I can't move it in and therefore shorten it.
Can you help me out there?
Otherwise, I had to send her back, because otherwise she's not suitable for the purpose.
I'd be glad to hear from you.
Yeah, that's really easier!
Then let's do it!
Send me the return card by mail?
The repair is now completed.
I've already tried this before.
Before the purchase, however, I had not relaunched the e-#PRS_ORG#.
Shall I do it now?
I find such a low credit almost unscrupulous.
That's why we don't agree.
Nordic Combination: Combined Riiber Wins
The German Nordic Combiners Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmidt are printed on the floor at the World Cup in the Estonian Otepää.

When will the money be returned to my account?
Yes we both re-made and use the version 4.5...
Maybe they've heard more often of problems.
Having bought a book directly with my #PRS_ORG#, it also seems to be out of it.
As soon as I want to open it, the message comes up!
This document could not be opened.

I have to work in the meantime!
In order for the colouring order to be uniform and clean, you should clean the components with some soap water from dust, fat and fingerprints, wash and dry with clear water.
Before you bring the brush the first time with a new color on the model, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the later visible inside of the components or on a yogurt cup.
The first line on the building block
Draw the brush evenly next to the stroke.
A slight overlap of the colour layers later ensures an even area.
Avoid quick and clear with the brush.
This creates unrealistically effective areas.
A model is not a gardening plant.
Start with the bright colors.
The darkness could appear later.
Metal tones and metal tones come to a close with a separate brush.
Otherwise, it can come to unbeautiful metal locks when mixed with normal colors.
Let the painted parts dry for a day before you crush them.
Originally reliable appearances reach the models through the Decals or drawings.
From high-level signs on aircraft with ship names to zoos and signs in car models: The Decals give the model the last slip.
Bring the Decals in the right order as long as the components are still good.
An aeroplane cockpit can be attached or easier before it is built into the ramp.
Even more important than the right tool such as scars, brushets and toothbrushs are at sticky time, patience and a quiet hand.
Cut out each needed Decal individually and lay it straight to you.
Decals are also called water slide images, because you soon moisturize their back with water until the carrier's paper gets dark by the nose.
Then drag the image just a small piece of paper and place the piece on the appropriate place on the model (which you have also moistened before).
While you hold the Decal on the model with a tool, you pull the carrier paper aside.
Attention: Always check if the image is right before you shake it completely from the paper, so that it does not stick on the finger, scratch or even shake.
Swallow excess water with a budget.
Not suitable for children under 3 years of age
I can only open a book in a short time, as soon as I look for something else, then I don't read the book anymore and I have to log out and log in and reload the book and search for the place I have read.
I've already communicated with you on Saturday.
Do I get this by email?
Also for all 3 packages?
Because the lamp came to me in 3 individual packages
Thank you very much anyway!
Then I'll buy somewhere as soon as the money is back.
But do I get it back without any problem?
Child Care at PKV / What is an "insurance case"?
Hello, together.
We have been in child care for some time now when it comes to accounting with the PCV, this is suddenly over.
The line after:
We had applied for the children's walk in front of the PKV and received the commitment over 3 attempts.
The tests have been limited in most ways (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to successful pregnancy and childbirth and was calculated with the PCV.
Some time later, we tried to get a second child, and we did 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but they still didn't calculate with the PCV.
We once again applied for the acquisition of costs at the PKV and received 3 further attempts.
After some further tests (we have performed more tests than promised, logically counting the most expensive with the PCV) we settled the calculations at the PCV and got the bad surprise: instead of 5 trials (2+3) the PCV wants to return only 3 trials.
Reason: With the pregnancy/birth, the remaining 2 trials of the first commitment fall.
The second child wish is a new insurance case.
However, according to the General Assembly, "The insurance case begins with healthcare treatment, it ends when treatment needs no longer exist."
The questions to the experts in the round here:
* Who here has the right to replace the PKV (only 3 attempts are made) or we (is to replace 5 attempts)?
* Should the PKV indicate in the commitments that another attempt is due to occur with a birth?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
The infertility (conditionally by closed conductors) is not healed by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here would give your opinion.
Thank you so much for your help!
Can you send me the three variants by email and tell me how I can best reach them again?
All right.
We won't order any more of them.
If they add the sales of me and my friend #NAME# (the same address), they have obviously lost a good customer.
They may wish to pass this on to their manager.
This is not competitive.
Yesterday the colleague told me that the refund was due and now tell me that I have to send the thing back.
Well, I guess I can't do anything to make the comodore completely disturbed.
Please see in the screenshot what the colleague wrote
There is clear and clear that the refund has been made and I still have not received a refund for #PRS_ORG#
You can tell her manager that they've lost two family customers now.
My friend also ordered various furniture for our apartment over his account.
We're not gonna do that anymore.
No, the defect only occurred after a few months.
An office chair must withstand normal use.
Otherwise, they may not sell him as an office chair.
No matter what, the guarantee is valid for 24 months.
No, it's not possible for me to get another type of packaging.
I'm going to tear down the cabinet and make it available to the transport company.
Good day, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products will be applied for with additional hackers, but unfortunately we cannot find them with you.
Can they help?
Week Theme: The Best Low Budget Films
What is exactly a low-budget film, there is no general definition with precise budget limits.
Wikipedia has the following to say:
>A **low-budget film** or **low-budget motion** is a motion picture shot with little to no founding from a major movie studio or private investor.
In the network you can find many lists of low-budget films, such as on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know her interesting representatives of this category?
What's wrong with you?
And maybe you don't like it at all?
I am a very good customer of you, have already set up 2 apartments completely with your furniture.
He wanted to ask the best price for the grey leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has now been extended again, is it also reliable?
Thank you very much.
With friendly greetings
If there's no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30 minutes, it's not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes at the waiting position...I'll give it up soon because it just doesn't work here.
Hello
"Half Victory" against Belarus with high costs for the EU
In conflict with the Belarusian regime, the EU can announce a "half victory" to political expert Raphael Bossong.
However, the costs were very high and meant massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees to Belarus" border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
Sustainablely, the EU has not resolved the confrontation, the researchers of the Berlin Foundation for Science and Policy (SWP) explained.
This state of fluctuation - Belarus is not very small, but the EU feels as a winner - is probably going on for a while.
The treatment of people at the border was not in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong said.
There is apparently an "increasing normalisation of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole has not decided to do so, this is at the expense of fundamental rights.
This development also weakens cohesion in the Union.
"It obviously cannot be implemented if a Member State is in charge of doing its thing," as it is now, Poland, which does not even allow Frontex to access the border.
In addition, the EU paid another price for its policy at the border with Belarus, says Bossong: a principle agreement on asylum policy will be hampered as the line "frontier protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
Rehearsal of cross-border attempts
According to Poland's border guard, migrants have again tried to reach out to Belarus in Polish territory.
55 migrants were arrested on Sunday night and brought back to the border, said a spokesperson of the Authority on Sunday.
The Polish officials were thrown with stones to the scene near Czeremsza by the migrants.
According to the report, a soldier was met in the face and had to be provided medically by a medical doctor.
In total, the border guard registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
Already on the Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the barriers.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan had crossed or attempted to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months.
The EU proposes Alexander Lukaschenko as the power-holder in Minsk to have her angeled with a view to joining the EU.
Poland and Lithuania rowed press reports according to border sections.
The EU punished Belarus and threatened to bring migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU Commissioners traveled to people's countries of origin to stop their departure.
The most effective element of the EU's response was the pressure on the airlines, Bossong said.
"There the EU has thrown its market power into the scales and has demonstrated its determination to operate with hard tapes and extraterritorial sanctions".
Minsk must also take into account domestic costs.
The Belarusian society is not likely to insist that the security system regularly closes thousands of people across the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial formula 1 finale
Max steps should have been taken in Mercedes' view of two rules breaks during the race.
Abu Dhabi - Following the controversial formula 1 finale of Abu Dhabi, Mercedes challenged.
The silver arrows are just as likely to be two rule breaks in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest refers to a alleged violation of Max's refuges in the Red Bull in the last safety car phase, when he should have been regularly overpowered.
A second objection was put to the evaluation at the end of the race.
In Mercedes' view, the protocol was not followed regularly.
On the last round of Lewis Hamilton was still caught in Mercedes and was tied to his first Formula 1 title.
The manoeuvre took place shortly after the end of a safety-car phase in which the Netherlands had caught up with the car running before it.
I'll check it out.
I'm talking to the bank and I'm back with you.
Thank you for the support

But I'm sorry just because he says he's not an anti-Semitic.
It's like if an outlaw says he's got nothing against aliens.
Your i will not be given it both.
But colleagues are constantly reproducing any anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself, you should just let it be complete.
Yeah, then you're just as serious as your colleague.
Those who seriously question Evolution in principle are simply completely solved.
For my part, a God has brought this whole thing into operation.
But as soon as you're a creationist, you have to believe that the earth is 10,000 years old and science only makes sense.
And that makes you an enemy of science and not any more serious as a colleague.
In order to obtain an optimal field of vision, the lupe should be brought as close to the eye as possible.
The specially aplanatic-aromatic lens system allows you to use the lupe and colourless to the edge area.
Often loops are marked with magnifying indications.
However, these data only apply to precisely defined conditions that rarely meet the conditions of use.
In order to be able to use your lupe optimally, please note the instructions in the table "Technical data" (see package leaflet).
On the lens surfaces of all optical devices – i.e. also in the case of injection loops – light flexes are created.
These reflections are significantly reduced by an anti-reflex coating.
In compliance with the optimal conditions of use - Lupe close to the eye - mirrors on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.

Dance sale in Schönwolde: In the municipality of Krembz women look out for the Christmas trees
Farmwirt Frank Diets has already experienced such a situation in the field of dentistry.
One day a man should even be driving home without his partner because they couldn't agree.
Every year, he plants a good 2000 pieces for it.
The 56-year-old has already experienced such a situation.
That always makes Christmas fun, he says.
What about the voucher?
Or am I gone as a customer?!
Anyway, I've got a defective delivery and now I've paid the full price for it.
Then I'll evaluate that as well!
We do not need to discuss the better court here, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating spear.
So they both have their names.
In German, an equivalent might be something like the "Dreher", which doesn't sound so good at much.
Problems with glass fibers + Devolo DLan/Magic
We've had a new glass fibre connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I now have problems building up a stable Wifi network.
Previously I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which has received and released up to a few randoms of 50 Mbit.
The new fiber optic connector sends 500 Mb to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLan module attached to the FritzBox.
However, the other DLan module, which sends the Wifi, is no longer the full 500, but the more I remove myself from the house with the module, the less it comes (uses a sticker that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
This leads to the fact that the Internet with the new fibre connection is now even slower on the first floor than before (\~45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but there were similar losses.
Could anyone explain to me why with glass fibers so much internet speed over the power line is "losed"?
And is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely important to put the LAN cable in the house.
I'm really desperate, why I've created an extra account here.
That's why I'd be more excited about an answer.
When it's time to change the giro account
Who would have thought now would have peace with the giro accounts for the first time, is deceived.
While many banks have used the fall to confirm their past tax increases with all kinds of tricks from their customers, the free amounts for negative increases continue to fall.
For example, the Deutsche Bank was considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros.
Now she's just half the amount and she's even quartered for day money.
In a first step, the limit was reduced only for customers of the Group’s Postbank – at 50,000 euros in Giro and Investment Accounts and at 25 000 euros in Day Money Accounts.
In the meantime, however, these lower amounts apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as confirmed by a speaker on request.
And not only for new contracts, but also for "new individual agreements with existing customers".
The Commerzbank was already down to a limit of 50,000 euros, which still applies, as was the case with ING Germany.
The direct bank DKB, who was just popular with cost-conscious customers, has reduced the free amounts in two stages, first to EUR 50,000, and now to EUR 25,000.
At the same time, more than 100 banks now have EUR 25,000 or less of the Verivox Internet Portal.
The Sparda Bank Berlin has also arrived at 25,000 euros: however, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centres which first received legal redress from the Landgericht Berlin.
Now the banks are already discussing whether the institutions should be able to provide returns - in the event that the higher authorities also have to explain the negative increases in principle for unacceptable and have to be repaid to millions of banks.

Jennifer Aniston employs a whole beauty army
She's officially at the top of Hollywood.
But your life is like a mountain and valley.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was elected by the US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter" as the most influential woman of the year.
For those who did the "Friends" reunition in 2021 and the continuation of their series "The Morning Show" furore, this success is primarily the result of much discipline and work.
A whole army of assistants, stylists and trainers is taking care of their appearance.
However, according to Aniston, she liked a chip on the day (yes, read correctly: a ONE chip from the bush).
The fact that you're still attracted to the hearts of the female and male fans is, in fact, a miracle.
Maybe because she just has Pech with the happiness - and still is looking for the great love.
And the baby wish has been removed from the list.
Before she was constantly asked when she would become a mother.
That hurt her.
People who asked that question have no idea what's personally off with me, medically, why I can't.
It was really hurtful.
It remains to be hoped that success and glory will also be made happy.
Invalid end of career: queens must give up
Kimi Queen's separation from Formula 1 was even quieter than thought.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finne pulled out the gloves and removed the sweat from the chair.
That's it.
After a vehicle failure and a slight taperation, Räikkonen had to stop his Alpha Romeo at the great price of Abu Dhabi after not even half the distance.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, which "Iceman" finished his career in the Royal Motorsport class.
His wife Minttu and the two children also traveled to the United Arab Emirates.
The greatest success of Räikkön was the victory of the 2007 World Cup in Ferrari.
He won 21 Grand-Prix win, started 18 times from the pole and arrived 103 times on the podium. dpa
Friedrich wins 60th World Cup - Nolte wins in the twins - Sport
The brand of the Norwegian Biathlet Ole Einar Björdalen with 94 successes is the goal of the Bobpilot.
"I calculated it once, I had to win nine and a half victory per season, then I could make it up to Cortina 2026," said the double Olympic winner of BSC Oberbärenburg, who recorded two successes in the Winterberg race in two days.
First on Saturday, he refused to attack Johannes Lochner for five hundred years, in which he drove from rank three to one.
Then he changed something at the material setting and went out on Sunday with 0.30 seconds.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Hall), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Hall), he passed through the British Brad Hall.
The third became the Austrian Benjamin Maier.
"We have been at greater risk today and have been rewarded," said Friedrich, who also imported his 22nd victory into the series.
The Berchtesgaden Johannes Lochner, who runs for Stuttgart, came to the square two times before this time to rank five.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Fäilnbach landed after rank four in the first race eight in place.
"If I knew what else he was doing, then I would do it," Lochner said.
Nolte with home victory - podium for Jamanka
Among the women, Laura Nolte won the third season in the twins.
After arriving in Monobob on Monday only for the fourth place, she joined the World Cup in German three-time success.
Mariama Jamanka from the BRC Thuringia came with Germany's fastest sprinterin, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen, on rank two.
In addition to her Olympia qualification, she booked the first basement in this winter.
The Wiesbadener Kim Kalicki landed with Leonie Fiebig in place three.
For me it was supercool, first basement in the world Cup, I'm superhappy that Mariama is taking me.
I'm so excited about the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the beginning, but today's starting times were okay," Burghardt said and stressed: "It's not just a push, it's also a huge deal to do about it."
Jamanka was a little upset about the not quite error-free rides, but he said, "It's going in the right direction".
I already had the blanket in my basket and could buy it now!!!!
What am I supposed to do?
I just didn't get it and therefore I can't redeem it.
Because of Corona last year, I had quite different problems and never had time for it.
And now he called it running away which made me very angry.
Look in the chat it was about the Asare seat bank.
I want to give it back and then order again as it is just reduced :)
Why is the shipment only started on 16.3.?
There was nothing of such long delivery time on your website
No until I tip on it comes an extra field with the message
I was taken off yesterday from your colleague.
Why is this a problem today?
I also sent you pictures of the wrong being delivered.
But we would still like the Regal module, even if it is a new one.
And don't cancel the whole order.
Just this day, just this week, just until XY...
Hello, great girls and girls and women,
I've got some things I just want to write and maybe the one or the other goes like this...
I am 24, I have kPTBS, full-time student and Hundema - once aside from my dog's crying or going to the kindergarten, he's actually 1 to 1 my child.
My friend (since 6J together) is sick, a second-degree burn has been on Monday and has been depressed for years (but now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him, we had a lot of cough and it was nice.
I helped him with the shower (because hand is in association with wg combustion).
It's cooled up and we're seeing less (1-2x week) what makes me very comfortable with my needs for affection and love.
My dogkind just had stomach pain, I cooked for him, and now he's in his Kuschel cover, and he's a little relaxed after I was there with the heat lamp and ironing for him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she's just gone for a month.
Now there is still housework on us, which of course we share.
But cooking yourself is just a lot of work for me...
My PTBS disease is just well-adjusted, I'm half-treated and I'm right.
Not good, but I'm coming straight and I'm almost symptomatic.
My union just requires a lot (for me), tomorrow at 3 p.m. I have done a written test for which I have not done anything yet and over-morning anatomy hour for which I should at least prepare something.
And next week I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes next is in my calendar and not in my head because there is no room.
So my week goes like this: just until tomorrow, then it's weekend.
But then everything goes on?
Just until the birthday.
Just until the start of the holiday.
Just until the weekend.
Just until...
And so it goes on forever.
I think I'm just so stressed that I need these spiritual points because otherwise I'll pack it down.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic", but otherwise I can't...
Is that how you feel?
Honestly, I'm infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
I can't really say that in words.
I don't know if I would have survived my kptbs.
I think this also has something to do with mental load of women, and that's why I thought I'd find safe companions here...
I wish you at least one more relaxing evening, the week is almost done!
I have received my order today, unfortunately, the whole other color plus surface is scratched and table bones have print.
At the first delivery, the color was exactly the same as on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we change the table now, will I get another color or how?
The email to cancel was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#.
For the rest of the time.
But she wasn't confirmed.
Once again, I found in school that many religious teachers do not believe in God and that it is only another matter for them, such as math or geography.
For me, this was always a bit strange, perhaps because I was raised Christian and I always believed in something like that.
How are you doing?
You may also be able to tell from work and study colleagues about different attitudes.
In principle, I understand the difference between private and professional and it is sensible to separate.
Is there a teaching plan, etc.
But it was also rare to have a physical teacher who did not believe in the theory of relativity.
What makes one want to teach religion if one does not believe it?
Is culture true or something?
Hope your question isn't too private.
Can't it be changed or not?Please write it in English I also understand well
It's been a very long time, then I'd look at it.
It's good, thanks.
I'll wait until the beginning of next week for a re-announcement.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Please help us with film search
Hello, dear people.
I'm looking for a movie from my childhood (b. 24).
I think it's been a movie for young people.
There are two time axes (or parallel worlds) in the film.
One of the modern (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the kingdom of the dead) (not quite sure).
Because I can't describe it any more in the real world, there's a young woman.
And in the kingdom of the dead a young soldier (like those soldiers from the battle of the Caribbean).
For some reason the paths cross and there is an action.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the kingdom of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this kingdom to live myself.
The transition is I think the soldier's graveyard too.
At the end of the day, both soldiers are fighting each other.
If that's what I'm saying, I'm grateful for every answer.
Our little one slept on the stomach from week 1 to week.
Fixed forward: still alive :D
Relax.
Such a child looks a lot more like you think.
Make sure everything is all right around, no pets, often go in and look, but no minutes of monitoring.
That makes you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good Matratze.
No kisses.
Axo and we didn't have a sleeping bag, but we've always had a roof.
Watch your child when it sleeps.
Does it turn its head to the side?
Can it get out of the belly?
Or is it in front of the face directly in the mattress?
You can decide if everything's okay.
We've all grown up, and when my husband came into the world, it was like walking and giving that you put the kids on the belly to sleep.
Besides, we are already "student" with you and have already bought a lot of articles
But why do you offer me only 20EUR?
Hello, I already wrote with a colleague of yours yesterday and so far no feedback.
It's about my wardrobe that arrived yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC ID#).
The right drawer doesn't fit into the cabinet.
Please contact me as soon as possible.
The cabinet is currently not to be used.
To make it quite clear.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know for sure, not everything can be kept.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV.
It is only simple that the policy of this channel is currently under all the salt.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but at the same time go on a big bed tour.
It was said to be an "independent" internet channel.
Citat Arno: You want to be "no running paint column".
What is it?
A 0815 publisher trying to bring his BilloMerch to the Elitefan.
And then we still have Marahs Do's & Don's.
Those of course apply to everyone except Simon and Etienne.
Of course, they can continue to affect people.
A krogman who is totally lacking in empathy and at the cost of the action with the exploded rooms tries to make ash.
How can you find this?
Great if you like it, I think it's scary.
I ask for a rueckruf, since my delivered wooden defect was made.

Kirschkern cushions are a traditional homeware for well-being heat applications, as Kirschkerne heat can be taken very well and re-dosed.
The removable inner cushion can easily be heated in the microwave or in the oven.
The soft reference makes the application particularly pleasant so that the little ones feel safe, even if they are not doing so well.
The Kirschkern box with reference is suitable for the following applications as heat storage only:
Before heating the kiss, check on unusual smell, floor or flakes and immediately dispose of in the presence.
Please remove the inner cushion from the connection before heating!
In the microwave at max. 300 Watt for a maximum of 2 minutes (Please note details of the microwave manufacturer!)
Distribute the heat evenly in the kiss immediately after heating!
Then put the inside cushion back in the connection.
In the first heatings, the surface may have a slight moisture formation, but disappears in repeated applications.
Keep up to date with the specified heating instructions, as longer times or higher energy performance may cause damage (flaming and combustion risk!).
Before heating the kiss in the microwave, check that a harvest of cereal products is allowed in the manufacturer’s instructions for use.
After the heated inside cushions have been brought back into contact, check the temperature of the pillow for babys (max. 43 °C) on your wrist!
Do not use the kiss in acute and chronic, inflammatory or febrile conditions, circular pain, fresh haematomas, blood clots and open wounds, as well as in people with reduced pain.

Is the battery broken?
Yesterday evening my laptop (thinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer loaded by my network share.
I bought this again about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought a net share alone was enough for the operation.
The battery is empty and the laptop does not start any longer despite the embedded network part.
After that, I've developed the battery, but there's nothing here either.
Do you want any ideas?
A new battery is ordered, but why can't I use the laptop in network operation?
Was there anything else that broke?
Thank you so much for your help!
I want to deliver the #PRS_ORG# to the room.
How can I book this?
I'm interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
But don't know how high the seat is....
Often on tour and yet much equipment?
With the Everyday V2 Backpack of Peak Design no problem!
20 litres of fixtures also swallow larger photo equipment without any problems that can be safely stolen using the polished FlexFold parts.
And what you still need in everyday life remains well organized and separate from the photo equipment thanks to practical access in the individually configurable interior.
With the "Update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series is still presented in a new look.
The cool, minimalistic design has literally in it - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack and yet provide quick access to photo equipment in seconds.
This works with two options: Once conventionally via the lid that can be closed with the MagLatch locking system, an excellent thought-based solution for effective protection that has already proved itself at the Messenger Bags.
There is a metal lock hook with suitable anchor bars on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has considered various "fills": there are 4 anchor bars, permanently destroyed in which the closing hooks can be trapped.
If the backpack is full, you just take the top bar, it's rather empty, a deeper one.
Pendant closures and hooks are also magnetic.
In this way the backpack can also be safely closed without fastening the hook.
The second option distinguishes the Everyday Backpack as well as the basics of other, photo backpacks: In addition to the lid, there is still a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the greatest disadvantage of traditional backpacks with access from above - you don't have to wander through the contents anymore!
At the same time, this smarter detail increases the everyday functionality of the backpack: If you include not only your photo equipment, but also everyday items or luggage.
In the Everyday Backpack, you can individually configure the interior space (more below) and then separate the two without problems - and access it independently through the two side openings.
In addition, you can pull the backpack from the right side in front of the body, for example, to access the camera equipment in the right main time, while the everyday things remain safe in the left half of the backpack and do not come between.
Comfortable, uncomplicated adjustable straps help.
And since the outer lid of the backpack is also made entirely of 100 % recycled, weatherproof nylon, the content will remain dry even if it is to go to Scotland in the autumn.
Unfortunately, I am looking forward to the email from her support.
#NAME# yesterday has me an e-mail confirming the mandate of

So far, I haven't received a message.
I'm asking for an immediate settlement.
I am already writing with the third support employee, with no one else than the promise that I will receive an e-mail as confirmation.
This is about sending back the wrong custom #NAME#
Is it to be seen when the cabinet could be returned?
Keeping him like this is no option for me...
It works.

Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. when is the item delivered?
Ordering and payment was on 12.1.21.
I was delivered a completely different lamp than I ordered
Please call me.
If you extend the voucher to me, I will give up a larger order at the same time, but I have always kept the damaged piece of furniture and not sent it back.
And that last year was different from the thought I couldn't deny, and I just couldn't redeem and clarify it.
But I have the damage as a customer and I don't accept it like that.
Rotating brake discs are designed to assess the requirements of the dynamic driver, the reliability and safety of the brake even under difficult conditions.
Rotating brake discs are manufactured from Guss and then mechanically processed (boiled and cut).
All finished discs are produced in short series according to individual technical characteristics, which are for certain discs and patterns.
On the basis of the individual technical drawing, a special production program is created which is directed by selecting the disc according to the characteristics of the original assembly.
This ensures high comfort and brake efficiency.
Additional openings increase the efficiency of cooling the disc, while the fronts improve the cleaning of brake discs and brake linings.
The aesthetic properties of our built-in drives underline the character of each car by attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the town where an unexpected event marked the history of the west coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered lightbrokes in the water at the southern fork of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery secret, the news spread rapidly and released the so-called "California Gold Rush" from '49.
Thousands came from near and far and made Coloma one of the fast growing and flourishing cities of the country.
Areas were hidden, tents were destroyed, and saloons and hotels were created almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the country's wealth.
For many it was called "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or Bankrott)!
In this game you are a pioneer who is looking for and wants to make a name.
You will search for gold, recruit workers, drive horses together and build companies.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding rivers and adjacent areas.
You're not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to overcome your pioneer colleagues so you can't go along with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast-paced strategy game with many ways to win.
At the same time, you choose your actions, you have to manage your resources and create a table that "works more and more for you" (so-called "Engine Building").
The buildings on your table allow you to become more efficient, receive additional actions or apply rules to your favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridges, you can develop your individual game style with fine adjustments.
Coloma plays over a period of three years from 1848 (the year in which the gold was discovered in Coloma), over 1849 (the year in which California Gold Rush) until 1850 (the year in which California achieved official statehood).
One year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players will choose a location on the game plan secretly and at the same time, where they can perform actions.
Then their selection is discovered and they place their pioneers in the right places.
If a location has most pioneers, it gets a lock!
This disables half of the location - reducing possible actions there.
Then the players perform alternate actions, such as winning resources, moving cars, setting up tents, searching for rivers, building bridges, opening up shops and positioning revolvers.
When all the actions have been completed, the pioneers will return.
At the beginning of each round, the sprinkler turns to a new location and changes the available actions.
This goes on for so long until the sprinkler moves five times, so each location has been covered once and the year ends.
There is a shooting in which players Coloma must defend themselves against an attack of angry bandits.
If the players have contributed enough revolvers and the bandits are numerous, they will receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they receive less rewards or end up in the cemetery.
The game ends after the third shooting, then the final evaluation takes place.
The player wins with most winning points!

"Why children are not tyrants" Doku, ARD Mediaathek
CW mental violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentation has appeared in my Twitter timeline today, and I have watched it at the same time.
>Children's psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a welcome guest in talk shows and holds lectures across Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children Become Tyrans" (2008), he released a fierce educational debate.
Former patient:Interns and educators are now raising serious objections against him.
Please be careful, the film is hard to bear.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
Our parents and other responsible people can never, never, never! go to power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child space for its development and make the framework for the child as large as it is in the situation meaningful and possible.
Brr, I'm still being shot.
Holetcheck: Countries advise on discharge of the test obligation for three times vaccinated
At its next meeting, the Ministers of Health of the countries would like to decide on a federal failure of the test obligation for three times the vaccine.
"We countries quickly need clarity, whether and from when three times the test obligation can occur," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), president of the Health Minister's conference, "Image on Sunday".
The drop of 2G plus for three times immunized is "not only medically meaningful, but also provides an additional immunization," said Holettschek.
Federal Minister of Health Karl Lauterbach (SPD) said "that he will make a proposal for the Conference of Health Ministers on Tuesday next." - afp

How do I do the best I can?
Hello, I find the #PRS_ORG# chair very nice, but I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you help me?
I can't do any shopping anymore about my #PRS_ORG#.
Display: Ups, it's an error.
Buy via the #PRS_ORG# page on the computer.
I updated the account details.
Where can this lie?
What you describe is referred to as "awareness*, i.e. mental perceptions under full drugs.
These occur at a frequency of about 1 to 1000.
The most common is the hearing of sounds/voices, the more rare the sight of images and the most rare the sight of pain.
Relevant for this issue: Imperial cuts are operations involving an increased rate of awareness, as one avoids a very deep narcosis to protect the child until it is absorbed.
Previously episodes of warning should be mentioned in the Narcotic Talk.
Certain anaesthesia procedures such as total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) are associated with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Love everyone, this comment from me describes awareness correctly, but had no u/Nitemarex **by definition.
I've read her comment wrong.
But the chair is defective.
Unfortunately, the €20 will not help us.
These are legal guarantees.
The absolute minimum would be that they would take back the defective chair.
This is also a standard in the area of eCommerce in addition to the legal obligation.
Please check again if they at least take back the defective chair.
We sell the second chair in private.
We'll lose some money.
I've already sent you an e-mail that you haven't answered.
Again the question.
In the order and on account, the goods are delivered to a room of my choice.
The consignor is company #NAME#.
I'm calling right there.
I was told that they only delivered it in front of the door - because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that right?
If so, I have to cancel the order because I don't know a person who can wear the heavy furniture on the first floor.
I'm not gonna be called?
I had asked a question
Theatre historian Günther Rühle died 97-year-old
He has been profiled as a theatre critic and as an intendant.
Later he wrote a monumental theatre story.
On Friday Günther Rühle died at the age of 97.
There is still the new book on the table, freshly printed: "An old man is getting older".
The startling diary of a slow separation from the world led by the theatre historian and journalist Günther Rühle until April 2021.
And in the middle of the reading, the news comes that the author is dead.
The last sentence in the book is: "I am already testifying to my life's gift."
There are different types of palettes.
One of the most common are European pallets, standardised wooden pallets, which are used primarily in the European space as a loading carrier.
They are certified by the European Palettes Association EPAL
According to data from statistics Austria in Austria, more than ten million pieces of pallets were produced.
The value of production was well worth EUR 79 million.
How many palettes are imported annually to Austria will not be raised
New York won MLS for the first time
New York City FC won the title in Major League Soccer for the first time.
After 1:1 in the regular playing time against host Portland Timbers, the team from the Eastern Conference decided the final in the 11th shot with 4:2.
At the end of the Eastern Conference, New York had implemented itself against Philadelphia Union, the team of the German Kai Wagner.
Roulade Tips & Tricks
I had received a lot of great tips here a week ago for the perfect gulasch.
That was Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery!
So thank you again for this :)
Now I've come to the taste and I want to cook the first rouladen to Silvester.
I'll set up a beef fund tomorrow.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I don't have an oven, but just a big cup.
How's it going now?
What about the books or how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English is not so good anymore, but I get it
IE is about a refund of €#NUMBER#
I was already informed on 18.01. by mail that the refund was made.
But to this day, the money hasn't come to me.
Please check there.
Where there are still Christmas Brats in the room of Lübeck
For many people, Gans or Ente belong to Christmas days such as the dance tree and gifts.
You haven't taken care of any birds yet?
Now it's about time.
We are betraying you where you get another Christmas present in the room of Lübeck.
The "Drive" of a pipe end level contributes significantly to the heat and fat content of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor switch.
With the VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME controller, you can set the desired level on the one hand and the breaking content of your sound on the other.
In addition, VT+ series amplifiers offer a unique power level ruler that allows you to reduce the signal level without changing anything on "gain" and the distortion.
Further, it already seems that even a performance reserve can be made smooth with the POWER LEVEL regulator when it comes up loud.
Thanks to POWER LEVEL regulator, the full potential of the VT+ series can be used in any situation.
The headphone can also be used as a line output.
This signal here is being edited with a box simulation so that you get an outstanding "acoustic" sound impression yourself using a headphone or direct recording.
The AUX can be connected to a CD or MP3 player so you can join your favorite songs.
A Tuner function is also on board - so you do not need a separate voice device.
If you are spending an additional VFS5 foot key, you can also call the sounds comfortably by foot, turn on/off the effect blocks and "stop" the pace of the compatible effects.
For live use, this is really unacceptable.
With its new power packages, VOX will take another step into the future!
But I'd seen it like that with others.
Then is it possible for you to send the lamp back?
Since she hangs too low over a table?
So I'd like to send them back.
Can you help me with this?
What about the Commodity?
Are we receiving an update next week for the exact delivery deadline?
Hello, they're already sitting on the #PRS_ORG# chairs
If it didn't work out, I'd be happy with a dessert or a voucher.
Under the circumstances, I find a receiver for the furniture.
Just over a thousand euros for goods that I don't need, then there's a lot.
I just got my delivery and would have known if screws were provided as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) on the expected hooks.
That is not a satisfactory answer and waiting time has not been paid
Is there a premium customer status with you?
Iran sees progress in negotiations on nuclear agreements
In the negotiations on the resumption of the International Atomic Convention, progress has been made according to Iranian data.
"Both sides are just ahead of agreeing on the issues that should be on the agenda," said Iran's Chief Retailer Ali Bagheri on Sunday of the Irna News Agency.
This was a 'positive and important development' because at first it did not even agree on the issues to be negotiated.
The agreement is to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks on the revitalization of the agreement were continued after almost one week’s interruption.
Negotiators from Iran, Germany, the United Kingdom, China, France and Russia participate in the negotiations.
A U.S. delegation is also on-site in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overhangs Saxony - Free state now with highest Corona incidence
Thüringen has dissolved Saxony and is currently showing the highest incidence in the nation.
As the only federal country, the value is above the mark of 1000.
As the only federal country, Thuringia was present at the Corona incident on Sunday over the 1000 brand.
The Robert Koch Institute reported the seven-day value of 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which was the last always the highest incidence in the nation, this value was at 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia decreased slightly, but it was also over the value of 1000.
In Thuringia, 2242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 other deaths related to an infection were reported within one day.
200 severe Covid-19 patients were treated intensively in hospitals on Sunday.
At weekends, there may be delays in reporting.
In addition, the health authorities have been overloaded for weeks and are barely behind with the discovery of new cases.
I understand.
As delivery takes place in early March, it may be possible to do so.
I have to print it and stick it to the package and leave it at the post office, was it?
I don't have to click/add/complete anything here?
That's exactly what I want to avoid, that's why I'm writing to you.
I would like to take over the return at my own expense.
8 Euros return fee is a frequency in my eyes.
It is time for change
##MBundaday welcome me, I am u/StratorDE in the plenary room in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
#What's the post here?
If you look at the activity in the last months of the MBundaday, you can find one thing: it is not existential.
We came to a winter star and extended the summer hole for a few months.
#What's the problem?
Yeah, what's the location?
To a large extent, this should simply be linked to the dissatisfaction, how some things have been done here and how we are generally present.
In the last few days, the impression has grown that many people here have still bock on the MBundesday.
#What we need to change
At this place the community is asked about the MBundesday which wants to keep them alive.
The attack came from u/edizvevo, who has been paying attention to this project in the last few days, and one has just found sharpheads.
After some writing, several people from the community have found themselves wishing to rebuild the project.
However, once again I would like to call on everyone specifically to participate, only so that this project can also exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a discord server on which we can exchange each other, as well as develop concrete things.
You can join the server via this link.
Destination:
* How will the MBundaday work in the future?
* What existing arrangements have to be changed/adapted/removed?
* How are we going to go abroad in the future?
* How should new members be recruited?
* How do we create a fair electoral system?
I'm pretty sure I forgot a few things, but what's not bad is that we end up having the discord.
If you have a desire and time, come to the Discord, work with and let us democratically decide about the future.
I've ordered a lamp screen with you that's still being delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big for it and not suitable for my taste.
I've already ordered another suspension with you.
I put it together and noticed this when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about that.
I hope this will be returned and I have a full refund.
This is also rather sad because the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have one more question: the day cover #PRS_ORG#, is it also in excess, i.e. in 240/240 for example?
#PRS_ORG# needs to be able to guarantee that the wrong cabinet will be picked up in time.
And I'm asking you to do that now.
I don't have a suitable packaging, but will unmount the cabinet as far as possible for the collection - they need to clear with #PRS_ORG# how it can work.
#PRS_ORG# can call me at any time to agree on a pick-up date.
Is there a guide to the installation?
How long would I have had time to make this or decide for the return?
How do you answer the question, why are you vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague I like.
She has lived for a while vegetarian herself, today probably even rarely eats meat.
I was a vegetarian myself a few years ago.
On the question of whether I have always wanted to be a vegan, and Vegetarianism has been a planned step in the process, I have answered honestly without much thought.
And I thought for a long time that I would support animal welfare as a vegetarian, but I sometimes reflected and understood that I would eventually also support animal quellerie.
So my decision is to be vegan.
At the moment I had the impression that it was on her side of Missmut, she then defended Vegetarianism and thought she knew where her meat came from and reduced as Vegetarian animal suffering.
Now I wonder if my answer was "plump"?
How do you answer the question?
Has the feeling that you are quickly stuck as a Veganer in a corner and conflicts arise without putting it on?
It greets a harmonizing vegetarian (;
This is clearly not an exception to § 312d BGB.
Your #PRS_ORG# do not detach from the legal requirements to the remote set.
I'm on the assigned date where #PRS_ORG# doesn't pick up my returns on site.
Because I can't be on site because of a baptism, that can't change either.
May I have an alternative pick-up time, please?
From 01.02.#NUMBER# I am constantly going to meet again.
Lahnsteiner Wehr for Water Rescue: 45,000 Euro grant from the country
Recently, the Rhineland-Palestinian Interior Minister Roger Lewentz delivered an allocation letter in Lahnsteiner Rathaus of EUR 45,000 for the new vehicle water rescue of the Voluntary Firearm Lahnstein to Mayor Peter Labonte.
The total costs of the vehicle used since November 2020 amount to EUR 135,000.
A good and important investment in security.
I am pleased that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate supports us in this regard," says Lahnstein Mayor Peter Labonte.
The vehicle is used by the diving staff Lahnstein, one of a total of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Over and under water they perform tasks in water and ice rescue and technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, there is a constant increase in the number of jobs: the boom of hotel shipping on Rhine and Mosel and the continued increasing use of the Lahn as a leisure flow.
I bought myself a book that I could only read at 10% and then the problems started.
I can't open the book.
However, following their recommendations, they have synchronized, removed and the newly loaded app has NOT worked.
I'm a little hungry because the whole action has taken a lot of time and I hope for help now.
Okay, that's it.
I would like to order 3 items from the #PRS_ORG# collection to June.
Can I enter an appointment in the order procedure?

For the first time, thanks to the fact that you've been here for the whole thing, I've also spent almost a decade in civil service in a similar activity, we were also armed in the executive, and I don't want to go on!
The question of right and left is always very simple.
In principle, however, it should be said that, of course, the civil servant comes from the liberal to conservative spectrum rather than from the revolutionary links, which should actually be clear to everyone.
Of course, even in the particular uniform and weaponry of people to the right of conservative magic, it should also be clear to everyone that these people can then naturally deal with the living reality is also clear, because you have of course besides the average white, now many Germans with migration backgrounds, women and also homosexuals (and so I don't now say the excessive female cliques, because they exist in the executive rather than even all normal men and women, whom one can't tell if they can't tell anyone) and also I have to rely on these people, because in doubt they will save your life or put it for you.
But even if my experience seems funny for the first time, they are proud of Germany and feel less relaxed by exaggerated left-wing policies, even if this policy is supposed to be used for them or they think it has to be right for them, they simply want to be treated in a normal way.
Back to the rights, since of course police and military forces are also a cross-section of society, you will also find extreme rights there, but they may openly say there or even openly discard any plans that are dangerous to the public is completely overruled and angers me too.
Of course, even policemen and soldiers who have often been in foreign use often begin to panic because of negative experiences and sometimes even say things that are wrong until politically.
It is also true that even right-minded people will meet those who do a rainy exchange of thoughts.
Nevertheless, what I think is well combated, and also with political education and education, is against the whole!
Germany is so much international and this is also so good in my opinion that we could not afford it at all to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks!
Yeah, what I don't understand, the other basket I also ordered on the Deutsche side.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered, it wasn't sold out.
I already ordered in November.
But it was so confirmed in your confirmation of the order
It's still about my order, which is no longer available.
I used to chat with #NAME#.
Alternatively, you could deliver the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# Euro in black to Germany or this basket is available anywhere in Germany.
I always find you as a partner company.
but above the edge of the wood are two deep oaks which were filled with something yellow
And on the mirror itself is a small scratcher
Ordinarily by a child?
Hello, I (w32) have been busy for a long time.
I am very disciplined and organized at work (being self-employed, very little leisure time), but for a long time I get worse than right to lead my household permanently clean and orderly.
There are always phases in which everything stays, and then and when it packs me and I clean up and drink.
But it's never really so "that once someone could come to visit spontaneously".
My husband is also not better, although I am upset somewhere but most of the time, he simply loses his home against work and distress.
The kitchen is still the most regularly cleaned where we like to cook.
Now on my question, did you manage to get better with a child?
But we still have nothing to do with it, and this question has taken on me for a long time.
Because for me I don't have any incentive, it just doesn't bother me so much until a visit comes and for example there's always fresh clothes and the kitchen can be used.
Do you have a bigger urge with a child, or do you stay sloppy?
I look forward to your answers.
Exclusive, new, and qualitatively high-quality and anatomically pre-formed cut, offers maximum comfort, a perfect fit and thus allows an almost unlimited freedom of movement.
Preformation with special, further attachment to the joints for improved freedom of movement (on arms and knees)
For Focea Comfort 4 the Flex System 2 area covered by the Flex System was more than doubled to increase comfort.
Neckless stretch panels on the edges reduce friction (axles, arms and knees)
High quality preformations in the lower back area and step by step provide an attractive, perfect seat.
Elaskin 8.8 Stretch panel in the Lendenwirbel area increases the flexibility around the backrest closure and thus improves the comfort, especially when bending and mounting and installation of the equipment on the surface.
The Free Flex Zone that is located around the shoulders and back guarantees increased flexibility in movements of the arms and back.
Fireskin is a warm, water-degrading material with a special surface structure that offers a high degree of cold protection.
Positioned on the chest, it brings warmth into a sensitive area of the body.
Soft, thin (-2 mm) shuttering on the face of the hood increases comfort, sealing and durability (separate head fold)
Soft, in-circuit zone improves the closure with finely adjustable width adjustment by a flexible, smooth adhesive closure, which does not hang on the cassation or nails
Double sleeves with zip closure on wrists and legs combine a foldable inner sleeve with a soft, cassier neoprene outer sleeve
45° anchoring at the end of the inner sleeve for increased elasticity and loadability when pulling.
Long zipper on the neck with a elastic reinforcement, for an anatomical cut with increased comfort at all without hair
Longer G-Lock P Backrest Lock (overall without hood) with metal slider and integrated water Dam system for improved sealing (reviewed patent)
Bracelets on arms and legs
Neoprene reinforcements at all ends of the zipper locks to prevent a crack if excessive force is used.
Neoprene panels bonded with outer and inner overlap
Borders of outer sleeves stretched for greater loadability
Inner manschat edge embedded for increased flexibility
The original Beuchat system was designed to fix the computer in its place, especially at deeper dives (the system is compatible with all common bracelet computers)
Career in social work - as someone with a self-insecure personality disorder?
I have been training in the field of software development and have been learning for about a year.
Unfortunately, I increasingly feel that this profession is not the right thing for me, because I have been thinking about starting again and studying social work for a long time.
The problem: I have a self-insecure (or fearfully avoidable) personality disorder (AVPS).
That means grossly saying that I don't have a feeling of self-esteem and that I'm therefore afraid.
I don't have a problem with talking to people at a business level, but I have a very difficult time talking and I have been told more often that I seem inconvenient (by which I think I have already become better).
Can I become a social worker like that?
I do not want to work as a streetworker or as an open youth meeting, but rather as an example of seeking advice or family assistance.
However, I do not know if the actual working day really is as I imagine it, and it is difficult to find something on the Internet.
The ÄVPS is already leading to problems in my job (for me, emotionally) because it pulls me down every time there's something to hold on to my code ("already the simplest things") and I find it difficult to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I should really know how to do this"/"I keep him with my stupid questions from working"/"he really needs to keep me under control" etc.).
I'll probably have the problems in every profession but I wanted to mention it on the spot.
But you've got the sofa back already?
Because there was no confirmation for this either.
I'm waiting for a pick-up date.
What do they mean, please?
If I have downloaded a book on the #PRS_ORG#, the message your #PRS_ORG# does not authorize this book
Are there any problems?
I was in the chat with #PRS_ORG# who asked me if I got a delivery confirmation for my cabinet.
The protein (protein) taken with the feed splits the bird into the individual protein building materials (amino acids) in its stomach tract and builds from this its own body protein, which it also needs to form.
Fertiliser formation in nestling and re-instruction in miceling birds are extremely complex procedures and are associated with a particularly high claim for the entire organism of the animal.
Please note that NEKTON bio should not be administered during the breeding process, as other disorders may occur during the pregnancy.
Following this short-term administration of NECTON-bio, vitamins should be returned to daily supply with NECTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NECTON-MSA (mineral preparation).

1 g NECTON bio to 250 ml of water or 100 g of soft food.
It is recommended to prepare only as much drinking water/weighing feed as the bird consumes daily and to change water/feed daily.
A striped measuring spoon (if any) corresponds to 1 g of NECTON bio.
In the event of severe bleeding damage, the double or triple dose of NECTON bio may be given at first until the approach to feeding retraining is visible.
The normal dose is then reached until the fertilisation is complete.
Storage: NECTON bio should be stored without sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
Please excuse them, but the chair is sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair break after 9 months?
The insurance claims in Germany are 24 months.
This is really very bad service.
Hello, I sent an e-mail on Monday to inform you that my order was damaged and images were attached.
Did you receive this email?
Statement by a Community employee in opposition to the Statute
Hallo r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
Our property is supposed to like a walnut tree.
Thus, application was made to the municipality.
An employee writes to me that the case of fruit trees and therefore the Walnuss is not part of the constitution.
In the Statute, however, the Walnuss is explicitly referred to as a protective tree.
Can I now rely on the employee's statement or not?
On the one hand, I have to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the constitution is clear.
Thank you for your answers
We understand.
Then we will use the new packaging for them.
I didn't get a message.
Well, then I still have a sofa without use.
Would you like to offer me a dessert or a voucher?
What were they more expensive?
Yeah, I think that's the only question is whether I can pay in euro and let me deliver the blanket to Germany.
Can you check that out?
E-mail: A serious traffic accident with self
Recently, a serious traffic accident occurred at St. 2179 between Self-Nord and Plößberg.
As the police's press alarm announces today (14:03 p.m.), a car has arrived at the counter-trafficking.
There are injured.
Ah, okay, I get it.
Well, then thank you so much again that it was so easy!
Council and ideas for further professional life
For the first time, Merry Christmas with you!
Unfortunately, my Christmas is moderately good because my dear head just thinks everything you can think about.
Before I figure out here.. briefly: I need advice and the best of people who somehow know my situation - that is from you.
I'm just making the reef as a queer climber.
Initially, I studied something else and worked there in an area (to remain at least a little anonymous, I call nothing more precise here).
But then all was too boring and I looked at alternatives that could make me more fun.
I once landed at the school and was sure that it was - even though the framework conditions were significantly more inflexible than in my previous profession, but that was no matter to me.
I have now arrived at the third "I google other bids".
And it's only half a year away.
In the times before, I always decided to continue and at least to end the reef, after which I can still swing.
But I'm absolutely done.
I've had so little time in the last month that I've completely lied to.
Now they're vacations, but there's still a bunch of work waiting for me.
Before the reef I always thought I would be stress resistant, but my weekend was also my weekend and my celebration night.
There I was free.
And the stress on the job was at times unresolved.
Now it's my own family party that's too much stress.
And then there are these rigid structures that make me nervous.
In principle, it makes fun and looks from the outside also runs well with regard to feedback and so on.
But I'm completely out of line and I wonder how much stress my body can withstand before he completely closes - if he doesn't do it right now.
I wonder if I want the rest of my life to do so - just when I read some contributions from you here - or if I shouldn't go back to the old area, because where I was valued, I could take free time when I needed it, and the work was somehow boring, but it was properly paid for, and I worked together in a team and not as a single fighter, as it is now, most of the time of the case.
But then I wonder if in a year I will not be back in the same place as I am now and unhappy.
You know, it's all kind of wrong, but maybe you've got it as an external council or ideas, like I'm out of this situation that I'm completely finished and about to start crying about it at the slightest thought.
I'm not going to make decisions so emotionally right now, which probably leads to nothing good.
But maybe your views help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or Christmas, which is enough for me for the first time.
Thank you for reading and apologise for my sad tone.
I hope my situation has become at least a little clear.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series of VOX has continued to develop, among other things, to combine advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" switch, which perfectly simulates the behaviour of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X Amps we present a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely at the latest state of the art in matters of sound.
Thanks to the VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of components and Amp switches, the VTX amplifiers are waiting for an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
These amps also, of course, contain the multi-stage Valvetronix tube amplifier.
This is partly based on real analog switches, because they simply get the sound variations and nuances of a tube enhancer better than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated switch, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed case and a bass reflex system, from which the natural resonances only spray.
With VOX's "Tone Room" software you can even correct and bend historical facts on the virtual level until the Amp and the effects sound as you've always imagined.
The perfect combination of pipe sound and modeling technology is mainly due to the VOX Valve reactor technology presented in 2001.
Of course, it has been refined several times since then to meet new sound requirements, which in 2010 has again led to a performance shift of the VOX Valvetronix series - with more dynamics and more sophisticated and decisive enhancer models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series was also designed in such a way as to find all guitarists looking for a maximum sound variety.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube enhancer: they expect a fat sound, a nuanced playback of play dynamics and string impact as well as a prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that the end-stage determines the tube character of an amplifier and developed VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.
The Valve Reactor switch, equipped with a 12AX7 tube, of each VT+ amplifier represents the behavior, the subtle nuances and the sound character of a tube amplifier perfectly.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner: Magic lose at Clippers
The Orlando Magic series is held in the NBA.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but to win against the Los Angeles Clippers is not enough.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven counters of his older brother Moritz lost the magic on Saturday 104:106 at the Los Angeles Clippers.
The main feature is also adaptable: with three individually plazier and foldable shutter parts it is directed to the needs of your photo equipment and is therefore suitable for any type of cameras - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-format mirror reflex cameras.
What finally fits into the backpack depends, of course, on the size of the camera and the lens.
A possible possession would be a DSLR camera with a set lens, two to three swap targets and a flashlight.
Larger DSLM cameras like the different models of the Sony-a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 leave room for other targets.
You can also steal any amount of accessories.
And anyone who has a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-Series) can use the backpack for his equipment and for photo-external things.

Volcano eruption on La Palma: probably longest history
In the almost three months since the outbreak, the lava currents have caused great damage to the Canary Islands.
Is an end in sight?
With a duration of 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma has been the longest in Spanish history since Sunday.
So far, the eruption of the Tehuya volcano in 1585 was 84 days longer than the longest on the Atlantic peninsula on the West coast of Africa.
There are no reliable data on earlier outbreaks.
The activity of the still unnamed volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has been somewhat reduced in the past few days, but Vulcanologists were still waiting for no forecast when it could end.
The indicators point to a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," said the president of the island council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, the state TV broadcaster RTVE.
Damages in millions of heights
In the almost three months since the outbreak, the more than 1,000 degrees has destroyed almost 2900 homes and other buildings, as reported by RTVE.
Almost 1200 hectares were covered by a metridic lava layer.
This corresponds to almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7,000 people had to be evacuated, the damage is estimated at more than EUR 900 million.
In front of the coast, two new landscapes were created by cold lava with a total size of about 50 hectares.
It was particularly serious about the very important banana cultivation for the island, of which about half of the approximately 85,000 people live directly or indirectly and which was already before the volcanic eruption in the crisis.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, other areas were seriously affected, the newspaper "El País" wrote.
Christmas and the Gifts
Christmas stands at the door and especially the children will not be able to expect the heavenly feast.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree have been associated with the spiritual atmosphere and the scrupulous tension of the world.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still hold our increasingly fragmented society together.
The more important it is to become aware of the Christmas tradition of the gift, so that the gesture of the gift, which, according to French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss, has been a peace-based "Society of Natural Peoples" contract, can be avoided and refilled with life in the context of this tradition.
How From Nikolaus the Christ Kind
The Protestants were very strict, by which the Christmas days were closely linked to the present.
Previously on Nikolaust day gifts were handed over to some kind.
The background of this popular seat today is that the Holy Nicholas as Bishop of Myra has secretly thrown three women into her window in a night to save them another life in sin.
From this unconventional type of gift, the popular custom in Germany was to fill the boots with gifts, especially for children.
Protestants took advantage of this use because they deny mediators between God and men as "holy worship".
For these reasons they stood up against the institution.
Martin Luther made the Christkid out of Nikolaus and thus founded a new tradition line.
The focus of the present shifted to the weekend.
Since most Protestants do not see such detailed questions so close, it only makes the least worse that the use of St. Nicholas is similar to Martin’s use of Martinsingen and Martinsumzug still a solid part of the Christmas season.
Today you can find everything in boots before the door and under the Christmas tree of socks until you want luxury watches all that the heart wants.
Various traditions in Christian countries
Sources bear a tradition of the gift since the 13th century on the day of St. Nicholas.
With the reform, the day of the donation moved to the weekend.
In all Christian lands, however, a happy God - fearing motherfucker raises the question of who now brings the gifts to the children.
In Germany it depends on the respective region whether the Christmas child appears on the Holy Night or the Christmas man, who is in principle a kind of Nikolaus, who was eventually assigned some of his own species.
Among them are his white noise bar, which only has little to do with the rather strict acidic bar of the historical figure, his sleigh, which is pulled by renters and the preference of the fireplace to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, St. Nicholas remains the central figure at Christmas.
In Spain, the Holy Three Kings give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana, who should have guided them on the way to Jesus.
In Scandinavia, sometimes fable beings bring the gifts, while in Russia it brought Father Frost to some glory.
Here there are not reindeer, but three horses that draw their tails as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the motherland of the reform in the course of the Hussite War, Christkind is responsible for the surrender of the gifts.

Police shoots discreet bank robbers near the King's palace
Near the Kensington Palace in London, an armed man was shot by the police on Saturday.
The police reported that the callers had reported a man who was supposed to have gone to a bank with a gun and a bookkeeper's business.
The man fled according to the authorities in a vehicle that could not be stopped by officials until later.
It's been shot down and the man was hit.
He was still declared dead at the tabernacle.
The police didn't come from a terrorist background.
Several messages are located in the area around the Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and the three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.

In the Hollywood show there are usually dangerous objects from distant galaxies that glow colourfully inside.
Quite harmless, however, is 'Smart Stone': Only the sun ensures that this sunlight shines fascinatingly – preferably in white or colourless light (in six different shades of color).
The edgeless, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: As a natural-shaped big hive this modern light object is presented at day.
Its organic circles fit in every natural environment – whether on the edge of the terrace, in the grass or in the stone area.
He also works in the vicinity of larger hives and finders, where he knows how to say thanks to his size.
You can save yourself great preparations: As a solar lamp »Smart Stone« does not require any wire or batteries.
Place the “lightstone” at any place that the sun shines.
Two co-supplied earthpeas provide for a fixed stop if needed.
The matt white plastic lid itself is robust and weatherproof.
Its solar module hides “Smart Stone” discreetly inside it, together with its battery and two LEDs – one for white, the other for colourful light.

Arrows Problem
Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
I hope I'm doing everything right here, is actually saving my first post after a year.
To my problem: I started taking the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I had so incredibly bad pain during the period and shit PMS before the period.
Now I would like to leave it back because I have to take enough medication I cannot choose from because of chronic diseases.
My main problem, of course not the pain, but my skin.
I had received my last approximately two-year break from 0 to 100 explosive pixels and these everywhere.
It's so superficial, but it's been really hard on me, and I didn't really feel like it.
In the two years of break, the whole thing never really normalized.
Maybe he's got some tips to avoid this time.
It's already my cosmetics, but maybe there's something someone can recommend.
Unfortunately, the doctor didn't take me so seriously and the skin doctor's appointment is still coming.
Thank you very much to everyone who has read the novel!
Yes, the love skin is such a nice thing.
Having a pre-bupert bad neurodermitis, then a time of quiet, then large-scale bone marrow and the acne theme.
Food also tried everything possible in the course of Mr. Sickness, and I was left hanging on sugar, milk and meat-poor meat, because otherwise nothing worked so well.
It may also be good that Hormonell is simply the worm inside, but if you like me everywhere you don't want to keep looking for what else is going wrong.
I already had all her colleague's seminary.
I wrote and now I've lost the conversation and I don't know what was answered to my questions.
I have to work through it all the time and on the phone and suddenly everything was gone...
What's there to check if the money was there, I'd see it.
Please check my bank details. Maybe there was something wrong.
But there's usually a big one.

110-kV-Earth cable will be rebuilt in 2022
The approval for the release of the new high voltage cap at Tann is valid.
The plan-setting decision of the government of Niederbayern opens the way for the construction to begin in 2022.
This was now shared by the network operator Bayernwerk.
The approximately seven-kilometre-long cable will connect the Tann circuit to the north of the municipality and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and parish churches.
The cable is connected to a mast of release near the village of Edermanning at Reut.
Good morning,
my order of 03.01.21 with order number #NUMBER# has so far only arrived in parts with us.
The blue bet cell number:#PRS_ORG# with the sender #NUMBER# was returned by #PRS_ORG# with the note "not possible".
All three other packages have arrived so that a delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me what the next procedure is?
A nice start in the week!
You can forget that, but I've explained it several times yesterday!!
This is a glass comede and the whole pages are placed, so everywhere the glass is and the cardboard is broken
The comede is in my apartment and #PRS_ORG# refuses to come into the apartment because of the #PRS_ORG# provisions
This means that the comode can't be picked up because no one in my apartment can clean
Thanks for the message
But why only EUR 20?
The original value of this chair was #NUMBER#EUR
No, it's all about books, so the question about #PRS_ORG# is probably a general problem.
Ref: Plan teaching (EC)
Hello, ladies and gentlemen,
I've been in the ref since summer, teaching makes me fun, but I still have great problems planning my teaching in the field of Earth science.
Unfortunately, my school is not technically well equipped, so I can only use the table, the school book and an OHP as a medium in principle.
In addition, I can only copy s/w for free in school (what is nervous about earth science).
I just need a very long time to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently doing the topic of geofactors, and I actually have every hour of it.
In principle, the methods are always repeated, but on the other hand, I don't want to invest too much time for simple lessons (I need them for UBs etc.).
I'm actually always out of the learning goal (what I want to achieve) in planning and think about how I can build it (usually I create a worksheet with texts from books that don't have my school).
We have the book Terra and with most of the tasks in the book I am rather unhappy.
That's why the worksheets too.
Maybe I can get an Earthquake teacher to work with the book on time.
I'd really be happy.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the #NUMBER# order.
However, I have already decided for a new one at #PRS_ORG# but I would like to complete the return as soon as possible.
Trade is afraid because of the 2G regulation on Christmas business.
In most shops, only those who are vaccinated or healed may be allowed to do so.
Trade holds this as unnecessary and unresolved revenue.
He's got a possible solution, too.
In the view of the German Trade Association (HDE), the 2G regulations destroy the important Christmas business.
In the case of non-daily-needed business, there was a complaint about revenue cuts, criticised the head of the HDE business, Stefan Genth.
According to a current HDE survey among 1,100 traders, more than 70 percent of the companies looked negative on the remaining days of the year.
Many would have written down the Christmas business.
"What should actually be the positive height of the year is now often a hole without ground," Genth said.
Therefore, traders with 2G access restrictions lost almost a third of their pre-crisis rates in the past week.
It only runs in food retail as well as online.
The association called for consequences from the dramatic development.
The purchase with mask, distance and hygiene concept was a safe matter, said the chief businessman.
"2G does not bring us forward in the fight against pandemic," he stressed.
The current regulations frightened customers and required high staffing.
The gang regulations had to be allowed across the country, he demanded.
After that, each customer had to be checked only once on 2G (vomited or healed) and would have access to all shops with the tape received on that day.
In addition, in retail trade - as already in public transport in the case of 3G rule (vaccinated, cured or tested) - sampling should be sufficient.
Deutsche Euroshop also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies were last without 2G at good 75 percent of the pre-Crona level, the sales at about 90 percent.
These figures will now be safe in the middle of such important Christmas business," said CEO Wilhelm Wellner of the "Economic Week".
Due to the high personal and administrative effort, the Centre will try to find and obtain solutions.
This includes the so-called band solution, where "visitors can, for example, enter all shops at a central location in the center once their 2G tracking and then - equipped with a bracelet similar to a club hotel - undamaged".
I recently ordered and delivered the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratcher and the frame is also an error that has been tried with a yellow filling.
That's not nice.
I would like to give the mirror back and have already packed it back into the package and glued it.
How do I proceed for the return now?
The lamp is designed for dual-balance, based on new flat SMD LEDs with high performance and high colour rendering.
For setting the colour temperature and brightness of the lamp, a modern microprocessor with exceptional possibilities is provided.
In addition to the adjustment of brightness, there are two standard colour temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually set and store the colour temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the flash memory.
A special feature of the controller, it is simple and intuitively manageable.
The light creates a very light current with soft light of high quality, completely flameless.
The 120-degree radiation angle with which you can illuminate large areas at relatively small distances is excellent.
Also in reporting situations in small spaces or short distances.
You can adjust the brightness practically without changing the color temperature.
It's a great tool to work on either the movie set or the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller allows remote control of the light in television studios or when the light is mounted in difficult accessible places.
On the back of the lamp is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a illuminating display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
There is also the slot for the NP-F battery (not included in the delivery range)
User Memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
In order to perform the settings of the individual settings on the memory space, it is easy to hold down and finish by pressing one of the memory keys.
The memory controller saves the current state of the lamp when switched off, so that the familiar situation remains when new plugs are turned on - very practical in the studio work, for example when the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
Working with battery one of the largest strengths of DL3120 functionality comes from the possibility of operating with cheap NP-F battery.
These are often already in the possession of photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can go back to existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before the set whether the battery has sufficient power - it is a battery test equal to installed - for each of the two battery modes a value in the two displays (the left battery top display, the right on the bottom display).
Furthermore, of course it is possible to provide the light bulb over the supplied net part continuously with electricity.
The construction of the lamp is very simple.
You have a 16mm hole as a connector for fastening, so you can directly access your photo booth.
The inclination is to be set reliably by fixing on both sides.
It was considered that the mechanical components are also extremely high quality and are therefore also designed for longevity and hard use.
In addition, a fold link is included in the delivery range.
Great is this also contained a bag in the range of delivery.
So you can buy the light with all the accessories you may want to buy, safely transport or store without any problems.
The damage I have received and it is too small :(
"The Party that We Wanted to Smash": Frankfurt celebrates a dry comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Entracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the last two times in series were probably on the way to the next Federal Square.
But then the SGE turned up, within a good hour burst the hunger over an adult season start from the soul and beat furiously with 5:2. "It's crazy what the boys have done today," cheered Coach Oliver Glasner at DAZN and said a "Pauschal Lob, to every individual who was with it."
At first it looked after a new damper for the nine still behind their expectations.
Patrick Schick had led the Leverkussner with 2:0.
What happened then also impressed the SGE trainer.
"How the players then returned and showed a fantastic performance," Glasser continues.
I am insanely happy with the performance that we have shown and of course also with the result.
Even dissident Christopher Lenz, who was able to stand on the spot again for the first time since the fourth day and his overcome muscle injury, stressed the morale of his teammates.
"I think our mentality is incredibly large," said the 27-year-old and looked forward to the result especially for the audience.
That was the party we wanted to throw today.
For the coming tasks, however, Glasner now wants to keep the focus on himself, but he also looks forward to it with regard to the staff situation.
It is extraordinary that we have all the players fit in December that all the players are physically in a top constitution.
It is top work in our medical department, but also the players live highly professionally.
Now you want to "go step by step and stay modest" and "pass the tasks to this level" until the annual change.
As next Wednesday, an outdoor game will be held at Borussia Mönchengladbach (18:30, Sky) on the program.
I get the mail that my package comes back to you due to an error.
I tried to call #PRS_ORG# and let it redirect, no chance.
Can it be sent back to me directly or do I have to wait until the money has been returned and cancel the order?
I would regret to say that I will not order again because it has already taken a very long time.
Have they ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Detergents for handball women in front of quarter finals against Spain
Germany's handball women are just after the humiliation against Denmark with hanging heads and empty views of the parquet.
At 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 viewers in Granollers, the DHB selection ended with a huge defeat and must now run against the Spanish host in the fourth final.
"We were too worried and had too much respect before the opponent," said Federal Trainer Henk Groener.
We must act differently against Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany closed the main round group III with 8:2 points as a second behind the Danes (10:0).
It's a shame we couldn't take the flow.
That was a bad game of all that we have to delete," said Captain Emily Folk.
In the fight to enter the semi-finals against the WM second of 2019, there is a clear increase on the coming Tuesday in order to keep the delicate dream of the first medal alive since 2007.
The best German poster in the duel with the three-time Olympic Denmark was the back room player Alina Grijseels with six doors.
"We just weren't there - neither in the attack nor in the defense," said Xenia Smits, and demanded: "We need to look forward quickly now."
From front to back not at height
Unlike in the previous five tournaments, the German team with the anpfiff was not at the height.
Missiles and technical errors in the attack and leaks in the defense were responsible for a quick 0:4-back stop after seven minutes.
Just Torfrau Dinah Eckerle was immediately at operating temperature and prevented with some parades worse.
The first gate reached the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully completed a quick setback.
However, this was not the expected initial ignition.
Against the aggressive coverage of the Danes, the German women could hardly sit in scene - and if not, they usually failed at the strong Althea Reinhardt in the gate of the Scandinavia.
This was how the party ran early at 3:10 after 20 minutes, especially Mia Zschokke’s backroom player not long after because of a tough crowd at her opponent’s ass saw red too.
In the fourth final, however, it may be involved again.
Only in the final phase of the first half of the season did the DHB selection get a little better into the game and until the break to at least five towers.
Nevertheless, the only silent hope for a rebound after the change was after seven minutes at 9:19.
Again, the Greeners were sinning in all areas and making it easy for the well-established opponent, who was among the medal candidates at the end.
As a result, the German team could no longer climb to an increase in performance and went as a clear loser from the park.

I'd like to pass a code of goodness
as in #PRS_ORG# gift vouchers
What's the matter with them?
The title suggests that I act as an implant in mobile implants in which (until now) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is vaccinated in nursing homes.
As soon as these are ready for a large part, it goes on to part in vaccination centres for me.
I would like to answer questions without a time limit on the organizational and human aspects and also medical questions, unless they are related to a personal (e.g. "I take medicine X, this is done with the vaccination.").
In my field of work, the education for vaccination, the position of indication (person is entitled to a vaccination according to coronary prescription and no reason to speak against it), the medical documentation and, if necessary, the emergency care in case of allergic reactions (never happened to me).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, such as medical professionals.
In imphetamines, however, we often have no part of it, but "only" (for God's sake does not want no missing value!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for the preparation of the vaccine, but they can't carry out vaccinations (should?), so I also carry out most vaccinations myself.
Heavy "huidler" question: Amberger knows the solution
What's a "huidler"?
With this dialectic word, sent by an Amberger, has been provided in the BR TV "We in Bayern" for intense thought.
But unlike in many previous days, the term remained in the series "Host me?" this time unraveled by the callers.
No, it wasn't a "man who's nervous."
And no one who needs to go "everything fast."
That, people heard from the TV moderator, is totally wrong.
On what the man from Amberg announced the solution and thus probably also provided for surprises in many upper floors.
"Der Huidler," the audience experienced, "is a glue with which one can exchange the oven."
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, who has been interviewed as an expert on Bavarian television for years, confirmed this.
With the observation that this is a typical top-level term, it somehow derives from the rather well-known word word "hounds".
What was a success of education - perhaps even for some who have lived in the area of Amberg for a long time.
I can't buy books for 2 weeks.
There is always the following error message after confirmation: oops - something is wrong - try again later.
I re-started the #PRS_ORG#gel#PRS_ORG#n, connected, synchronized and repaired with the PC.
It didn't help.
The tire choice in the race-cycle really is so cool?
This morning I am fully awake because I wanted at least a little training to prepare for my bicycle tour in the coming week.
I said, did and I went with my race bike, which I bought on eBay yesterday.
The first 40km were also really beautiful - but then what is going on in every city (this time: Thank you Krefeld!).
Glass splitter on the line.
Zack, loud boobs and my back tires didn't even want to take the rest of the track anymore.
Since I had no real opportunity because of the day of the week to get me a spare coat and a spare hose, I had to return with half a bad payback and take the first train home.
At the time, it was not so bad as to pay technically, maybe it is better if I do it with the tyre change before the bike tour.
But now I'm faced with a question and I hope you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long distance over several days before me, I would get extremely angry about this problem more often.
Now it wasn't really bad, because even the old tires from the previous owner (very nice old man, it was on the day I came to pick up the bike up to 14 o'clock 120km!) and who had already described it as suboptimal because he had been in the role with them for several years.
But if I think I have to make another tire change when I drive 80-90kms, then I think I'm really badly paid :D
Now I came to the conversation with an older man on the train trip, who wondered why I wouldn't have had the Marathon Plus tires; they should be indistinguishable.
Now, of course, the whole thing sounds very tempting.
But are these really so incomprehensible?
I have little desire to spend 40€/rip now, just to be disappointed.
Then I ask myself: I have at the moment on the racetrack I think 25x622.
There are also (probably?) at the Marathon Plus tires, but the majority is already larger.
Is this a problem?
Or would you recommend me to other tires at a race bike in general?
The wave side seems to be my absolute! Do you know how to recommend the Durano DD?
Thank you in advance for the help and loving greetings!

The 53-year-old was robbed on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten with his car for an unexplained cause against a medieval island and then hit the counterroads, as the police reported.
There it came to a frontal collision with the vehicle of a 27-year-old.
The 53-year-old car was then pushed against a tree and stuck in the car.
The 27-year-old and his 23-year-old companion were seriously injured in the accident and taken to surrounding hospitals.

After the release of our new High End broadband B 100-6 OHM it was only a matter of time before our SOLO series would be brought back to adulthood.
SOLO 15 is called the new Sprössling and is an optical reminder of the large samples with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, in this construction proposal an appropriate design foot is included directly in order to raise the speaker to the right position.
This has no influence on acoustics and can therefore be adjusted in length according to the circumstances at home.
In principle, the SOLO 15 is very well suited for people who have a more subordinated role in the maximum volume, but are expected to achieve an exceptionally high level.
A 10 cm loudspeaker is simply not able to create almost unfiltered such a large sound pressure level.
However, this does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, it grows considerably and is extremely impressive and accurate for its size.
Tonal was matched by the SOLO 15 with a slight high rise.
This is generally used in broadband to optimize the high frequency increasing bonding.
The SOLO 15 with very clear and fine sound convinces exactly on the hearing space.
It is easy to turn outside, the high-tone area can be reduced and the sound image is warmer.
Thanks to the point call source, the location of the individual components of a piece of music in the optimal stereo triangle is accurate and stunning.
The extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM provide a fine dynamic looking for the same.
The SOLO 15 not only complements our SOLO series but expands it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all of our construction sets, it is recommended to start thinking about the final optics of the speaker to plan appropriate changes in the construction.
For example, if you want to supply the case, the reduction of the speaker needs to be adjusted accordingly, since the furniture is again material.
After all the plates have been cut (e.g. in the construction market), you should first drill an 8 mm hole into the floor plate at the appropriate place to be able to run the cable safely later.
With the help of an overcrowd, the opening of the speaker in the front is now following, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be used legally later.
At the back this opening should be provided with a 45° phase to make the opening area of the speaker box as large as possible.
The four screwpoints of the B 100 - 6 OHM receive a break in the phase, as shown in the picture "Detail phase".
Then you start with the actual construction of the box and place one of the two sides on a level surface.
On these, the back wall, the ceiling, the front and the ground are lined up.
The three suspensions should also be used and glued.
The suspensions can vary in the material strength if necessary, for example, if you want to recover finished performance from the construction market instead of producing them from 16 mm MDF.
In the next step, the second page will be added.
Then follow all the plates of the foot, i.e. both sides, as well as the front.
The opening of the bass reflector tube as well as the connection mount on the back wall shall be facilitated by means of an appropriate hole or a drill hole.
Then you use a round hair to round up all the edges of the actual box.
The top of the plate can also be rounded.
Then the footplate is firmly glued with the foot of the housing and added with long wooden screws.
It follows the marking and front drilling (2,5-mm drills) of the screwing points of the loudspeaker box and the connection clamp.
After the wooden dust has been cleaned (absorbing/absorbing), you start by leaving the cable.
The simplest way to do this is through the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the back wall.
The entire and short cable is pushed for the piece through the 8 mm drilling in the foot to the terminal opening and allows it to stand about 30 cm out there.
In the upper part of the housing, the cable is used to open the speaker and it also allows it to hang loosely.
The frequency range is then prepared and used.
The construction plan of the frequency fluxes, as well as the corresponding connection plan can be taken from the following document: assembly instructions Weiche Solo 15.
If the frequency fluctuations are installed and the connection terminal tightens, the closing of the 8 mm cable opening is followed by the inside of the box, which is not completely closed.
Through the 35 mm BASSREFLEX opening and with something suitable, hot stickers can be dropped onto the opening and so closed.
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp you can check the closure accordingly.
Now the damping follows, according to the description.
The B 100 - 6 OHM is then connected and secured with the appropriate screws.
The polarity plays an important role in this, so that the plus line (marked cable) must be anchored at the pluspol of the speaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is shortened and inserted to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube).
For damping, a mat of the damping material is cut into two parts and lacquered into the case.
The opening around the bass reflex canal should be kept free.
Can I give up an order now and leave it to you at the beginning of June?
> Hello everyone,
> Finally, we can announce that we will reorganize the OSCAST this year!
> Unfortunately, for well-known reasons, it is not possible to get more than four people into the studio, which means a higher planning effort and explains the short term of the announcement.
ABER: There will be at least three people per switch, so we will follow the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
> We do our best to avoid delay or other problems.
But hey, it's still like before pandemic – yet we'll give everything to accompany the Oscars as entertainingly as possible.
> It will run out at about 0:30.
Have a cold drink, plan good food and prepare for a long but very interesting night.
