Members of the Assembly of Wales feared "to pass through Marretas"
There is a confusion on the part of some Members of the Assembly of Wales (AM) as to the suggestion that their title be changed to MWP.
The origin of this controversy is in the plans to change the name of the assembly to "Gaels Parliament".
Some members of this assembly, from all political backgrounds, feared that this would cause them to fall into ridicule.
One AM worker said the group is concerned about the fact that "the term "retired" with Twp and Pwp".
For non-galese readers: in the Welsh language, "twp" means "idiot" and pwp means "excrements".
An AM of Plaid said that the group in its global "was not satisfied" and suggested alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative Member said that the group was "open mind" about the change of name, but said that the MWP designation was literally very close to Muppet (Marreta).
In this context, the letter w in Welsh has a statement similar to that of the letter u in the English of Yorkshire.
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection has declared: "The final decision on how Members of the House are appointed will obviously be taken by themselves".
The Law of the Government of Wales of 2017 gave its Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, with general support for the proposal to appoint the Assembly as the "Gaels Parliament".
On the issue of the title of the AM, the Commission supported "Galês Parliament Members", or WMP, but the MWP option was more favoured in a public consultation.
It seems that the AMs are suggesting alternatives, but the effort to reach consensus can be a headache for President Elin Jones, who should present a draft legislation on amendments within a few weeks.
The reform legislation will include other amendments to the way in which the Assembly carries out its activities, such as rules on the disqualification of the AMs and the configuration of the committee system.
When they discuss legislation, the AMs will have the final word on how they should be designated.
Macedonians will refer to the change of country name
The voters will vote on Sunday on the change of their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was organized in an attempt to resolve a conflict of decades with the neighboring Greece, which integrates a province with the name of Macedonia.
Athens has been insisting that the name of its neighbor in the north constitutes a claim on its territory, having repeatedly raised objections to its requests for accession to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, opponent of the plebiscite on the change of name, said he would ignore the vote.
However, the supporters of the referendum, among them Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of name is no more than the price to be paid for accession to the EU and NATO.
The Sins of St. Martin settle in a moment when the churches of Harlem fight for survival
"In a historical perspective, the elders I spoke to told me that there was a bar and a church on each corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today, there's no one else."
The disappearance of the bars, he said, was understood.
"People socialize differently," he said today.
"The bars have stopped being the living rooms of the neighborhood where people go regularly."
As far as the churches are concerned, the possibility of the money gained with the sale of heritage does not last as long as the leaders expect" and that sooner or later, everything will return exactly to the point of departure."
The churches, added, can be replaced by buildings of apartments with condominiums inhabited by the type of people who will not support the sanctuaries of the neighborhood that still remain.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he said, "and therefore it will hasten the arrival of the day when these churches will all close, because it is unlikely that most of those who change to these complexes will join these congregations."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation left here in the 1930 ’ s.
The building was later established by a black congregation that carried out its worship in the immediate.
St. Martin's was occupied by a black congregation under the auspices of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott to the 125th Street lodgers, an important commercial street in Harlem that resisted the recruitment and promotion of black employees.
A fire in 1939 left the building severely damaged. However, when they made plans for its reconstruction, Father Johnson's parishioners ordered the carriage.
Rev. David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin's, proudly called the carriage "the ashes of the poor".
The specialist who touched the carriage in July called it something else: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
This specialist, Tiffany Ng, at the University of Michigan, also mentioned that it was the first carriage of the world to be played by a black musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who moved to the largest carriage in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said St. Martin's didn't replace him.
What happened in St. Martin's in recent months was a complicated story of architects and contractors, some brought by the lay leaders of the church and others by the episcopal diocese.
The parish council, the governing body of the parish composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July, expressing its concern that this "procurator would be able to pass over its costs", ill-fated by the fact that he was not involved in the recruitment of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Tuberoon causes injuries in 13-year-old adolescents in a laxative hunting dive in California
A Tubaron attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday during a hunting dive at the Lagosto in California on the first day of the Lagos season, the authorities said.
The attack occurred shortly after 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour how much he heard the boy screaming for help, then having ended up in his direction with a group to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said that he initially thought it was just enthusiasm for catching a lagostast, but then he realized that the boy was shouting "I was bitten"!
I was bitten!
The whole key area was dilated, Hammel described what he observed when he arrived at the boy.
"I cried out to everyone to get out of the water: "There's a tube in the water!" said Hammel.
The boy was transported by air to the Children's Hospital Council in San Diego, where he was admitted in critical condition.
We do not know the type of tuberon responsible for the attack.
Captain Larry Giles said in a press release that a tuberon had been detected in the area a few weeks before, but that it was considered not to belong to a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries at the top of the trunk.
The authorities closed access from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for research and security reasons.
Giles said there are more than 135 species of tubers in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK cosmetic market
Sainsbury's is competing with Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams with cosmetic sections in the style of large warehouses, supported by specialist assistants.
As part of a substantial initiative to gain a share in the UK cosmetics market, evaluated at 2.8 billion pounds, which has continued to grow as fashion and household clothing sales recover, these major cosmetics sections will be tested in 11 stores scattered around the country and will be implemented in more shops in the year that comes if their success is demonstrated.
This investment in cosmetics comes from the search by supermarkets in ways to use another exposure space used for TVs, microwaves and household articles.
Sainsbury's mentioned that it would duplicate its catalogue of beauty products with up to 3000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing ranges of L'Oréal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with brand areas similar to shops like Boots.
The supermarket network is also relaunching its Boutique makeup range so that most products comply with the vegan precepts, something increasingly required by younger buyers.
In addition, The Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two Sainsbury's shops, the first of which opened in Croydon, South London, last week. The second, in Selly Oak, Birmingham, is expected to open near the end of the year.
Online purchases and changing food purchase habits for small daily quantities in nearby stores have led supermarkets now to make more effort to persuade customers to visit their stores.
Mike Coupe, executive president of Sainsbury's, said that shops will become more and more like large warehouses, at a time when the supermarket chain is trying to combat Aldi and Lidl discount shops with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has come to install Argos sales points in hundreds of stores, and has also installed a series of Habitats, since he bought both chains two years ago, and claims that this has strengthened sales of merchandise products and made the most profitable acquisitions.
The company's previous attempt to renew its cosmetics and pharmacy departments was unsuccessful.
Sainsbury's tested a partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but the relationship ended after a difference on the distribution of revenues from health products stores in their supermarkets.
The new strategy arises after Sainsbury's three years sold its pharmaceutical business with 281 points of sale to Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds.
It was said by the company that Lloyds would participate in the plan by adding in four stores an extended range of luxury brands for skin care such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the appearance and essence of our cosmetics sections to provide our customers with a more pleasant environment.
We also invest in specialized training of colleagues, who will be available to advise the customer.
Our range of brands was designed to adapt to all needs. On the other hand, the inviting environment and practical locations make us now an irresistible point of sale of beauty products that breaks with the old ways of making purchases."
Peter Jones "urry" after Holly Willoughby left business of 11 million pounds
Peter Jones, the star of Dragons Den, was "furnished" after the TV shower Holly Willoughby had left a 11 million pounds business with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for the brand of articles for home and True accessories.
The business of both had been compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
This morning's presenter, 37 years old, announced in Instagram that he would abandon the partnership.
Holly Willoughby left the star of the Dragons Den Peter Jones live by abandoning the lucrative mark in the last minute to focus on its new highly cost-effective contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Some sources claim that Jones was "furnished" when the TV gold girl admitted, during a tight meeting last Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that his new business (the value of which may amount to 1.5 million pounds) meant that he would stop having time to dedicate himself to his brand of household articles and accessories True.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was expected to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at 11 million pounds.
While Willoughby, 37 years old, was announcing on Instagram that he would leave True, Jones was taking a plane to one of his foreign holiday homes.
One source said, "Truly was far above Holly's priorities.
It would mean a long-term resolution of its future and would be financial support for the next two decades.
His decision to leave left everyone absolutely scared.
No one believed what was going on on Tuesday... was so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of articles ready to sell at Marlow headquarters."
Experts believe that the output of this morning’s presenter, who is among Britain’s most lucrative veettes, can cost millions to the company, given the advanced investment in products, which go from pillows and candles to clothing and household articles, and the potential for additional delays in the launch.
In addition, it can mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, with three children, and husband Dan Baldwin, are close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp ten years ago.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52 years old, joined the project as president in March.
Couples take vacations together and Jones has a 40% share in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is about to become a brand ambassador to the M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the I'm The Celebrity of the ITV.
A nearby source from Jones said last night that "We do not intend to comment on your business".
Hard conversation "and then we fell in love"
The North American President has mentioned the criticisms that it would be the aim of the media to make a comment that some would consider "indecent of a president" and to reveal such a positive attitude with the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give in?
Trump said, in his fictitious voice of "telejournal pivo".
"I didn't give up on anything."
He mentioned that Kim is interested in a second meeting after his initial meeting in Singapore in June, stressing that it would be a major step in the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations for denuclearisation are lagging behind.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders at the UN General Assembly that North does not see a "response" from the United States at the first steps towards the disarmament of North Korea.
Instead, he said, the US continues with sanctions designed to maintain pressure.
Trump adopted a more optimistic point of view in his speech at the beginning.
"It's running very well with North Korea," he said.
"We were about to go into war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been dead.
Now we have this excellent relationship."
Trump said his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim led to positive results: the end of fire tests, support for the release of hostages and the return to the country of the mortal remains of US military.
In addition, he defended his in public approach when he spoke in his relations with Kim.
"It's so easy to be worthy of a president, but instead of we have 10,000 people out there trying to get into this super lotted arena, we'd have about 200 people standing right here," Trump said, pointing to the crowd directly in front of them.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia cause devastation on an island, causing hundreds of people to die
In the heat of the Lombok earthquake, for example, it was told foreign non-governmental organizations that they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of the Lombok population had been displaced, no national disaster was declared, a prerequisite for channelling international aid.
"Unfortunately, they have in many cases been clear to say that they are not asking for international assistance; therefore, it becomes a little difficult," Mrs Sumbung said.
Although Save the Children is organizing a team that will go to Palu, there is no guarantee that foreign personnel can work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster response agency, said that the Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to determine whether it would be possible for the international agencies to contribute to the aid effort.
Despite the constant earthquakes of land suffered by Indonesia, the country remains extremely poorly prepared for the wrath of nature.
Although they have been built in Aceh, tsunami shelters are not regularly observed in other coastal lines.
It is likely that the apparent lack of a series of tsunami alarms in Palu, a bad degree of the validity of a warning, had contributed to the loss of lives.
In the most favorable times, traveling among many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship parked in Lombok to treat the victims of earthquakes is on the way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the place of this new disaster.
President Joko Widodo, who made the improvement of the infrastructure decrypts a central part of his campaign, spent enormous amounts on roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding struck Mr. Joko's executive, at a time when he faced his re-election in the coming year.
The president is also being pressured by the persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority adopted a more conservative form of their faith.
Over 1,000 people died and tens of thousands were evicted while Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets using catanas, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
See: Daniel Sturridge from Liverpool makes a long finish for the empathic neck against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved a Liverpool from a defeat at the Premier League against Chelsea, with a goal on the 89th minute on Saturday at the Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri when he was about 30 metres from Chelsea's luggage, with his team losing 1-0.
He gave a touch to his left before making a finish towards the second beam.
In the attempt, the ball flew high over the big area by heading to the top right corner of the network.
In the end, the ball fell on a Kepa Arrizabalaga on flight and fell inside the network.
"I was just trying to reach this position, to go to the ball, and the players like Shaq made the most of it, so I was just getting as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw the Kante coming, I gave a touch, and I didn't think too much about it. I just finished."
Chelsea won 1-0 at the interval after marking a goal in the 25th minute, from the Belgian star Eden Hazard.
In this game, the advance of the blues gave a walk back to Mateo Kovacic before unmarking near the midfield and performing a sprint towards the Liverpool area.
Kovacic made a quick midfield pass.
Then he accomplished a beautiful ending that passed through the opposing defense, leading Hazard to the great area.
This exceeded the defenses and made the goal against the second beam network with a finish with the left foot that passed through the Alsson Becker's Liverpool network.
Liverpool faces Naples in the group phase of the Champions League at three in the afternoon of Wednesday, at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton at the UEFA European League at three in the afternoon of Thursday in London.
Number of deaths in the tsunami in Indonesia rises to 832
The number of deaths in the earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia rose to 832, the country's disaster response agency declared early Sunday.
There are reports that describe a large number of people imprisoned in the ruins of buildings that broke out during the magnitude 7.5 earthquake on Friday, which triggered waves that reached 6 meters high, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesman of the agency, said at a press conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with the ruins of the buildings that had disappeared.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man for suspected murder after a woman's demise to death
A murder investigation was initiated after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The victim, at 44 years of age, was found at 7:55 in the morning with cutting gun injuries in Grayson Mews, John Street, having a 32-year-old man arrested for suspected murder.
The police urged the population of the area that could have witnessed something to give information.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is at an early stage, but I would like to appeal to all those who were in John Street's immediate presence in Birkenhead and who were present to contact us.
I also want to appeal to those who may have obtained images with board cameras, particularly taxi drivers, that contact us, because they may have crucial information for the investigation."
A spokesperson for the police confirmed that the woman whose body was found was resident in Birkenhead and was located within a property.
This afternoon, friends who believe to know the victim went to the scene to investigate the location where she had been found this morning.
The investigations are under way, with the police saying that they are currently informing relatives close to the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to access his apartment, but was informed by the police that entrances or exits from the building are prohibited.
When he was informed about what had happened, he was speechless.
The residents are now being informed that they will only be able to return to their homes from time to time.
A police officer was heard telling a man that the entire area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene bathed in tears.
He repeatedly says that "it's so horrible."
At two o'clock in the afternoon, two police vans were within the cordon and another was parked in the area immediately outside.
A number of police officers were highlighted inside the cordon to monitor the apartment building.
We ask those who have information that you contact by DM @MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers by number 0800 555 111 indicating the registration 247 of 30 September.
Parliament's Cromwell statue has become the most recent monument swallowed by the contents of "historic revisionism"
Their removal would constitute an act of poetic justice for their destruction, which recalls the perpetuity of the Taliban, of so many English cultural and religious artifacts, and which was carried out by their fanatic Puritan followers.
However, Cromwell Society described Crick's suggestion as "a crazy" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable, in the current debate on the removal of statues, that Oliver Cromwell's figure next to the Palace of Westminster would become an aim to be abolished.
The iconoclasty of British civil wars was not ordered or carried out by Cromwell.
Maybe the wrong Cromwell is being sacrificed by the acts of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell, by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's author, is a testimony to the opinion of the 19th century and from the history of a figure that many still believe to be worthy of honor.
Goldsmith said to Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is faced by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course, of the monarchy.
Whether or not this is a precise description is the subject of a continuing historical debate.
What is true is that the 17th-century conflict has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and that Cromwell is a figure of individual fame that represents one side of this division.
Your successes as Lord Protector are also worthy of honor and commemoration."
Pig killer attacks and kills Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a southwestern China market, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his so-called "Yuan", was found dead, with a cut and covered blood artery, close to a pouch on the market in Liupanshui, in the province of Guizhou, read in the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
The pig breeder prepares to inject pigs into a pig breed on May 30, 2005, in Xining, Qinghai province, China.
According to reports, you will have traveled with the cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered a door for an open neighbor.
In that pouch, he said, there was a big male pig with blood in his mouth.
A forensic analysis confirmed that the pig, with 227 pounds, had attacked the pig farmer until death, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were covered with blood and broken, said the cousin, referred to by his so-called "Wu", according to the Guiyang Evening News.
The security cameras show Yuan entering the market at 440 in the morning on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been closed to prevent other people from attacking while the police collected evidence at the scene.
Reports say that the Yuan family and the market authorities are negotiating compensation for their death.
Although rare, cases of pigs' attacks on human beings have already been reported.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in her fifth in Massachusetts, leaving the man with serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a 300-pound pig immobilized a Welsh farm against its tractor until the woman managed to scare the animal.
After an Oregon farmer had been eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that the smell of blood can work as "stimulation".
"They're just kidding.
They like to scream, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
We only need to show them due respect," he said.
Restoration of the Rosa hurricane should bring heavy generalized rain to the southwest of the United States
As expected, the Rosa hurricane is weakening as it moves on the coldest waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, it will bring torrential rains to all the north of Mexico and to the southwest of the United States in the coming days.
At 5 a.m., Eastern Time on Sunday, Rosa caused riots of 137 km/h, a Category 1 hurricane, located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
However, it begins to form a depression on the Pacific Ocean that moves to the west coast of the United States. As it approaches the peninsula of Baja California, Rosa, now a tropical storm, will begin to push a strong tropical humidity towards the north in the south-west area of the United States.
On Monday, it will cause precipitation that can reach 25 mm in certain areas of Mexico.
At that time, tropical humidity interacting with the approximate depression will produce strong rains widespread in the southwest in the coming days.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 mm of rain may cause dangerous sudden floods, inundated with damage and possibly landslides in the desert.
The strong tropical humidity will cause precipitation that can reach 5-7 mm in point areas, especially in parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
There were expected to be up to 5 to 10 mm precipitation in southwest areas, especially on most of Arizona.
Sudden floods are possible with conditions of rapid deterioration due to the scattered nature of tropical rains.
It is highly advisable to walk in the desert on foot with the threat of tropical rains.
Strong precipitation may cause the desfiladers to become brave rivers and the finds will bring strong peak winds and dust clouds.
The approaching depression will bring with it strong precipitation on parts of the southern California coast line.
Total precipitations of more than 12 mm are possible, which may cause small damage and steep roads.
This may be the first precipitation of the wet station in the region.
Some tropical aquariums will begin to take place in Arizona at the end of Sunday and at the beginning of Monday, before the rain becomes more scattered at the end of Monday and on the third.
The heavy rain will spread in the Four Corners on Tuesday and last until the fourth.
The month of October can record strong changes in temperature throughout the U.S. territory as the Arctic cools down. However, tropical areas will remain quite fine.
Sometimes this leads to drastic temperature changes in short distances.
There is an excellent example of the dramatic temperature differences across the central area of the United States on Sunday.
There is a difference of almost 11 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the coming days, the constant summer heat will tend to increase and expand again.
It is hoped that most of the central and eastern areas of the United States will start in October with temperatures of between 27 and 30 degrees from the South Plains to parts of the Northeast.
The city of New York can reach the 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 5.5 degrees above the average.
Our long-term forecast indicates a high probability of temperatures occurring above the average in the eastern United States until the end of the first half of October.
Over 20 million people attended Brett Kavanaugh's audience
More than 20 million people attended six television stations yesterday at Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Supreme Court, and the woman who accused him of sexual abuse allegedly occurring in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continued, with the stations interrupting regular programming due to a turnaround of the last hour: an agreement drawn up by the Senator of Arizona Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Commission that he had absolute confidence that Kavanaugh had drunk her while trying to get her off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in an inflamed testimony, said he had absolute confidence that such a thing did not happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people, numbered by Nielsen on Friday, attended the hearing.
The company accounted for the average number of viewers in the CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC chains.
The numbers of other stations that transmitted it were not yet available, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen generally has difficulty measuring hearings of those who see programs in offices.
To give some perspective, this is a level of hearings similar to the end of an American football game or the Oscars ceremony.
Fox News Channel, whose commentators gave their strong support to Kavanaugh's appointment, led all television stations with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the hearing that lasted all day, referred to Nielsen.
The ABC was in second place with 3.26 million spectators.
Next comes CBS with 3.1 million, NBC with 2.94 million, MSNBC with 2.89 million and CNN with 2.52 million, referred to Nielsen.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure of the Friday drama.
After the cabinet of the moderate Republican issued a statement stating that his vote would be in favour of Kavanaugh, the senator was arrested by the CNN and CBS Chambers on Friday morning to be verbally attacked by protesters when he tried to enter a lift to address a hearing of the Judicial Commission.
The senator remained immovable to look at the floor while he was directly criticized for CNN cameras.
"I'm here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told that "you have power while so many women have no power."
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator door closes, that he would have more to say in the committee hearing.
The cable and broadcasting stations were all covering the event in direct hours later, when the Judicial Commission voted to make Kavanaugh's appointment continue for a vote in plenary session of the Senate.
However, Flake said that he would only do so in the understanding that the FBI would investigate charges against the nominee during the next week, something the democratic minority had been demanding.
Flake was partly convinced after talks with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and, later, with some other senators, he made his decision.
Flake's choice was decisive, since it was clear that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump opened an investigation by the FBI into allegations against Kavanaugh.
Prime Minister May accuses critics of "making political" with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused the critics of his plans to abandon the European Union of "making political" with Britain's future and of harming national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
Theresa May, British Prime Minister, arrives at the Conservatory Conference in Birmingham, Britain, on 29 September 2018.
Another interview he gave on the first page of the paper, his former foreign minister Boris Johnson reinforced his attack on what is known as the "Checkers Plan" of the Minister for Brexit, saying that a proposal that provides that Britain and the EU cover the rates of the other side is "totally absurd".
Wayde Sims murder: police arrests suspect Dieteon Simpson of the LSU player's death
Police arrest a suspect of Sims' death shooting, a 20-year-old basketball player in LSU.
Dieteon Simpson, 20 years old, was arrested and charged with second-degree murder, according to a communication from the Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, with the police claiming that Sims lost his eyes during the fight.
The police recovered them from the scene and said they had found Simpson's DNA in them, told WAFB, a CBS branch.
After questioning Simpson, the police reported that he had killed Wayde with a gun of fire.
A loan of USD 350 000 was established, the lawyer said.
The medical office of the parish of East Baton Rouge issued a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was a bullet wound in the head extending to the neck.
The department reports that the collaboration of the action group of the State Police of Louisiana, the criminal lab of the state police, the Southern University police and residents of the area who collaborated in the investigation led to this arrest.
The athletic director of the LSU, Joe Aleva, thanked the authorities in the area for their "diligence and effort to obtain justice".
Yeah, he was 20 years old.
This advanced 1.98 m high grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the LSU.
Its average was 5.6 points and 2.6 highlights per game in the last season.
On Friday morning, LSU's basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "damaged" and "in shock" for Wayde's death.
"That's what we're worried about forever," Wade said.
Volcano throws ashes into Mexico City
Ascents from the Volcano Popocatepetl reached the southern districts of the capital of Mexico.
The National Centre for Disaster Prevention advised the Mexicans on Sunday to stay away from the volcano after a resume of activity on the crater, which recorded 183 gas and ashes emissions in a 24-hour space.
The center detected numerous noises and tremors.
Images on the social networks showed fine layers of ashes covering the car bristles in neighborhoods of Mexico City like Jochimilco.
Geophysics recorded an increase in the activity of the volcano, located 72 kilometres from the capital, since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake hit the central area of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Comparisons between the Catalan police and separatists before the anniversary of the vote for independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after clashing between independent protesters and the intervention police, while thousands of people joined the rival demonstrations to mark the first birthday of the polarizer referring to Catalan on the secession.
A group of masked separatists, trapped by the intervention police, reached her with eggs and threw ink into the dust, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets that are usually filled with tourists.
There were also later confrontations, in which the police used the batons to contain the conflicts.
For a few hours, independent groups who sang "We don't forget, we don't forgive" faced Unionist protestors, who were shouting "Long Life for Spain".
Fourteen people have received treatment for minor injuries suffered in protests, can be read in the local press.
The tensions remain high in the region inclined to independence, one year after the October 1 referendum which was considered illegal by Madrid, but which was celebrated by the Catalan separatists.
The electors chose the independence segregatedly, although the flow to the urns had been low, with a majority boycott of those against.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to block the current vote at voting tables distributed by the region, resulting in violent confrontations.
Independent groups had camped during the night on Friday to prevent a demonstration of support to the national police.
Although this event was performed, it was forced to take a different path.
Narcis Termes, 68 years old, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had any hope that Catalonia would become independent.
"Last year, we lived our best moments.
I saw my parents cry for joy because they can vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Although they have won a vital but tangential victory in the regional elections in December last, the Catalan independent parties have had difficulties maintaining the momentum this year, with their most known leaders in voluntary exile or in detention waiting for judgment on their role in the organization of the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of the police with his cell phone, said the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
"It's becoming more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been waiting for a trial since last year, announced that he would apply to the European Parliament in the next year's elections.
"Presenting me as a candidate for European elections is the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression we see on the part of the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: men arrested after a car crash against a house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car hit repeatedly in a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m., British summer time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage occurred in the gates and in the building itself.
At a certain point, someone may also have shot a beast against the car.
Menga attack gives a 1-0 victory to Livingston against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston assured the victory
Livingston, promoted to the first division, spooked the Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard the second defeat of only two in 18 games as an Ibrox club technician.
Dolly Menga's attack made the difference, at a time when Gary Holt's team changes from level, with the Hibernian in second place.
The Gerrard team, which continues without a win out of the house in the first division this season, faces the Hearts leaders with more than eight points next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers will face the Rapid Vienna at the European League at home on Thursday.
However, Livingstone has extended its succession to six games without defeats in the division, with the main coach Holt without losing once since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston loses opportunities against disturbed visitors
Holt's team should have gone ahead in the marker long before the goal, because the incisive character of their game was causing all kinds of problems to Rangers.
Scott Robinson stepped into the defense, but he let himself be dragged in front of the trunk and then Alan Lithgow could only steer his efforts far after he had failed to find Craig Halkett's head on the trunk.
The house team was pleased to let Rangers play before it, knowing that it could cause problems for visitors in the stop-ball games.
And that's how the crucial goal came up.
Rangers gave a book and Livingston got an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson coordinated to take the pass to Menga, which gave a touch and marked from the center of the big area.
At this point, Rangers dominated the ball's possession, but he faced a defense from the impenetrable house team, and the security guard Liam Kelly didn't have much trouble.
This pattern continued in the second part, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to defend himself.
Scott Pittman was frustrated by the Rangers' network guard's feet, Allan McGregor, and Lithgow gave a shot away from another liveston stop ball game.
They continued crossings to the large area of Livingston, which were subsequently resolved, and two claims of great criminality, one after Halkett's investment on the Glenn Middleton substitution and the other after one hand, were rejected by the arbitrator.
Livingstone Phenomenal - Analysis
Alasdair Lamont, from BBC Scotland, to Tony Macaroni Arena
A performance and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
They were excellent without exception, continuing to exceed expectations in this ascending trajectory.
His game style and staff have changed little since his return to the great teams, but it is necessary to praise Holt for the way he galvanized the eleven since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was tremendous, getting an extremely well-organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall to give his best throughout the game.
Anyway, Rangers has revealed little inspiration.
Despite the excellent quality shown sometimes with Gerrard, the team was very busy with these standards.
Their final play was not inspired (only once they managed to open the team of the house), being a kind of warning to the Rangers, which is located in the middle of the table.
Erdogan is received ambiguably in Colonia
There were smiles under a blue sky on Saturday (September 29th) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for a breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, whose aim was to repair relations between NATO allies.
The difference involved issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's access to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Colony to launch a new and gigantic mosque.
The city houses the largest Turkish population outside its country.
The police claimed security reasons to prevent a crowd of more than 25 000 people from meeting in front of the mosque, but many supporters marked presence in the immediate to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, were also heard, condemning both the president's policies and the German government's decision to host him in the country.
Antagonist protests reflect the divisive character of a visitor hailed as a hero by some German Turks and hated as an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies in collision with car
A cyclist died in a collision involving a car in London.
The accident occurred near the crossing of Bestwood Street with Evelyn Street, a street moving in Deptford, west of the city, close to 10 a.m., time of British summer.
The driver of the trip stopped and a rescue team intervened, but the cyclist died at the scene.
This collision occurs months after the death of another cyclist in a collision with escape on Childers Street, about a mile and a half of the Saturday accident.
The Metropolitan Police said the agents are trying to identify the person and inform his family.
Barriers and diversions were placed for buses, and drivers were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: six agents injured in disorders
Six prison agents were injured in disturbances in a high-security male prison, the Prison Office said.
The ongoing disturbances began at the HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire about 0930, British summer time on Saturday.
Special agents were called "Tornado" to solve the problem, which involves eight prisoners and is restricted to a wing.
Agents received treatment for small facial injuries at the site.
A spokesperson for the Prison Services said: "Specially trained teams were used to resolve the ongoing incident at the HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and it must be clear that the names of the responsible persons will be communicated to the police and they will be able to spend more time behind the ranks."
HMP Long Lartin accommodates more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had to receive hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
In addition, in October last year, agents from the intervention police were called to resolve a serious disturbance in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Furacão Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (the areas affected by the drought can benefit)
It is rare a tropical depression to reach Arizona, but it is exactly what is expected for the beginning of next week, when the remaining energy of the Rosa hurricane crosses the South-West Desert, implying the risk of sudden floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued notices of sudden flooding for Monday and Tuesday, for the southern and eastern parts of Nevada, for southern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
It is hoped that Rosa will take a direct route on Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching the end of Monday with rain.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix referred to a tweet that only "ten tropical cycles have maintained a state of tropical storm or depression in a radius of 300 km from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that passed 60 km from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Furakons Center provide 5 to 10 mm of precipitation, with isolated quantities that can reach 15 mm in the Arizona Mogollon Rim.
Other areas of the South-West Desert, such as the Central Rocky Mountains and the Great Bacia, will be able to receive 3 to 5 mm, with the possibility of all isolated that can reach 10 mm.
For those not affected by the risks of sudden floods, the rain of the Rosa can be a blessing because the region is affected by the drought.
Although floods are a very serious concern, part of this precipitation can be beneficial because the southwest is currently being affected by drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, little more than 40% of Arizona suffers at least extreme drought, the second most serious category," weather.com reported.
First of all, the Rosa hurricane will reach the continental mass through the peninsula of Baja California, Mexico.
Rosa, still with force of hurricane on Sunday morning, with winds at maximum speeds of 137 km/h, is 619 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico, moving north at a speed of 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific, so it is weakening.
Thus, it is expected that it will reach the coastal area in Mexico with tropical storm force in the afternoon or when it falls from Monday night.
Strong precipitation may occur in parts of Mexico, causing a significant risk of flooding.
"Total precipitation is expected from 8 to 10 mm from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with a maximum possible precipitation of 25 mm," weather.com reported.
Rosa will then head north, crossing Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the first hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression. It will then head south of Utah in the last hours of Tuesday night.
"The main expected danger of the Rose or its reefs is the very high precipitation in Baja California, northwest of Sonora, and in the South-West Desert of the United States," said the National Hurricane Center.
These rains are expected to produce sudden and inundated floods of destruction in the deserts, at risk of life, and floods in mountainous lands.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: four arrested for attempted murder
Three male adolescents and a 20-year-old man were arrested for suspected murder after a 16-year-old boy had been found with cutting gun injuries in Somerset.
The adolescent was found injured in the area of the Excelsior Terrace of Midsomer Norton, near 4 p.m., British summer time on Saturday.
It was transported to the hospital, where it remains "stable".
They were arrested during the night a 17-year-old teenager, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man in the Radstock area, reported Avon and Somerset police.
The agents have called on everyone who can have mobile footage of the incident.
Trump said that Kavanaugh "was a victim of evil and rage" of the Democratic Party
"A vote by Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the irreplaceable and ultrasonic tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said in a commission in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh "was a victim of evil and rage" of the Democratic Party during his appointment process.
Kavanaugh testified before the Congress on Thursday, with a strong and emotionally dejected accusation by Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually abused her for decades when they were both teenagers.
Ford also testified in the hearing on his claim.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people bore witness to Kavanaugh's brilliance, quality and courage that day.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a brilliant public service curriculum," said the multitudes of supporters of West Virginia.
The President later referred to the appointment of Kavanaugh when he spoke of the importance of republican influence on the polls in the inter-local elections.
"We are five weeks from one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not competing, but I'm actually competing," he said.
"That's why I went all over the place fighting for excellent candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats are in a mission of "resistance and obstruction.
The first procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh is scheduled to take place by Friday at the latest, he said to CNN a principal deputy of the direction of the Republican Party.
Hundreds of earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia; the number continues to rise
At least 384 people died, many of them drawn by the giant waves that hit the beaches, when a great earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, the authorities reported on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when waves with up to six meters of altitude hit the beach while they were getting late, dragging many to death and causing a trail of devastation on their way.
The tsunami occurred following a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"When the threat of tsunamis arose yesterday, people were still in their activities on the beach and did not run away immediately, having been victims of the accident," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the agency to reduce the impact of Indonesian disasters (BNPB) in a Jacarta communication.
"The tsunami didn't move by itself: it dragged cars, trunks, houses, it hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami moved in the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h before reaching the coastal line.
Some people climbed the trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Public air photographs by the agency show many buildings and shops destroyed, deformed and demolished bridges, and a mesquite surrounded by water.
The coastal city continued to be shaken by replicas on Saturday.
The earthquake series was felt in an area of 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) reported in a statement that energy released by the massive Friday's applause was about 200 times the power of the nuclear bomb released on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, located at the end of a long and narrow bay, may have amplified the size of the tsunami, is read in the statement.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had disappeared.
Bodies of some victims were found trapped under the ruins of the deserted buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were found missing.
Nugroho reported that the number of victims and damage can be deeper along the coast line 300 km north of Palu, an area called Dongala, closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications "were completely incapacitated and there was no information" about Dongala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 inhabitants in the area," said the Red Cross in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading towards the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse," he said.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not reporting that a tsunami had hit Palu, although the authorities had claimed that the waves had arisen at the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur filming released on social networks, you can see a man on the top floor of a building shouting frenzy notices that the tsunami was approaching, for people on the street below.
In a minute, a water wall fell on the coast, dragging buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the filming.
The earthquake and tsunami caused an extensive cut of energy that interrupted communications in the Palu area, which made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the rescue efforts.
The army began to send cargo aircraft with Jacarta's help and other cities. However, the evacuations still desperately need food and other basic products.
The airport of the city was reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo marked a visit to Palau's evacuation centres on Sunday.
The number of deaths in the tsunami in Indonesia increases exponentially to more than 800.
It's very bad.
Although he has managed to reach the city of Palu safely, where employees are housed in shelters of lona mounted in the courtyard of his offices, the staff of the World Vision of Dongala went through the stage of devastation on their way, said Mr. Doseba.
"They told me they saw many houses destroyed," he said.
It's very bad.
Even when the aid groups began to initiate the dark disaster assistance tasks, some complained that the highly experienced foreign aid workers were being prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and foreign personnel can only be accessed if they are declared "national disaster zone".
That hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a provincial disaster," said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for the Red Cross in Indonesia.
"As soon as the government says "OK, this is a national disaster", we can open the doors to international assistance, but this status still does not exist."
As the second night fell in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and relatives of the still missing remained hopeful that their loved ones would be part of the miracles that weakened the dark manchets of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a boy was removed from an exit.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who had been trapped in the trash for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandano, coach of the national Indonesian parachute team, had trained two of his missing athletes for the Asian Games, completed at the beginning of this month in Indonesia.
Other prisoners at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandadi, were their students.
"As a senior parachute practitioner, I have to carry my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon said that in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel began to circulate among the parachute community, he desperately sent messages at WhatsApp to the sportsmen of Palu, who were participating in the festival on the beach.
However, their messages produced only a grey check mark instead of a pair of blues.
"I think that means that the messages were not delivered," he said.
Thieves take 26 750 USD during automatic box resupply in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 to a Brink's employee who resupplyed an automatic box in Newport on the Levee, according to a report from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car was emptying an automatic box in the entertainment complex and preparing to introduce more money, says Detective Dennis McCarthy in the communiqué.
While he was busy, another man "sucked up behind Brink's officer" and stole a bag of money for a delivery.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the area, according to the statement, but the police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their identities should contact the Newport police through number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper change your name to Ye
The Kanye West rapper has changed his name--to Ye.
In announcing this change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The being previously known by Kanye West."
West, 41 years old, received some Ye and used it as the title of her eighth album, released in June.
The change comes before your participation in Saturday Night Live, where you are expected to present your new Yandhi album.
This intervention is intended to replace that of the singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled it for "emotional reasons", informed the creator of the show.
At the same time as an abbreviation of his current professional name, the word has a religious meaning for him, according to West.
"I think "ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "you," said West at the beginning of this year, when he commented on the title of his album with the Big Boy radio presenter.
"So it's you, it's us, it's us.
Come from Kanye, which means "the only one", for only Ye - being just a reflection of our good, of our evil, of our confusion, of everything.
The album is another reflection of whom we are."
Kanye is part of a series of famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs was known alternately by Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
Former West collaborator, JAY-Z, also used variations of his name with or without hyphen and capital.
In Mexico, AMLO undertakes not to resort to military forces against civilians
Mexican elected president Andres Manuel López Obrador committed himself not to use military force against civilians, at a time when the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of a bloody rebate against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza "never use the army to suppress the Mexican people".
Militarys fired against a peaceful demonstration on the square on October 2, 1968, resulting in a number of deaths that may have risen to 300, when leftist student movements were deployed throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador committed himself to supporting young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to those they study and opening more public universities.
The president said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities drag young people into gangs of criminals.
The US should double the financing of artificial intelligence
At a time when China is strengthening its activity in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the research costs in this field, said the investor and professional in the Kai-Fu Lee area, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments take place after several U.S. government departments have made announcements related to IA, even though the country does not have a comprehensive formal strategy on this matter.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: it intends to lead innovation in IA by 2030.
"Duplicateing the research budget in IA would be a good start, since all the other countries are so behind the US and we are looking for the new revolution in IA," Lee said.
Duplicate funding could double the assumptions of the next great success of the IA to be achieved by the United States, Lee referred to NBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, a company that invested in one of the most prominent companies in IA in China, the Face++.
In the 1980s, at the University of Carnegie Mellon, he worked on an IA system that defeated Othello's best-class American player. Later, he performed executive functions at Microsoft Research and was president of the Google branch in China.
Lee gave credit to the previous technological contests of the U.S. government such as the Robotics Challenge of the Department of Defence for Advanced Research Projects Agency and asked when it would be next, in order to help identify the next visionaries.
US researchers often have to make a great effort to obtain state funding, Lee said.
"It's not China that's stealing academic leaders; it's companies," he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technological companies have hired universities to work in IA.
Lee said that changes in immigration policies could also help the US to boost its efforts in the field of IA.
"It was the opinion that green cards should be automatically granted to doctors in IA," he said.
The Chinese State Council presented its Plan for the Development of the Artificial Intelligence of the Next Generation in July 2017.
The Chinese National Foundation of Natural Sciences provides funding for people in academic institutions in a similar way to that used by the National Science Foundation and other government organizations to fund researchers in the United States. However, the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, which is intended to involve partners in industry and the academic environment, and the White House announced the formation of the Restraint Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, DARPA announced this month an investment of $2 billion in an initiative designated by AI Next.
As far as NSF is concerned, it currently invests more than USD 100 million a year in IA research.
However, the US legislation that was intended to set up a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence is not moving forward for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on the change of country name
The Macedonians voted on Sunday to decide on the change of the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia", an initiative that would resolve a decade-long dispute with Greece that blocked its requests for accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which forms part of a province called Macedonia, insists that the name of its northern neighbour represents a claim on its territory and vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments signed an agreement in June based on the proposal for a new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would be a blow to the ethnic identity of the Macedonian population, mostly slaves.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign raised doubts as to whether the flow to the urns would be sufficient to meet the 50% required for the referendum to be valid.
The rapporteur's question was: "Is it in favour of joining NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters for the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is worth paying to continue the accession efforts in agencies with the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I come today to vote for the future of our country, for the young people in Macedonia, so that they can live free under the auspices of the European Union, because this means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, a sufficient number of Members of Parliament said that they would respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
The change of name would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The National Elections Committee stated that there had been no record of irregularities until one afternoon.
However, the fluctuation was only 16% compared to 34% obtained in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of registered voters came to vote.
"We will vote for my children; our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a capital elector, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko vote in the referendum on the change of country name, which would open the doors for their accession to NATO and the European Union, Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and placed chairs in front of the tents mounted by which they would boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads up and not the service door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to receive us as Macedonia, we can address others as China and Russia to become part of the Eurasian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO entry will bring much needed investments to Macedonia, which accounts for a unemployment rate above 20%.
"I believe that the overwhelming majority will be in favour, as more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after giving his vote.
According to him, a "yes" would be the "confirmation of our future".
A survey published on Monday by the Macedonian Political Research Institute revealed that between 30 and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum, a value below the required level.
Another survey, conducted by the Telma TV in Macedonia, found that 57% of the respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote.
For the success of the referendum, fluency must be more than 50% more than one vote.
The failure of the referendum would represent the first major failure in the policy of the pro-Western government since it took possession in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero do Manchester City across all Brighton's defense towards the goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling forgot Brighton's defense in victory for 2-0 against Manchester City on Saturday, at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
I'll make it look ridiculously easy on your throat in minute 65.
The Argentinian advanced received a pass in the middle of the field at the beginning of the play.
He scored a sprint between three Brighton defenses before cutting to reach an open field.
He was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He made a defense before neutralizing in the race others within the limits of the great area of Brighton.
Then he took a walk to his left, where he was Sterling.
The advanced English used its first touch in the big area to return the ball to Aguero, who, with the right boot, defeated Brighton Mathew Ryan's nets with a finish on the right side of the network.
"Yesterday he's having some trouble at his feet," he told reporters Pep Guardiola, city coach.
"We said he'd play for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky for him to have marked a goal at that time."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage against the Premier League.
That hunger was marked at 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball well in Brighton's territory in that game.
He made a pass on the defenses along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
This gave some touch before driving Sterling towards the second line.
The Sky Blues advance hit the ball to the net immediately before sliding off the edge of the field.
The city faces Hoffenheim in the group phase of the Champions League at 1255 noon on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to make Rockies' life difficult
With the Nationals removed from the end, there were not many reasons to force another start.
However, the always competitive Scherzer has hopes of entering the field on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are implications relative to the end for the Rockies, which hold a leadership of a game about the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies were at least lucky with a victory of 5-2 against the Nationals on Friday night, but they still intend to secure their title of the first division.
"Although we are playing for nothing, at least we can go into the field knowing that the environment here in Denver, with the crowd, the other team will probably play at the highest level that I could face this year.
Why would I not want to compete under those conditions?"
The Nationals have not yet announced the headline launcher for Sunday, but there are some who say they are inclined to allow Scherzer to carry out the launches in this situation.
Scherzer, who would begin his 34th, took a session in the bullpen on Thursday and would throw in his normal position on Sunday.
Washington's right player goes with 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 entries this season.
Trump makes a start in Western Virginia
The President later mentioned the situation involving his election to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, as he mentioned the importance of republican influence in the inter-Caal elections.
"All we've done is in the game in November.
We are five weeks from one of the most important elections in our lives.
This is one of the big, big... I'm not competing, but I'm competing and that's why I'm everywhere fighting for excellent candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "They're seeing this horrible, horrible group of radical democrats, they're seeing it happen right now.
And they're determined to regain power using all the necessary means.
They don't care who they attack, who they have to pass over to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, and we won't give them."
The Democrats, he said, have the task of "resisting and obstructing".
"And they've seen it in the last four days," he said, calling it "aggressive, evil, filthy and false" to the Democrats.
The President referred to the name of Diane Feinstein, a member of the Senate Judicial Committee, and received public sounds.
"Do you remember your answer?
Did you get the escape of the document?
Whoa, whoa, what?
No, um, I, wait, one - that was a really bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party has ceased to be inclusive.
It is intolerant to those who openly give their opinion
When the Momentum activists of my local party organization voted to censor me, it was not a surprise to me.
At the end of the day, I am the most recent of a number of working Members in Parliament who have been told that they are not welcome - all because we openly express our opinions.
My colleague in this House, Joan Ryan, was the target of similar treatment because he was resolutely opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship motion criticized me for contradicting Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically similar issues to which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notification to the Nottingham East Labour Meeting at the sixth fair mentioned that "we pretend that the meetings are inclusive and productive".
For most of my eight years as a local employee representative in Parliament, the meetings of the General Committee were exactly that.
Unfortunately, today, it has ceased to be the tone of many of the meetings and the promise of "more kind and kind" policy has been forgotten, if it has ever been realized.
It has become increasingly apparent that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and that each opinion is judged whether or not it is acceptable by the party's leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy took the lead, because his colleagues who thought he was sharing a similar political perspective began to expect me to turn around and assume positions that he would never agree with - either on national security or on the single EU market.
Whenever I speak in public (and it doesn't really matter what I say), there is a torrent of insults on the social networks that call for "disposal", denouncing the policies of the centre, telling me that I should not belong to the Labour Party.
And it's not just me who's going through this.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, since the comments I am directed tend to be political.
I am frightened by the professionalism and determination of these colleagues who face a barrier to sexual or racist abuse every day, but who never go back to them.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how these levels of insult have become normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we have stopped being involved, and with each motion of "censorship" or amendment of the selection rules the party narrows its views.
I've received countless advice over the last two years, urging me to keep my head down, so that it won't be so expressive, and that it would be "all right" for me.
But that's not why I came to make politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, implicated by the neglect of thatcher's government that left the classroom of my comprehensive school literally in trash, I have tried to fight for better public services for those who need them most, whether as an author or as a minister in the government.
I've never hidden my policies, including in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could have been somewhat confused about my political positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
For those who promoted the motion on Friday, all I have to say is that when the country is headed for a Brexit that will harm families, businesses and our public services, not understanding the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, the message that I have is not for the Nottingham Momentum; it is for my constituents, members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threats of "disposal" or political records will prevent me from acting in the sense that I believe it is the interests of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: the intruder Ayr goes to the top
Two late trials have somehow sent the result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in this incredibly interesting game of Tennent's Premiership of the day.
The team is now at the top of the table, the only one of ten without defeats.
In the end, it was a superior defense and better management of the risks that made the house team take the best, and coach Peter Murchie had every reason to be satisfied.
"We have been tested in our games so far and we are still unbeatable, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose said, "The merit goes to Ayr. They better manage the risks than we do."
Grant Anderson's trial in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, placed Ayr in the front, but a yellow card for the Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who gave up for the Warriors, allowed Melrose to express the numbers, having taken advantage of an unconverted test.
Climate extended the advantage of Ayr with a great penalty, before, immediately before the mid-term, having marked and then converted a soil test to place the marker on 17-5 for Ayr at the interval.
However, Melrose well started the second part and Patrick Anderson's test, converted by Baggot, reduced the disadvantage to five points.
A long interruption followed due to a serious injury by Ruarid Knott, who was transported from maca to the outside and, after resumption, Ayr reinforced leadership with a trial by Stafford McDowall converted by Climate.
Ayr's executive captain, Blair Macpherson, then received a yellow card and once again Melrose took advantage of the digital advantage with an unconverted trial by Bruce Colvine at the end of an intense pressure investment.
However, the house team came back, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card because he had destroyed the weather without the ball, in the launch of the penalty, MacPherson placed the ball on the ground behind the Maul in Air's progress.
The climate turned, as it had done almost immediately following the reinstatement, after Kyle Rowe had picked up David Armstrong's box kick and sent Gregor Henry's wing to the fifth test of the house team.
Styl Game star ready for a new career in the restaurant business
Ford Kieran, Still Game star, seems ready to enter the restaurant sector after knowing that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor Jack Jarvis represents in the popular BBC series, who writes and participates with the long-date comedian partner Greg Hemphil.
The couple announced that the ninth season, coming soon, will be the last of the series, and it seems Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is Director of Arigingmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although a source of the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan was intending to engage in the "flowering Glasgow restoration business".
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, a land without coast, hopes that the court will restore a path to the Pacific
Marines patrol a cable-covered naval base in La Paz.
Public buildings stand for a blue-marine flag.
The ship bases of Lake Titicaca for the Amazon point out the motto: "The sea is ours by law.
It's a duty to recover it."
Throughout Bolivia, a landlocked country, there is still the memory of a lost coastal line for Chile in a bloody conflict of resources in the 19th century, as well as the desire to navigate again in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may be at the highest point in decades, since Bolivia awaits a judgment of the International Court of Justice on 1 October, after five years of deliberation.
"Bolivia has the impulse, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, a positive perspective on the result," said Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will attend the TIJ's ruling on giant screens distributed by the country, hoping that the Hague court will resolve in favour of its country's claim, so that, after decades of uncertain negotiations, Chile will be forced to negotiate, granting Bolivia a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic Bolivian indigenous president, who faces a controversial battle for the re-election in the coming year, also has a lot in play in the Monday judgment.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," were the President's votes last August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide in favour of Bolivia, and that it would not change at all.
The United Nations body, based in the Netherlands, has no power to assign Chilean territory to another country and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
That the TIJ judgment should be issued only six months after the hearing of the final allegations indicates that the case "was not complicated", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And far from promoting the Bolivian cause, the last four years may have damaged it.
"The issue of access to the sea was kidnapped by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
Morales' belligerent rhetoric undermined some Chilean residual good will, he suggested.
In the future, Bolivia and Chile will continue the talks, but it will be extremely difficult to maintain the dialogue after this.
The two countries have not been changing ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representative of Bolivia in Haia, rejected the idea that the court's decision process was involuntarily rapid.
Next Monday will give Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, another of the most popular presidents in Latin America, was using the maritime issue as a political mule.
"Bolivia will never relinquish its right of access to the Pacific," he added.
"The sentence is an opportunity to understand that we must go beyond the past."
North Korea claims there will be no disarmament without the country's trust in the US
North Korea Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his nation would never withdraw from its nuclear weapons if it didn't trust Washington first.
Ri was speaking on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
In his speech, he urged the United States to fulfil the promises they made during a summit in Singapore among the leaders of the rival countries.
Your comments arise when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be ready to resume nuclear diplomacy in impasse, more than three months after the Singapore summit with North Korean President Kim Jong Un.
Ri said that it is a "impossible dream" to consider that the continued sanctions and the objection of the United States to a statement that puts an end to the Korean war will sometimes lead North to kneel.
Washington was afraid to accept the statement without Pyongyang taking the first significant steps towards disarmament.
Both Kim and US president Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is a widespread cyticism about Pyongyang really intends to reduce an arsenal that the country is probably the only way to ensure its safety.
Pumpeo plans to visit Pyongyang in the month that comes to prepare a second Kim-Trup summit.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest line of huge hats on the way to a shop near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or protect yourself completely from the sun, you don't need to look any more.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented in the pass a series of extravagant and oversized hats for their spring-summer 2019 collections, which left the style set startled in Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, Instagram was flooded with very little practical hats and these designers sent these amazing creations to the pass.
Valentine's most prominent piece was an extravagant beige hat decorated with a wide abba similar to a penalty that flooded the head of the models.
Other oversized accessories included engraved melanins of jewelry, a magic hat and even a pineapple, although they were not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks...even in carnival time.
Many of the colored masks had cooked lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than with high silk.
One of the creations resembled the diving equipment, with tube and eye, while another looked like a melted ice cone.
And if you want to continue this huge statement of fashion, you're lucky.
The stylism observers predict that these huge hats are on the way to a store near you.
The oversized hats appear effervescent in the path of "La Bomba", the straw hat with a 61 cm abbe that has been used by everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The mark of worship behind the very little practical hat that spread through the social networks sent another great creation for the passageways: a bag of beach in straw almost as large as the model in fact in the bathroom that carried it.
The burnt orange raffia bag, decorated with raffia strips and with a white leather stick, was the most prominent piece of the Spring-summer La Riviera 2019 collection of Jacquesmus in Paris Fashion Week.
The famous designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I'm waiting to see big hats and beach bags coming to the shops for next summer. Since the designer had so much impact, it would be difficult to ignore the search for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
The independent schools in Scotland benefit from a curriculum of academic excellence, with this trend continued in 2018 with another set of exceptional results in the examinations, reinforced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community initiatives.
With more than 30,000 students scattered throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to obtain the best level of service for both students and parents.
Independent schools intend to prepare their students for the deepening of their studies and access to universities, as well as for the career they have chosen and to take their place as global citizens.
Since this is an educational sector capable of designing and implementing a school curriculum to the extent possible, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and sought theme in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If we talk to a man in a language he understands, we can get into his mind.
If we speak to him in his own language, we will be able to enter his heart."
This quote reminds us that we cannot rely only on English when we intend to create relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Based on the results of the recent reviews this year, we have verified that languages are at the top of the table, with the highest rates of use of independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who studied foreign languages achieved the maximum classification of A.
These data, collected in 74 schools under the scope of the SCIS, show that 72% of the students received the maximum score of A in Mandarin, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish also received an A.
This shows that Scottish independent schools are favouring foreign languages as vital skills that will undoubtedly serve children and young people in the future.
Languages, as an option, are now addressed in the same way as STEM themes (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculum of independent schools and not only.
An investigation by the United Kingdom Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 concluded that, among the reasons for the difficulties of employers to fill gaps, 17% concerned the lack of language skills.
Therefore, knowing other languages is increasingly an imperative to prepare the young generation for their future careers.
With more potential employment opportunities to demand language knowledge, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the chosen career, if they have learned a second language, they will have a tangible advantage in the future with an aptitude for life like this.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically put a multilingual person in front of competition.
According to a survey by YouTube to more than 4000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75% did not speak a foreign language well enough to maintain a conversation, and the French is the only language spoken by a proportion of two digits, 15%.
Therefore, investing in language teaching is now important for today’s children.
The domain of several languages, particularly those of developing countries, will give children with better chances of finding employment with relevance.
In Scotland, each school differs in the languages it teaches.
Some of these will focus on the most classic modern languages, while others will teach languages considered the most important for the United Kingdom for the Horizon 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be a set of languages to choose in independent schools, supported by specialized teaching staff in the area.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a pedagogical environment that prepares children and gives them the necessary skills for success, whatever the future holds.
Today, in a globalised business environment, languages continue to be of fundamental importance to the future of the country, so it is necessary to reflect it in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to provide this option with diversity and excellence for young Scottish people.
It's a good thing to do.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron starts at Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is about to end for the fans who want to see LeBron James get started in Los Angeles Lakers.
Luke Walton, Lakers coach, announced that James will participate in the opening game of Sunday's early Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, how many minutes will play are still to be determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Laker journalist Mike Trudell posted a tweet claiming that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After training at the beginning of this week, James was questioned about his plans for the calendar of six Lakers games in the pre-time.
"I don't need pre-temporary games at this stage of my career to be ready," he said.
Time and channel of YouTube from Trump Commission in Western Virginia
President Donald Trump launches a round of campaign comedy tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five comedians scheduled for next week, which include stops in friendly places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote of compliance pending for your choice for the wave of the Supreme Court, Trump intends to strengthen support for the mid-term elections to be held shortly, since the Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What time is Trump's start in West Virginia tonight and how do you see him online?
Trump's commission in Wheeling, West Virginia, is marked for 7 a.m. on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's commission in West Virginia online below on live YouTube.
Trump will probably address this week's hearings to Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court, who have become tensions due to allegations of sexual abuse.
However, the main objective of this torrent of comedies is to help Republicans, who face difficult elections in November, gain some impetus.
Thus, in charge of President Trump's campaign, these five commissions next week intend "to give energy to volunteers and supporters at a time when Republicans are trying to protect and extend the majority who remain in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so fundamental to the president's agenda that he will visit as many states as possible, as we approach the agitation of the campaign season," said a spokesman for Trump's campaign that he gave up being quoted, told Reuters.
Marked for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the start of the night will attract supporters "from Ohio to Pennsylvania and get coverage of the media in the Pittsburgh area", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will mark the second time this month that Trump visits Western Virginia, the state in which he won for more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate to the West Virginia Senate Patrick Morrisey, in disadvantage in the polls.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to give you help in the surveys," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of Western Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: US team demonstrates that it has the strength to fight to keep hope alive before the singles of Sunday
After three uniform sessions, Saturday throughsoms in the afternoon may be exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
The pendulum oscillation of the impement is a completely invented sport concept, but it is one in which players really believe, and never more than in competitions like these.
So where would they say the impetus will come now?
"They have an advantage of six points and now there are four, so we're dealing with this as a bit of momentum, I would say," said Jordan Spieth as he was leaving the field at the end of the day.
Europe is, of course, in favour of four points ahead and twelve more at stake.
The Americans, as Spieth says, still have some reserve energy and many reasons to feel encouraged, especially given the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each of them achieved three points in four.
Spieth has been a killer of green tea and is leading by example.
Those party guitar screams were getting higher as the round continued, with a crucial putt that made from the fourth run an all-square when he and Thomas were two holes behind in two.
His putt that won the match on the 15th produced a similar cry, from that guy who reveals that he still believes that the American team continues to compete.
"We only need to focus and worry about our own game," Spieth said.
That's all that's left of each of these players.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable revelation of Ryder Cup.
The European couple, unlikely but adorable, is four in four and cannot be mistaken.
The "Moliwood" was the only duet not to make a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and Friday afternoon back.
In this series, and given the way your energy seems to flow from and to this turbulent crowd, the idea that they are the players to beat on Sundays is reinforced, and that there is no more popular player to seal a European victory potential at the end of the National Le Golf than Fleetwood or Molinari.
As a matter of preference, both at the same time in different holes.
However, the talk on the glory of Europe remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson defeated Sergio Garcia, the hero of the fourballs this morning, when teamed up with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front of the nine have put Spanish and Swedish in a hole that they've never been close to leaving.
However, on Sunday, there is no one to help them get out of it.
Fourballs and fursomes are so fascinating to see from close because of the interactions between partners, the advice they give or not and how the strategy can change in a moment.
Europe has played better on the team so far and has gained a significant advantage on the final day. However, this foursome session has also shown that the US team has the stomach for the fight that some, especially in the United States, have doubted.
Europe with a 10-6 leadership on the last day of Ryder Cup
Europe will enter on the last day of Ryder Cup with an edged advantage after leaving the fourballs and foursomes of Saturday's games with a 10-6 leadership in front of the United States.
Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari's inspired duet led the two-win charge on a Tiger Woods with difficulties to reach the ranking in Le Golf National, so far, from four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, fighting to preserve the trophy he lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an unsuccessful American team in the morning's fourballs, winning the 3-1 series.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes with two winning matches, but failed to reduce the disadvantage.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points on Sunday 12 to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to win four points followed when he and Molinari, who received some "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend are only the only duet to win four points in their four opening match in Ryder Cup history.
Having smashed Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they super-consolidated the advantage, defeating an energyless Woods and American beginner Bryson Dechambeau with an even more emphatic 5-4-4.
Woods, who slipped during two games on Saturday, revealed occasional genius accesses, but already lost 19 of the games he played in fourballs and foursomes, and seven followed.
Justin Rose, resting during the morning fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes, defeating by 2+1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the first and third rankings in the world ranking.
However, on this pleasant day with a light breeze south-west of Paris, Europe has not always brought the best.
Jordan Spieth, winner three times of the main male tournaments, and Justin Thomas defined the reference for Americans with two points on Saturday.
The duet won a courageous 2&1 victory over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter from Spain, and later returned to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy for 4&3 in the fursomes, losing both opening holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup's history a team has reversed a four-point disadvantage before the singles, although the Furyk team, the holder of the title, just needs to bump to preserve the trophy.
After two days in the second position, a counter-attack on Sunday seems to be beyond its possibilities.
North Korea says "no thought" to a unilateral disarmament with no confidence
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea told the United Nations on Saturday that the continuation of sanctions was exacerbating mistrust in the United States and that there was no way of the country unilaterally disregarding its nuclear weapons in these circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said to the annual General Assembly of the world body that North Korea had taken "significant good-will measures" last year, such as the interruption of nuclear and missile tests, the dismantling of the nuclear test centre and the commitment to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technologies.
"However, we do not see any corresponding US response," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there is no way to proceed to our first disarmament."
Although Ri has reclaimed North Korean complaints already known about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to denuclearization, in which North Korea would be rewarded as steps are taken, its statements appear to be significant in so far as they do not deliberately reject unilateral denuclearization, in contrast with Pyongyang's earlier positions.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong One and Donald Trump at the first summit ever held between a US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, where Kim committed himself to working in the sense of "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula", while Trump offered security guarantees to North Korea.
North Korea has sought to achieve a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean war, but the United States states that Pyongyang has first to abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted appeals to mitigate the severe international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on "denuclearization first" and increases the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve its goal in a coercive way, resisting even the "declaration of the end of the war", said Ri.
"The perception that sanctions can put us on our knees is an impossible dream of people who don't know anything about us.
However, the problem is that the extension of sanctions is exacerbating our distrust."
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump which had been referred to by US leaders in the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: "If the interested party were South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached this impasse".
Still, the tone of Ri's speech was radically different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly to direct North Korea's rockets towards the U.S. territory after Mr. President Mau Trump called Kim "the man of the rockets" in a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, which in the past year had threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, Kim praised for his courage to take steps in the direction of disarmament, but stated that much was still to be done and that sanctions would have to continue until North Korea is denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not have a calendar for it, referring to "delaying two years, three years or five months, doesn't matter".
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompey told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The application of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue vigorously until denuclearisation is complete, final and verifiable".
The Security Council has unanimously reinforced the sanctions against North Korea imposed since 2006, in an attempt to stifle the financing of nuclear programmes and ballistic missiles in North Korea.
Pompeo met with Ri on the side of the UN General Assembly and declared after visiting Pyongyang again in the month that comes to prepare a second summit.
Pompey has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last visit did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that they had made progress, although then North Korea had denounced him for "doing gangster demands.
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea committed itself to dismantle a missile facility and also a nuclear complex if the United States "takes appropriate measures".
Pompey said Kim had told him that the "relevant measures" they sought were the security guarantees taken by Trump in Singapore, as well as initiatives to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students attend courses that teach them to rest long enough
A new course at Harvard University this year put all its students to sleep more, in an initiative to fight the masquerade culture of studying in "rights" impregnated with caffeine.
One professor concluded that students at the top of the world ranking did not often have the least idea about the most basic concepts about the care they should have with themselves.
Charles Cheisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, was the author of the course, who believes to be the first of his kind in the United States.
The inspiration for the course arose after giving a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
"At last, a girl came to meet me and said, "Why are you just telling me this in the last year of the course?"
The young man said that no one had ever mentioned the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is the first time this year, explains to students the essential concepts of how good sleep habits contribute positively to academic and athletic performance, as well as to improving general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of university health services, said that the institution decided to introduce the course after concluding that some students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In a section there is an image of a bedroom where students click on cupcakes of coffee, curtains, shoes and books to be informed about the effects of caffeine and light, and about how athletic performance is influenced by sleep deprivation, and the importance of a routine to collect to bed.
In another section, participants are informed about how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of AVC, depression and cancer.
Then, a map of the campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
"We know that it will not change the behavior of students instantly.
However, we believe that they have the right to know, as we all have the right to know the health effects of the smoking option," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in "direct making" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students make this a growing problem.
Ensuring that we sleep enough and with quality should be a "secret weapon" of the students to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said, and even to avoid thickening, because deprivation of sleep puts the brain in a hunger mode, making them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student of physical and chemical biology, helped Professor Cheisler design the course after attending one of his classes last year in Harvard.
The course opened her eyes and inspired her to encourage the creation of a course for all campuses, she said.
The next step, according to its expectations, is to ask all graduate students to attend a similar study program before entering the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students weigh the use of an alarm for the time to go to bed, as to wake up, and that they are aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can disrupt the circadian rhythm and lead to problems in falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - Rangers 0: Menga's goal to destroy Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another access of sadness out of the house when Dolly Menga's attack caused Steven Gerrard's disarmed team a 1-0 defeat at the Livingston Stadium.
Ibrox's team tried to record their first victory on their way from the 1-0 victory in St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team ended up in the defeat of Gerrard in 18 games, leaving his team eight points behind the frozen Hearts, the leader of the first Scottish division.
Menga scored seven minutes before the end of the first part and the Rangers collective, with no inspiration, never seemed to be equal.
With Rangers now coming down to sixth position, Livingston goes up to third, and just behind the Hibernian for the difference of goals.
And there may be even more problems for Rangers after the Calum Spence line prosecutor has received treatment of a head injury caused by an apparently pulled object from the visitor's area.
Gerrard made eight changes in the team that exceeded Air in the mid-finals of Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same eleven of Livingston who stole a point at Hearts last week, and would have been delighted with the way his well-winded team drowned the opponents in each game.
Rangers may have dominated the ball possession, but Livingston did more than he had.
The team could have scored just two minutes, when the first pass sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's luggage, but the average wasted his big opportunity out.
A long free trip from Keaghan Jacobs went to meet Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow managed only to finish out towards the second strike.
Rangers managed to regain control, but hope was bigger than belief in their game at the end of the third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he should have been given a great penalty in the fourth hour with his collision with Steven Lawless, but the arbitrator Steven Thomson refused the Colombian appeals.
The Rangers only got two sets to the first part, but the former Ibrox guard-nets Liam Kelly had little to worry about with Lassana Coulibaly's head end and Ovie Ejaria's weak end.
Although the Livingston goal at the 34th minute may have been contrary to what was expected from the development of the game, it is impossible for the team to deserve it, no matter what its tenacity.
Once again, Rangers couldn't deal with a long-standing Jacobs ball game.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher made a pass to Scott Robinson, who kept calm when he chose Menga for a simple completion.
Gerrard moved in the interval, replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, and this exchange almost immediately had an impact when the lateral advance passed to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly did a sprint from his line to block.
However, Livingston continued to force visitors to play exactly the kind of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett to take a long walk behind a long walk.
Holt's team may have increased its advantage in the final stages, but McGregor stood up well, defending Jacobs before Lithgow finished out in the corner.
The Rangers' replacement, Glenn Middleton, once again claimed a great penalty when he ran into Jacobs, but Thomson ignored the request again.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page of our German "Sunday Morning": On September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, and continues to CONTAR ...was born in Germany the physical future of Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that has just led to the device known as Geiger counter.
The main piece of science since then, the counter Geiger has also become a central element of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" in which the improbable scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans participated:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals like uranium.

New cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to "see" harmful cells
A new cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to "see" harmful cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells as part of treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and its alteration in the laboratory
These cells, which can "see" a common protein to many cancers, are then injected again into the body
An experimental vaccine is producing promising results in patients with a number of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells, saw her cancer in the ovaries disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and its laboratory alteration so that they can "see" a common protein to many cancers, designated by HER2. These cells are then injected again into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results suggest we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "controls the growth of various types of cancer", including those of the mother, the ovary, the lungs and also the colorectals, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach involves removing immune cells from patients and "teaching them" to attack cancer cells worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarks on a trip to Trump supporting a MAGA hat after its appearance in the SNL.
It didn't work out.
Kanye West went to the studio on Saturday Night Live after an inconsistency performance in which the president of the United States, Donald Trump, praised him, said he would run for the presidential elections in 2020.
After performing his night song, with the name of Ghost Town, in which he wore a hat "Make America Great", he started a bravery against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"How many times do I talk to a white man and he says to me, "How can you like Trump?
Well, if I were worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
The SNL began with a satire with Matt Damon, in which Hollywood star broke Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judicial Committee on the allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it had not been transmitted, the West Bravata scene was published on social media by Comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to change West when he did.
In addition, West had complained to the public about having had a bad bite in the builders because of the hat.
"I was intimidated by the builders.
They said, "Don't go there with that hat."
I was terrified!
And then they tell me I'm marginalized," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see the marginalization?", saying that "I would chase my superman's coat, because that means no one tells me what to do.
Try love."
His comments led to the public going and the participants in the SNL seemed to be ashamed, he told Variety, having someone on the program told the newspaper: "All the study was completely silent."
West had been invited to replace the singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days ago.
West has confused many with the performance of song I Love It Undressed Perrier bottle.
West received a demonstration of support from the director of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who published the tweet: "To one of our bravest spirits: forced by the TRUBA."
However, the interview programmer Karen Hunter posted a tweet saying that West was simply "to be what it is, and that is absolutely wonderful".
"But I chose NOT to reward someone (by buying his music or by supporting his "art") who I think is welcoming and spreading harmful ideologies to the community.
He's free.
And so do we," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, claiming that he was now "the former known by Kanye West".
West is not the first artist to change his name, following Diddy's past, also known by Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The also rapper Snoop Dog has already used the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the missing musical legend Prince has changed the name to a symbol and then to "the artist previously known by Prince".
Prosecution of attempted murder after defamation in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after a man was raped in a restaurant in the eastern part of Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, the police said.
The reu is expected to be presented to the Court of Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be analysed by the public ministry.
Star of the Battle of the Thrones Kit Harington attacks toxic male
Kit Harington is known for his role as an exgrimist as Jon Snow in the violent series of medieval fantasies of HBO, the Throne War.
However, the actor, at 31 years of age, attacked the stereotype of the maquisist hero, claiming that such papers on the screen make boys often feel that they have to be hard to respect.
In a conversation with Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed that "something went wrong" and asked about how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his colleague in the Rose Leslie Thrones War, also at 31 years of age, admitted that he has a "very strong position" regarding the approach of the problem.
"I have a pretty strong personal position right now: what went wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"What have we been teaching men when they are growing up in terms of the problem we are seeing now?"
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for the rise of toxic maleity due to its very male characters.
And he continued: "What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and on the streets that make young people feel they have to belong to this particular form of masculinity?
I think this is one of the big issues of our time: how can we change this?
Because clearly something went very wrong for young people."
In the interview, the actor also admitted that he would not enter into any prequels or sequels of the Thrones War when the series ended in the next summer, mentioning that for him, the "fields of battle and horses" ended.
From November, Kit will participate in a re-edit of True West by Sam Shepard, who is the story of a cinema producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he considered finding his wife Rose was the best thing that came out of the Thrones War.
"I met my wife in this series, so she somehow gave me my future family and my life from here," she said.
Rose played Ygritte's role, the loving interest of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the series of fantasy won with Emmys.
The couple gave the knot in June 2018 on the property of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% of new cases
China has announced a 14% leap in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, health authorities said.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases result from transmissions through sexual relations, which marks a change in the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contracted HIV in this way was reduced to practically zero, the Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, in terms of annual homologous variation, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sexual relations is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was defined in China in 1997, but it is said that discrimination against the LGBT community is common.
Studies estimated that, due to the country's conservative values, 70 to 90% of men who had sexual relations with other men ended up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases result from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV drugs as part of an effort to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters desperately flees information about Republican senators by a collaborator and attacks "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Congressman Maxine Waters denied on Saturday the allegations that a member of his team would have published personal information from three U.S. Senate members on the Wikipedia pages of the legislators.
The Democrat of Los Angeles stated that the accusations were promoted by opinion leaders and "ultradright" sites.
"Truths, lies and more reprehensible lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information allegedly includes residences of the households and phone numbers of Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person in Capitol Hill during a hearing with a Senate panel on charges of improper sexual conduct against Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court.
The information leak occurred some time after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the publications was associated with the Waters office and published the data of a Waters staff member, reported The Hill.
"This unsubstantiated accusation is completely false and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"My collaborator, whose identity, personal data and security were compromised by these fraudulent and false allegations, had no responsibility for this information leak.
This unsubstantiated accusation is completely false and an absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly attracted online criticisms, including those of the former press secretary of the White House Ari Fleischer.
"This dissatisfaction is cholera," Fleischer wrote.
"That suggests she doesn't have the temper to be a Congressman.
When someone is accused of something that is not their responsibility, they can't get angry.
You can't have a challenging attitude.
You can't question the defendant's reasons.
It must reveal calmness and serenity."
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to the democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who had been accused by critics of appearing to be too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who will debate Waters' place in the inter-local elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Very serious if it's true," she read on her tweet.
In his statement, Waters stated that his office had warned "the competent authorities" about these fraudulent allegations.
"We ensure that the guilty will be revealed," he continued, "and will be legally responsible for all their acts, which are destructive and dangerous to all and any members of my staff."
Review by Johnny English Back to Attack - weak spy movie parody with Rowan Atkinson
It is now fashionable to look for contacts with Brexit in any new film with a British flavor, and this seems to apply to the new edition in the series of comedy films and action Johnny English, started in 2003 with "Johnny English" and brought back to life in 2011 with "Johnny English Regresso".
Is it that ironic self-satisfaction on the subject of being so bad is the new opportunity to export to the nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his bubbling eyes and an excessively elastic expression, obtained his license to create confusion, renewed a second time - with his name to signal, more than anything, that is a comprehensive comic creation for non-anglophone filmmakers.
He is, of course, the stupid secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims to a soft glamour, has a bit of Cloiseau, a pie from Mr. Bean and something from that fulan who contributed with a single note to the theme of the film "Moments of Glory" at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympic Games.
In addition, his character was originally based on the traveler and a mysterious international man whose role Atkinson played in TV ads for Barclaycard, who left chaos in his chase.
There are one or two interesting moments in this latest edition of JJ.
I loved the scene in which Johnny English is approaching a helicopter with a Medieval armor, with the rotor's feet making a short noise of a carriage against the cape.
Atkinson's talent for comedy is obvious, but humor sounds weak and strangely superfluous, especially considering that the editions of "series" such as the 007 and the Impossible Mission now confidently propose comedy as an ingredient.
We have the idea that humor is directed at children and not adults, and in my opinion, Johnny English's bizarre adventures are not as inventive and focused as Atkinson's mute film numbers in Bean's character.
Now, the assumption, always current, is that Britain is in a serious trouble.
A computer pirate infiltrated the network of British super-secret spies, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground to confuse the service agent, a unfortunately small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last drop for a prime minister who incarnates a pompous and conflicting figure, already suffering a total defeat of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives his best with this role that reminds the character of Theresa May, but the argument does not give too much material for big flights.
Your secret service advisers inform you that, since all the agents in the asset have been compromised, you will have to remove someone from the reform.
And this person is the devastated Johnny English, now working as a teacher in a chic school, but giving non-official lessons about how to be an infiltrated spy: here are some interesting numbers, because English offers us a spy academy in the style of the movie "School de Rock".
English is taken quickly to Whitehall to receive emergency instructions and to join his auxiliary Bough sufferer, a paper replayed by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, tied to a submarine commander, a fussy character in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
Thus, Batman and Robin of the disaster at the Secret Service of His Majesty are back to action, facing the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletin, paper played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is being dangerously embroiled by the billionaire charismatic of the technologies that claim to be able to solve Britain's computer problems: the sad Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their obscurity of absurd acts: disfigured by table employees, burned a visionary French restaurant, create confusion by entering as clandestines on the luxurious Volta yacht, and English launches pure anarchy as he tries to use virtual reality glasses to familiarize himself with the interior of the Volta house.
All the stops were certainly created in view of this last sequence, but for the most sympathetic and stormy of all, the set has plenty of TV for children.
The result is quite medium.
And as in other movies by Johnny English, I couldn't stop asking: couldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that makes justice to his talent?
Workers deny that they are planning a plan for the British to work four days a week, but receiving five
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party may be considering a radical plan to provide the British with a four-day work week, but with five-day payments.
Reports suggest that the party wants the patrons to pass the savings with the revolution of artificial intelligence (IA) for workers, giving them a day of additional strike.
The workers got a three-day weekend, but keeping the order.
Sources refer to the idea of "adjusting" to the party's economic programme, which reinvigorates the country in favour of workers.
The shift to a four-day work week received the favourable opinion of the Congress of Trade Unions as a form of workers taking part in the changes in the economy.
A senior member of the Labour Party said to The Sunday Times: "We hope to announce a policy review before the end of the year.
"It will not happen from one day to the other, but a four-day work week is a aspirations adjusted to the party's approach to the rebalancing of the economy for the worker, as well as to the overall strategy of the party for the industrial sector."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, since the Green Party had already proposed a four-day work week during its campaign for the 2017 legislative elections.
However, this aspirations are not supported at this time by the whole Labour Party.
One party spokesman said: "The four-day workweek is not part of the party's policy and we are not considering it."
The minister of shadow finance John McDonnell used the party's conference last week to reveal his vision of a socialist economic revolution.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain the power of the hands of the "no-face-directors" and the "speculators" of the basic services companies.
Its plans also include the non-recovery of the total shareholding of current water companies, since the Labour Party may carry out "deductions" based on the perception of illegal conduct.
McDonnell also confirmed plans to place employees in company management councils and create inclusive ownership funds that transfer 10% of the share of private companies to employees, which will be able to pay annual dividends that may exceed 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell the "60 Minutes" if the FBI's investigation with Kavanaugh can do them or not change their mind.
The FBI's investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote of his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least one week, raising questions as to whether the conclusions could lead Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview to be given on Sunday, Scott Pelley's correspondent asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find out something that makes them change their mind.
Kennedy turned out to be more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"That said when I went to the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this, when this claim came up, and I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was resolved, certainly, without doubt."
The vote by Graham, however, seems unbearable.
"I've decided on Brett Kavanaugh and it would take an explosive charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know one thing: Brett made a powerful dissident," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone she mentioned couldn't confirm it.
It was 36 years ago.
I can't see anything else to change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival? Did you do something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, the city of New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event with an extremely impressive list of stars that will act on an equally impressive mission: eradicating poverty in the world.
Already in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will host tens of thousands of people in the Grand Hall of Central Park, not only to watch performances such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to strengthen awareness of the real objective of the event: to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a group of defenses that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who actively fight it.
To receive a free ticket for the event (unless they are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), spectators had to perform a series of tasks, or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to a world leader, a telephone call or any other significant ways that contribute to raising awareness of the goal of ending poverty.
However, what was the degree of success of Global Citizen in these 12 years in achieving its goal?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is a genuine way to persuade them to demand action, or is this just another case of "clichetivism" - do we find it makes a difference to sign an online petition or send a tweet?
Global Citizen claims that since 2011, it has registered more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters who have exerted pressure to achieve a number of different objectives.
These actions, according to the organization, have contributed to the global leaders' announcement of commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its actions, with at least $10 billion relating to them being already disbursed or hired.
The group estimates that the funds obtained so far have had a direct impact on almost 649 million people scattered around the world.
Some of the main commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership established in the United Kingdom, bringing together investors and implementers committed to "helping children reach their full potential", which promised to give Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country. This after receiving more than 4700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the United Kingdom government, donors, national governments and global citizens like all of us, we can make the social injustice of sub-nutrition a footnote in history," Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, said to a crowd in a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that, after more than 5,000 pressure actions on the United Kingdom in order to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced that it would finance a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will cover 5 million women and children, with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the frequent questions on the site, "What makes you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?"
The Global Citizen answers: "It was a long and tortuous path - sometimes we fell and failed.
But, like the great movements of civil and anti-apartheid rights that preceded us, because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae are among the artists who will be performing at this year's event in New York, presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
USA can use Navy as "block" to place an obstacle to Russia's energy exports - Interior Secretary
"If necessary," Washington may use its Navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, revealed the US Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, according to Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia's involvement in Syria, in particular, where the legitimate government is invited, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they intend to mediate energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, in the southern belly of Europe," he said.
And, according to the governor, there are ways and means to prevent it.
"The United States has the ability, with its Navy, to ensure that maritime routes are open and, if necessary, to block to ensure that energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke was directed to participants at an event organized by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group called "the voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
In his speech, he continued to compare Washington's approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, referring to which they are effectively the same.
"The economic option in Iran and Russia is to advance and replace fuels," he said, referring to Russia as a "magic of a single trick" with a dependent fossil fuel economy.
These statements arise at a time when the Trump administration is on a mission to increase natural gas exports to Europe, in place of Russia, which is the cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, the authorities of the Trump administration, including the president himself, are trying to persuade Germany to abandon the "inadequate" Nord Stream pipeline project, which, according to Trump, has become a "prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stated that the North Stream pipeline, budgeted at $11 billion, aims to double the existing capacity for 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is simply motivated by economic reasons, which is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument for exerting pressure and that consumers should have the ability to choose suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak following a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position prompted a negative reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main German industrial association, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), called on the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a great problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, the top head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "deeply analyze" the possibility of running for the presidency in 2020, said the Massachusetts Senator
The Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that he will "deeply analyze" the possibility of running for the presidency following the inter-call elections.
During an informal public debate in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider the possibility of applying.
"The time has come for women to go to Washington to repair our dysfunctional government, and this includes a woman as the maximum responsible," The Hill said.
"After 6 November, I will thoroughly analyze the possibility of applying for the presidency."
Warren commented on President Donald Trump during the informal debate, saying that "he was taking the country in the wrong direction".
"I am extremely concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren has been a harsh vocal critic of Trump and his appointment to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On a tweet on Friday, Warren said that "it is clear that we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, a survey carried out on Thursday revealed that the majority of Warren’s own constituents were not of the opinion that she should be candidate for the presidency in 2020.
59% of the "probable" electors in Massachusetts said that the senator should not apply, according to the poll of the Political Research Centre at the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe.
32% support your candidacy.
The poll revealed a higher support for the candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38% in favour of a potential candidacy and 48% against.
Other prominent names of the Democratic Party discussed on a potential candidate in 2020 include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide in January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions the post-traumatic stress of Track Palin at Donald Trump's commission
Track Palin, aged 26, spent a year in Iraq after his list in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and accused of an incident of domestic violence
"What my own son's going on, what's going on after he's back, I can identify with the other families who feel the ramifications of post-traumatic stress and some of the wounds our soldiers are actually returning," said Donald Trump to the public in support of Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called this detention "the elephant in the room" and said that his son and other veterans "turn a little different, return hardened, return investigating whether there is this respect for which his soldiers and aviators, and all other members of the armed forces, gave it to the country."
Track Palin was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence against a woman and possession of weapons while drinking, according to Dan Bennett, spokesperson of the Department of Police of Wasilla.
Eighteen states and the District of Colombia support the challenge of the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Colombia are supporting a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that refuses asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and the district sent a statement of friendship curiae (friends of the court) on Friday in Washington, in support of an asylum seeker who is responding to this policy, referred to NBC News.
The full name of the complaint in the Grace vs. Sessions that the American Civil Liberties Union intervened in August against politics was not revealed.
The person claimed that his partner "and his children, members of a violent gang", abused her, but the US authorities denied his asylum application on July 20th.
The complaint was arrested in Texas.
The government ministries that support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum candidates in the United States, such as nations facing widespread problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy withdrew a 2014 decision of the Immigrant Resources Council allowing immigrants without documents of domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The Attorney General of the District of Colombia Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of federal, federal and international laws".
"Federal legislation requires that all asylum applications be assessed on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances underlying them; this prohibition violates this principle," read the statement of friends curiae.
The lawyers also argued in this statement that the ban on the entry of immigrants by the police has a negative impact on the US economy, stating that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "available the necessary workforce".
The Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gangs in June.
"The asylum is available to those who leave their country due to persecution or fear based on ethnicity, religion, nationality or belonging to a specific social group or with a certain political opinion," Sessions said in their policy announcement on June 11.
Asylum has never been destined to alleviate all the problems, not even all the serious problems, that people face every day throughout the world.
Rescue efforts desperate in Palu when the number of dead doubles in a counter-hour to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is increasingly desperate.
"The environment is very tense," said Risa Kusuma, 35 years old, mother of a febrile male baby, in comforting him in an evacuation center in the city of Palu.
"At every minute, an ambulance brings more bodies.
There's a shortage of clean water."
Residents were visited who returned to their ruined houses to try to save everything they could find among their water-scattered parts.
There were hundreds of injuries and hospitals, damaged by magnitude 7.5 earthquake, were overloaded.
Some of the wounded, such as Dwi Harris, who broke the ribs and shoulders, rested outside the Army Hospital of the Palu, where the patients were treated abroad due to the strong replicas they continued.
His eyes were wet with tears when he told how he felt when the violent earthquake hit him in the hotel room of the fifth walk where he was with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was trapped in the ruins of the wall, I think," Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife screaming for help, but then silent.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope you're safe."
US Ambassador accuses China of "intimacy" with "advertising ads"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in a daily newspaper of the United States promoting the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
The president of the United States, Donald Trump, referred last Wednesday to the Chinese Daily supplement paid at the Des Moines Register, the newspaper with the most withdrawal from the state of Iowa, after accusing China of trying to interfere in the elections of 6 November to Congress, an accusation denied by China.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the US elections marked the beginning of what the American authorities, in statements to Reuters, designated as a new phase in the growing Washington campaign to pressure China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to publish advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently hindering an ever-increasing trade war that has seen both sides apply tariff fluctuations on imports from the other.
China's retaliation rates in the early stages of the trade war were designed to affect exporters in states that support the Trump Republican Party, Chinese and North American experts say.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and former Iowa long-standing governor, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion article in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, "is now putting the foot on the accelerator of this intimidation with the publication of advertising ads in our free press".
"With the spread of this propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the acarinated American tradition of freedom of expression and of the press by publishing a pay announcement at the Des Moines Register," Branstad said.
"In contrast, in the banks here in Beijing, we find very few dissident voices and we will never see a true reflection of the diversity of opinions that Chinese may have of their country's worrying economic trajectory, because the media are under firm control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
In addition, he added that "one of the most prominent Chinese newspapers refused to publish" his article, although he did not mention which.
Republicans alienate women's voters before the intercal elections with the Kavanaugh disaster, warn analysts
At a time when many important Republicans support and defend the appointment to the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh in the face of various allegations of sexual assault, analysts warn that this may lead to a negative reaction, particularly of women, during the mid-term elections to take place shortly.
The emotions around the case have been very strong and the majority of the Republicans have said publicly that they intend to move forward for a vote.
These things have no backwardness," said The Hill Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Maxwell School at Syracuse University, for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said that he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake's last hour's pressure to carry out an FBI investigation would be sufficient to calm the rebel voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget tomorrow or November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, Senior Adviser and National Speaker of the Progressive Group MoveOn, according to Washington newspaper, D.C.
On Friday morning, protestors sang "November is at the door!" when they protested in the Senate's courtroom, since the Republicans who controlled the Judicial Committee chose to move forward with Kavanaugh's appointment despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, Mic reported.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will beat all the memories," said the news site Stu Rothenberg, a political analyst without a party membership.
"People say it's already high; it's true.
But it can be even higher, particularly among the indecisive voters in the suburban areas and the younger voters, from 18 to 29 years of age, who, although they do not like the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony describing his allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court appointed, analysts suggested that a negative reaction could occur if Republicans progressed with confirmation.
"This became a trap for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee's vote, or about whether Kavanaugh will take its place as a judge. It's also about how the Republicans dealt with the matter and how they dealt with it," said Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities USA, a group that helps to elect Democrats, to the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat divided on whom to believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a small majority aligning with the first.
A new YouTube survey revealed that 41% of respondents believed absolutely or probably in Ford's testimony, while 35% claimed they believed absolutely or probably in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% claimed that Kavanaugh had probably or absolutely lied in his testimony, while only 30% claimed the same about Ford.
After Flake's proposal, the FBI initiated an investigation into Ford's allegations, as well as another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, according to the Guardian.
Ford made an oath before the Senate Judicial Committee last week that Kavanaugh had sexually harassed her while she was drunk when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the appointment to the Supreme Court exposed his genital organs when the two participated in a party during the period during which they both studied in Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web aims to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, an inventor of the World Wide Web, created a startup that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest design of this legendary technology character, Inrupt, is a company that takes advantage of Berners-Lee’s open source platform, Solid.
This allows users to decide where their data is stored and who has access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with the Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention underlying the Inrupt is to "dominating the world".
"We have to do it now," he said about the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "online personal data storage", or POD.
This can contain contact lists, task lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available in a single browser and at the same time.
What is unique about online personal data storage is that it is exclusively for the user to decide who has access to what type of information.
The company calls it "personal training through the data".
The idea of Inrupt, according to John Bruce's CEO, is to provide resources, processes and skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company is currently composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some internal programmers hired to work on the project and a volunteer programming community.
At the beginning of this week, the world-wide technology creators will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to the "Facebook and Google about the introduction or not of a total change in which all their business models are turned from one day to another.
"We're not asking for their permission."
In a publication in the Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to create commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps to protect the integrity and quality of the new Web created with Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on the neutrality of the Internet.
Even as he launches Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this next era of the Web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Honoring the clergy decorated with Victoria Cross in the First Great War
The only clergy of the Church of England to receive Victoria Cross during the First Great War as a combatant was honored in their native city for 100 years.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann obtained the decoration on September 29, 1918 with the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a freeman four days later and never knew that he had received the highest British military honor.
His two grandchildren broke off a memorial plate at a stop in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of them, Michael Vann, said it was "bright symbolic" that the plate had been presented exactly 100 years after the fact that he gave the decoration to his grandfather.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Saint-Quentin Canal "in a very thick fog and under closed fire of portable and metrological weapons".
Then he ran to the fire line and, "with the greatest courage", led the line forward before attacking alone a cannon and beating three soldiers of the stand.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German freeman shooter on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72 years old, said that his grandfather's actions were "something I know he could never equal, but also a lesson of humility".
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, deposited a crown of flowers after the stop, led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "very honored to participate in the stop" and added that "the courage of a genuine hero is to be demonstrated through the support that will be given by many people".
Fans of mixed martial arts all night long to see Bellator 206 attend instead to Porca Peppa
Imagine this: you wake up all night to see the Bellator 206, full of glasses and, finally, you are prevented from seeing the main event.
The San José series included 13 matches, with six from the main group, and was being shown live during the night in the United Kingdom, in Channel 5.
At six o'clock in the morning, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the confrontation, the spectators in the United Kingdom were frightened when the cover changed to the Porca Peppa.
Some were not impressed after they had been agreed until early in the morning especially for the fight.
A fan on Twitter described the change for cartoons for children as "a kind of bad joke".
"The government's regulation says that the content is not appropriate for the six in the morning, so they had to change to another programming," said Dave Schwartz, an administrator with marketing and communications hair, when questioned about the transmission.
"Peppa pig," yes.
The president of Bellator, Scott Coker, said that he would correct the schedule of the broadcasts to include future viewers of the United Kingdom.
"I think that when I think about repetition, I think we can solve the problem," said Coker.
"But it's six in the morning of Sunday there and we can't solve it until our time of Sunday, which is a second fair in British time.
But we're working on it.
I'm not lying when I say that, when the programming changed, there were many messages exchanged and none very nice.
We were trying to solve the problem, and we thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn't: it was a government problem.
I promise it won't happen next time.
We'll reduce the number of fights to five instead of six, as we usually do.
It's a sad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "less" about her sexuality
Olympic dancer Tom Daley said he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality, but that gave him the motivation to become a success.
The 24-year-old athlete said he didn't realize until he got into high school that "they're all like me."
In an interview with the first Desert Island Discs of Radio 4, presented by Lauren Laverne, she said she expressed herself in favour of the rights of homosexuals to give "hope" to others.
He also said that becoming a father makes him less worried about winning the Olympics.
The program's long-term regular presenter, Kirsty Young, shot a bullet for several months due to illness.
Appearing as a parent in Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt "less" to everyone else because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls".
In his words, "to this day, this impression of feeling smaller and different has been the real reason that has given me the power and strength to achieve success."
Their goal was to prove that it was "someone", he said, not to disappoint everyone when they discovered their sexuality sooner or later.
The double Olympic bronze medalist became a prominent LGBT activist and used his participation in Commonwealth Games this year in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
According to him, he manifested himself because he felt happy that he could live openly without consequences and intended to give "hope" to others.
The world trim champion said to fall in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013, "suddenly caught me."
Daley married Oscar's winner last year, 20 years older, although he said that the age difference never was a problem.
"When we get through when we're so young" - his first participation in the Olympic Games was at 14 years old and his father died of cancer three years later - he said, it's hard to find someone of the same age who's been through high and low alike.
The couple had a son last June, called Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that "all his perspective" had changed.
"If they had asked me last year, everything that mattered was "getting a gold medal," he said.
"You know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic Gold Medal is Robbie."
Your son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at 40 years of age after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept the fact that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was whether they had tickets for the London games in 2012, because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell you that "you won't be here to be in the first row, Dad," he said.
"I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and it was only when he actually stopped breathing and died that I finally recognized that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I was fully aware that it was what I had dreamed of all my life: diving in front of a multitude of compatriots in the Olympic Games...there was no better feeling," he said.
All this was also the inspiration of his first song choice - Proud, by Heather Small - with which he had identified himself during the preparation for the Olympics, and which still gives him chicken skin.
The Desert Island Discs passes on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 p.m., British summer hour.
Mickelson down at the bank at Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will reach a record on Saturday when fighting his 47th match on a Ryder Cup, but he will have to recover his way to prevent the frame from symbolizing an unfortunate occasion.
Mickelson, playing in the biennial event for the 12th time, a record of participations, was sent to the bank by Captain Jim Furyk on Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being in the center of action, as many times has been in the U.S. teams, the five-time winner of the main male championships divided the day between the support function and the work in his game in the field, hoping to correct what afflicts him.
Having never given heels to the most challenging even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old player is not the ideal for the Le Golf National field, where the long row usually punishes the wrong heels.
And if the field by itself was not scary enough, Mickelson, on Sunday's ninth day, will face the precise British Open Francesco Molinari champion, who teamed up with the initiator Tommy Fleetwood, winning all four matches they had this week.
If Americans, with a four-point disadvantage to start the 12 single parts, record a good start, Mickelson's start can be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, but he couldn't say much more.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a palm on my back, put his arm around me and said I would be ready tomorrow," Fury said.
"He has much confidence in himself.
He's a respected champion who's given these teams a lot of weight in the past, and also this week.
I probably hadn't seen him play two games.
I thought more about it, but that's how it happened and that's how we thought we'd have to keep going.
He wants to be in the game, like everyone else."
Mickelson will cross Nick Faldo's record on Sunday from the biggest number of games at Ryder Cup.
This may mark the end of a career in Ryder Cup that has never equalled the successes of its individual curriculum.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven empathies, although Furyk has stated that his presence has created some tangible advantages for the team.
"He's sarcastic, funny and spiritual, he likes to play with people and he's an excellent person to have in the team room," he explained.
"I think the younger players had fun getting along with him this week, which was fun to see.
He gives a lot more than just playing."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that his great advantage can disappear in an apex
Thomas Bjorn, European Captain, knows from experience that his leadership being pushed into the last day of singles at Ryder Cup can easily become an accident.
The Danish had its star in the 1997 Valderrama match, where a team captained by Seve Ballesteros maintained a five-point advantage over the Americans, but crossed the finish line with the nose with the narrowest of the margins, winning for 1411⁄2-1311⁄2.
"We always tried to remember that we had a considerable advantage in Valderrama; we had a great advantage in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but little," said Bjorn, in the image, after attending the 2018 Tour for 5-3, both on Friday and yesterday, to lead for 10-5 at Le Golf National.
So the story has shown me and all those in this team that this isn't over yet.
Tomorrow, give your best.
Go over there and do everything right.
This doesn't end until we have the points on the marker.
We have a goal that is to try to win this trophy and that is where the approach should remain.
I have always said that I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we are well aware of who is on the other side: the best players in the world."
Enthralled by the performance of their players in a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never go ahead with myself in this.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
Tomorrow what matters is individual performance and this involves a different task.
It's great we're there with a partner when things go well, but when we're there on our own, our skills as golfers are tested as well.
This is the message you need to convey to players: tomorrow, give your best.
Now they're going to leave the partner and he has to go and give the best of himself too."
In contrast to Bjorn, the opponent Jim Furyk will seek to make his players have a better performance individually than as partners, constituting the exceptions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points in four.
Furyk himself was already on both sides of these big turns on the last day, having been part of the winning team in Brooklyn before he finished losing when Europe took off the cartel the "Milagre in Medina".
"I remember all the words," he said in answer to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, motivated his players for the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you would like to get that fast start like what you saw in Brooklyn and what you saw in Medina.
When this push is directed towards one side, the pressure is very large in these middle parts.
We organized our actual in accordance and ordered the players how we feel, you know, what we're going to try to do tomorrow."
Thomas, with the mission to try to lead the counter-attack, faces Rory McIlroy in the main game, being Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter the other Europeans in the first half of the order.
"I chose this group of players for this order because I think it covers the entire route," said Bjorn about his choices for singles.
New German warship once again
The latest German Navy fleet should have entered service in 2014 to replace warships of the Cold War. However, it will be necessary to wait at least until next year, due to systems prone to disasters and a cost of exponential growth, according to local media.
The entrance to the service of the "Rheinland-Pfalz," the command ship of the new baden-Wuerttemberg class, was now delayed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper, which quoted a military spokesman.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but the worrying post-delivery problems have undermined the fate of the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class that the Navy had ordered in 2007 will serve to replace the old frigates of the Bremen class.
It is known that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, in addition to a series of anti-air missiles and anti-shipments, as well as some stealthy technologies such as the reduction of radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer periods of maintenance, which would allow the most recent frigates to be sent to missions with a maximum duration of two years away from the ports of origin.
However, the continuing delays have made it possible that with the warships of the last generation, considered as a form of Germany designing beyond-border power, they will already be out of date when they enter service, says Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate made mannets last year when the German Navy refused to put it in service, having returned it to the blohm & Voss stalls in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the Navy returned a ship to the shipyard after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German media cite a series of crucial "hardware and software defects" that would make the warship useless if used in a combat mission.
The weaknesses of the software were particularly important, since the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, only half of the quota required in the oldest Fragates of the Bremen class.
It was also known that the boat is too heavy, which reduces its performance and limits the marine's ability to install additional features in the future.
It is believed that the "Reinland-Pfalz", of 7,000 tons, has the double weight of similar class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to hardware failures, the total project price, including crew training, is also becoming a problem.
It is said that this will have reached an amazing EUR 3.1 billion, an increase compared to the EUR 2.2 billion initially budgeted.
The problems facing the most recent frogs have become particularly important in the light of recent warnings that German naval power is weakening.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the leader of the German parliamentary commission of defence, admitted that the Navy is currently leaving ships capable of being used."
The politician said that the problem had grown exponentially over time, because older ships were out of service without ships to replace them.
In the end, he complained that none of the baden-Wuerttemberg class frogs could have joined the Navy.
National Trust spyes on the secret life of the bites
New research is being carried out on a property in the High Scottish Lands with the aim of revealing how bats use the landscape to search for food.
It is hoped that the results will make some light on the behavior of these single flying mammals and help guide conservation activities in the future.
The study, carried out by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, will follow common bites and fruit, as well as long ears and Daubenton bites at the Inverewe Gardens in Western Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations spread by the property to follow the activities of the bats throughout the station.
Mobile studies will also be carried out by NTS personnel and by volunteers with portable detectors.
The analysis by experts of all recordings will evaluate the frequency of the calls of the bites and what each species is doing.
A map of the habitat will then be produced to create a detailed picture of its territorial behavior.
Rob Dewar, an NTS nature conservation advisor, expects the results to reveal which habitat areas are most important for the bites and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of meadows, as well as the best way to maintain forests for turtles and associated species.
The bat populations in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have grown considerably over the last century.
These animals are threatened by construction and development works that affect the dormitories and make habitat scarce.
The wind turbines and the lamps are also a threat, together with the killing papers and some chemical treatments of construction materials, as well as attacks of domestic cats.
In fact, the bites are not blind.
However, given their nightly hunting habits, their ears are more useful than eyes when it comes to catching the prey.
It is used by them a sophisticated echo location technique to identify insects and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76 000 hectares of land throughout the region, takes the bites very seriously.
The organization has ten trained specialists who regularly carry out studies, dorms inspections and sometimes rescues.
It also created the first reservation in Scotland dedicated exclusively to pieces, the Thrave property in Dumfries and Galloway, which hosts eight of the ten species of Scottish pieces.
The director of the property, David Thompson, says the same is the ideal territory for them.
"Here in Thrave we have an excellent area for bites," he said.
"We have old buildings, many veteran trees and all this good habitat.
However, there is still much about the bites we do not know, so the work we are doing here and in the other properties will help us learn more about what they need to thrive."
He stressed the importance of checking whether there are bites before maintaining the properties, as the non-intended destruction of just one mother's bedroom can lead to the death of up to 400 young women and animals, which could eradicate the whole of the local population.
The bites are a protected species and it is illegal to kill them, ambush them, disturb them or destroy their dorms.
Elizabeth Ferrell, the Scottish protector of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to participate to help.
It was said to her: "We still have a lot to learn about our bites, and for many of our species, we simply don't know how their populations are avenged."
Ronaldo unfortunately charges of rape when his lawyers prepare to process German newspaper
Christian Ronald characterized the allegations of rape against him as "false news", claiming that people "want to promote themselves" using their name.
Your lawyers are preparing to process the German news magazine Der Spiegel, who published the allegations.
The advanced Portuguese and Juventus selection was accused of rapeing an American woman, identified as Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He claims that he will then have to pay $375 000 to keep the alleged victim silent about the accident, read in Der Spiegel on Friday.
Speaking in a live video on Instagram to its 142 million followers hours after the disclosure of the allegations, Ronaldo, aged 33, characterized the reports as "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news," he said to the chamber the winner of five Golden Balls.
"They want to promote themselves at the expense of my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous for saying my name, but that's part of the profession.
I'm a happy man and everything's okay," the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to process Der Spiegel on the allegations, which have characterized as "an unacceptable report of suspicions in the field of privacy", according to Reuters.
Advocate Christian Schertz said that the player would claim compensation for moral damage in the amount corresponding to the severity of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident will have occurred in June 2009 at a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga will have reportedly gone to the player's room, where he will have raped her annually, according to the documents submitted to the District Court of the County of Clark in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo put on his knees after the alleged incident and told him that he was "99%" "a good guy," damaged by "one percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sexual relations, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had photographs of her injuries in a hospital, but that she would later have agreed to enter into an extrajudicial agreement because she felt "feared by the prospect of retaliation" and was concerned about the possibility of "publicly humiliated".
The woman, 34 years old, now claims that she intends to cancel the agreement because she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join the Royal Madrid, leaving Manchester United, at the time of the alleged aggression. This summer he moved to the Italian giants Juve in a business of 100 million euros.
Brexit: United Kingdom "to regret forever" the loss of car manufacturers
The United Kingdom "would regret it forever" if it lost its world leader status in car manufacturing after Brexit, said the Secretary for Greg Clark Companies.
Clark also said that Toyota in the United Kingdom had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop the production of its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese manufacturer said that the impact of delays on the borders in the case of an unagreed Brexit could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston factory, which produces the Toyota Auris and Avensis models, produced almost 150 000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My perspective is that if Britain is out of the EU irregularly at the end of March, we will be watching production stops in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, executive director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in the United Kingdom expressed concerns about the EU's exit without an agreement on the level of operation of cross-border transactions, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, said that it would close its Minis factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what manufacturers claim to be the risks of the supply chain in the case of a Brexit without agreement.
Toyota's production line is managed on a "just-in-time" basis, with the pieces arriving every 37 minutes, from suppliers both in the UK and in the EU, for vehicles manufactured by order.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without agreement on 29 March, disturbances at the border may occur, which the sector says may lead to delays and lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day of stocks in its Derbyshire factory, the company said, so the production would have to stop.
Clark said that Theresa May's "Checkers Plan" for future relations with the EU was "calibrated precisely to avoid these border checks".
"We have to have an agreement. We want the best agreement that allows, as I said, not only the current success, but also the benefit of this opportunity for us," said the BBC Radio 4 programme Today.
"The evidence not only of Toyota but also of other manufacturers points out that we absolutely need to be able to continue with what has been a highly successful set of supply chains."
Although it was not possible to estimate the stop time, Toyota said that in the long term, the added costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and could lead to loss of jobs sooner or later.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who worked at Burnaston's factory for 24 years and coordinates the United Union in this place, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "According to my experience, if they are lost, these jobs will never return.
A spokesman for the government said that "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU".
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again, says the White House
The important meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be "adjou another week" as there is still no understanding about Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court, referred to the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of legal adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating the Russian interference in the elections, the links between Trump's advisers and Russia and the possible obstruction of justice by the President.
The fact that Trump could be preparing the resignation of the Deputy Attorney General, thus putting Mueller's independence at risk, has been feeding rumors in Washington for months.
At the beginning of this month the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of dissimulating talks with Trump and the possibility of deposing the President through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last Monday he moved to the White House, having information that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced on Thursday with Trump, which was held in the United Nations, New York.
Trump said that "I would rather not say goodbye" Rosenstein, but the meeting was then delayed to avoid the overlap with a hearing of the Senate Justice Commission in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered an FBI investigation with the duration of one week on charges against Kavanaugh, delaying the final vote in the Senate.
Trump's press advisor, Sarah Sanders, participated in Fox News Sunday.
Questioned about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "The date has not yet been marked, it may be this week, but it may also be delayed another week, taking into account everything that has happened in the Supreme Court.
Let's see. I always like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists would disagree with this statement: Sanders has not organized a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
The presenter Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of press conferences is not due to a deviation from the "protagonism" of television reporters, although he said that: "It would not be inconsistent with the fact that they like protagonism."
He then realized that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The President makes more questions and answers than any previous president," he said, adding, without adding proof: "We have analyzed these numbers."
The press conferences will continue, Sanders said, but "if the press has an opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, that is infinitely better than talking to me.
We have tried to do this often and have seen that we have done so in recent weeks, and the fact that they can talk to the President of the United States replaces any press conference."
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or press conferences, when receiving foreign representatives.
The press conferences on the ground are rare.
This week the President showed why in New York, he appeared in an undistracted and sometimes bizarre way in front of the present journalists.
Minister of Health writes to EU workers in the Scottish National Health Service about Brexit's fears
The Minister of Health wrote to the EU staff working in the Scottish National Health Service to express the country's gratitude and request that they stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent the letter less than six months after leaving the UK of the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed itself to running for EU citizens who work in the decentralized public services of the country.
In her letter, Mrs Freeman wrote: "During the summer negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on withdrawal continued, pending decisions for this fall.
But the UK government has also accelerated preparations for a possible exit scenario without agreement.
I know this is a very worrying time for all of you.
That is why I would like to reaffirm at this time how much I value the contribution of each employee, regardless of their nationality.
Co-workers from all over the EU and other sources bring valuable experience and skills, which strengthen and improve the work of the health service, benefiting the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is truly your home and we want you to continue here."
Christion Abercrombie submitted to emergency surgery after suffering head injuries
The Tennessee State Tigers defense, Christian Abercrombie, was submitted to an emergency surgery after suffering head injuries on Saturday's defeat by 31-27 in front of the Vanderbilt Motors, Mike Organ informed the Tigers.
Coach of the Tennessee team, Rod Reed, told reporters that the injury occurred just before the interval.
"She approached the lateral line and almost fainted," Reed reported.
The technical team and the medical staff placed Abercrombie oxygen on the side line before placing it in a maca and transporting it to a deeper evaluation.
A team representative told Chris Harris from the Nashville WSMV, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was recovering from surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no information about the type/gravity of the injury" and that the team is trying to find out when it happened.
Abercrombie, a second-year student, suspended the studies during the first season with Tennessee State Tigers after a transfer from Illinois.
He made five stickers on Saturday before leaving the game, which raises his total season to 18 stickers.
A higher seal tax on foreign buyers will be collected when acquiring properties in the United Kingdom
The Conservative Party has announced plans to collect a higher seal tax on foreign buyers who acquire properties in the United Kingdom, with the additional revenue to be invested in aid to homeless people
The measure will neutralize the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract the younger electorate
The increase in seal tax will affect buyers who are not taxed in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance expects to raise up to 120 million pounds a year to help homeless people
A higher stamp tax rate will be charged to foreign buyers who acquire properties in the United Kingdom, with the additional revenue to be invested in aid to homeless people, Theresa May will today announce.
The measure is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract the younger electorate, with promises to provide more affordable accommodation and to tax higher incomes.
The increase in seal tax will affect people and companies not taxed in the United Kingdom, with the additional revenue to boost the government's campaign to offer a roof to homeless people.
The surplus - added to the current seal tax, including the highest levels introduced two years ago for the second rooms and rental purchases - may rise to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects the measure to raise up to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13% of the new buildings in London are acquired by non-residents in the United Kingdom, increasing prices and making it difficult to access first-room buyers to the market.
Many prosperous areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "phantom cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers spending most of their time outside the country.
The new policy arises weeks after Boris Johnson has demanded a cut from the seal tax to help young people acquire their first home.
He accused the large construction companies of keeping the prices of the high properties when landing land that they did not use, demanding that Mrs. May leave the quotas on affordable accommodation to resolve the "damage of accommodation" in Britain.
Mr Corbyn announced an appeal for housing reform proposals, including income checks and the end of the "no justification".
He also wants to assign extended powers to the municipalities for the construction of new houses.
Mrs. May said: "Last year I said that I would devote my mandate to restoring the British dream that living conditions should be improved for every new generation.
And that means solving the problem of our real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it is not true that it is as easy to buy a house for people living outside the United Kingdom and for foreign companies as for British resident workers.
For too many people the dream of being the owner of their home has become too distant and the shame of those who sleep at the back continues to be too real."
Jack Ross: "My last ambition is to guide Scotland"
Sunderland coach Jack Ross said his "last ambition" is to come to become Scotland's picker.
The 42-year-old Scottish has been successful in the challenge of giving new life to the club of the north-east, currently third classified in the First League, to three points of leadership.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after guiding St. Mirren on his return to the Scottish First Division in the past.
"I want to represent my country as a player.
But I just got an internationalization B," Ross told the BBC Scotland Sports Sound program.
"I grew to see Scotland playing in Hampden with my father and these are some of my best memories.
But this opportunity will only arise if you succeed in managing clubs."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland coach include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach of Alloa Athletic says he was not afraid to happen to names so consecrated in such a large-scale club after rejecting Barnsley and Ipswich Town invitations.
"For me, at the moment the success is summed up to "can I take the club back to the Premier League?"
Considering the structure and facilities of the club, its location is undoubtedly at the Premier League," he said.
"It won't be easy to take the club back, but I'll just think I've done well here when I reach that goal."
Ross' career as a coach is only three years old, after a period as an assistant coach of Dumbarton and 15 months on the Hearts technical team.
He then helped Alloa recover from the descent to the third division and led St. Mirren from the threat of depromotion to the championship title in the following time.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever felt during his career as a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
Taking note of Alloa "was a real crusade," remember.
"I've always seen myself more as a coach than a player.
It seems strange because it went well, I won life as a player and I had some high moments in my career.
But playing can be very hard.
We face many challenges every week.
I still face them in terms of stress and stress, but I feel very well as a coach.
I've always wanted to train and now that I'm doing it, I feel more comfortable than I've ever felt in my adult life."

The perfect time for a pint is 17:30 on Saturday, according to a study
The summer heat wave filled the British pubs, but put more pressure on the restaurant chains.
Restoration groups recorded a 2.7% increase in sales in July, but the occupation of restaurants decreased 4.8%, showing statistics.
Peter Martin, from CGA consultant, who compiled the statistics, said: "The continuation of the good time and career of England in the World Football Championship, longer than expected, made the pattern of June, in which the pubs recorded an increase of 2.8% in sales, if it were repeated in July, but the restaurants knew a return.
The fall of 1.8% recorded in the sales of the restaurant in June got worse in July.
Pubs and bars with the business sitting in the drinks had the best performance far away, with a homologous growth more than compensated for the downfall of the restaurants.
Pubs with business sitting in the meals also experienced difficulties, although not as dramatic as those of the restoration operators.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In pubs and bars managed directly, the sales of drinks rose 6.6% during the month, with meals returning 3%."
Paul Newman, from the analyst of the leisure and restoration sectors RSM said: "These results extend the trend we have recorded since the end of April.
Meteorology and the impact of major social and sports events continue to be the main factors that influence sales in the outside food market.
It is no surprise that the restoration groups continue to face difficulties, although the annual drop in sales of 4.8% is particularly damaging when they are added to the increase in cost pressure.
The long and hot summer could not get at worst for the operators with the business sitting in the meals. Only time will tell if the warmest temperatures we know in August will provide the desired relief."
The growth of the total sales of pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the early release of brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker, the sectoral indicator of sales of British pubs, bars and restaurants, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operational groups, with a combined turnover of more than 9 billion pounds, being recognized as the sector's benchmark.
One in every five children hidden from parents secret accounts on social networks
One in every five children - some with only 11 years of age - has secret accounts in the social networks that hide parents and teachers, revealed a study
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed an increase in "false" pages in Instagram
The news exacerbates fears about the publication of sexual content
Twenty percent of students claimed to have a "principal" account to show their parents
One in every five children - some with only 11 years of age - creates accounts on the social networks that hide adults.
An investigation with 20,000 secondary school students revealed a rapid increase in "false" accounts on the Instagram photo sharing site.
The news exacerbated fears about the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of students claimed to have an innocent "principal" account to show their parents, while at the same time holding private accounts.
A mother who found the secret account of her 13-year-old daughter discovered that the teenager was urging others to "violate her".
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Directors (HMC) of Independent Schools, revealed that 40% of young people between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, half of which he admitted to keeping private accounts.
HMC director Mike Buchanan said: "It is disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where their parents and teachers cannot find them."
Elid Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" at the Scottish Athletics Council
Elid Doyle was elected non-executive Director of the Scottish Council of Athletics at the annual General Assembly of the regulator.
Doyle is the most successful Scottish athlete. President Ian Beattie described the appointment as an excellent opportunity for sports regulators to take advantage of their vast international experience over the past decade.
"Eilid is extremely respected throughout the Scottish, British and world community of athleticism and we are sure that Scottish athleticism will have much to gain with its presence in the Council," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I am excited to be able to act like the voice of athletes and I hope to be able to contribute truly to helping guide sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200th and 400th marks in the Atlanta Olympic Games in 1996, and a total of four Olympic gold medals, and who is currently a regular commentator on BBC, stopped walking after a transient ischemic accident.
As he wrote on Twitter: "Do today a month that suffers a stroke.
I stopped walking.
The doctors said that only time would tell me if I could recover and to what extent.
It's been a painful job but I've achieved a total recovery, I've learned to walk again, and I've even done agility exercises!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Advert of milk extraction pump compares mothers to cows, dividing online opinions
A dairy mining company divided online opinions with an ad that compares mothers who breast-feed cows in order.
To mark the launch of what is described as the "first portable silent pump of milk extraction", the consumer technology company Elvie launched an ironic announcement inspired in the music videos to highlight the freedom granted by the new pump to mothers who extract milk.
Four mothers dance in a feno-filled holiday at the sound of a music that includes verses such as: "Yes, I'm ordering, but I don't have trouble" and "If you haven't repaired, I don't have tits, these are my tits."
The report continues: "Bombs, bombs, baby food, bombs, bombs, I'm ordering my girls."
However, the ad published on the company's Facebook page generated online controversy.
With 77,000 visualizations and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from spectators, with many saying that it eases the "horrors" of the Latinian sector.
"You tried to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give the light to produce milk, only their babies are stolen from them a few days after they were born," wrote one viewer.
The Elvie extraction pump comes discreetly within a breast-feeding suture (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: "Comprehensively traumatic for the mother and the baby.
But yes, why don't you use them to announce an extraction bomb for mothers who can stay with their babies?"
Someone said, "An announcement with a huge lack of sensitivity."
Others defended the ad, as a woman who admitted to finding the song "hilariante".
"I think it's a great idea.
If I was still breast-feeding, I'd buy one.
The extraction made me feel exactly like a cow.
The ad is a bit crazy, but it makes all the sense.
This product is great," wrote one of the women.
Another commented: "It's a fun ad addressed to mothers who extract milk (many times in bathrooms or at work) and feel like "voices".
It's not an announcement to praise or judge the Latinic sector."
At the end of the video, the group of women revealed that they were dancing with the discreet bombs housed in the sutians.
The concept behind the campaign is based on information that many women who extract milk with bombs claim to feel like cows.
However, the Elvie bomb is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and has discreetly head inside a breast-feeding suture, giving women the freedom to move, grab their babies, and even go out of the house while they milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and Creative Director of "Mother", commented: "The Elvie bomb is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By establishing a parallel between women who extract milk and milk cows, we wanted to highlight all the challenges of milk extraction, while we presented in a fun way and with which people can identify the incredible feeling of freedom provided by the new bomb.
It wasn't the first time the Elvie bomb was hit.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two children showed up at the passerelle for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children discreetly relocated to a campsite on the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained has reached a peak, despite the monthly crossings of the border have remained relatively unchanged, partly because the severe rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult for children to be trained.
Traditionally, most of the "patrins" are themselves undocumented immigrants, fearing to compromise their own possibility of staying in the country by offering to step up a child.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential parents and other adults who integrate their family members should record their fingerprints, and the data were shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Immigration and Alfândegas Control Service, testified before the Congress that the service stopped dozens of people who had applied for non-accompanied minors.
The service later confirmed that 70% of the detainees had no criminal record.
"Approximately 80% of the parents or members of their family members are illegal in the country, many of whom are foreigners with criminal records.
That is why we will continue to pursue these individuals," Mr Albence said.
In order to speed up the processing of children, officials introduced new rules requiring some of them to be brought before a court within a month of the date of detention, instead of 60 days, the previous rule, according to the officials of the reception centres.
Many are present by videoconference, not in person, to defend their application for legal status before a judge of the immigration court.
Those considered ineligible for aid shall be immediately deported.
The longer children remain detained, the more likely they are to feel anxious or depressed, which may lead to access to violence or attempts to escape, according to the staff of the reception centres and reports produced by the system in recent months.
Immigrant rights defenders say that these concerns are exacerbated in larger installations such as Tornillo, where the large dimension contributes to the neglect of children's disturbance.
They add that the transfer of children to the camps without leaving time for their emotional preparation or to say goodbye to friends makes the trauma with which many are already discussing.
Syria demands immediate withdrawal from the American, French and Turkish "occupational forces"
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also requested the return of Syrian refugees home, despite the war in the country in its eighth year.
Mouelem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces are illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of combating terrorism, and that "they will be treated as such".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said to the Assembly.
Moalem insisted that the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, in a war that left millions more displaced.
He said that Damascus would continue to "break this sacred battle until we free all Syrian territories" from both terrorist groups and from "all and any illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, mainly training and advising the Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in this country devastated by the war.
Regarding the issue of refugees, Moualem said that the conditions for their return were assured, accusing "some Western countries" of "spending irrational fears" that led refugees to stay abroad.
"We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no help in rebuilding Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to put an end to the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a security zone in the last major rebel base of Idlib created an opportunity to insist on political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has avoided a large-scale attack by the Syrian forces supported by the Russians in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement established "clear spaces" and expressed hope that military action targeted the jihadists, including the combatants of the Al-Nusra Front associated with Al-Qaeda, who "will be eradicated".
The United Nations envoy, Staffan de Miscura, hopes to convene shortly the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria, preparing the ground for elections.
Moualem laid down conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, stating that the work of the panel should be limited to "review of the articles of the current constitution" and warning against possible interference.
Because Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Trump would be re-elected in 2020, unless, as many liberal observers are likely to expect, the accusation and scandals will soon end their presidency.
The one that would certainly constitute "the most dramatic end of a presidency forever"!
At the moment, there are no signs of weary viewers.
Since 2014, hearings have more than doubled to 1.05 million in CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million spectators in good time, an increase of 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and the MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" led cable hearings with up to 3.5 million spectators on big news nights.
"This is a strong call for people because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, producer of ABC's "Designed Survival" program on a cabinet chief who becomes President after an attack that destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a comedian veteran and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club", has another theory.
Remember when you called a taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The cab driver told him he was going to vote for Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
He said, "Because he makes me laugh," Scovell told me.
Chaos have value of entertainment.
Of course, unlike television programs, stories from Washington can determine the future of legislation on abortion, the right to family meetings of immigrants and the health of the global economy.
Changing the program is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can give.
And yet, it is more than being an informed citizen when we are attending the sixth hour of a debate by experts on the use by Bob Woodward of sources "with deep knowledge" in his book "Fare", Paul Manafort's ivory leather blouse ("a piece of clothing full of insolence", as mentioned by Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniels' s... hum... President Trump's anatomy.
For my part, I will never face the Super Mario in the same way.
"Part of what he has done seems to be a reality show because he gives us something every night," said Brent Montgomery, director of the Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", on the dynamic list of Trump and the daily turns of the circuit (antigonizing with the NFL, praise Kim Jong-Un).
We can't lose any episode or stay behind.
When I spoke to Mr. Fleiss this week they were 26th on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was closed at home, seeing MSNBC while recording CNN.
He did not detract from television while Brett Kavanaugh was preparing to witness before the Senate Justice Commission, with the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
"I still remember when we did all those crazy programs and people said: this is the principle of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but at last they were right."

Significant external financing in the inter-trial elections for the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that the 17th cycle of Pennsylvania has a flow of funding, thanks to the reinstatement of the electoral circles that left two holders in the race for the same place.
The recent adjustment of Pittsburgh's suburban circles placed the Democratic Conor Lamb in the race, which won its place in another circle in an extraordinary election last spring.
Lamb is running against another title, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th circle of Pennsylvania, which is largely superior to the new 17th circle.
The maps were redesigned after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania had decided in January that the old circles would unconstitutionally favor the Republicans.
The race for the 17th round triggered a tough dispute over the funding of the campaign between the financial arms of the main parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a tangential victory in the extremely controversial extraordinary elections in March for the 18th election circle of the Congress of Pennsylvania.
This place was occupied for more than a decade by a Republican and President Donald Trump won in the circle by 20 percentage points.
Analysts have given a slight advantage to the democrats.
U.S. thought it would punish El Salvador for supporting China, then retreating
Some diplomats pointed out that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with few Washington protests.
President Trump had a warm meeting with the president of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, in June 2017, and had a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled Trump Organisation from the board.
Representatives of the Department of State decided to call the leaders of US diplomatic representations in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama after the "recent decisions to stop recognizing Taiwan", said Heather Nauert, spokesperson of the Department of State, in a communiqué this month.
However, only sanctions were considered against El Salvador, which received approximately US$ 140 million in 2017, including for control of drug trafficking, economic aid and development.
The proposed penalties, which included cuts in financial assistance and specific visa restrictions, would have severely penalized this Central American country with high unemployment and homicide rates.
With the continuation of the internal meetings, representatives of North America and Central America held a high-level conference focused on economic security and prosperity, following a similar meeting last year as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from entering the United States.
But in mid-September, administration top officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to continue, putting aside all and any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence has scheduled an intervention at the conference, now marked for mid-October, in a signal of the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, the diplomats said.
The three American representatives discreetly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any hard messages or punishment from Washington.
The spokesperson for the White House for Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to talk about the internal deliberations on the coverage of the anonymity.
His reports were corroborated by an external analyst near the Administration, who also requested the anonymity.
Study the History
The next bomb to be released may be the report by Legal Adviser Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of justice by Mr Trump, on which there is currently substantial evidence in the public domain.
Mueller will be claiming to guide his investigation in order to find out if Trump's campaign has concurred with Russia in order to attack the elections.
If Congress changes hands, Trump will face responsibility on the part of that body, while preparing to present himself to the electors again and perhaps to be judged by their peers.
There are many hypotheses and I do not want to suggest that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable - not even his equivalents in Europe.
There are choices we have to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the fight.
In 1938, some German officials were prepared to demolish Hitler in a coup d'état, since the West had resisted and supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We missed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of carnificin that followed.
The course of history revolves around points of inflection such as this, in which the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or blocked.
The Americans are currently facing several of these inflexibility points.
What would we do if Trump fired Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been under threat since this paper reported that, last year, he suggested to record the President secretly, speculating on his inability to carry out the task.
Rosenstein says the news of The Times is wrong.
"How will we respond if the recently requested FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not fair and complete or if it is confirmed to the Supreme Court, despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and dishonest testimony?
And above all, are we going to vote in the interim elections for a Congress responsible for Mr. Trump?
If we sink into these tests, democracy will be about to pass through a long desert.
But I believe we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my diplomatic residence.
She survived, immigrated to America and, 60 years later, sent me to light candles from Sabath on that table with suastics.
With an inheritance of these, how could you not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorans of the Optimist Rangers before the game with the Vienna Rapid
The Rangers receive the Vienna Rapid on Thursday, knowing that a victory over the Austrians, following the impressive empate in Spain with Villareal at the beginning of the month, will leave them in a good position to qualify in Group G of the League of Europe.
A knee injury prevented the average Graham Dorrans from making the first game of the season until the match to two goals with the Villareal, but he believes the Rangers will be able to use this result as a trampoline for higher flights.
"It was a good point for us because Villareal is a good team," said the 31-year-old player.
"We won the game with a positive mentality and won a point.
Perhaps we could have gained near the end, but in global terms, the empathy was probably the most just result.
They were probably better in the first part but we turned around and dominated in the second part.
Thursday will be another great European night.
I hope we can win the three points. It will be a difficult game because they have achieved a good result in the last game but, with the support of the public, I am sure we will give our best to achieve a positive result.
Last year was very hard, with all my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now there is a good environment.
The team is good and the players are having fun; the training runs well.
I hope we can give our best, forget the past and achieve success."
Women are losing sleep with fear of this savings-reform account
Although participants in the investigation have a clear idea of the type of care they intend to take, few people have talked to their families about the matter.
About half of the individuals in the nationwide study referred to talking to their spouses about the cost of continued care.
Only 10% mentioned talking to children about the same subject.
"People want a family to take care of themselves, but they're not having this conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationalwide Life Insurance Branch.
Here's how to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You will not be able to prepare your family to take care of them if you do not let them know your wishes with due advance.
Work with your consultant and your family, discussing where and how to receive care, since these choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Includes your financial consultant: Your consultant may also help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Their continuing care financing choices may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid policy with monetary valuation to help cover these expenses or funding using their own savings, provided that they have these available values.
Prepare legal documentation: Avoid legal battles.
Name a health care investigator, choosing a person from your trust to supervise your health care and ensure that professionals respect your wishes if you are prevented from communicating with them.
Consider also the constitution of an inquiry into your finances.
You will have to select someone you trust to make the financial decisions for yourself, ensuring that your accounts will be paid if you are incapacitated.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent is suffering a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
Would you like to answer the questions about medication and allergies?
Include this information in a written plan to be prepared.
"Not only are there financial issues at stake, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What's the medication?
Who'll take care of the dog?
Prepare this plan."
Targeted man multiple times with air pressure in Ilfracombe
A man was targeted several times with an air pressure when he returned home after one night in the city.
The victim, at the house of forty years old, was in the Oxford Grove area in Ilfracombe, Devon, when it was reached in the chest, abdomen and hand.
The agents described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a "random act".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
The injuries do not involve life risk and the police have requested witnesses.
Sysmos and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a strong earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, the authorities reported, and were expected to increase the number of deaths.
With the communications interrupted, the rescuers failed to obtain any information from the Dongala region, a zone north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of magnitude 7,5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Dongala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Sulawesi Central, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Dongalla is a region that extends over 300 km from the coast, northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The region, with administrative status lower than that of a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main economic activities of the province of Sulawesi Central, especially in the coastal region of Dongala.
The extraction of nickel is also important in the province, but focuses mostly on Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the past hundred years, according to the Indonesian disaster management agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongala.
A tsunami also hit the western part of Dongala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Seismic Fire ring, being regularly hit by seismic.
Here are some of the main symptoms and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: On December 26, a strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh, in the north of Sumatra, originated a tsunami that reached 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong systems reached the western coast of Sumatra, at the end of March and beginning of April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island, along Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake hit the south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, originating in a tsunami that hit the south coast, killing almost 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake hit the city of Padang, the capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake hit one of the islands of Mentawai, along Sumatra, detonating a tsunami with waves up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A little deep earthquake hit the Pidie Jaya region in Aceh, spreading the destruction and panic among people who remembered the devastation caused by the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
This time no tsunami occurred, but more than 100 people died buried under the ruins of the buildings.
2018: Great Sismos reached the Indonesian island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The systems destroyed thousands of buildings, leaving thousands of tourists temporarily isolated.
Senior son of Sarah Palin arrested for domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice-President Sarah Palin, was arrested for charges of aggression.
Palin, 29-year-old resident in Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspected domestic violence, interference in an investigation into domestic violence and detention resistance, according to a report released on Saturday by the Alaska police.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he pulled his phone off.
Palin was previously detained in the Mat-Su pre-trial detention center, subject to a $500 bail, informed KTUU.
He was present to the judge on Saturday, declaring himself "evidently, innocent", the station announced.
Palin faces charges for three Class A crimes, which means he can be sentenced to a penalty of up to a year and fined at $250,000.
He was also charged with a class B crime, punishable by a day of chains and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges against Palin are filed.
In December 2017 he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
The mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is brought before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, interference with the complaint of a domestic violence crime and possession of alcohol-dependent weapons in relation to the incident.
Your girlfriend accused him of strangling his face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by associations of veterans after associating the violent behavior of the child with post-traumatic stress resulting from her service in Iraq.
Sismo and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died as a result of a earthquake that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electrical and communications networks were cut off, expecting the number of dead to rise in the next few days.
The system reached the region of Sulawesi Central, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jacarta.
They broadcast videos on social networks showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people were gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Public Ministry asks for rare capital punishment for suspected terrorist attack in New York
The New York Public Ministry is calling for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack that killed eight people in the city -- a rare penalty that has not been executed in the state by a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, aged 30, is accused of using a truck rented by the Home Depot to carry out an attack in October, on a cyclist in West Side Highway, in the Lower Manhattan, stockpiling pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intendedly" killed the eight victims and "intendedly" inflicted serious injuries, according to the notification requesting the death penalty, registered in the South Zone of New York.
Both charges can be punished with the death penalty, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, the jury of a federal court accused Saipov of 22 crimes, including eight charges of murder to the service of organized crime, usually used by the Public Ministry in cases of organised crime, and a charge of violence and destruction of motorized vehicles.
The attack demanded a "considerable planning and premeditation", the prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov executed it as "atrocious, cruel and corrupt".
"Sayful Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", he refers to the notification.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
A decade ago the South Zone of New York didn't demand the death penalty for a charge.
The reu, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug traffickers, but the penalty was commuted to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953, when the couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being sentenced by conspiracy to commit acts of espionage in favour of the Soviet Union, two years earlier, during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
According to the court's documentation, Saipov, natural of Uzbekistan, did not show any reimbursements in the days and months following the attack.
He told the investigators that he felt good about what he had done, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he had been inspired to carry out the attack after watching videos of ISIS on his phone, according to the charge.
He also applied for permission to hang the ISIS flag in the hospital room, he referred to the police.
He declared himself innocent of all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of Saipov's defense lawyers, said they were "of course disappointed" with the indictment's decision.
"We think that the decision to request the death penalty rather than accept a confession of guilt for life imprisonment, without the possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma associated with these events for all involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the accused not to ask for the death penalty.
Conservative Member states that NIGEL FARAGE should lead the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage today promised to "mobilize the popular army" during a protest at the Conservative Congress.
The former UKIP leader said that politicians should "sympathize with the pressure" of Eurocetics, while one of Theresa May's Members suggested that he should lead the negotiations with the EU.
Conservator Peter Bone said in Birmingham's demonstration that the United Kingdom "would have left" if Farage was Brexit's Minister.
But the challenge faced by Mrs May to reconcile her deeply divided fellow believers was underlined by the conservatives who advocated the permanence, who organized a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister has been debated to maintain his commitment plan, known as the Chequers Plan, against the attacks of Brexit's supporters, permanent defenders and the EU.
The Allies insist that she will continue to try to reach agreement with Brussels in spite of the protests, forcing the Euro-Cethenics and the Labour Party to choose between their package and their "chaos".
Mr. Bone said at the launch of the Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted to "end the Plan".
Bone suggested that Farage should have been entrusted with responsibilities in the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were responsible, we would've gone out," he said.
Wellingborough said, "I will continue to defend Brexit but we should end the Plan."
Strengthening its opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight in two World Wars to be subserviants.
We want to make the laws of our own country."
Bone rejected the allegations that the public opinion has changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British people have changed their ideas and intend to stay is totally decoupled".
Brexit's defender Andrea Jenkyns also participated in the event, saying to journalists: "I simply say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers Plan is unpopular to the public, the opposition will not approve it, is unpopular to our own party and to the militants who take the campaigns to the street and to whom we owe our election.
Let the Chequers Plan fall down and start listening."
In a message addressed to Mrs. May, he added: "Only the prime ministers who know how to keep promises keep their jobs."
Farage said in the demonstration that politicians should "sympathize with the pressure" if they were ready to betray the decision that came out of the 2016 referendum.
"This has become a matter of trust between us - the people - and the political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them they're not going to know about it."
Addressing the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want them to press our political class, which is at the edge of betraying Brexit.
We want to mobilize the popular army of this country, which has given us victory in Brexit and which will not rest until we become an independent, proud United Kingdom and rule itself."
In the meantime, the defenders of permanentity marched to Birmingham before organizing a two-hour event in the city center.
A crowd of activists pushed bands with the message "Conservators against Brexit" after the group was launched this weekend.
The representative of the Labourers in the House of Lords, Andrew Adonis, criticized the Conservatives for the security problems they faced with the party's application at the opening of the congress.
"It is these people who tell us that they will have the computer systems and all the technology prepared for "Canada more", for the free border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
It's a complete farce.
There is no good Brexit," he concluded.
Warren plans to "seriously" the possible candidacy to the President
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says he will "seriously apply to the President" after the November elections.
Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future during a debate in that state on Saturday.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, is a candidate for the re-election in November against Republican Member Geoff Diehl, co-mandater of the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It has been speculated that you will be able to face Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was its 36th meeting with voters in the format of debate since Trump's takeover.
One of the participants asked whether he was planning to apply to the Presidency.
Warren replied that it is time for women to go to Washington to correct the problems of our government and that includes a woman at the top.
Detention in the context of the murder of Wayde Sims of LSU Tigers
Baton Rouge police, Louisiana, announced Saturday the arrest of a suspect in the case of the LSU Tigers basketball player's murder, Wayde Sims, on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police announced 20-year-old Dieteon Simpson's arrest at a press conference at 11 a.m.
The police had released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help in identifying a man seen in the images.
Yes, 20 years old, he was beaten near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims took a shot in the head, after which he ended up dying," police chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters on Saturday, according to 247 sports.
Wayde defended a friend and was targeted by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to his presence at the site, imposing a weapon, recognizing that he had targeted Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without showing resistance and taken to East Baton Rouge Parish police team.
Yes, a 1.98-meter junior created in Baton Rouge, played 32 games and was holder for 10 times in the past, with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 recoveries per game.
Great Russian Prize: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title with a victory over Sebastian Vettel following team orders
It became clear from the time Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team orders played a central role in the race.
Leaving the pole position, Bottas had a good start and left Hamilton behind in defending his position on the first two curves, allowing Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went first to the boxes and made Hamilton have to face the end of the platoon, which could have been decisive.
Mercedes went to the boxes one time later and went out behind Vettel, but Hamilton exceeded him after a clean squeak, after which the Ferrari pilot resolutely left the inside of the free track, under the risk of disqualification after a double trajectory correction to defend himself in the third curve.
Max Verstappen left the last line of the grid and was in the seventh place at the end of the first time, on the day of his 21st birthday.
He then led a large part of the race, changing tires very late, which would allow him to be fast in the final part, aiming to go over Kimi Raikkonen to finish fourth.
He finished coming to the boxes in the 44th round but couldn't improve his pace in the last eight rounds, which allowed Raikkonen to end up in a room.
"It's a hard day because Valteri did a fantastic job all weekend and he was a real knight, letting me go over it.
The team did an exceptional job, which allowed us to finish in the first two positions," Hamilton said.
Body language
President Donald Trump has ridiculed Senator Diane Feinstein on Saturday because of his insistence on not revealing a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court, of sexual abuse.
Speaking on a committee in Western Virginia, the President did not refer directly to Ford's testimony before the Senate's Justice Commission, commenting instead that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are "more, more malicious and false".
"See the beautiful thing that is happening in the Senate in the last days, see the anger, see how people are more, evil and false," Trump said.
"When we see the leaks of information and communications and when they say 'oh, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me.
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, did the escape go away from you?
Do you remember her answer... has she released the document?
Oh, no.
The escape didn't start with me.'
Well, let's wait there.
The escape departed from us... No, it wasn't us," he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein received the letter with the details of the charges against Kavanaugh sent by Ford in July and the escape took place in early September, but denied that the escape had left his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't reveal his story," Feinstein told the Commission, according to The Hill.
"She asked me for confidentiality and I complied with her request."
But his dissident did not convince the President, who said during the beginning of Saturday night: "You know, that was the worst body language.
Maybe it wasn't her, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court's nomination, accused of sexual abuse by three women, the President suggested that the Democrats would be using the charges in their favour.
"They are determined to regain power by all means.
We see evil, evil, no interest in who can reach, who have to walk to seize power and control," said the President, according to the Mediate.
First Division: Dundee Stars defeat by Belfast Giants for 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals by the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars were rescued from defeat on Friday in the game of the First Division against the Belfast Giants, winning the second hand for 5-3 on Saturday in Dundee.
The Giants have gained an initial advantage of two goals with Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier finishes.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie were on their way home team before Dwyer put the Giants in front again.
François Bouchard has come to Dundee before two goals of Lukas Lundvald guarantee the team's victory.
It was the third defeat of the season for the men of Adam Keefe, who had achieved a turnaround on Friday night in Belfast, defeating Dundee for 2-1.
It was the fourth season meeting between the two teams, with the Giants winning the three previous games.
Dwyer's first goal arose in the fourth minute (3:35) following assistance from Kendall McFaill, with David Rutherford to assist Beauvillier to increase the advantage four minutes later.
In the first brake period, Sullivan again put the house team in the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt provided the empathy to Cownie, at 15:16.
Dwyer assured the Giants that they would reach the first stage of leadership, marking their second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The team of the house reorganized and Bouchard repatriated with a mighty goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran made efforts to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the game at the end of the second period, guaranteeing victory by marking the fifth goal of the team in the middle of the last period.
The Giants, who lost four of the last five games, receive Milton Keynes in the next game on Friday.
Aerial controller dies to help hundreds of passengers escape the earthquake
A Indonesian air controller has been hailed as a hero after dying to ensure that a plane with hundreds of passengers unloaded safely.
More than 800 people died and many continue to disappear after a strong earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, originating in a tsunami.
Strong replicas continue to undermine the region, leaving many residents buried in the trash in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing to save themselves, 21-year-old Antonioius Gunavan Aggin refused to leave his post while the control tower was taking off with violence at the airport of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri in Palu.
It remained focused to ensure that the flight 6321 of Batik Air, which was then on the track, landed safely.
He then jumped from the control tower in front of the emerging collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
Indonesia's air navigation agency spokesman Yohannes Sirat said that the decision could save hundreds of lives, reported the Australian TV chain ABC News.
We sent a Balikpapan helicopter to Kalimantan to evacuate him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
"We were devastated with this news," he added.
However, the authorities feared that the number of deaths could reach thousands, referring to the disaster management agency in the country that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The balance sheet is increasing, as there are many bodies buried by the garbage that we have not yet been able to rescue," said the spokesman of the Nugroho Sutopo Purwo agency.
Waves up to six meters devastated Palu, where a collective funeral takes place on Sunday.
Commercial and military aircraft are transporting aid and maintenance to the site.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Each minute ambulances come with bodies.
Missing drinking water.
The minimercadas are being picked up all over the place."
Jan Gelfand, responsible for the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "The Red Cross is in a race against time to help survivors, but we do not know what we will find.
The current situation is really tragic, but it could be much worse."
The president of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, arrived at Palu on Sunday. According to CNN sources, he addressed the local military forces and said:
"I ask you to work day and night to complete the evacuation operations.
At the beginning of this year, the island of Lombok in Indonesia was hit by systems that killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini now reports that there is a missing man after the plane crash in the lagoon
The airline responsible for the plane that took off on a plane in Micronesia, Pacific, now reports that there is a missing man after reporting that all 47 passengers and the crew had been safely rescued from the plane to sink.
In a communiqué, Air Niugini claimed that from Saturday to Saturday afternoon he could not confirm the residence of a male passenger.
The area company claimed to be collaborating with hospitals, researchers and local authorities to locate man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more details about the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and the crew after the plane had spent on the water trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline has advanced that six passengers remain hospitalized on Saturday, all of them with a stable clinical picture.
You still don't know for sure what was the cause of the fall or the exact sequence of events.
The U.S. airline and the Navy were unanimous in saying that the plane failed to reach the track and fell in love with the lagoon.
Some witnesses thought the plane was out of track.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said the plane was very low.
"It was the best thing that happened," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and other people had managed to drag themselves with the water through the belt and get to the aircraft's emergency exits to sink.
He reported that the ship's assistants had panicked and started screaming, and that he had suffered a small injury in his head.
According to the U.S. Navy, the sailors who were working on an improvement of a wet in the vicinity also helped in the rescue by using an inflatable boat to transport people to the ground before the plane sinking at 30 meters (100 feet) of depth.
Based on data collected by Aviation Safety Network in the last two decades, 111 people died in accidents with registered PNG airlines, but none involved Air Niugini.
Analyst explains the chronology of the events of the night in which a woman was burned alive
The prosecution concluded its allegations on Saturday in the new trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlet, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, witnessed for several hours as an expert in the field of information analysis.
He described to the jury how he used the phone records to reconstruct the movements of 20-year-old Quintom Tellis Argument and 19-year-old Jessica Chamber victim on the night of her death.
According to the newspaper Clarion Ledger, Rowlett claimed to have obtained location data from several phones that confirm that Telllis was with Chambers on the night of his death, contradicting the statements he had made earlier.
When the data showed that his phone was with Chambers at the time he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police were talking to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When the charge asked her if Tellis was telling the truth that she was in her car that night, Sanford replied that she was lying because the car was in Nashville."
Another incongruity in Tellis's testimony pointed out that she had said that she knew Chambers about two weeks ago when she died.
The phone records indicated that they only met a week ago.
Rowlett said that, some time after the death of Chambers, Tellis switched off SMS messages, phone calls and contact information from Chambers.
"He took her away from her life," Hale said.
The defence should start presenting its final allegations on Sunday.
The judge said he was hoping that the trial would begin to be analyzed by the jury at the end of that day.
The High Breed: What is the conscious hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to change the negative tone of the genre by filling your music with positive messages.
The High Breed Group of Bristol claims that the hip hop has deviated from its roots of political and social criticism.
They want to go back to these roots and return popularity to the conscious hip hop.
Artists such as The Refugees and Common have attended a recent renaissance in the United Kingdom thanks to the intervention of other interpreters, such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black?
Love New York couples process by dismissal through a "racist" SMS message
A New Yorker love is processing a marriage for discriminatory dismissal after having been misled by receiving a mother's text message complaining that "it was another black".
The couple denied the charges of racism, claiming that the process was an act of "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two children, showed some fear when she discovered that her new mom Giselle Maurice was black when she presented herself for her first working day in 2016.
"I CAN'T CRER... MORE A BLACK," Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in an SMS message.
However, instead of sending the message to the husband, he sent it to Giselle Maurice... twice.
According to the New York Post, when he realized of his cup, a Lynsey Plasco-Faxman fired Giselle Maurice claiming the poor performance of the previous African-American love and was waiting for a Filipino love.
Giselle Maurice was paid for her only day of work and sent to Uber's house.
Now, Giselle Maurice is processing the marriage and requesting compensation of 350 USD/day for the period of six months for which she had been chosen without contract.
"I want to show them that they can't be punished," he said to the Post on Friday, adding, "I know this is discrimination."
The couple rejected the allegations of racism, saying that dismissing Giselle was perfectly logical because they were afraid they could not trust her after they had offended her.
"My wife sent him something I really didn't want to say.
He's not a racist.
We are not racist people," Joel Plasco said to the Post.
"Would your children trust someone who had treated you badly?
Your newborn son?
I don't believe it."
By calling the process of "extortion", Plasco said that his wife had been a mother only two months ago and had to deal with "a very difficult situation."
"Are you going to chase someone like that?
It's not very nice," the investment banker added.
While the legal process is under way, the court of public opinion was quick to condemn the couple on social networks, criticizing their behavior and reasoning.
New letter reveals that the editors of Paddington were afraid that readers might not identify themselves with a speaking bear
Karen Jankel, daughter of Bond, who was born shortly after the book had been accepted, commented in this way: "It's hard to get into the skin of someone who read it for the first time before it was published.
It's very fun to get to know this now, after Paddington's been so successful."
He commented that his father, who worked as a BBC camera operator before being inspired by a little bear to play writing the children's book, would not have been breast-feeding if the book had been rejected, and added that the 60-year-old's anniversary of publication had a bitter taste given his death last year.
About Paddington, who described as "a very important member of our family", said that his father was very proud of his success.
"He was a modest man and not a person given to gabarolice," he said.
"But as Paddington was so real to him, it was as if he had a successful son: we were proud even when the fact is not ours.
I think that's how I saw Paddington's success.
Despite being the fruit of his imagination, he always attributed credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to my phone.
Soon after landing, the daughter had been taken from the emergency to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the doctors fought in vain to save her life.
"Nad often called to say that the situation was really bad and that there was no chance of survival," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperous.
"Then Nad called to say that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that she had to fire me.
That's what I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, my dear.
We'll be together soon.
Together.
The medications that the doctors had given you to keep your heart working were slowly giving up and getting out of your system.
I had died a while ago, and all his organs were stopping.
I had to stay there and wait, knowing all this was happening.
I couldn't scream or complain because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to tell you."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperous, now mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane along with other passengers allied to the test why she was going through.
"No one knew," he said.
"I've always heard from my head low.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt a huge compassion for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Grief women pin cards on bridge to avoid suicide
Two women who lost loved ones who committed suicide fight to prevent others from following the same path.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have fixed cards on a galley bridge with motivation messages and phone numbers that people can use to get support.
Tyler, son of Sharon Davis, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and 18 when he committed suicide.
"I don't want no father to feel how I feel every day," he said.
Sharon Davis, 45-year-old resident in Lydney, said the son was a promising boss with a contagious smile.
"She was known for her smile.
Everyone said he was lighting the room."
However, he gave up his job before he died because he had "dumped in the darkness".
In 2014, Tyler was found dead by his 11-year-old brother.
Sharon Davis said, "I'm always worried about a possible impact."
Sharon Davis created the posts "so they know that there are people who are available to help and who can talk to, or even be a friend.
Don't close yourself.
Kelly Humphreys, a long-standing friend of Sharon Davis, lost Mark, his 15-year-old partner, shortly after his father-in-law's death.
"I didn't say I was sad or depressed," she said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas day, it was a trap. When the kids opened the presents, they didn't even look at them."
He said that his death traumatized them a lot, but it's something they have to overcome: "Destroy a family.
No one gets indifferent.
But we all have to keep living and fighting."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake with the start of the FBI investigation
"I thought that in terms similar to what I was asking - a research with time and scope defined - we could become more united," said Jeff Flake on Saturday, moving that he feared that the committee would be "demorning" in the face of an ingrained party impasse.
Why didn't Brett Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Your resolve is just a matter of time.
The mid-term elections are only five weeks away. On 6 November, if the Republicans are expected to have bad results, they will see their attempts to elect their candidate to the frustrated Supreme Court.
George W. Bush has contacted the senators to press them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and through whom he met Ashley, Bush's personal secretary at that time.
What happens after the FBI presents its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not true that Kavanaugh is able to obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice-President Mike Pence to cast the ballot and confirm his seat in the Supreme Court.
Number of deserters in North Korea decreases during Kim's regime
According to a South Korean legislator, the number of North Korean deserters for North Korea decreased from the rise to the power of Kim Jong-one seven years ago.
In quoting data from the Ministry of South Korea Unification, Park Byeong-seug indicated that 1127 deserts occurred last year compared to 2706 of 2011.
Park said that the more stringent border controls between North Korea and China, as well as the fact that smugglers of people ask for more money, were the main factors.
Pyongyang didn't make any public statements.
As a general rule, South Korean citizenship is granted to the vast majority of North Korean deserters.
Seoul reported that more than 30,000 North Koreans illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
The majority fled to China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers the deserters to be illegal and non-refugee migrants, and it is frequent to repatriate them.
The relations between North Korea and South Korea (technically still in war) have improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the denuclearisation negotiations that are in an impasse.
The talks took place after the historic meeting in June between the President of the United States, Donald Trump, and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, during which they agreed, in general, to cooperate in the creation of a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the US for the lack of progress.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under these circumstances, it is impossible for us to take the first steps towards unilateral disarmament," Ri said in a speech at the United Nations Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is hysterical and unfit to serve at the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, a minority leader in the House, said that Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, was hysterical and temporarily unfit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't stop thinking that if a woman had acted like this, it would be called hysterical," Pelosi said about his reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judicial Commission on Thursday
Kavanaugh emotionally denied all sexual abuse connections to Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh made a statement of emotional openness, sometimes in a stifling and soluble voice, speaking of his family and years of high school.
He also explicitly accused the Committee's Democrats, calling for the allegations made against him of "aggressive and conspiracy murder" organized by liberals who were tortured by Hillary Clinton had lost the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said to believe that Kavanaugh's testimony proves that he has no conditions to serve in the Supreme Court given his preconceived behaviour against the Democrats.
"I think you have disqualified yourself with your statements and the way you attacked Clinton and the Democrats," he said.
When he was asked if he would try to challenge the effective appointment of Kavanaugh and if the Democrats won the majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi hesitated.
"What I can say is that if you lie to Congress or the FBI, you do not meet the conditions to be in the Supreme Court, nor even to serve in your current court," Pelosi said.
Currently, Kavanaugh is a judge in the D.C. Circuit Report Court.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, he received potential opinions from Kavanaugh against the Affordable Care Act (more known by Obamacare) or the Roe vs Wade case, given the reputation of being a conservative judge.
During the confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh raised questions about the possibility of bringing certain decisions to the Supreme Court.
"This is not a time to choose someone hysterical and preconceived to the Supreme Court and to hope that we will be happy with the decision," Pelosi said.
Women need to know how to control their emotions.
It's a justified diatribe, months and years of rage to cross, and can't get rid of without crying.
"We heard when we sang," Mrs. Steine told me 45 years later.
"Don't you think it's weird?"
A woman with an executive post in a company who helped me tremendously. She told me she was also crying when I was angry, but she had created a technique. When she was angry and started crying, she said to the person I was talking to, "Don't think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And he kept going.
And I thought to myself... it's brilliant," Mrs. Steine continued.
The tears are accepted when they express anger because, in a more common context, they are misunderstood.
I remember perfectly that, in an old job in an office dominated by men in whom I was crying of inexplicable anger, I was caught by an older woman's neck - a no-friendly manager who terrorized me a little - and literally dragged to the stairs to hear it say
"You never let them see you cry."
"They don't know if you're angry.
They think you're sad and they're going to be happy they got to affect you."
Patricia Schroeder, at the date of the Democratic Congress of Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Gary Hart was caught in an extra-marriage relationship on board a boat called Monkey Business and gave up his candidacy, an extremely frustrated Patricia Schroeder did not see why she could not apply herself to the presidents.
"It wasn't a very serious decision," he told me to laugh 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates and another one was simply unnecessary.
There was someone who called the situation "The Snow White and the Seven Years."
Given its late entry, the fund-raising was one of the desirable ones and he swore that he would only enter the race if he managed to raise $2 million.
A battle condemned to defeat.
He found that some of his sympathizers would only give him $250, even though they had given $1,000 to male candidates.
"Do you think I'm entitled to a discount?" he asked.
When he announced that he would not enter into a formal campaign, the emotions came to the top - thank you for the people who had supported him, frustration with a system that raised so many obstacles to fundraising and made the message reach voters, instead of delegates, and anger against sexism - and tears came up.
"Even it seemed depressed," said Patricia Schroeder when she spoke about the reaction of the media.
"I'd have thought Kleinex was my business sponsor.
What would you write in my epitaph now?
"She cried?"
How the trade war between the U.S. and China can be beneficial to Beijing
The first rescue of the trade war between the U.S. and China was overwhelming, and although the end of the conflict is not in sight, in the perspective of experts, the removal of the two countries can be beneficial to Beijing in the long term.
Donald Trump, U.S. President, fired the first warning at the beginning of the year when taxing important Chinese imports including solar, steel and aluminium panels.
This week was the scene of a significant deterioration in the situation with the new rates to affect goods worth $200 billion (150 billion pounds), taxing in fact half of all the goods sent by China to the United States.
Beijing has always reflected in the same currency, with recently rising rates from 5 to 10 per cent for American goods worth $6 billion.
China has committed itself to following the steps of the United States and it is unlikely that the second largest economy in the world will be stagnant in the near future.
Making Washington back would mean submitting to the demands, but showing a public subservience to the U.S. would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, President of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing makes good use of its trumps, the pressures imposed by the U.S. trade war with the U.S. can positively sustain China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"In fact, the fact that a Washington or Beijing climate policy decision can result in an economic crisis in both countries is much more dangerous than observers could have ever anticipated," said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher dedicated to Asia's study at the Center for New American Security, a group of reflections.
Foreign Minister says Syria is ready for refugee return
Syria claims to be prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help for the reconstruction of a country devastated by more than seven long years of war.
In his speech at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the country's conditions are improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
There are now all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that have left because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and livelihood.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people who have stayed in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would receive a good deal of help for the reconstruction of the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or help from the countries sponsoring the revolt.
Europe wins in Ryder Cup in Paris
The European Selection beats the U.S. and wins the 2018 Ryder Cup with a final score from 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National in the vicinity of Paris, France.
The U.S. has now accumulated six consecutive defeats on European soil since they won the Ryder Cup in Europe in 1993.
Europe returned to its victorious crown after the Danish captain's team Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
The North American star Phil Mickelson, who showed serious difficulties during almost all the tournament, sent the tea of departure to the water at the hole 16, par 3, giving the victory to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari shined in all its rounds, becoming 1 of the 4 players to get 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth lost 5&4 for the worst-class player in the European Selection, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The best-class player in the world, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 for Ian Poulter from England in which he may have been his last participant in Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the most prized European of all tournaments with 25.5 career points.
"It's not my habit to cry, but today I couldn't contain myself.
It was a tough year.
I can't stop thanking Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy we won the cup.
It was all a team effort and I am happy to have been able to help," said an emotional Garcia after the victory of Europe.
Pass the word to your compatriot Jon Rham who defeated the American golf legend, Tiger Woods, for 2+1 in singulars on Sunday.
"It is impossible to describe the pride I feel I have defeated Tiger Woods. I grew up to see him play," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a 13-21-3 record at Ryder Cup.
Statistical values revealed by one of the largest players of all time with 14 major winning titles and only beat by Jack Nicklaus.
With the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau who had a high-calibre performance throughout the tournament, the remaining elements of the U.S. Selection discussed getting to the fairway.
The American captain, Jim Furyk, spoke after his team's disappointing performance. "I'm proud of them.
This morning, we managed to put some fear into Europe.
Let's fight.
My congratulations to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players were excellent.
We will reorganise and I will work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Commission to continue.
I like many of these 12 players and I'm proud to be your captain.
I have to pull the hat off the other team.
They were better."
