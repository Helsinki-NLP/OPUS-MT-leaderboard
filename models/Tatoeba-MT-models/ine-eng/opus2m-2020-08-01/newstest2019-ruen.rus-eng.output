Number of trainees ready to leave in Donbass from Ukraine
The official representative of the People's Police of the self-proclaimed Lugan People's Republic (LNR) Andrei Marochko said that Ukraine would send at least 3,000 new recruits to Donbass in winter 2018-2019.
According to him, this is how Kiev plans “to do something to complete the units.”
"The unwillingness of Ukrainian citizens to serve in the lines of Ukraine's VP, massive dismissals have led to a low number of units," said Maročko, quoted by the "RIA News".
He also did not rule out that real figures for the Ukrainian army could be increased if necessary.
In 2014-2017, Kiev launched a so-called anti-terrorist operation (ATO), which was later replaced by the Joint Force (OECD).
It was expected that this measure would strengthen the role of Ukrainian rapists in resolving the situation.
At the end of August 2018, the situation in Donbass was exacerbated by the murder of the head of DNR Alexander Zachenko.
The DNA authorities have qualified what happened as a terrorist.
Several persons involved in the explosion were detained during the criminal investigation.
According to the preliminary data, they confirmed that the diversion was organized by Ukrainian special services.

The head of the British MIDI compared the EU with the Soviet Union and prison
British Minister of Foreign Affairs Jeremy Hunt compared the European Union to the Soviet Union and accused Brussels of arresting the member countries of the Community.
The diplomat made this statement at the meeting of the leading Conservative Party in Birmingham, which opened on Sunday, 30 September.
According to Daily Mail, Hunt thus commented on the difficulties in the Brexit negotiation process.
What happened to faith in a European dream and its ideals?
The EU was created to protect freedom, and the Soviet Union did not allow anyone to leave it.
The lesson of history is clear: if you turn the EU from prison to prison, the desire to leave it will not decrease but will only grow, and we will not be the only fugitive who wants to escape the prison," the Minister said.
He also added that attempts to punish Britain for the decision to leave the Euro Union would only exacerbate the crisis, notes the newspaper.ru.
In mid-September, British Prime Minister Teresa May stated that Brexit ' s negotiations had become a dead end.

In particular, there is still no clear agreement on how parties will interact after London leaves the community.
In addition, the issue of the Irish border remains open.

Ilon Mask is forced to leave the post of Directors' Board of Directors of Tesla
The United States Securities and Stock Exchange Commission and founder Tesla Ilon Mask settled their fraud dispute.
CNBC News reports.
According to the telechannels, within the framework of the arrangements reached, the Council of Directors of Tesla will have to leave the post.
In doing so, the Commission allowed Moscow to retain the position of Head of Tesla.
As noted, the founder of Tesla will also have to pay an administrative fine of $20 million.
They'll get the same amount from Tesla.
In this way, money is distributed among the affected investors.
In addition, the company should appoint two independent directors.
Ilon Mask is an American businessman who is among the 50 richest people on the Forbes magazine.
He is the Head of SpaceX Space Corporation, Neurotheological Company Neuralink and Tesla electrician developer, and the Co-founder of Paypal.
The US Securities and Stock Exchange Commission has previously brought Tesla Ilon Maska to trial on the basis of his statement published on Twitter about the possible purchase of the company.
Last month, Mask announced plans to make Tesla a private company and buy all shares in a fixed-price stock exchange of $420.
The cost of $420 was reported as “due to the importance of this number in marijuana culture”, Bloomberg reported earlier with reference to the co-director of the Commission's Security Division, Stephen Peekin.
However, Ilon Mask subsequently refused to buy shares.
Commenting on the claim made against him by the US Securities and Exchanges Commission, the businessman stated that he considered the allegations of fraud unfounded and added that he was very disappointed and disappointed by these claims.
"Physicalness is the most important value in my life, and the facts will prove that I never violated it," said a businessman in an interview with CNBC.
In August, a group of Tesla shareholders filed a collective claim against Masca, complaining of financial losses.
The plaintiffs claimed that businessmen’s posts had been damaged.
In particular, one shareholder said that businessmen had been misled by tweets, so Tesla stock sellers were forced to buy paper at artificially high prices to cover their positions.
Other claimants also noted that the unwarranted statements of Ilon Maska led to sharp fluctuations in the course.
In September, Ilona Maska accused the head of the Citron Research research company of stock exchanges.
However, if Moscow could not settle its dispute with the US Securities and Stock Exchange Commission, it would be in danger of being removed from company management and even prison.
In particular, he told the TV channel of the former chairman of the Harvey Pitts Commission.
The mask is a "bad guy who can't run a car company."

"This means marking the church as an enemy organization, and it was for this purpose that this bill was established," said the representative of the RPC in the Russian television station."
Mitropolit also stressed that the UPC is not a Russian church, but a Ukrainian church, because “the believers consider themselves Ukrainians, they are the patriots of their country”.

As a result of our meeting with car manufacturers, it must be a clear future for the creation of the Russian "Formula-1" which has no analogues in the world," said Dmitry Kozak.
We must encourage our car manufacturers in this direction.
It was a plan until 2024, but I don't think it was possible at that time.
I think more real time is over the next ten years."

According to the vice-premier, there are already investors who are ready to invest in establishing a family team at the World Motor Race Championship in Formula-1.
I know that in Russia there are car sports lovers, state-of-the-art businessmen who are willing to invest, willing to invest in the creation of the Russian Formula-1 team, he said.
"We are ready to support them morally.
We'll hope we have a team like that.
I suspect that thoughts about the establishment of a team have appeared, including because such an infrastructure has occurred in Sochi."
Tomorrow the Face Autodrom is waiting for the Englishman.

Look, even the Tribunal's qualifications have been practically filled, the vice-premier said.
I can say that this year's yield rose by 72 per cent compared to last year.
That's a good, positive result.
We are also preparing an action plan to improve the efficiency of the use of the Sochi Autodrom infrastructure throughout the year.
This will be an additional tourist product that will add even more attractiveness to Sochi.
Dmitry Kozak did not go through and the main theme of the day for Russian car lovers was the return of Daniel Quetta to Toro Rosso.
We all congratulate Daniel and wish him success next season, Deputy Prime Minister said.
It is He who is the All-forgiving, the All-seeing.

The opening of penicillin marked the beginning of the age of modern antibiotics, brought Fleming the world's glory and made it the Nobel laureate.
In fact, the release of penicillin from fungal mushrooms was not the first opening of Fleming.
A few years earlier, he was cured and had a tear from his own nose on Peter’s cup (a glass lid that had experience with bacteria) and a few days later found that the bacteria there had been destroyed.
They were found almost as accidentally as penicillin.
The name Fleming has been included in the list of 100 most outstanding persons in human history.
Its opening has, in the opinion of many scientists, changed the course of history.
With the help of penicillin, medicine began to deal with most of the oldest diseases that had previously been considered incurable - tuberculosis, syphilis, gangrene...
When, shortly after receiving the Nobel Prize, Fleming arrived in the French capital in 1945, the Paris newspapers wrote: "For the destruction of fascism and liberation of France, he did more than ten divisions."
According to experts, the opening of Fleming's first world antibiotics saved more than 200 million people from the Earth.
Alexander Fleming died in his home in London in 1955 from a heart attack.

Trump told about "love" in Kim Chen Yn
From the mutual cruelty of U.S. leaders and the Canadians, it was hardly in love with each other that Donald Tramp joked.
The President of the United States, Donald Trump, noted his success in the North Korean crisis resolution.
Starting with mutual threats of destruction, the leaders of the two countries have now improved so much that they are hardly in love with each other, the President of the United States noted.
The White House was reminded that it had adopted the North Korean problem from the previous administration as the main challenge in foreign policy.
Tramp noted that Barack Obama's team had so much relations with the Canadians that it could not even call the country's leadership - they just didn't shoot the tube there.
At that time, the United States and the Canadians were on the verge of war, and today the North Korean leader writes in the White House “pretty letters”, said Trump.
Tramp admitted that at the beginning of his work he was also "inflicted" to Kim Chen Yin, that he was, by the way, mutual.
But now their relationship has improved so much that the leaders have “in love with one another”.
However, Trump asked not to take his words literally and warned that American media interpreted them as incompetence.
The tramp pointed out that Phenyan had recently stopped nuclear and missile tests and also closed military sites.
All of this is his administration's work, a confident American president.
Last Tuesday, Donald Trump approached Kim Chen Yin easily from the United Nations Assembly.
Trump thanked the North Korean leader for the courage and steps taken to descale tension.
However, Trump noted that sanctions against the CNDR would continue until the full denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.

The meeting was a positive result of the cessation of the nuclear and missile tests of the CNDR, as well as the return to the United States of America of the remnants of the United States.
However, other practical steps towards the denuclearization of North Korea have been taken.
The media reported that several disarmament scenarios had already been sent by the Canadians since the Singapore Summit, but Phenyan rejected them, calling them “Gangsterian”.

Nicai called for "Moscian language by Ukrainian product"
The Ukrainian Children's Writer and Clergy for the purity of Larissa Nice's native language called for the withdrawal from Ukraine of "Russian Mosque Product and Mosque).
To do this, it offers Ukrainian product, “culturally waved, culturally pressured”.
In his comments on “the purpose of eradicating the Russian language in Ukraine”, Nice shared it with the Ukrainian edition of “Observer”.
According to her, the Ukrainian product in question is now being prepared - it is even already in existence and continues to develop further.
In time, the Ukrainians will "rehabilitate" from this "Moscian language", she is convinced.
For example, in neighboring Poland, she said that the Russian language had been widely used on television and radio before, but in public space, it had virtually disappeared.
However, according to Nice, the Ukrainians do not use aggressive methods in this process: the actions of the authorities prohibiting the use of Russian are, in her view, only “enlargement of borders for Ukrainian speech at the legislative level”.
Earlier, Nice had shared experiences of holding the Ukrainian regime in a child camp in Carpathians, where she was invited to work.
In December 2016, she threatened the network of Watsons bookstores, one of which was associated with her in Russian.
After she failed, Nikki turned herself into a traitor.
The use of Russian words by Ukrainians is called "language schizophrenia", calling on Ukrainians to renounce Russian letters even in writing the names.
Recently, Nikia stated that the name "Russia" was stolen from Ukrainians, so Russia should be called Moscow.
Even the Ukrainian Security Service was not able to escape the wrath of the writer: when she came there and heard the conversation of the officers with each other in Russian, she made a scandal and left, knocking the door.
A man's conversation was interrupted, and this brought forth its fruit.
The defender of Urala Dennis Kulakov - the victory over Arsenal (2:1) in the ninth round of the Russian championship.
"Denise, what makes you think you've won?"
"I think we wanted to win more," says Kulak's official Ural website.
"This was a difficult game, a serious man's conversation was interrupted, and it brought fruit: two balls were killed and they didn't miss.
"You missed a few matches because of the damage you got at the beginning of the month.
How did he feel today?"
"If he's been 90 minutes, then it's okay!
In fact, he felt good.
Maybe at the end of a little bit of force, so nothing happens.
And yes, Dr. and physicist Vladimir Anatolević Gashnev brought me to this game, and thank them very much!
"What about the atmosphere in the team?"
"It's no secret to anyone that after victory and recovery is easier, and the mood in the collective is good.
Now we had a white band, although it was black at first.
We must continue in the same spirit and rejoice with the sick."
"Have you been stuck in the game since he didn't go out in the field?"
"It's like this, it's getting a little tired, because really, it's a bad situation.
But I'll repeat it again, thanks to the physiotherapist and the doctors who put them on their feet.
The main thing is that we won and advised the sick.
And the rest is secondary."

The referendum is intended to resolve a 27-year dispute between Macedonia and Greece regarding the name of the former Yugoslav Republic, which coincides with the name of the northern Greek area.

The chapter of the Syrian MID also stressed that the P-300 was a defensive system, not an offensive system, and it was designed to protect the Syrian sky.

The head of the Board of the Federation for International Affairs, Constantine Kosachev, considered the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly to be a success for Russia and did not rule out that it could become a turning point in the perception of the RF as an inalienable participant in addressing global world problems.
“The uniqueness of the current 73rd session, in my opinion, is that the rhetoric we have been accustomed to in recent years to insinuating Russia has now been more in order,” said the senator in an interview published on Sunday by the Russian newspaper.
He explained that, in previous years, the RF was sometimes “marked as one of the three main threats to humanity, along with Ebola disease, together with climate change or terrorism, Russia was in this series, in any case, in the statement of a group of Western countries, which was sufficiently unanimous in this regard.”
At the 73rd session, Kosachev stressed that “the theme of Russia was virtually absent in the negative.
"If you carefully analyze the statement of the President of the United States, the President of France, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Germany, I am not now taking Ukraine, Georgia, or the British, in any case, people were not quite correct," said the politician, noting that Russia "was not much of a wall that was trained by tennis ball."
The head of the Soféda profile committee does not rule out that this reflects a trend that he believes will “set aside the current session [of the UN General Assembly], although this trend may be fully manifested in a year or two or three”.
"I do not rule out that the current session can be reversed in some way," said Kosachev, explaining that "there are too many examples of how Russia's integration can move forward in international affairs".
As an example, he brought situations to Syria, around Iran and North Korea.
"So far, unfortunately, not Ukraine, but I have no doubt that the Russian vision of the Ukrainian crisis will also be crushed in time," the MP added.
This is related to what he believes is that “adequate, healthy perception of Russia as not simply a possible, inalienable participant in addressing the global problems of modern times”.
"I don't want to get wrong, but I have the feeling that we're going somewhere where the movement will not be moving back, it will be moving forward," he added.
Another “interested and important feeling” in this context called Kosachev “a request for a Russian vision of how the modern world should develop”.
"I attended many meetings of the head of the Russian delegation [at the session of the General Assembly] of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Sergei Lavrov, and I was very pleased to see that if two or five years ago the Russian opinion, the Russian view of the world, which was largely uninterested, now the situation is different," said the chairman of the Sovfed Committee.
In his view, this was due to the fact that “the so-called new liberal order, which deals with the West, has no answers to questions about how to solve world problems due to a clear lack of ideas in global space, the lack of ideas about how to deal with the problems of the Middle East, the problems of terrorism, the problems of non-proliferation, the problems of migration”.
"And here demand for a Russian vision is becoming more and more evident," said Kosachev, stressing that in this sense he believes that "the current session is a good one for the work of a Russian delegation that is successful for Russia".

In Damascus, they declared their right to exercise military force in Idlib
Damascus hopes that Idlib will not have to use military force in the Syrian province, said the head of the MID of the Syrian Arab Republic, Valid Muallem.
In his view, Syria has the right to do so.
The Minister added that Turkey had the opportunity to quickly solve the problem of the expulsion of Russian-banned fighters from the demilitarized zone of Idliba, reports the RIA News.
The Head of MIDI also stressed that Damascus would have to resort to a military solution to the problem of eastern parts of the Euphrates in the event of a desire for segregation of Kurds.
At the same time, in Muallem's view, the negotiations with the Kurdish forces of SDF were good until they were interrupted by the United States.
On 17 September, Putin and President of Turkey, Recep Erdogan agreed to establish a demilitarized zone by 15 October along the line of conflict between the armed opposition and the Government forces in the Syrian province of Idlib.
Terry led the Chelsea Youth Team.

According to the RT with reference to Mirror, former British Assembly Captain John Terry led the Chelsea Youth Team.
According to the source, a well-known game, which has lasted for a long time in the London Club, will lead a team of not more than 23 years.

The first Deputy Speaker of the Irina Gerashtenko High Council apologized to a convicted Russian journalist, Roman Sushtenko, for not being able to release him from prison.
She said this in a video to a political prisoner who had been recorded before the second anniversary of the illegal arrest of the FSB.
She said that in those days under the walls of the Russian Embassy in Paris there was an action that the participants announced a hungry protest demanding the release of the Kremlin.
Every day French journalists, politicians, culturalists, there are people who know you well, hungry, supporting Oleg Senzov, other political prisoners of Kremlin, and of course, you.
There are no international meetings, no negotiations, no interviews, wherever the President of Ukraine, the Ukrainian authorities, all of us, did not demand pressure on Kremlin, pressure on Putin with one demand -- the liberation of Oleg, the liberation of Roman, the release of all political prisoners of Crimea and those who are illegally detained in the occupied territories of Donbass and Crimea," Gerashtenko said.
She also expressed confidence that the trials would be thwarted by making us “bader, more stringent in the protection of Ukraine’s national interests, in the protection of every Ukrainian, in the understanding that such good and evil are.”
Remember, the correspondent of Ukraine in France, Roman Suštenko, was detained by Russian forces at Moscow airport on 30 September 2016.
On 7 October, he was charged with spying on Ukraine ' s Chief Intelligence Office.
On 4 June 2018, the Moscow City Court sentenced Suštenko to 12 years in a strict regime colony, and the Supreme Court of Russia recognized this verdict as legitimate.
The Russian prisoners met Ukraine's last request before its entry into the column.

"I couldn't even hold the bed"
Watang Kiqabidze on Cancer Control
Many artists now tell us how they managed to cope with oncology.
Unfortunately, the disease does not save anyone, but the history of popular victory over cancer gives hope to many sick ones.
The famous actor Wachtang Kiqabidze admitted that he lived only because of his wife.
Many years ago, he was diagnosed with a terrible diagnosis that sounded like a sentence.
"I'm like a mole down on my skull.
I fell.
He's lost his orientation.
They put them in the hospital.
I couldn't hold the bed there, I couldn't stand, I fell all the time.
It turns out that it's a bad case that the artery doesn't miss blood.
They brought them to Moscow, they said I had a big, rotten bug in my head, they had an emergency operation.
And during the operation, the doctors for the cyst saw a rash," said Kikabidze in the "Onces" program.
The pouch turned out to be a bad thing.
At that time, 37 years ago, the Tbilisi people even came to say good - bye to his house.
But the actor’s wife did not allow the living actor to be buried, she believed she could cope with the illness and for more than a year did not leave her beloved wife’s bed.
If it wasn't for Irina, I wouldn't be alive now.
Whenever I had a critical situation, she was close to the rock," admitted the actor.
The actor managed to cope with the illness, and now he lives happily in his home in the center of Tbilisi.
And from time to time, his hearing is confused about his illness, about the timeless endings that appear on the Internet.
The founders of the Peacemaker website have contributed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Hungary, Peter Cearto.
As a result, it became “the attempt on the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine”.
In addition, the heads of the neighbouring countries of the Middle East have identified “direct threats to the invasion of Ukraine” and “support for separatist attitudes in Ukraine”, as well as the participation of “in the organization of provocation aimed at mass violations of Ukrainian citizens’ legislation”.
It should be noted that in front of Sierra Leone, the deputy of Kiev-Pecher Lavri Pavel and the representative of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchs) had been approved by Onufry.
They were opposed to receiving Thomas of Ukraine as a local church.
Earlier, in commenting on the issuance of Hungarian passports to Ukrainian citizens in Zacarpatha, Ukrainian President Petr Poroshenko demanded respect for Ukraine's sovereign rights.
The authorities called the golden parachutist's gold miner.
At the same time, 23 salaries were paid by Yuri Agibalov, Deputy Governor of the Voronez Region, under the regional State Post Act.
The actual amount of the gold parachutist released from office by the officer was several times less than the amount reported in the media.
Such explanations provided the press service of the regional Government.
Under the law, Agibalov's salary is 11,189 rubles.
Thus, it was stressed in the press service that the amount of one-time payment was based on the deduction of the income tax of 223,892, rather than 1 million rubles written by the media.
The officer has received an old-age pension since July 2018.
Its state office is more than nine years old.
The appointment of this pension and a one-time payment shall be made immediately after the resignation of the post, explained to the agency “RIA Novesti” in the Government area.
At the same time, Agibal's pension benefits were suspended when he was appointed to the post and his salary did not change compared with the previous period.
The winner of the Governor ' s election was the Governor of the Aleksandra Gusev region, who took office on 15 September.
Agibalov was released from office due to the expiry of the term of office of the head of the area.
The powers of other officials who held State posts in the region have likewise been completed.
On 29 September, the Telegram channel Nezagarh published documents indicating that Agibalova, who had resigned from the post of vice-governor, had paid an exit fee of 23 salaries, and two days later he had received a similar post without the addition of the Vrio.
Deputy Gosmunda called to tell schoolers about the damage of masturbation
He is the first Vice-Chairman of the Education and Science Committee.
Based on the experience of his work, he noted in an interview that adolescents to masturbation were causing the harmful information they found on the Internet.
This is what the MP added to the educational institutions and the family.
Gennadia Onishtenko, Member of Gosmundya RF (in an interview with the Moscow speaking radio station):
As part of the overall sexual education of children, this should be done by explaining the loss of children, because there is a risk of sexual health for both boys and girls.
The problem is objective, it is that child rearing occurs early enough, and there are still large knives between their sexual conception and the possibility of formal inter-sex contacts.
In the view of Oneschenko, the problem is hampered by “hungry”, the reduction of “sex age” and the lack of a culture of adequate child education.
The doctor is sure that many youths are facing ononysm.
The MP believes that practicing lessons on the harm of onanism is primarily about the schools of "hyperurbanized" regions.
"If we start this conversation in our Muslim Republic, we just won't get along with you, easy to talk," said the professor.
Gennadiai Oinštenko is an active academic of the RAMN, a member of the Bureau of the RAMN, a doctor of medical sciences, professor.
Dr. Russia and Kyrgyz, member of the presidency of the General Russian Public Health League.

ADD became the second most popular in Germany
The anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany beats a regular popularity record, and Angela Merkel's ratings fall.
According to all, the inhabitants of Germany began to take seriously the immigration policy of Angela Merkel, which led to the country ' s leading target for millions of refugees from the Middle East.
Most importantly, the latest Socrates report that the anti-immigrant "Alternative for Germany" party is becoming more popular and the positions of the ruling bloc of Merkel and Zeehofer are weakened.
This week, Agg hit a regular record, rising to the second line in the rating of the people ' s sympathy.
Right-wing Conservatives with 17 per cent of the population were able to travel to social Democrats, with about 16 per cent.
The gap in one percentage point can be attributed to statistical error, but it cannot be noted that the fact that Agg from a small group of European economists in 2013 has been able to become a major political force.
Leadership in general is still continuing to hold the ruling HSS/HDS, which has about 30 per cent.
However, the trend towards loss of points is evident here: in April, Angela Merkel's support for the block was four percentage points above.
The German chancellor ' s personal rating, which is headed by the German Government for the fourth consecutive term, is also declining.
Today, there are 48 per cent of Germans in support of Angela Merkel, 7 per cent below last year.
In addition, there were “green” (15 per cent), left (11%) and liberal (10 per cent) behind the Social Democrats.
Evolution of Alternatives
The "Alternative for Germany" party was established in September 2012 on the basis of the "Alternative Choice 2013" group, which included members of the Christian Democratic Union.
The group initially opposed the government course, but only economic issues, including the problems of the euro and EU interaction, were at first.
The group opposed the "sponsoring" of weak EU economies, did not rule out the possibility of the return to the German mark and the full withdrawal of the country from the Euro Union.
In the light of the deepening of the immigration crisis, the political platform has expanded.
In 2013, the group formed a full party that took up a series of Eurosceptics and began to strongly criticise the Government for the failure of immigration policy.
In the last parliamentary elections in 2017, Agg was allowed to enter the Bundestag for the first time, with 94 MPs receiving seats (from 709).
Two representatives of "Alternatives for Germany" were given seats in the European Parliament.
Published video with a journalist who called Ukrainian citizens "Bolvan Nation"
The leading political show on Ukrainian TV, the author of the two books of Ostap Drozdov in the direct atmosphere, acknowledged that he regarded his fellow citizens as “a Bolwan nation”.
They believe in television and read a little.
As Drosdov said, living and working in such a country is difficult.
"We haven't had a culture of reading and accepting texts since we were kids," said a journalist.
Local nationalists immediately criticized Drosdov for his lack of patriotism and greed.
As previously reported, the State Committee on Television and Broadcasting of the Independent began to fight the literature, which had the slightest incentive to criticize the Kiev authorities, banning the import of up to 201 publications.

Named after the time of death of the Universe
The universe is still about 140 billion years old, ten times the age of the world observed, about 13.8 billion years old.
The study of the international scientific community is published in the library of electronic prints arXiv.org and is published in Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan, reports the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun.
Such findings were made by the HSC (Hyper Suprime-Cam) camera of the Subaru telescope for approximately ten million galaxies.
As a result of the distribution of dark matter and dark energy of more than 95 per cent of the energy mass of the observed world, scientists, working under the LCDM (L Cold Dark Matter) model, assessed the expansion rate of the Universe, which was somewhat slower than was previously thought to be.
Subaru's press release notes that the observations have provided a detailed three-dimensional map of the distribution of matter in the Universe and that the European Space Telescope Planck has clarified the limitations imposed on LCDM parameters.
In July scientists modeled the possible death of the Universe.
Three years earlier, their colleagues presented new evidence that the world under review would cease to exist after 22 billion years as a result of the Great Depression.
There has been an ongoing attempt to bring together the pension referendum promoters
The ability to know the people ' s views on pension reform is postponed for an indefinite period
In Moscow, on Saturday, the meeting of the general federal group of the referendum against an increase in pension age was held.
It was attended by representatives of 13 sub-groups that registered different language versions of issues (the entire Centre had registered five languages).
They decided to apply to the CIC for registration of a single group of initiatives and to ask Russians: "Are you in favour of not increasing the age of the pension legislation as of 1 July 2018, on which the citizens of Russia are entitled to an old-age pension?"
The wording was registered by a Vulnerable Sub-Group, whose representatives did not participate in the meeting, but were considered to be the simplest and most legal basis.
Most of the participants were supporters of the member of the Fair Russia Ili Sviridov (six sub-groups) and the CRC (four sub-groups).
There were three independent subgroups, from Lower New York, Voronez and Orenburg.
Sviridov had previously told the Awarenesses that the invitations had been sent to all the initiators and that about 40 subgroups had agreed to come.
But, for example, Marina Semenov, the leader of the year's sub-group (it was supported by another 15 sub-groups), said to the Awarenesses, that she did not receive the invitation and did not plan to come: "We didn't understand who the other one was and who the enemy was."
Death of the blues singer Otis Rash
At the age of 84, a famous Chicago blouse guitarist and singer Otis Rash reportedly died, referring to his manager, Rick Bates.
He died as a result of complications after his stroke in 2003.

The enemy fought with dignity, created great problems for us.
I'm glad we played a good game today.
I've already said that some naked people will come, mostly to work on it.
And that we've won very important as well."
"Why did you decide to give Danis Zaryp a breakthrough in this series?"
"We have our program he's working on.
That's why it was such a decision," said Billetdin's press service club.

In the match "Loko" - "Ahmat" the errors of Turbin fell asleep as from the corner of abundance
Former world judge Vladimir Levitin commented on the work of Arbitrary Evgen Turbin in the 9th Tour of the Russian Locomotive Championship, Ahmat, and found out the controversial episodes of the game.
- How do you rate Evgenia Turbin in the Locomotive match, Ahmat?
- I believe that the referee confirmed his inadmissibility to the Russian Prime Minister's judge.
It is surprising to me that the efforts made at the fifth Spartacus Tour - Dinham, not Turbin himself or the DSI leaders, have not made serious conclusions about its low qualifications.
The result did not slow down in the ninth round: errors in his actions, private failures of rough receptions fell out of abundance.
For example, at the 50th minute of Eder's train, he's working with his hands in his crime scene, the Ahmata protector Rodolfo.
Eight meters from the gate, but Turbin doesn't put the pens.
- How do you rate the episode involving Idova, who was at the 82nd minute when it turned out that the ball had fallen into his hand?
- I think there was an imaginary defense game here in his criminal court.
The turbine was close to the moment, well seen by this episode and its first assistant on the right.
This moment was to be seen by the reserve judge Sergei Karasev.
However, the three were all asleep, and the penalties were not appointed.
Thus, the game is broken, and sports justice has been washed away.
It was the same case when the court of law was choking out and burying the sports spirit of the game.
At the 52nd minute, Turbin did not decide to remove Oleg Ivanov's guest defender, who violated the rules against Krykhovyak, and when the judge showed him a yellow card, he protested.
What do you think of this episode?
Did you need to show the second "barber"?
- Turbin and the first yellow card didn't show up at the moment.
The second would be illogical.
- Oleg Ivanov said after the match about double standards of justice that some teams are being punished for such violations as in the episode with Idova, and there is nothing.
What do you value the words of a football player?
- Watch what you understand under double standards.
There were penalties.
They didn't give it to him.
So the referee doesn't give the second penance at the opposite doors.
This is the principle that is used.
And the second moment of double standards, the judge sees who's playing.
He played Locomotive on Saturday and Ahmat had serious claims about Turbin's work because the team was damaged.
Matt Damon played the accused of rape by Judge Cavano at the start of the SNL
American actor Matt Damon played a candidate at the U.S. Supreme Court of Brett Kavano, who is accused of rape.
Damon appeared in the first issue of the new Saturday Night Live broadcast season on the NBC TV.
During a small sketch, the actor played Kavano at the hearings in the rape chamber.
The candidate in the U.S. Supreme Court had earlier drawn attention to his emotional and detailed narratives during his interview with Senator Amy Klobushar.
Yes, Kavano repeatedly admitted in his love for beer, but he said that he never drank until he was out of memory.
In addition, in an attempt to justify himself on charges of rape, Kavano claimed that he was a virgin in those years.
Damon also won those moments.
I was just doing a lot of drinking and not thinking about sex at all.
I was the most proud, drunk virgin I've ever seen.
Everyone knows this," said the judge in execution of Matt Damon.
Previously, Kavano was elected U.S. Supreme Judge.
Barbara Strazand found some strange behavior in her cloned dogs
The American singer Barbara Strazand said that her dead dog's clones were completely different from the original pituitary.
"They don't look like it.
In fact, [the clones] look like her, but it's not possible to clone the soul," stressed a 76-year-old singer.
At the end of 2017, Strazand ordered two clones of his 14-year-old dog a cotton toller named Samantha, which had to be stopped because of health problems.
In July 2018 it was reported that the dog of the Chihuahua breed at the call of Cudo-Milly (Miracle Milly) called the world's smallest dog was cloned for the 49th time.
Specialists are engaged in cloning a six-year-old animal in an attempt to understand why it is so miniature.
The United States of America has been thinking about Russia's maritime blockade due to oil and gas supply
In the United States, Russia's maritime blockade can be launched to gain advantages in the world's energy market.
The U.S. authorities have been so busy fighting for the success of the world's carbon market that they are ready to resort to Russia's maritime blockade, which remains one of the world's leading energy suppliers.
Ryan Zinke, the head of the U.S. M.D., had already told about the possibility of a maritime blockade.
In contrast to world practice, the American Ministry of the Interior is not a police officer, but a civilian, including a natural resource policy.
Zinke ' s statement was therefore fully within the competence of the head of his department, even though political decoration had not been deprived.
Speaking at an industrial event in Pittsburgh, Zinke stated that the U.S. military forces controlled sea routes in the Middle East and could block them if necessary.
Zinke said that the need could be linked to Washington's desire to prevent Russian supplies to the world energy market.
Zinke recalled that Russia was still receiving the lion's share of its income from supplies to the world oil and gas market.
The desire to distribute energy supplies in the Middle East, as in Eastern Europe, was the main reason for Moscow ' s activation in that region, is convinced of Zinke.
The Minister explained that the United States was still looking to ensure world leadership in the energy market, becoming the largest supplier of oil and gas.
To that end, Washington will have to crush Russia and Iran, and the maritime embargo on trade routes is an acceptable measure of this kind, Zinke believes.

He is young, talented, creative and in his creativity strives for new non-standard forms of self-expression.

Formula 1 Grand-by-Russian Gonka
There's a club in Russia that I'm following.
Former Captain Chelsea and Constituent England John Terry -- about why the Russian Spartacus Championship's 9th Tour took place -- "Rostov" (0:1).
"I've got a club in Russia that I'm following.
I've been watching him for a while, and I've been interested in looking at him.
I can't say I'm a painkiller, because my heart belongs to Chelsea, but I have sympathy for Spartacus and I want to apologize again for the decision made."
Remember, the 18-point Rostov was raised in the third place in the tournament table and Spartacus was on the fifth line with 15 points in the asset.
In the next round, on 7 October, the Red and White will play with Enise, and the Valerie Carpina will take Orenburg on the day.
The road script was placed in the lobby for nothing.
When a man in the city of Somerville (Massachussets) named LBC Boutique and Loan brought a script that offered only 50 dollars for an old and unrepresentable instrument.
But the experienced store manager Dylan Mcdermitt suspected that it was an old and expensive tool and sought advice from the expert.
It was found here that the script was made in 1759 by renowned Italian violinist Ferdinand Galiano and was valued at $250,000.
Only one scrap of the script is estimated at $16,000 to $180,000.
The investigation found that the violin was not so long stolen from one of the city’s inhabitants, and the instrument was returned to the rightful owner.
Not yet known how the script came to the man who placed it in the lobby, but there were no previous clashes with the law.
The manager said that now all those who brought into the lobby would ask to play on it to make sure that it really belonged to the client.
In the ninth RPL tour, we are facing an overwhelming opposition: Spartacus will take over at his "Rostov" stadium in Tušin under the leadership of Valeria Carpina, a man, as you know, not another "national team".
The speciality of this meeting adds that clubs now have an equal number of 15 points, and they divide 3 and 4 places in the tournament table, leaving the far-off Zenita and in one point from Krasnodar, which is playing with Dynamo tomorrow.
In the red-and-white field: the club is again surrounded by idiotic scandals, in the League of Europe, the Masimo Carrera team suddenly flew to Rapido, and recently moved home to Ahmatu.
After a fight with CSCA, who ended up with a fair deal, Spartacus with a minimum account and not without work won the Black Sea Cup, and so far it has been said that Russia's most popular club has approached the end of the crisis.
The Rostov three match could not win in order, because the defeat doesn't know five.
Let's see if Karpin will be able to extend the endless series of games so principled for himself.
The previous Carpina "Rostova" meeting with Spartacus ended in favour of the headquarters team.
The beginning is at 7:00.

London was angry with the charges against Moscow
Russia is trying to rewrite the outcome of the cold war, British Defence Minister Gavin Williamson said.
But England will protect its values, he stressed at the meeting of the Conservative Party in Birmingham.
More and more, Iran and North Korea are becoming more and more dangerous, the enemies are operating in severe zones through cyberattacks and false news, the Minister added.
But the largest of them is Russia, which is increasing its military presence in Ukraine and the Arctic region.
Such statements by western Moscow have repeatedly been rejected by TASS.
At that time, the head of the British MIDI, Jeremy Hunt, reported that Russia would have to pay a high price if it did not comply with international rules and use weapons.
Hunt mentioned a history of poisoning in the English city of Solsbury in March of this year by former GRU Colonel Sergei Scripala, who was convicted of spying for Britain and his daughter, Julia.
The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia holds a referendum on EU and NATO accession, subject to a change of country name.
The referendum was intended to resolve a 27-year dispute with neighbouring Greece regarding the name of the country that coincided with the name of the neighbouring Greek province.
One of the first was Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, a hot supporter of the Republic of North Macedonia.
International organizations are watching the preparations for the referendum and today ' s vote.
The Head of the Monitoring Mission of the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, Jan Petersen, told Euronews about the organized work of observers:
Approximately 100 teams have travelled throughout the country to observe the whole process today, from opening the polls to closing, then counting the votes and drawing up the protocols.

The observer groups shall set up in detail and communicate with the members of the electoral commissions in order to then present them in the final report."
The translator compared the mentality of Russian and German
The mentality of the Russian and German peoples varies, but few differences between them do not play a major role in understanding each other.
On International Translator Day, 30 September, a professional translator-synchronist, Berbel Saxe, told of this.
It has been in Russian and English for more than 30 years.
"The Germans like to plan events quietly, and the Russians, as the proverb says, "is a long time to go fast."
But it seems to me that for understanding among the peoples and for the work of the translator, this is not a major role," said a specialist in the commentary "RIA News".
According to the translator, in order to understand that two countries don't do without each other, " enough to know the story".
And in the future, Saxe noted, Germany had no point in ignoring Russia.
Russia is a natural part of Europe, there is no point in trying to ignore it.
We need Russian gas, oil, there's a lot of things that determine our common destiny," she said.
Earlier that day, the Chancellor of Germany, Angela Merkel, said that the country was trying to "link" relations with Russia and support them.
According to her, the Northern Stream 2 gas pipeline is particularly important for Berlin, which is built from the coast of Russia to Germany at the bottom of the Baltic Sea.

The project of directors Carrie Kirkpatrick and Jason Reisig for their initial outputs has raised $23 million, in general justified the expectations of experts forecasting 20-25 million a week.

The viewers are upset by Agutin's choice for the voice show
The viewers of the show Voice 60+ accuse Leonid Agutin of "insane cove and sudden subtass. "
When in the blind hearings he first heard his father Nikola Agutin's voice, many hoped that he would remain neutral and not return to the executive.
But his son's feelings were taken up, and he chose the relative to his team.
At that time, many felt that it was a joke, but they forgave the teacher the inadvertentness of the first phase.
But the joke took a long time, and the star's father was absolutely unfairly taking the place of more worthy performers.
And now the viewers are no longer ready to forgive Agutin for such injustice.
Yesterday we, the show’s viewers, were upset by the improbable and naked prosthesis of our loved ones on the final ladder.
I even doubted that Agutina would be strong enough and conscience would not be able to hold her dad in the first place by the end of the day," said Irina Petrovsky and Xenia Larin of the TV show.
In the meantime, for his father, Leonid Agutin "sweet" the great performers who really sang, while Nikolai Petrovic whispered a touching song about his mother, explaining that the viewers still want to see his father's show.
But, as it turns out, viewers want an objective evaluation and see real talented performers in the final, and now Agutin has discredited the show.
"I can feel the voice of the members of the Agutina team, they've been denied."
"The last time Agutin showed how he loved the pope, and today he was supposed to be a professional."
"The contest has lost its meaning."
"To remove two talented people from the project and leave in the project your father who does not drink a whisper, how can you then call the teacher?"
"He likes to be a poet, he likes to have a concert in Kremlin for his money, and he likes to see how many people come to this concert."
It's a voice show, not a cruel family show.
"Agutina's side was unprofessional."
"Then you have to invite the Pope to do your own show, not the show that's made for 1 Channel."
"That was a real chance for someone, and he took someone's place.
And I don't understand why a silent dad should make me understand more than anyone else with real cloud data.
Why did a worker from Surgut with a great voice and a tambourine melt, and Pope Agutina was brought to the finish?
And then we all complain that on the stage and from screens the same person for decades!
That's because it's not going to get through the bush."
"What were you waiting for?
It's Russia!
It's a round of mud and mud.
There will be no remaining money in the family budget!
The absurd theatre continues!"
The users also recalled that in one of the seasons of the traditional Voice, the son of the city went to the blind hearings.
Then the subway and the head didn't have a son on their own team.
Besides, he said, "Come on, get out of here. Everything's clear."
Agutin was unable to act as a professional.

The customer checked out a basket with faeces in the 7-Eleven store
Damian Simms, 41-year-old resident of St. Petersburg (Florida), called "he had a tooth" for the manager of the 7-Eleven round-the-day network: in May, he released it from the store for an unpleasant behavior.
And he decided to avenge his enemy in the original way.
In the middle of the second night, he went to the store and went out to the sex and part of the goods in the boxes containing the basket.
There were faeces and urine in the basket, which Simms "loaned" from a nearby mobile biotourist.
The police arrested the defendant when the incident occurred.
He was placed in prison and released to court in a bet at $300.
He had been charged with unlawful invasion of property and criminal offences and was also forbidden to enter the store and approach the manager.
Although Simms ' crime seemed more ridiculous than serious, the trial could be severe enough, since it had repeatedly violated the law: it included large-scale theft, robbery, illegal possession of arms, unscrupulous driving and ill-treatment of animals.

The Russian Williams pilot Sergey Sirotkin commented on the outcome of the Grand Prix race in Russia.
"I don't really want to talk about what's in my head.
I had a good start, and in the second turn, I was between the two cars that just made me feel sorry for myself.
I lost all the positions I played at the start at the moment, right away.
It turned out to be a very bad position.
He's stuck in traffic.
We were hoping that after the rest of us get to the pit stop, we'd get into the clean air, and we'd get back to speed, but the reindeer was gone.
Plus was fighting with his partner, and he was in contact with him.
I understand he's a little mistaken.

President of the Russian Tennis Federation (FTR) Shamil Tarpishtev commented on the removal of Moscow Spartacus's footballers Denis Glushakov and Andreya Ešenko from major-level training after the criticism of the lead coach of the Massimo Carrera team, reports Sport Weekend.
The actions of the Carrera were absolutely absurd.
To pay attention to such things is an inconceivable stupidity.
I totally disagree with what Carrera is doing.
It only deepens the dissatisfaction of the team.
First, these are scriptures, read and perceive them as you please.
I wouldn't have reacted to this if I were Carrera.
Each one has his own opinion.
Second, everyone wants to get sick.
If deaf people and Eštenko are being fooled, that doesn't mean they have something against the coach.
I don't think the Italians have enough flexibility in their perception of the situation.
And it doesn't serve as a normal climate on the team.
Spartacus doesn't have a game today, so it didn't have to blow up at all.
Maybe I should have laughed about it together.
Spartacus has a lot of misconceptions in different lines, there is a lack of play after being introduced into the youth.
The relations within the team, it seems, do not add optimism to the match," Tarpištev said.
The two teams will be held on 30 September and will begin at 19.00 a.m. in Moscow.
Previously, John Terry, who refused Spartacus, led the Chelsea Youth Team.

"The coming of such technologies is a unique thing, it's a tremendous good.
This is an explosive growth in medical technology, an improvement in the quality of life and infrastructure.
But there's the other side.
The development of natural technologies is actually a technological reproduction of living systems.
There is a turning point - targeted intervention in human activity.
There's always a risk.
The car came up, people started to die under the wheels.
But cars still use them.
The dual nature of technology immediately.
I'm creating a new medical technology, and I can create weapons of mass destruction," says a scientific REN TV.
After watching the film and discussing modern scientific breakthroughs, students were able to ask questions to the meeting.
The role of speakers was the candidate for physics and mathematics, the leader of the NBICS Kurchav complex of natural technology NIC "Kurchavsky Institute" Julia Djakova and the leader of the NBICS Kurchav complex of technology Vačeslav Demin.

Camerovskan upsets the herd of drums at the cemetery
On 30 September, a report from a prominent social network on the Cameroonese site was made that horned animals were being freely used in one of the local caves.
The animal herds passed between the fence and the grass.
The commentators expressed various opinions: one of the locals noted that there was no harm in the presence of a small hornet, and their appetite could even help to clear the territory of the stork and grass, but some of the city’s inhabitants did not have to live:
"These are graves, not pastures.
There's something I want to do.
Of course, you will not say that they are greedy, but it is not the case."
In other words, one of the eyewitnesses noted that the problem in the animal environment was already known and that the necessary measures would soon be taken.
What's the right thing to do?
The word does not exist.
That's right.
The word "press" means "twice, influence, influence" is only phonetic because we hear the sound [a] instead of the word "suffer."
We use that word, assuming it's derived from the word "pressurization."
But "pression" and "suffering" are not only immunisticly close, but even in some sense are opposed.
Make sure it's done.
Getting around (booky, old) means "enough, full, enough, enough to be enough for someone or something to satisfy."
To be happy, to be happy is family.
Previously, he still had the importance of "no matter what it is to have self-sufficiency" - "response yourself."
The Old Slavic "devil" by the family word "to rule" and "will."
Push, push, push, push, push.
These words are actually threatening "families": daos - "wolf", deyja - "dead" and "moan" - "treasure".
A similar phonetic form of the words “pressurisation” and “suffer”, as well as the inevitable ageing of the latter, have led to contamination.
So we have the same "d[a]flight," which is also used in writing through "a", which is, in fact, wrong and impossible from the point of view of the processes of emergence and development of those words.
Well, that's the right thing to do.
But that word is outdated, in its true meaning it is no longer in use.
If you want to note that any circumstances/people have a negative effect on you above, use the word "press".
You can also use the construction "show pressure", but remember that it is an office.

However, this has hardly had a major impact on the outcome."
"In Sochi it's very difficult to drive, the start of the race will be a key moment?"
"Please, yes, but you never know how it works.
It's going to be easy anyway, because our car is going to be a lot slower than Mercedes.

Russia has protected itself from terrorists through the Syria operation
In three years of Russian military operation in Syria, about 100,000 terrorists were killed, 85 thousand of whom were destroyed by the FF Air and Space Force.
He told of this in connection with the third anniversary of the Russian military operation in Syria, the former head of the WPC, the head of the Federation's Defence and Security Council, Victor Bondarev.
He noted the high accuracy of the use of air defeat equipment: Air-space forces were on the move and were continuing to strike precisely on terrorist sites.
According to Bondareva, in three years, tens of thousands of terrorist facilities have been destroyed in Syria, for example, of munitions, reinforcements and headquarters.
Russian air carriers have broken down the anti-Gyhadis defense, which has become a decisive contribution to the advance of the Syrian Government's troops, transmitted by the Interface.
According to Bondareva, our military operations in Syria also protected Russia itself from terrorists, many of whom had Russian passports.
More than two-thirds of the territory of the Arab Republic of Syria was under control of terrorist groups, including the Islamic State (IGA, prohibited in Russia) and the Djebhat-an-Nusru ( prohibited in Russia).
According to the Gender Staff of the Armed Forces, there were about four thousand Russian soldiers on the IG side and about five thousand post-Soviet citizens, the TASS reports.
And this is only about registered persons, without considering those who were not identified, Bondarev stressed.
Most of them were trained and ready to take up arms at any time, and Russian passports gave them the right to freely enter our country ' s territory.
Thus, Bondarev noted that in Syria, Russia was fighting international terrorism on the far-off side, otherwise this evil would “turn to us”.

Mitropolit Ilarion compared Kiev's decision to rename the UPC with the actions of the Fascists
The Head of the Synod of the Department of External Church Relations of the Russian Orthodox Church, Mitropolit Ilarion, compared the rename of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate to the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of the Fascists against the Jews.
"It is equally true that in Fascist Germany, the Jews were forced to attach a yellow Easter star, which means marking the Church as an enemy organization, and for this purpose the bill was created," said the word "Rossia-24" (interfax quote).
In his view, this step would have the most serious consequences right now when the Russian-Ukrainian conflict was at a sharp stage.
Kiev thus hopes to gain full control of the UPC and “put it outside the law”, the minister believes.
"This is the Ukrainian church, and the believers of this church consider themselves Ukrainians, they are the patriots of their country," he added.

The fate of the Pochaev Labra, the Orthodox Ukrainian and the world's shrine, must be ready to protect it, is said to be treated.
Mitropolit called not to speak of those who were led astray by the believers.
The UPC has canonical status as defined by Thomas of 29 October 1990 by Mother Church.
And now someone wants to introduce themselves to the new-style patriarch and another Catholic pope of the Roman Warfolome.
The new style with its consequences is unacceptable to us.
And we are satisfied with the status of our church," said the deputy of the labra.
He recalled that since October 1990, the CPC has been canonically independent and fully independent in its management.
There is no administrative and financial accountability of the Moscow Patriarchy.
In fact, Thomas already has our church.
What else do we need, Thomas?" -- said the Metropolis of Pochaevsky Vladimir, calling on believers and all citizens to ask whether other confessions of Thomas are independent of the Vatican?

And Greece will strengthen the right to its past.
There are no perfect agreements.
They are the result of difficult compromises that cannot be fully achieved by all."
The country is being renamed by the ruling Social Democrats, headed by Prime Minister Zoran Zaev.
Against the conservative opposition and the President of the country of Georgi Ivanov.
According to journalist Vétina Chilimanova, Macedonia has no sense to enter the EU - enough to have a partnership with it: "Many of those who do not like the agreement believe that the current Socialist Government in the head with Zaev is being forced from outside to change the country's name.

I'm going to lose sovereignty first.
There are obviously countries that do not wish Macedonia to remain one of the sovereign countries in the Balkans."

The country has failed.
The choice that Macedonian citizens will make will determine the future not only for the Balkans but also for Europe as a whole."
