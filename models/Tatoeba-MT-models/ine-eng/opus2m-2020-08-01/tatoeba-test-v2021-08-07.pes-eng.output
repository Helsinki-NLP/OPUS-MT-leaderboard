You are certainly not the right ones!
Ye are both liars.
You are heaping out of your way with thunder.
Your search has failed.
You are from Iran.
You are of good cheer.
Ye are not needful to do so.
Thou hast not regarded idleness out of part.
You are not a son.
You are not a daughter.
Thou hast no part with the half of thine thoughts, which thou takest away.
You are hidden in Egypt.
You are the one who has the power.
You're a real noise level one.
You are not really a fool.
Ye are worthy, if ye be willing.
You are very impatient with me.
You are the one who now needs me.
You are still--are you not?
"Behold, this day is dawning from your sleep. Do you have any work to do?"
Please
That's good.
Let thy work and thy labour be before thy household.
The first fruits of your vineyard, which are in the field;
Let thy hair be shaved off.
Let your heart be free. Only be able to overcome it.
A heart that is broken, whether it be alive, or dead.
"Your officers alone are the keepers of your vision.
Thy body shall be full of days, and thou shalt die.
Your fellows were like this: they were like this.
Your time is fulfilled.
Thou shalt know the breaking of it.
You must be a guide to your father, and you must do it.
It is better to have no sign before him.
You have to take some rest.
You must go and cut down your hair.
You ought to have kept it secret.
You must keep your mouth shut
You were not able to do it, but were filled with joy by my joy.
Only when there is no money, that ye ought not to honour.
You must first give an example.
You shall offer your gifts.
Thou shalt speak all that thou thinkest.
You must tell him the truth.
You need to make good use of your time.
You must do a hard work.
As ye have need of, carry that which ye have of necessity.
You trust in men more than in men.
You two are truly kind.
The eyes of the young men shall be open.
You shall see it. You shall see it with your eyes.
You're done.
Do you want to speak with me from freedom?
We were at ease, therefore gave you the latter time.
You will be able to read this book in the year ahead.
Thou shalt not soon think of him.
You will understand it with the passing of time.
You will write an e-mail.
You don't make him rest to that which is good.
You don't give him that which is good, and you don't give him that which is evil.
