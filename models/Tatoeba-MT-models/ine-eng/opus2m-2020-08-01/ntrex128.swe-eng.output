AM in Wales is anxious to "stand up as a puckon"
Some AMs, members of the Wales National Assembly, are confused about a proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament – Member of the Wales Parliament).
The proposal is intended to change the name of the national assembly to the Wales Parliament.
AM throughout the political spectrum is concerned about being punished.
One AM for Labour said his group was worried because "it rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
For readers who can't walesic: Twp means dumb on walesic and pwp means bajs.
One AM for Plaid said that the group in general was "unsatisfied" and has proposed other options.
A conservative waleser said his group was "open" for the name change, but pointed out that it was a short step from MWP to Mupp.
In this context, W is expressed in Welsh as the letter U in English in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drawing up legislation on the name change, said: "The final decision on what members of the congregation should be called is so clear to the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the outcome of a public consultation on the proposals, which found strong support for calling the Assembly of Wales Parliament.
The current title for AM was proposed by the Commission by Welsh Parliament Members (members of the Wales Parliament) or by WMP, but MWP received the highest support in a public consultation.
AM clearly proposes other options, but problems with reaching a consensus may cause problems for Presiding Officer Elin Jones, who is expected to submit draft legislation on the amendment within a few weeks.
The legislative framework for the amendments also includes other amendments to the workings of the Assembly, including rules for the disqualification of an AM and the design of the Committee system.
AM is allowed to vote on what they should be called when they discuss legislation.
Macedonia implements a referendum on the change of the country's name
On Sunday, voters shall vote if they are to change the country's name to "The Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum is an attempt to put an end to a dispute that has been going on for decades with the neighbouring country of Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the neighbouring country represents a claim on its territory and has repeatedly protested against its attempt to become a member of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov opposes the referendum on the name change and has said that he will ignore the outcome.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the name exchange is the price they have to pay to join the EU and NATO.
The clocks in St. Martin's silence when the churches in Harlem hit on problems
"Old people I speak to say there was a bar and a church on every corner before," said Mr. Adams.
"There isn't either."
He said it's understandable that the bars are disappearing.
"People are surrounded by other ways now," he said.
"Bars aren't like the area's living room anymore. Your people go on a regular basis."
He is concerned that the money from the sale of assets will not go as far as the leaders expect and that "before or after they arrive on the route again".
He also pointed out that churches can be replaced by apartments with apartments filled with people who do not help the remaining churches.
"The absolute majority of people buying apartments in the buildings will be white," he said. "This will eventually lead to the closure of all churches, because those who move into the apartments will probably not become members of the churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – Metropolitan Community 1870, a decade later.
The original White Methodist Assembly moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation with a church nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation led by pastor John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of shops on 125th Street, a shopping street in Harlem, who refused to hire or transport black people.
The building was seriously damaged in a fire in 1939, but when pastor Johnson’s congregation planned the renovation, they also built the clock.
Pastor David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and successor of St. Martin's, proudly called the music game "the poor watches".
The expert who played the game in July had another name for it: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also pointed out that it was the world's first watch game played by a black musician – Dionisio A. Lind, who moved on to the largest game in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merriweather, he didn't replace St. Martin's.
The events of the last few months at St. Martin's are a complicated story with architects and contractors – some who were hired by the church's playwrights, others by the episcopal foundation.
The church council – the governing body of the congregation consisting of bodies – wrote to the foundation in July and expressed concern that the foundation would "try to transfer the cost" to the church council, although the church council had not been involved when the foundation hired architects and contractors.
Some members of the congregation complained about a lack of transparency from the foundation.
Haj damages 13-year-olds who dive for lobsters in California
On Saturday, a 13-year-old boy attacked and injured a shark who went after lobsters in California on the first day of the lobster season, according to officials.
The attack took place immediately before seven o'clock in the morning, near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had drowned with his friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy cry for help and paddled there with a group of others to pull him out of the water.
According to Hammel, he first thought the boy was just happy to have found a lobster, but then he realized that the boy screamed, "I've been bitten!"
"I've been bitten!"
When Hammel came to the boy, he noticed that the whole keybone had been torn up.
"I called out to everyone to get out of the water. 'It's a shark in the water!' said Hammel.
The boy was flying to the Council of Children's Hospital in San Diego and his condition is indicated to be critical.
It's unclear what hajart it was.
Bath guard Larry Giles told the media that a shark had seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it had been determined that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles also said that the victim suffered trauma on his upper torso.
Access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami's in Ecinitas was blocked for 48 hours for investigation and security reasons.
Giles mentioned that there are over 135 sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's joins the British beauty market
Sainsbury's takes on Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams with similar beauty walks with beauty specialists.
As part of a considerable push into the UK’s beauty market of £2.8 billion, which continues to grow despite the fall of the fashion and household market, the larger beauty steps will be tested in 11 shops across the country and implemented in more shops next year if they are successful.
The investment in the beauty market is part of a quick purchase attempt to fill the gaps previously recorded by TV sets, microwaves and household products.
Sainsbury's said they're going to double their beauty offer up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing offers from L'Oreal, Maybellline and Burt's Bees will also have larger spaces with marked areas, such as shops such as Boots.
The store chain also relaunches its boutique brand so that most of the products are vegan – which more and more young customers require.
In addition, the perfume dealer Fragrance Shop will test the condition in two Sainsbury's stores – the first condition opened in Croydon in South London last week and the second opens in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Shopping online and the trend to buy smaller amounts of food every day in local stores means that fast shopping needs to do more to attract customers.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, has said that their stores will look more and more like a mall in an attempt to fight cheap shops like Aldi and Lidl with more services and other products than food.
Sainsbury's has Argos stand in hundreds of shops and has also obtained a number of Habitat stand since they bought both chains two years ago, which they believe has increased food sales and made the acquisition more profitable.
The previous attempt to give the beauty and pharmacy departments a facelift failed.
Sainsbury's tested a collaboration with Boots in the early 2000s, but the cooperation ended after a dispute about how the revenues from Boot's sales in the fast purchase would be distributed.
The new strategy will be after Sainsbury sold its pharmacy business with 281 shops to Celesio, who owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million three years ago.
They claim that Lloyds would play a role in the plan by adding an extensive range of luxurious skin care products, including brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial manager, said: "We have given our beauty walks a new appearance and a new feeling to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained employees who can advise customers.
Our range of brands has been designed to meet all needs, and with an attractive environment in slippery places, we are now an attractive destination of beauty that challenges the old way to shop."
Peter Jones "breathing" after Holly Willoughby withdraws from the deal at £11 million
Dragon's The Star Peter Jones is "breathing" that the TV presenter Holly Willoughby withdraws from a deal of £11 million with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby does not interfere with their brand True, with leisure clothes and accessories.
Their activities have been compared to the Gwyneth Paltrows brand Goop.
This morning representative, 37, announced his decision on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has made Dragons The Star Peter Jones angry by withdrawing from their luxurious lifestyle in the last minute – to focus on their new deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to the sources, Jones became "breathing" at a busy meeting at his business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire on Tuesday when the TV favorite admitted that her new contract – worth up to £1.5 million – meant that she no longer focused on their brand True, with leisure clothes and accessories.
The business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrows brand Goop and was expected to double Willoughby's estimated property of £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced that she was leaving True on Instagram Flight Jones to one of her holiday homes.
One source said, "Truly was clearly Holly's top priority.
It would be her long-term future for the coming decades.
Her decision to pull herself out shocked everyone involved.
No one could believe it happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of goods that are ready to be sold at the Marlow headquarters."
Experts believe that this morning representative's decision to withdraw may cost the company several million due to significant investments in everything from pillows and light to clothing and the risk of further delays in the launch.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Poor mother Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby started Truly with Capp 2016 and Jones, 52, took the role as president in March.
The couple spend their holidays together and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host to "I'm a Celebrity" on ITV.
A source near Jones said last night, "We're not commenting on his business."
Hard talk "and then we fell in love"
He was joking that the media would criticise him for a comment that some would consider to be "invaluable a president" and that he was so positive about North Korea's leaders.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said in a "news campaign":
"I haven't given up anything."
He said that Kim wanted another meeting after Trump celebrated their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
But the negotiations on nuclear weapons have been held.
More than three months after the meeting in Singapore in June, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the leaders of the UN General Assembly this Saturday that North Korea did not see a "response" from the United States after North Korea's first defeat.
He noted that the United States, instead, continues sanctions designed to maintain the pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech to his followers.
"It's going very well with North Korea," he said.
"We were about to fight North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a sovereign relationship."
He said his attempt to improve Kim's relationship has had positive results – an end to rockets, freed hostages and returned remains of American soldiers.
And he defended his different way of talking about the relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to act like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this full-packed arena, we'd have about 200 people here," Trump said and pointed out to the audience in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquakes destroy the island of Indonesia, hundreds of deaths
After the earthquake at Lombok, for example, foreign non-governmental organisations were told not to need them.
Despite the fact that more than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok had lost their homes, no exemption was granted, which is required for international assistance.
"In many cases they have been very clear that they do not ask for international help, which complicates it all," said Ms. Sumbang.
Saved children gather a team to go to Palu, but it is still unclear whether foreign staff can work there.
Mr Sutopo, spokesperson for the Natural Disaster Agency, said that Indonesian officials assessed the situation in Palu in order to determine whether international organisations should be allowed to participate in the assistance work.
In view of the constant earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is still sadly unprepared for the wrath of nature.
Tsunami protection has been built in Aceh, but they are rare on other coastlines.
The absence of a tsunami threat in Palu, although a warning had been issued, was likely contributing to the loss of life.
Even under perfect conditions, it is a challenge to travel between many islands of Indonesia.
Natural disasters complicate the logistics further.
A hospital ship that has been deployed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it takes at least three days to reach the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo focused on the promises to improve Indonesia's wear infrastructure in his campaign and has spent large sums on roads and train tracks.
But lack of funding has plagued Mr. Yoko's administration in the next year's election.
Mr. Joko is also pressurized by the slowing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands lost their homes when Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets with machetes, arrows, and other primitive weapons.
Look at: Liverpool Daniel Sturridge filed for Chelsea in the last minute
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss against Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute in Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday.
Sturridge got a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 meters from Chelsea's goal when his team left with 1-0.
He transferred the ball to the left and shot a trigger against the outer pillar.
The attempt flew high over the target area against the top right corner of the net.
The ball finally fell over the hope of Kepa Arizabalaga and arrived online.
"I just tried to get in a position to get to the ball and players that Shaq always plays forward as much as possible, so I just tried to give myself as much time as possible," said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante getting close and I didn't think so much about it but just fired."
Chelsea led by 1-0 after the first half after a goal in the 25th minute from the Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The blue striker held a pass back to Mateo Kovacic, spinning from close to the center and sprinted to the Liverpool side.
Kovacic made a quick give-and-go at the center.
Then he got a sovereign kick that brought Hazard into the target area.
Hazard jumped off the defense and got the ball in the net at the remote column with a left-footed kick past Liverpool's Alison Becker.
Liverpool fights against Naples in the group stage of the Champions League at the Stadium San Paolo in Naples, Italy at 15:00 on Wednesday.
Chelsea is facing videoton in Uefa Europa League in London at 3:00 on Thursday.
The mortality rate for tsunamis in Indonesia rises to 832
The number of earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia has risen to 832, according to the country's disaster agency early Sunday.
Many people were reported to have been trapped in the players of buildings broken down in the 7.5 earthquake that hit on Friday and triggered waves up to six meters, said the bureau’s spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a news conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was filled with rusty buildings.
Police arrest, 32, suspected of murder after a woman died
A murder trial has started after a woman's equal was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 with a knife wound on Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested suspected of murder.
The police have asked people in the area who saw or heard anything to come forward.
Detective Brian O'Hagan said, "We're at an early stage of the investigation, but I'm asking everyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard anything suspicious about contacting us.
I also ask all, especially taxi drivers, who may have filmed something with a car camera to contact us because they may have information that is crucial to our investigation."
A spokesperson for the police has confirmed that the woman found lives in Birkenhead and that the body was found inside a property.
In the afternoon, friends who think they know the woman came to the place to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and the police inform the victim's closest relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has just tried to get into his apartment, but the police said no one can get in or out of the building.
He became aimless when he found out what had happened.
The residents of the building have been informed that it will take several hours before they can get back in.
A police officer told a man that the whole area was treated as a crime scene.
A crying woman appeared on the spot.
She says, "It's so terrible" over and over again.
At 14:00, there were two police cars inside the lockdown and another just outside.
A number of police officers were in front of the lockdown with an overview of the apartment building.
People with information are asked to send a DM to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 and enter log 247 from 30 September.
Parliament's status of Cromwell's latest victims for the rewriting of history
A ban would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England’s cultural and religious artifacts performed by his fanatic Puritan followers.
But Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick's proposal for "dude" and "try to write about the story".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace would be included in the ongoing debate on the removal of statues."
The iconic class during the English civil war was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Fal Cromwell may have been offered for what his ancestor Thomas did 100 years earlier.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent representation of Cromwell shows the view of the 1800s and is part of the history of a man who many believe should still be praised.
Mr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Many, perhaps more at the end of the 1800s than now, believes that Cromwell defended Parliament from pressure, in his case from the monarchy.
If this is a proper representation, it is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
But the conflict in the middle of the 1600s has undoubtedly affected the development of our nation, and Cromwell is a well-known person who represents one side of the matter.
His holdings as Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated and celebrated.
Murder pig kills peasants
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only with his surname Yuan, was found dead with a broken artery and covered in blood in a market stair in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou, reported South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig breeder prepares to inject the vaccine into pigs in a pig herd on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He is reported to have traveled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, the cousin found him dead and discovered that the door to a nearby pighouse was open.
He said there was a big piggie in the pighouse with blood on his mouth.
A forensic study confirmed that the 250 kilos [250 kg] of pig had killed the farmer, according to the report.
"My cousin's bones were bloody and distorted," said the cousin identified with the last name Wu to Guiyang Evening News.
A surveillance camera filmed Yuan when he came to the market to feed his pigs at 4:40 on Thursday.
His body was found an hour later.
The pig that killed the farmer didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
One market manager told Evening News that the pig had been locked in to avoid more attacks while the police collected evidence on the spot.
The Yuan family and the market leaders are reported to negotiate compensation for his death.
It's rare that pigs attack people, but it's happened before.
In 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and seriously injured the man.
Ten years earlier, a 300 - pound [300 kg] pig pressed a farm in Wales against a tractor until his wife scared it away.
When a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012 a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are normally not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can work as a "catalyst".
"They're just playful.
They're very curious, they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to show them respect," he said.
Residues of the Hurricane Rosa for extensive heavy rain to the southwest USA
As expected, the hurricane Rosa becomes weaker as it travels across the cooler waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
But Rosa will bring abundant rain to North Mexico and the South West in the coming days.
Rosa had a wind power of up to 135 km/h, category 1, five EST on Sunday and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to travel north on Sunday.
In time, a tortoise begins to form over the Pacific Sea and travels east towards the western coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, it will force deep tropical moisture north into the southwestern USA.
Rosa will take up to 25 cm of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical moisture that interacts with the nearest strain will create vastly heavy rain in the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 cm of rain will cause dangerous flooding, flooding and possibly earthquakes in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture will lead to 5 to 7.5 cm of rain per hour in certain places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 5 to 10 cm of rain is expected in certain places in the southwestern USA, especially in large parts of Arizona.
Sudden flooding is possible with rapid deterioration due to the spread of tropical rain.
It is absolutely not recommended that someone go out in the desert to foot when tropical rain is expected.
Heavy rains can make canyons for sending rivers and ash storms lead to strong local winds that blow around sand.
The nearby riverbank with it seems to be a local heavy rain to parts of southern California's coastline.
It is possible with a total of more than one cm of rain, which can lead to mud streams and narrow roads.
It would be the first rain in the area during the rainy season.
Some shined tropical rains will approach Arizona late on Sunday and early Monday, before the rain will be extended later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to Four Corner on Tuesday and continue on Wednesday.
October can mean intense temperature changes throughout the United States, when the Arctic cools down, but the tropicals remain warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic short-range temperature changes.
There is a good example of dramatic temperature differences in Central America on Sunday.
It is almost 10 degrees between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
In the coming days, the remaining summer heat will try to spread again.
Large parts of Central and Eastern America are expected to get a hot start in October with about 30 degrees from Great Plains to parts of the North-East USA.
New York could get 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about five degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a large chance for warmer temperatures than the average in the eastern US during the first half of October.
Over 20 million people were looking at Brett Kavanaugh's poll
More than 20 million watched the arrest of Thursday's testimony from Brett Kavanaugh, who was nominated to the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assault in the 1980s on six TV networks.
During the time, the political situation continued and the normal transmission was interrupted for the last minute of Friday – Senator of Arizona, Jeff Flake's agreement with the FBI, where they were able to investigate the charge for a week.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was absolutely sure that Kavanaugh was staring at her when he was full and trying to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh gave a passionate witness and said he was absolutely sure it didn't happen.
It is likely that the number of viewers on Friday was higher than the 20.4 million indicated by Nielsen.
They calculated the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN; Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The number of viewers was not immediately available for other TV networks that showed the interview, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often has trouble counting people looking at the office.
Comparably, there are as many spectators as for a football match in the final game or Oscarsgalan.
Fox News Channel, whose presenters have shown strong support for Kavanaugh's nomination, had most viewers with an average of 5.69 million during the day-to-day interview, according to Nielsen.
ABC had more than 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interest was still high after the interview.
Flake was in focus during Friday's drama.
After the Republican office issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS filmed demonstrators yelling at him when he tried to take a lift to a hearing with the Judiciary Committee on Friday morning.
He looked down on the floor for several minutes while the demonstrators yelled at him, as shown in direct transmission by CNN.
"I'm right in front of you," said one woman.
Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?"
They also said, "You have power when so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office had issued a statement and before closing the elevator doors he said he would have more to say after the committee hearing.
The TV networks broadcast live several hours later when the Judiciary Committee voted if they would carry on Kavanaugh's nomination to a vote with the whole Senate.
But Flake said that he was only going to do it if the FBI would investigate the charges against the nominee during the coming week, which the minority Democrats have been working on.
Flake was partly convinced by his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several senators, Flake later made his decision.
Flakes' decisions had a major impact, as it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "political games" around Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union for "political games" about the future of Britain and undermine the nation's interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom on 29 September 2018.
In another interview next to her on the front page of the newspaper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson continued his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and said the proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other's customs duties was "completely unreasonable".
Shooting of Wayde Sims: Police seize suspect Dyteon Simpson for the death of the LSU player
The police have arrested a suspect in the shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and put in custody for murder, said the police in Baton Rouge.
The authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and the police said Sims lost his glasses in the fight.
The police found the glasses on the spot and found Simpson's DNA on them, according to CBS subsidiary WAFB.
After questioning with Simpson, the police said he recognized that he killed Wayde.
His citizenship was set at $350,000, according to the Attorney.
The doctor in East Baton Rouge Parish released a preliminary report on Friday, according to which the cause of death was a gunshot wound in his head and in his neck.
The police are grateful to Louisiana State Police for their efforts, the police's state law lab, the Southern University police and residents in the area for their assistance with the investigation leading to the arrest.
LSU's athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the local police for their "flight and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1.98 meters ahead grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per match last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "broken" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"You're worried about this all the time," Wade said.
Volcano asking for ashes over Mexico City
Aska from the Volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southern part of Mexico’s capital.
National Center for Disaster Prevention warned in the Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after the activity had been detected in the crater and the recorded 183 emissions of gas and ashes over 24 hours.
The Centre discovered several women and shells.
Pictures of social media showed thin layers of ash on windmills in the areas of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicians have noted increased activity in the volcano which is 72 km south-east of the capital since an earthquake of 7.1 hit central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano called Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police are dealing with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six persons were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence demonstrators met with mob police while thousands of people took part in rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarising secession vote.
A group of masked separatists who were held back by the cow police threw eggs and colored powder on them, leading to dark dust on streets that are usually full of tourists.
Kills broke out later on during the day, and policemen used their batons to stop them.
For several hours the independence groups called "never forget, never forgive" while the Unionists called "long live Spain".
14 people were treated for minor damage caused by the protests, according to local press.
The vote is still tense in the region which longs for independence one year after the referendum on the first October considered illegal by Madrid but welcomed by Catalan separatists.
A vast majority voted for independence, but the participation was low when most of those who opposed the secession boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes yesterday when the police tried to stop the vote by countries in the region.
Self-reliance groups camped during the night on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration was still taking place, but another route was forced.
Electric Narcis Termes, 68, participated in the separatist protest with his wife and said he no longer believed that Catalonia would become independent.
"Last night we experienced one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy to be able to vote, but now we are stuck," he said.
Despite a decisive but marginal gain in regional elections in December, it has been difficult for Catalan parties that are independent to maintain the driving force up this year, as many of their most well-known leaders live in self-embarked exile or are waiting for trial on their role in the organisation of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of the police on her cell phone, said that the conflict had been fought by politicians on both sides.
"It gets more and more excited," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who had been arrested since the end of last year, announced that he was going to run for the European Parliament next year.
"To apply to the European Parliament is the best way to condemn the return of democratic values and the subjugation we have experienced from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after driving into the house
Three men — 33, 34 and 39 — were arrested after driving a car into a house in Londonderry repeatedly.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent, around 19:30 BST on Thursday.
Detective Bob Blemmings said the walls and the building itself were damaged.
An armbrush may also have been fired against the car.
Add Livingston 1-0 to Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston's safe win
Livingston shocked Rangers and sentenced Steven Gerrard to his second loss of 18 matches as manager of the Ibrox Club.
The Dolly Mengas strike turned out to be the difference when Gary Holt's side was divided into two with the Hibernian.
Gerrard's side has still not received a win in Premiership this season and meets Hearts, with eight points more, next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers Rapid Vienna in Europe will welcome the League on Thursday.
Livingston prolongs his winning career to six matches – Master Coach Holt has not yet experienced a loss since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses chances against cross-visitors
Holt's team should have taken the lead far before they made their targets; their justice gave Rangers all the problems they could.
Scott Robinson broke through but dragged his performance across the target, and then Alan Lithgow could only shoot the board after he had slipped in to measure Craig Halket's zeroing across the target.
The home team was pleased to let Rangers play in front of them when they knew they could attack in certain games.
And that's how the decisive goal was made.
Rangers gave up a fresh park and Livingston took advantage of an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson collaborated to give Menga a chance, which made targets from the center of the target area.
In that situation, Rangers had dominated the ball, but the home team's defense was insurmountable and the target guard Liam Kelly was left largely in peace.
The same pattern continued in the second half, but Alfredo Morelos forced a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was denied by Ranger's target guard Allan McGregor's feet and Lithgow shot a board from another set of Livingstone's games.
Crossings came constantly into the target area of Livingston and were handled without any problem. Two criminal charges – after Halket's challenge by the exchanger Glenn Middleton and one for hands – were dismissed.
" Phenomenal" from Livingston – Analysis
BBC Scotlands Alaskar Lamont on Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal demonstration and results for Livingston.
Each was outstanding and continues to exceed expectations on the way up.
Their game style and staff have hardly changed since they returned to the top level, but Holt deserves the honour of having galvanized the team since its arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was outstanding and led a well-organized defense, and Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worall right through.
But Rangers lacked inspiration.
They've had their hours under Gerrard, but they didn't live up to the standard.
Their last ball did not hold – they only opened the home page once – and it is one of the alarm clocks for Rangers, located in the middle.
Erdogan gets a mixed welcome in Cologne
On Saturday, it was the evening of June and September (29 September) when Turkey’s and Germany’s leaders shared breakfast together in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany – which will repair the relationship between NATO allies.
They have become incompatible with human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population in the world outside Turkey.
The police claimed that they prevented 25 000 spectators from gathering outside the mosque for security reasons, but many followers gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan demonstrators – many of them Kurdish – also heard and condemned Erdogan's police and the German government's decision to welcome him to Germany.
The duplicating protests show the split views of a visitor who is considered to be a hero of certain German Turks and is condemned as a single tyrant of others.
Road accident in Deptford: Cyclist dies in a crack with a car
A cyclist has died in a crook with a car in London.
The Kroken took place near the crossing of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a well-traveled road in Deptford in south-eastern London, around 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped the car and the nurse was called there, but the man died on the spot.
The hook takes place a few months after another cyclist died in an infection accident on Childers Street, about 1.5 km from the hook on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said they were trying to identify the man and inform his closest relative.
Roads have been blocked and buses have been redirected and drivers have been asked to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: Six guards injured in a storm
Six prison guards have been injured in trouble at a high-security prison for men, according to Prison Office.
The riots broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 9:30 BST on Sunday and continues.
Specialized "tornadowatts" have been called there to deal with the unrest, which involves eight prisoners on a plane.
The guards were treated on site for minor damage to the face.
A spokesperson for Prison Service said: "Specially trained prison personnel have been sent there to handle the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members have been treated for damage.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and it is clear that those behind this will refer to the police and may receive increased prison sentences."
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June it was reported that the director of the prison was treated at the hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, the police were called the jailer to deal with serious problems where personnel were attacked with billiard balls.
Orkanen Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flooding (dry areas can be useful)
It is rare that tropical low pressure reaches Arizona, but that is exactly what will probably happen at the beginning of next week when the remaining energy from the hurricane of Rosa passes over the deserts of the South West, with the risk of sudden flooding.
National Weather Service has already issued alerts for sudden floods for Monday and Tuesday in West Arizona and into south and east Nevada, south-eastern California and Utah, including the cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to travel directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, and take rain with her late Monday.
National Weather Service in Phoenix said in a tweet that only "twenty tropical cyclones have maintained their status as tropical storm or low pressure within 320 km from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 65 km of Arizona border".
National Hurricane Centers latest models predicts 5–10 cm rain, with isolated quantities up to 15 cm in Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other parts of the deserts in the southwestern USA, including central cliffs and Great Basin, are likely to receive 2.5–5 cm of rain with a risk of up to 10 cm.
In areas where there is no risk of sudden flooding, Rosa rain can be a blessing because the region is affected by drought.
Floods are very serious, but some of the rain is likely to be useful because the Southwestern United States suffers from drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, over 40% of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, the next highest category, reported weather.com.
The Orkan Rosa will first travel over the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, still with energy in the morning of Sunday with maximum wind power of 135 km/h, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and travels north for 20 km/h.
The storm hits the cooler water in the Pacific, which calms it down.
Therefore, it is now expected to reach the Mexican countryside as a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Some parts of Mexico can get heavy rain, which is a significant risk of flooding.
"Together 7.5-15 cm of rain is expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with a risk of up to 25 cm", weather.com reported.
Rosa will then travel north over Mexico as a tropical storm and reach the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure, which will then travel through Arizona and into southern Utah late Tuesday evening.
"The greatest danger from Rosa and its remaining energy is very heavy rain in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the deserts in the southwestern USA," said the National Hurricane Center.
The rain is expected to lead to life-threatening sudden floods and floods in the desert, as well as earthquakes in mountainous terrain.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three boys in their teens and a 20-year-old man have been arrested for attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with a knife wound in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton, around 4:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital and the situation reported to be "stable".
One 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and one 20-year-old were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, said the police in Avon and Somerset.
The police ask anyone who may have filmed what happened to the cell phone to come forward.
Trump says that Kavanaugh "led, evil, evil" from the democratic party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the impartiality and scandalous tactics of the democratic party," Trump told his supporters in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had been "led by the evil, evil" of the democratic party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh witnessed before the convention on Thursday and strongly and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford’s accusation that he had committed sexual abuse on her several decades earlier when she was a teenager.
Ford also testified in front of the Congress about his charge.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people saw it brilliant and quality and courage" at Kavanaugh that day.
"A voice to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to confirm one of the most appropriate legal meanings of our time, a lawyer with a first-class history of serving the public," he told his followers in the audience in West Virginia.
The President referred directly to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke about the importance of Republicans voting in the upcoming mid-term elections.
"We are five weeks from one of the most important choices in our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm running," he said.
"That's why I go around and fight for sovereign candidates."
Trump claimed that the Democrats are trying to "stand up and stop".
The first final vote of the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place on Friday, according to information to CNN from an assistant to an older Republican leader.
Hundreds of deaths in earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, number of increases
At least 384 people died, many were swept away when giant waves crashed against the beaches, when a large earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to the authorities of Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when up to six meters of high waves crashed toward the beach in the foam and drowned many into a safe death and destroyed everything in its path.
Tsunamin came after an earthquake of 7.5.
"When the tsunami alert came yesterday, people stayed on the beach instead of running away immediately, and they fell victim to the tsunami," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for the Indonesian disaster agency BNPB, at a meeting in Jakarta.
"Tsunamin was not alone but dragged with him cars, stocks and houses. It hit everything on its way," Nugroho said. He also said that Tsunamin had traveled on the open sea for up to 800 km/h before the affected coastline.
Some climbed up trees to get away from the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 facilities in Palu.
Flight photos released by the disaster agency show that many buildings and shops are destroyed, bridges are damaged and have collapsed and a mosque is surrounded by water.
Afternoon still hit the coastal town on Saturday.
The number of earthquakes was felt in an area with a population of 2.4 million.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology BPPT said in a statement that the amount of energy released in the huge earthquake this Friday was 200 times as large as the nuclear bomb released at Hiroshima in the second world war.
The city is at the end of a long, narrow bay, which may have made tsunamin larger, according to the agency.
Nugroho described the destruction as "wide" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels have collapsed.
Dead victims were found during the rush of collapsed buildings, he said, and 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the victims and damage can be even worse along the coast line 300 km north of Palu, an area called Dongala, which is close to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communication from Dongala "was completely outdated without any information," Nugroho said.
"There are over 300,000 people living there," said the Red Cross in a statement, and its staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it can get a lot worse," they said.
The Agency was criticised on Saturday for not being informed that Tsunamin had hit Palu, but the authorities said that the waves had emerged within the time of the warning.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man on the top of a building hears screaming frenzy warnings about tsunamin to people on the streets below.
Within a few minutes a wall of water breaks down against the beach and sweeps away buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately authenticate the video.
Earthquakes and tsunamis led to a massive power break that interrupted all communication around Palu, which made the rescue work more difficult for the authorities.
The military has begun sending your cargo flights with the help of Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but evacuated persons are still in great need of food and other necessities.
The airport has been opened for assistance and remains closed for further traffic until October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit facilities in Palu on Sunday.
The number of deaths in tsunamis in Indonesia exceeds 800.
It's very bad.
Staff from the World Vision in Dongala have gone to Palu where they seek protection during performances on the farm outside the office, but they saw destruction along the way, according to Mr. Doseba.
"They said they saw many destroyed houses," he said.
It's very bad.
Aid groups have begun their direct assistance work, but some complained that foreign aid workers with extensive expertise were prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, needs and employees from abroad may be used only if an exemption permit is issued after a disaster.
This hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a regional disaster," said Aulia Ariani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the authorities say it is a national disaster, we can release international aid, but it has not yet been cancelled."
When the second night fell in Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunamis, relatives and friends of missing people were still hoping that their loved ones would prove to be the miracles that would bring about the dark natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was rescued from a cop.
On Sunday, the rescue workers rescued a woman who had been trapped in a ditch for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandano, Indonesia’s national flight trainer, had trained two of the missing airplanes before the Asian Games, which ended in Indonesia earlier this month.
Others who were stuck at Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As a screenflight veteran, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon told us that the hours after the screenshots heard that Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed, he was sending desperate WhatsApp messages to the Palu participants who participated in the beach festival.
But his messages only got a gray box instead of two blues.
"I think that means the messages were not delivered," he said.
Thieves take $26 750 under ATM filling at Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, the thief stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who filled in a ATM at Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport police.
The car driver had emptied a ATM in the entertainment facility and would deliver more money, said criminal Dennis McCarthy in the message.
While he was busy "slowing up another man behind Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money that would be delivered.
The witness saw several suspected flights from the scene, according to the press release, but the police did not indicate how many involved in the incident.
All who have information on the identity of the persecutors shall contact the police in Newport at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper renames to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes name – to Ye.
He announced the name change on Twitter on Saturday and said, "The warning that is formally known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been called Ye for a longer time and used the nickname as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The name change comes before his participation in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new Yandhi album.
He replaces the singer Ariana Grande in the program, who introduced "sensitivity reasons" according to the program's creator.
Ye is an abbreviation of West's current professional name, but he has also said that the word has a religious significance for him.
"I think 'yes' is the word used most in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," said West earlier this year when he talked about the title of his album with the radio values Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It went from Kanye, which means 'the only', to just Ye – a reflection of our good, our evil, our confused, everything.
The album is like a mirror of who we are."
He's one of a number of famous rappers who's changed names.
Sean Combs was previously called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred to be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who previously collaborated with West, has previously written his name with and without strings and bezels.
Mexico's AMLO swears not to use the military against civilians
Mexico's recently elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised never to use the military against civilians now that the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of a bloody revenge against students.
Lopez Obrador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza this Saturday that "never use the military to oppress the Mexican people".
Troops fired weapons against a peaceful demonstration at the square on October 2, 1968 and killed up to 600 people during a period of left-wing student movements in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has vowed to support young Mexicans with monthly contributions to students and by opening more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of education attract young people to criminal gangs.
USA should double AI funding
Now that China becomes more active within artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount they spend on research in the field, according to the inventor and AI user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comment will be after several parts of the U.S. government have made statements about AI, although the U.S. does not have a comprehensive formal AI strategy.
China presented its plan last year with the goal of becoming the leader in AI innovation by 2030.
"It would be a good start to double the AI research budget, given that all other countries are so far behind the United States and we are looking for the next breakthrough within AI," Lee said.
A double budget can double the chance that the next large AI will be made in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview earlier this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was previously published in the month of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies – Face++.
At Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s he worked on an AI system that beat the top ranked U.S. Othello player, and later he was led by Microsoft Research and was CEO of the Google China Department.
Lee mentioned earlier technology competitions from the U.S. government, such as Robot Challenge from the Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked what would be next to identify future visionaries.
In the United States researchers often have to work hard to get government funding, Lee said.
"It's not China that takes the academic leaders from us, but the companies," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have employed leading personalities from universities to work on AI.
Lee said that new immigration policies can also help the USA with AI innovation.
"I think green cards should be offered automatically to doctors within AI," he said.
State Council in China issued its development plan for the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
In China, National Natural Science Foundation grants funding to people in academic institutions like the National Science Foundation and other government organisations to distribute money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to bring together partners from industry and the academic world, and the White House announced the formation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And earlier this month DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative they call AI Next.
NSF is currently investing over $100 million a year in AI research.
American legislation that would create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not made any progress in several months.
Macedonian People's Vote on Rename
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether the country's name should be changed to "the Republic of North Macedonia", which would resolve a decade-old dispute with Greece that has prevented the country from joining the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and claims that its name in the north is a requirement in its territory and has therefore prevented Macedonia from joining NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the change of name would undermine the identity of the Macedonian slave majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he is not going to vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has led to doubt if the minimum participation of 50 per cent required for the referendum to be considered valid will be achieved.
The issue of the referendum roll-out is: "Are you for NATO and EU membership with the approval of the agreement with Greece?"
However, supporters of the name exchange, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that it is worth changing names if it does so that Macedonia, one of the countries formed when Yugoslavia was split, can join the EU and NATO.
"I am here to vote for the future of our country, for young people in Macedonia so that they can live free under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
The public vote is not binding, but enough Members in this House have said that they are going to follow the outcome in order to see it as crucial.
The name change requires a majority of two thirds of Parliament.
According to the State Electoral Commission, no irregularities had been reported at 13.
However, participation was only 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
"I vote for my children, we belong to Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in Skopje's capital.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko vote in the referendum in Macedonia on the country's change of name, which would open the way for membership in NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia 30 September 2018.
Outside the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, organised a small scene and put chairs in front of the tents set up by those who boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to go with our head in the air, not sneak in through the back door," Kavardarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not welcome us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of a Euro-Asian integration."
According to Prime Minister Zaev, NATO membership would lead to adequate investment in Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 per cent.
"I think that the absolute majority will vote yes, because more than 80% of our citizens are for the EU and NATO," Zaev said when he voted.
He said that a "yes" result would be a "confirmation of our future".
According to a survey published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Studies, between 30 and 43 per cent of voters in the referendum were thinking, which is the minimum participation required.
According to another survey conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia, 57 per cent of the participants were thinking of voting on Sunday.
70 percent of them were going to vote.
In order to count the referendum, 50 per cent of registered voters plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, it will be the first serious backdrop for the policy of the Western-oriented government since it took over last May.
Look at: Manchester Citys Sergio Aguero takes all of Brighton's defenses to make targets
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling beat Brighton's proposal in Manchester City's 2-0 win at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England on Saturday.
Aguero got it to look ridiculously simple when he made goals in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker got a pass from the middle field at the beginning of the sequence.
He jumped between Brighton's three defenders and went out on the open field.
Aguero was surrounded by four green triangles.
He went around a defender and ran away from several others at the edge of Brighton's target area.
Then he pushed a fit to Sterling to the left.
The English foreman used his first kick in the target area to return the ball to Aguero, who used the right foot to hit Brighton's target guard Matthew Ryan with a shot on the right side of the net.
"Aguero has problems with his feet," said the city manager Pep Guardiola to the journalists.
"We talked about him playing for 55 to 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he made a target at that moment."
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the initial takeover at the Premier League.
The target came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep inside Brighton's River on that game.
He sent out a nice kick along the left side of Leroy Sane.
Sane took a couple of kicks and led Sterling to the outer pillar.
Sky Blues ahead fired the ball into the net at the moment before it got off range.
City meets Hoffenheim in the group game at the Champions League at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany at 12:55 on Tuesday.
Scherzer wants to play with Rockies
Nationals have been eliminated from the final game, so there was no reason to force one to start.
But competing Scherzer wants to throw on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only about Rockies, who is a match before Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West, still has a chance to finish the game.
Rockies got a wild card slot with a 5-2 win over Nationals on Friday night, but is still out after its first division title.
"We play nothing, but we can get a chance to chew rubber in knowledge of the atmosphere here in Denver with the audience and that the other team would play at higher level than any other team I would meet this year.
Why wouldn't I want to be there?"
Nationals have not yet announced their launch on Sunday, but according to reports, they complain about letting Scherzer throw in the circumstances.
Scherser, who would make his 34th start, warmed up in the bullpen on Thursday and would throw on his normal rest day.
Washington's right-hand thrower is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 200 2/3 innings this season.
Trump is holding talks in West Virginia
The President referred directly to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated to the Supreme Court, when he spoke about the importance of Republicans voting in the forthcoming mid-term elections.
"All we've done is at stake in November.
We are five weeks from one of the most important choices in our lives.
This is one of the great... I am not running, but I am running. That's why I'm going around and fighting for sovereign candidates," he said.
Trump continued: "You see a terrible, terrible group of radical Democrats, you see it happening here and now.
They are determined to take back power whatever it takes, you see their wickedness, horror.
They don't care who they have to hurt, who they have to drive to take over power and control. That's what they want, power and control.
Democrats, he said, are fighting to "stand and prevent".
"You've seen it in the last four days," he said, and called the Democrats "serious and evil and terrible and false."
He mentioned the democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who sits in the Senate Judiciary Committee, which was met by high-level observers.
"Do you remember what she said?
'Did you close the document?'
'Eh, uh, huh?
No, no, no, I'm waiting for a... 'It was really bad body language, some of the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a broad church.
They don't tolerate people who say what they think.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, I was hardly surprised.
Anyway, I'm the last one in a series of MPs from Labour who can hear that we're not welcome, just because we say what we think.
My colleague in this House, Joan Ryan, was treated in a similar way when she was against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticised for not keeping Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on the security of the nation, on Europe – ironically similar subjects that Jeremy criticised previous leaders for.
In the statement on the meeting with Nottingham East Labour this Friday said that "we want the meetings to be welcome and productive".
During most of my eight years as Labour's local MP, the GC meetings on Fridays have been exactly that.
But unfortunately, many meetings are not, and the promise of "friendly, more generous" policy has been forgotten a long time ago, if it ever started.
It has become increasingly evident that divergent views are not tolerated within Labour, and each opinion is judged on the basis of whether it is accepted by the party leader.
This began immediately after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues I once thought had a similar political view that I expected me to make a full reversal and take positions that I would never otherwise have agreed on – whether it was the security of the nation or the EU's internal market.
Every time I speak publicly – and it doesn’t really matter what I say – I follow a dozen of the unawares of social media that require me to be retired, criticises middle politics and says that I shouldn’t even be in Labour.
And this doesn't just affect me.
The fact is that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments addressed to me are mostly political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of these colleagues when they are faced with a stream of seismic and racist insults every day but never give up.
One of the biggest disappointments with this policy of yours is the level of insults now considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that Labour should promote a culture of tolerance.
But in reality, we are no longer this broad church, and with every mistrustful and change of the rules of choice, the party becomes more and more narrow.
I've had a lot of advice over the last two years on flying under the radar and not being too straight, so "it's okay".
But that's not why I became a politician.
Since I joined Labour as a school student 32 years ago, provoked by thatcher’s government’s neglect, which literally brought my elementary school’s classroom to collapse, I have tried to fight for better public services for those who need it most – both at the local level and as government ministers.
I have never concealed my political views, and that includes the last choice.
No one in Nottingham East can have been in any way confused by my views on policies and substances that I do not agree with today's leadership.
To you who promoted the profession this Friday, I just want to say that when the country goes towards a Brexit that will damage households, businesses and public services, I don't understand why anyone would want to waste time and energy on my loyalty to Labour Party leaders.
But my main message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituency – both Labour members and others: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of threats to abandon me or political convenience will prevent me from doing what I think is best for all of you.

Ayr 38-17 Melrose: Oslagna Ayr on top
Two attempts in the last minute may have distorted the result a year, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in this wonderful entertaining Tennant's Premiership match.
They're on top now, the only unbeatable side of the ten.
In the end, it was their superior defense, as well as their ability to take chances, which gave the home team the win, and coach Peter Murchie has every right to be satisfied.
"We have been tested under our matches so far and are still unbeatable, so we are so clearly happy," he said.
Robin Christie from Melrose said, "Ayr deserves it, they took better chances than we did."
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, which was converted by Frazier Climo, gave Ayr the lead but a yellow card to Captain Rory Hughes of Scotland, who was released by Warriors for the match, Melrose let the figures speak and Jason Baggot made an unconverted attempt.
At the end of the first half he scored and converted a solo attempt to give Ayr a 17-5 line in the break.
But Melrose got a good start on the other half and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which was converted by Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
It was then a long wait for a serious damage to Ruarid Knott, which was carried out by the plan, and after the restart, Ayr increased the leadership again with an attempt by Stafford McDowall, which was converted by Climo.
Ayr's acting captain Blair MacPherson then received a yellow card, and Melrose again forced the extra man to pay with an unconverted attempt from Bruce Colvine, at the end of a period of intense pressure.
But the home team recovered and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card to have hit the climate without the ball, McPherson made a touch down from the fine-line out behind Ayrs Maul.
Climo converted, which he did again almost immediately after the restart, after Kyle Rowe collected David Armstrong's box kick and sent away the flag Gregor Henry for the fifth attempt of the home team.
Still Game-star seems ready for new careers in the restaurant industry
Still The Game Star Ford Kiernan seems ready to join the restaurant industry after it has been discovered that it has been identified as the CEO for a licensed restaurant activity.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays in BBC's popular series, which he writes and plays together with his long-term comedian partner Greg Hemfill.
Duon has announced that the next ninth season will be the end of the series, and Kiernan seems to plan ahead of life after Craiglang.
According to official register, he is the CEO of Arigingmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment, but a source of Scottish Sun indicated that Kiernan wanted to join Glasgow's "flowering restaurant industry".
"The Sea belongs to us": Uncoasted Bolivia hopes that the court will open the way to the Pacific again
Seamen patrol a rich neighborhood for the fleet in La Paz.
Public buildings have a sea blue flag.
The base of the fleet from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon bears the motto: "The sea belongs to us.
It's our duty to recover it."
In Bolivia, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict of the 1800s is still strong – and it is also eager to reseale on the Pacific.
This hope is higher than that of decades now when Bolivia is awaiting a decision by the International Court of Justice on the first October, after five years' consideration.
"Bolivia has the operation, a mood of unity and peace, and expects so clearly the result with a positive attitude," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the decision of the International Court of Justice on large screens over the country, hoping that the Hague Court will judge for the benefit of Bolivia's demands that Chile, after years of irregular discussions, negotiate with Bolivia to allow them to leave their own way to the sea.
The decision of Monday is also of great importance to Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatically-born president who is facing a controversial fight for re-election next year.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that it is incredible that the Court will judge Bolivia's benefit, and that not much would be changed even if it does.
The United Nations Court of Justice, based in the Netherlands, has no right to allocate Chilean territory and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the decision was announced only six months after the final arguments suggests that the case "was not complicated", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And in the last four years, it may have hurt rather than promoted Bolivia's chances.
"The issue of access to the sea has been captured by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
She claims that Morale's aggressive rhetoric has attracted Chile's remaining goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will in time continue the discussion, but it will be extremely difficult to do so after this.
The two countries have not been able to exchange ambassadors since 1962.
Prior to this, President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, did not consider that the Court’s decision had been taken very quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia will give "an outstanding opportunity to start a new era for Chile's relationship" and a chance to "stop for 139 years of mutual advantage differences of opinion", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin American’s most popular presidents – used the question of the sea as a political cricket.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific," he said.
"The decision is a chance to realize that we must move on from the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament requires trust in the United States
North Korea Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says the nation will not break down its nuclear weapons unless they can trust Washington.
Ri spoke to the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to fulfil the promises made at a summit in Singapore between the two rival leaders.
His comments came when US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo seems to be on the border to resolve the death penalty for nuclear weapons plomatine more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korea leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is a "desire dream" to continue sanctions and US protests against a statement to end the Korean War will ever be the theme of North Korea.
Washington hesitates to take part in the statement without Pyongyang first launching significant nuclear disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want another summit.
But there is widespread skepticism against the fact that Pyongyang is really going to get rid of a weaponry that the country probably sees as its only chance to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion views reveal the latest line huge headboards on the way to shops near you
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or completely block the sun, we have the right thing for you.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne have revealed a wide range of clever, oversized headboards for their SS19 collection on the catwalk, which blended the stylishs on Paris fashion weekend.
Incredible optical hats have taken over Instagram this summer, and the designs have sent away their ominous creatures on the catwalk.
Valentino’s main creation was an exaggerated beige hat with a poultry-like board of hats that completely took over the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories included jeweled watermelons, a magic hat and even an pineapple – but they are not intended to keep their head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks, in almost time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had sewn together lips and looked like Hannibal Lecter rather than haute couture.
One creature resembled a wet suit with snorkel and dive mask, and another looked like a melted glass layer.
And if you're going to keep going, you're lucky.
Fashion experts predict that the huge hateds may be on their way to shops near you.
The oversized hats come immediately after La Bomba – the helmet with a beam of 60 cm that has been seen on all from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the incredibly optical hat that has taken over social media sent out another great creation on the catwalk – a half beach bag that was almost as big as the model in the swim suit that held in it.
The raffia bag in terracotta, with raffia francs and a white leather handle, was excellent in Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 collection on Paris fashion week.
The famous designer Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: "I expect to see large hats and beach bags in the shops next summer – the designer has had such an impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills for global citizens
Scotland’s independent schools maintain outstanding academic results, and this continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding test results, which are only strengthened by individual and collective progress in sport, art, music and other social events.
With up to 30,000 students in Scotland, the schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best possible service for their students and their parents.
Independent schools seek to prepare their students for further education, their chosen career and their role as global citizens.
As a sector of education that can design and implement adapted curricula, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and demandable subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands it goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it will go to his heart."
It is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we create relationships and trust with people from other countries.
This year's test results show that languages are highest on the list, with a maximum number of approved results in independent schools.
A total of 68 per cent of students who studied foreign languages received A in the final Higher Grade.
Data collected from SKIS 74 member schools showed that 72 per cent of students who studied mandarin received an A in Higher Grade, and 72 per cent of those who studied German, 69 per cent of those who studied French and 63 per cent of those who studied Spanish also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as crucial skills as children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Language as a matter of course is now considered as important as natural knowledge, technology, engineering and mathematics on curricula in independent schools and beyond.
A survey carried out by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that employers for various reasons had difficulty filling their services, with 17% attributed to a lack of language skills.
This says that language skills are becoming increasingly necessary to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more future jobs requiring language skills, these skills will be needed in a globalised world.
Regardless of their career choice, they will have a real benefit in the future if they have adopted a different language.
To communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a multilingual person a competitive advantage.
According to a survey of more than 4,000 adult Brits published by YouTube 2013, 75 percent replied that they could not speak a foreign language well enough to keep a conversation in it, and in French was the only language that totaled a two-digit percentage (15 percent).
That is why it is so important to invest in language teaching for our children.
To be able to speak several languages, especially those used in developing countries, gives your child a better chance of finding meaningful employment in the future.
In Scotland each school will learn different combinations of languages.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while others will teach in languages considered to be the most important for Britain by 2020, for example Chinese or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose from within independent schools, with teachers who are specialists in this area.
Scottish independent schools strive to provide a learning environment that will prepare children and provide them with the skills needed to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
In a global economic environment, there is no doubt that languages continue to be crucial for the future of the country, so it must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be regarded as "international communication capacity".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for the youth of Scotland.
It's a good thing to do.
John Edward is head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron makes Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans looking forward to seeing LeBron James debut for Los Angeles Lakes.
Laker's coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play the first Saturday season match against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes has he played yet to be determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on Laker's official website.
Laker's reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is probably going to play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for Lakers' seasoning schedule.
"I don't need games at this stage of my career to get ready," he said.
Trumps West Virginia campaign event, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is making his first campaign tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's Trump's first of five planned performances next week, including events in places he has great support, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Pending a confirmatory vote by its candidate to the High Court's vacant post, Trump aims to build support for the upcoming mid-term elections, as the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Congress before the current elections in November.
What time is Trumps West Virginia rally tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trumps Wheeling, West Virginia campaign event is scheduled at 19:00, Saturday evening, 29 September 2018.
You can watch Trumps West Virginia-rally online below via live stream on YouTube.
Trump will probably deal with this week's poll by the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, who was sued for complaints of his sexual abuse, with a expected delay in the Senate's vote of up to one week while the FBI's investigation of the case is ongoing.
But the primary purpose of these events is to help the Republicans get some meat on their legs before the November elections.
So President Trump said that these five meetings next week aim to "engage volunteers and supporters when the Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority of the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"The control of Congress is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible when we enter the hectic campaign period," said a spokesman for the Trump campaign that did not want to be named Reuters.
Night's event, scheduled at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, can attract fans from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract attention from Pittsburgh's media", according to West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday the second time during the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state where he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican Senate d.o.b. for West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who has been looking for opinions in the polls.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must come there to try to give him an increase in opinion polls," says Simon Haeder, a statesman at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA fights to keep the hopes alive in front of Sunday's singles
After three one-sided sessions, the parties could have been what was required for this Ryder Cup this afternoon.
The torque pendulum is a completely invented sport concept, but something that players really believe in, and more than ever before in competitions like these.
So what time is this about now?
"They had a six-point lead and now it's four, so we carry it as a little moment I guess," said Jordan Spieth when he finished for the day.
Europe, of course, has four points ahead with 12 more to win.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel that they have little wind in the sail, but they have much to encourage by, not least in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and made home three points of four where.
Spieth has been washed from tea to green and preceded by a good example.
The Winstripe Scaled even higher when his round continued and he lowered a decisive point to take the match four all-square when he and Thomas had played after with two after two games.
His putt that won them the match of 15 met with a similar wreath, with conviction that the American team is not yet out of play.
"You really have to dig deep and worry about your own match," Spieth said.
That's all these players have left now.
18 holes to win.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, Ryder Cups' unmistakable story.
Europe's strange but charming couple are four from four and now nothing can go wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't do a bogey on Saturday afternoon and they also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
These performances and public reactions determine that they are the players to strike on Sunday and there are no more popular players who could get home a potential European victory when the sun goes down over Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Mostly both, at the same time at different holes.
However, it is too early to talk about European victories.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made the process brief with Sergio Garcia, the morning's fireworks hero, along with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on front nine lowered the Spaniards and the Swedish in a hole they never even came near to crawling out.
On Sunday, however, there is no one who will help you out of the hole.
Fireball and foursome are so fascinating to look closely at because of the interaction between the couple, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and how a strategy can be changed at a moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken a significant lead before the last day, but this foursome session also showed that Team USA has a fight which some, especially on the US side, had doubted.
Europe takes the lead with 10-6 in Ryder Cup last day
Europe will have a strong advantage on Ryder Cups the last day after coming out of Saturday's football and foursomes match with a 10-6-lead across the United States.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led two victories over a lined Tiger Woods and came home all four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European law, which fought to maintain the pokalas they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American law that never really started during the morning's football with 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursome and won two matches, but it was not enough to win.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from Sunday's 12 single matches to keep the podium.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to win four points in line while he and Molinari, baptized to "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend, is just the second pair to win four points from their first four matches in Ryder Cups history.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed into a fireball, they beat an exhausted Woods and American smoke Bryson Dechambeau with an even more impressive 5 & 4.
Woods, who went through two games on Saturday, showed trials at single moments of brilliantness, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in fireworks and fireworks, and seven of them in a row.
Justin Rose, retired during the morning’s football and returned to partner Henrik Stenson in foursomes to a 2 & 1 victory over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranked one and three in the world.
Europe did not know the whole way, but it was a nice, windy day immediately south-west of Paris.
Three times the winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won home with 2 & 1 over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in a fireball and returned later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 & 3 in a foursome after losing the two opening holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cups' history has a team come back from a base on four points in single matches, however, Furyk's side only needs an undecided result to keep the podium.
After having been the next best for two days, it seems like a counterattack on Sunday may become difficult to get through.
North Korea says the "never" will disarm unilaterally without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations this Saturday that continuing sanctions had deepened their mistrust towards the United States and it was not possible for the country to give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organization's annual general meeting that in recent years North Korea had taken "significant steps to show its goodwill", for example by stopping nuclear and missile testing, disassembling nuclear testing facilities and promising not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see any corresponding answer from the USA," he said.
"Without any confidence for the United States, there will be no confidence for our national security and under such circumstances there is no chance that we will disarm ourselves alone first."
While Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington’s resistance to a approach divided into stages of the nuclear power that would reward North Korea when it took a gradual step, his statement seemed important because it did not reject a unilateral nuclear solution just as Pyongyang had previously done.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a seated US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, where Kim promised to work towards "the development of nuclear weapons in the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea has sought a formal end to the Korean War 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first disband its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also given no thanks to negotiations to ease severe international sanctions against North Korea.
"The US insists on "development first" and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its purpose by forcing and even objecting to "the declaration to end the war", says Ri.
"The notion that sanctions can get us on our knees is a wish for the people who lack knowledge of us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions deepen our mistrust."
Ri did not mention plans at a second summit between Kim and Trump, which US leaders highlighted earlier in the UN during the week.
Instead of holding three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, the Minister said: "If the party on nuclear disarmament was South Korea and not the United States, the Korean peninsula's nuclear disarmament would not have come to such a death point."
Yet the tone in Ri's speech was dramaticly different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that North Korea's future ability to reach the US mainland with rockets was inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim a "rocketman" on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take action on disarmament, but said that much work remains and that sanctions must remain until North Korea is disarmed.
On Wednesday Trump said he had no time for this and said that "if it takes two years, three years or five months", it doesn't matter".
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The maintenance of the Security Council's sanctions must continue with force and without failure until we realize a complete, final, verified disarmament."
The Security Council has consistently reinforced sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to drown the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri in conjunction with the UN General Assembly and then said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made. However, North Korea accused him a few hours later of "walking demands".
North Korea promised a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile facility and also a nuclear complex if the United States took "opposite measures".
He said Kim had told him that the "responsible measures" he was seeking were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and that he was moving towards normalising relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has been given to all doctoral students to improve their sleep habits in an attempt to combat the growing macho culture to study through caffeine-filled "dyings".
An academic study found that students at the leading university in the world are often unconscious as to the basics of how to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first in his kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after talking about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
"At the end of it a girl came up to me and said, "Why can't I know this until now, in my last year?"
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me, he told The Telegraph.
The course, organized for the first time this year, explains to the students the importance of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance and improve their general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The hourly course includes a number of interactive data.
In part of the course there is a picture of a student room where students click on coffee cups, wardrobes, trainers and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, how athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation and the importance of good sleep habits.
In another part, participants may know how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that it will not change the students' behavior directly.
But we think they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know about the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes," said Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in that "dygna" still exists, he says, allowing modern technology and constantly increasing pressure on students meant that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
To ensure that you have enough sleep, of good quality, should be the student's "secret weapon" to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said - also to avoid weight gain because insomnia puts the student's brain in a state of hunger and keeps them hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californiar who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course and has read one of his courses last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course was an eye-opener and inspired him to campaign for a campus-wide course.
He hopes that the next step is to ask all doctoral students to complete a similar study program before they begin their studies at the institution of high performance.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm for when to lay down and when to wake up and be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can cause you to turn on the day, leading to inhaling problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga goals lower Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another loss today when Dolly Menga's strike sent Steven Gerrard's uneven side to a 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
The Ibrox page was out after taking home its first victory on the road since February 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's law delivered Gerrard's second defeat in 18 matches as manager to leave his team eight points after Ladbrokes Premiership Leader Harts.
Lots of hits to seven minutes before half-time, and Rangers never even scored.
While Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third and lies only behind the Hibernian on the target.
And there may be more problems on the line for Rangers after the lineman Calum Spence had to be treated for a year after an object was thrown from the far end.
Gerrard made eight changes to the semifinal of Betfred Cup.
Holt on the other side went with the same Livi 11 who took a point from Hearts last week and he would have been happy about the way his well-being games overglorred the opponents each time.
Rangers must have dominated, but Livingston did more with the ball control they had.
It should have been a goal for two minutes already into the match when Menga's first pass through Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed his big chance and shot outside.
A fresh park at the bottom of Keaghan Jacobs then reached the captain of the team Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow only reached the back pillar.
Rangers took control of the match, but it seemed to be more hopeful than believing in their games during the last third of the match.
Alfredo Morelo certainly felt that he should have been punished when he and Steven Lawless were collapsing, but Judge Steven Thomson fanned off the Colombian call.
Rangers were only able to do two goals in the first half, but this former Ibrox target guard Liam Kelly took it easy against Lassana Coulibaly's nick and a good shot from Ovie Ejaria.
Live opening shots in the 34th minute must go against the spirit of the game, but no one can deny that their skilled earned it.
Again, Rangers failed to handle Jacob's situation.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher came to Scott Robinson, who remained calm and chose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard acted at the break when he switched Coulibaly to Ryan Kent and the switch gave almost immediate effect when the outside hit the ball to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly jumped from his line to block the attempt.
But Livingston continued to get the opponents to play exactly the type of games they like, with Lithgow and Halkett who swung up long fit after long fit.
Holt's side could have strengthened his leadership in the last stage, but McGregor managed well to prevent Jacob's before Lithgow knocked out after the corner.
Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton had yet to claim a late sentence when he was shut down with Jacobs, but again he looked away from Thomson.
Almac: The inventor of Geiger Counter
And now a page from Sunday's almanac: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago ... the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the manicure called Geiger Meters.
Geigermeits have become a foundation for science since then and are also large in pop culture, as in the 1950s film "Bells of Coronado", with the main role of the unparalleled cowboy researchers Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
MAN "What in all the world is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger meter, used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones you can actually hear the effects of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity in the minerals. "Evans:
Evans, "Yeah, it's popping up now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63-year-old day.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune defense to "see" cancer cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune defense to "see" cancer cells and kill them
Vaccine learns how to recognise cancer cells as part of treatment
The method means to extract immune cells from a patient and modify them in the laboratory
They can then "see" a protein that is common to many cancers and then re-injected
A test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different cancer forms.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who learned to recognise cancer again, saw her ovaries disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them into the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein that is common to many cancer forms called HER2 and then reinjecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "promots the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovary, lung and colon cancer," explained Prof Berzofsky.
A similar method to take immune cells from patients and "learn" them how to target cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West supported Trump by wearing a MAGA cap, after his SNL appearance.
It didn't work so well.
Kanye West was kicked out of a studio during Saturday Night Live after a stunning performance where he praised US President Donald Trump and said he himself would run for the 2020 post.
After performing his third song for the evening, called Ghost Town, where he was wearing a Make America Great Keps, he ran against the Democrats and repeated his support for Trump.
"So many times when I talk to a white person they say, "How do you like Trump, he's racist?"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I'd have moved from America a long time ago, he said.
SNL started the show with a sketch with Matt Damon where the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate's Legal Committee on the allegations of sexual abuse by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even if it wasn't sent, the play of West's layout was loaded on social media by comical Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock tried to drive with West with the post.
West had also complained to the public that he had been harassed backstage for his main residence.
"They raped me backstage.
They said, "Don't go out there with that hat on."
They raped me!
And then they say I fell low," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to go down too low?" and said that he would "put my supermancape on, that means you can't say what I can do.
Test with love."
His comments attracted more fuss at least twice from the audience and employees from SNL seemed to be generated, reported Variety. One person said: "It became a death-star in the studio."
West had come in as a late substitute for the singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller had died a few days ago.
The West has ruined many with their appearance of the song I Love It, dressed in a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest souls: Thank you for supporting you against MOBBEN."
But Prattshowen's host, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West simply "be yourself and it's absolutely wonderful."
"But I chose NOT to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothes or by supporting his "art") who I believe embraces and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my society.
He's free.
We're with her, let her.
Before the show told the rapper on Twitter that he had changed his name and said that he was now "the creature previously known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows Diddy's footsteps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The rapper colleague, Snoop Dogg, has called himself Snoop Lion and, of course, the deceased musician Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist who was previously known as Prince.
Court of Justice for attempted murder after cutting knives at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, the police said.
The respondent is expected to be found at Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the Prosecutor's Office.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington fights toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for its sword-wing role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, has voiced negatively about the stereotype of the macho hero and says that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they have to be tough to respect.
In a statement to Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed that "something has gone wrong" and questioned how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity during the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently got married to his fellow actor in Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also she 31, admitted that he felt "a little strong" to deal with the problem.
"I personally feel pretty strong, right now--where have we gone wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"How have we raised men in view of the problems we see now?"
Kit believes that TV may partly be responsible for the increase of toxic masculinity due to its very masculine characteristics.
He continued "What is intruded and what is learned?
What is learned on TV and on the streets, which makes young boys feel that they have to be in a certain way to be man?
I think it is really one of the big issues in our time - how do we change it?
It is clear that something has gone wrong with young men."
In an interview, he also admitted that he would not make any Game of Thrones followers when the series comes to an end next summer and says that he is "ready with battlefields and horses".
From November, Kit will play in a new recording by Sam Shepards True West, who is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he thought the meeting with his wife Rose was the best experience from Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife because of the series, so he gave me my future family and my future life," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, as Kit's character Jon Snow falls in love with, in Emmy's winning fantasy series.
The couple got married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has reported an increase of 14 % of the population living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have been affected in the country, says health authorities.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only during the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases were transmitted via sex and marked a change from previous years.
Traditionally, HIV is rapidly spread through certain parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way had been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in the Yunnan Province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 from year to year.
HIV infection through society is an acute issue in the HBT community of China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against HBT persons is said to be widespread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will marry women sooner or later.
Many of the infections are due to insufficient protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that staff leaked the duties of the GOP Senator, blames on "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
On Saturday, US Congressman Maxine Waters condemned the claim that one of her employees had filed personal data on three republican U.S. senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that these claims were spread by right-wing extremist websites.
"False, lie and more reprehensible lies," said Waters in a Twitter statement.
The information released included addresses and telephone numbers of senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information came online Thursday, posted by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during a senate panel questioning the charges of sexual abuse against the nominated candidate to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came once after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with the Waters office and released information about a member of Waters staff, reported Hill.
"This unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"My staff - whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false claims - were in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unwarranted claim is completely false and an absolute lie."
Water's statement was quickly criticized online, including from the previous press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This deny is angry," Fleischer wrote.
"This indicates that she does not have the temper to be a member of the Congress.
When someone's accused of something they didn't do, they can't be angry.
They can't be proud.
They shall not question the applicant's motives.
They must be calm and sound."
Fleischer seemed to try to compare Water's reaction to the critics' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who critics accused of being angry during Thursday's interrogation.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who was running for Waters in the middle of the term of office, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"City of Truth," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said that her office had warned "appropriate authorities and criminal beings for these fraudulent demands.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators will be exposed," she continued, "and that they will be held legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all my employees."
Review of Johnny English Strikes Again - powerless spy parody of Rowan Atkinson
It is now a tradition to look for Brexit meanings in every new British film, and the same seems to apply to this new recording of the latest Johnny English action comedin - a series of spy parades launched in early 2003 with Johnny English and received new life 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Are we aware of how clearly bad we are becoming the nation's new export goods?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with the rubber face has been given his license to client the matter renewed for the second time - his name indicates more than anything else that he is a wide comic creation for biopublics even in non-English countries
Of course, he is the clever secret agent, who, despite his wonderful claims on smoothieglamour, has received a little bit of Clouseau, a cute Mr. Bean and a measure of the guy from the opening ceremony to the London OS in 2012.
He is also originally based on the traveler and the international mystery man Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV ads that create chaos wherever he goes.
There are one or two great moments in the last JE movie
I loved it when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in a middle suit and when the rotor blade struck his helmet for a while.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is shown, but humor feels quite low and strangely superfluous, especially because the "serious" film brands such as 007 and Mission Neptune itself now offer comedy as an ingredient.
The humour feels as if it is adapted for children instead of adults and for me Johnny English is not as strange as inventive and focused as Atkinson's silent film bravades in the role as Bean.
The constant issue is now that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated Britain's super-secret network of spies, revealing the identities of all British agents out in the field, to the agent of great dissatisfaction - an extremely small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last strand for a prime minister who is a Pompey and hard-earned figure, who already suffers from a complete collapse of his political popularity: Emma Thompson is doing his best with this quasi-Teresa-May character, but the manual does not offer much to work with.
Her informant informs her that when each individual active spy is busy, she must use someone who has retired.
And that means the native Johnny English in his own high person, now employed as a teacher in a well-off institution, but offering informal lessons in art to work undercover alongside.
English was sent back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and reunited with its former long-lived sidekick Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to an underage, a jolly-hockey-sticks-roll where Vicki Pepperdine is close to being thrown away.
So Batman and Robin are back after everything went so terribly wrong on Her Majesty's Secret Service and is hitting Olga Kurylenko's beautiful woman fatal Ophelia Bulletin.
In time, the Prime Minister will fall hard for the charismatic technologist, who claims that he can solve the British computer dispute: the unfortunate Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssé with a variety of occupations: dressed as servants, they set fire to a flashy French restaurant; they create chaos when sneaking on board Volta’s luxury boat; and English releases pure anarchy when he tries to use a VR headset to familiarize himself with the inside of Volta’s house.
There is probably a lot of work behind the last sequence, but despite the fact that the film is both charming and speedy, it has an air of children's TV around it.
Quite moderately everything like everything.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I can't help but think: Can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that matches his talent?
Labour refuses to draw up a plan for Britain to work a four-day week but receive a five-day salary
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical plan that assumes that the British are working for a four-day week - but gets paid for five.
According to the Party, business leaders want to transfer savings made through the revolution of artificial intelligence (AI) to workers by giving them an extra day off.
It would see employees enjoying a three-day weekend - but keep the same salary.
According to sources, the idea of "passing" with the party's economic agenda would benefit the workers.
To change to a four-day week has been approved by Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from economic change.
A senior representative in Labor said to The Sunday Times: A policy review is expected to be published before the end of the year.
"It will not happen in one day, but a four-day work week is an effort that fits into the party's position to balance the economy for the benefit of the worker and the party's overall industrial strategy."
Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, even the The Greens party that promised a four-day work week during its 2017 election campaign.
However, this objective is not recorded by Labour as a whole.
A spokesperson for Labour said: "A four-week work week is not the party's policy and it's not the party's agreement."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to communicate his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to withdraw power from " faceless leaders" and "sniffs" on government companies.
The plans of the Shadow Chancellor also mean that the current shareholders of water companies cannot recover their entire effort, as a Labour Government can make 'deductions' because of what they believe has been wrong.
He also confirmed plans to put employees in corporate boards and create the so-called Inclusive Ownship Funds, where 10% of the private company's own funds are transferred to its employees, who then receive annual dividends up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell the TV program "60 minutes" whether the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh could change their views
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least one week and raises the question of whether the Agency's investigations could have some Republican senators change the situation.
In an interview that was sent on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could reveal something that would lead them to change their views.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
"I said when I went into the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, the claim came out, and he said, "Have you done it?"
He was determined, convinced, uncertain."
However, Graham's voice seems unstoppable.
"I have already decided on Brett Kavanaugh and it would take a dynamic approach," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it," allowed Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all her names couldn't verify it.
It was 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new changing."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has done something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday New York will be host to the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has an enormously impressive set of stars that perform and an equally impressive mission; to combat world poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people going to Central Parks Great Lawn, not only to enjoy artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real objectives of the event: to combat extreme poverty by 2030.
Global Citizen Festival, according to a 2012 statement, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international pre-accession group that hopes to combat poverty by increasing the number of people who actively fight against it.
To get a free ticket to the event (if you weren't ready to pay for a VIP ticket), the concert guests would perform a series of tasks, or "measures" such as volunteer work, email a world leader, call or otherwise meaningfully contribute to raising awareness of the goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been with 12 years left to reach its goal?
Is it the idea to reward people with a free concert a genuine way to convince people to act, or is it just so-called "clictivism" - people who feel they make a real difference by signing an online application or writing a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has reported that more than 19 million "actions" have been registered from its supporters who have fought for a variety of objectives.
It is said that these measures have contributed to leading world leaders to announce commitments and policies corresponding to more than $37 billion, which will affect life for more than 2.25 billion people in 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and announcements arising from its actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid out or financed.
The group appreciates that the assets collected so far have had a direct impact on almost 649 million people around the world.
Some of the most important commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership based in the UK between investors and stakeholders who are committed to "helping children develop their full potential", promising to give Rwanda $35 million to help combat malnutrition in the area after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and global citizens, just like you, we can make social injustices as malnutrition is a footnote in history," said the ambassador of the Tracey Ulllman partnership to the crowd during a live-in-consistency in London in April 2018.
The group also said that, following more than 5000 measures that require Britain to improve the cost of mothers and children, the government announced funding for the project, Power of Nutrition, which includes food programmes targeting 5 million women and children.
In answer to one of the common questions on his website, "What makes you think we can fight extreme poverty?"
Global citizens replied: "It will be a long and difficult road - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-participation movements before us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are some of the artists who perform at the New York Year's event, whose hosts are Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use its fleet in a "block" to prevent Russian energy exports.
The government can "if necessary" join its fleet to prevent Russian energy operators from entering the markets, including in the Middle East, has revealed by US Home Minister Ryan Zinke, quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's commitment to Syria - particularly where it seems at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I think they are in the Middle East because they want to sell energy, just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern parts of Europe," he said.
And according to him, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The US has the ability, with our fleet, to ensure that the waterways are kept open and, if necessary, to apply blocked, to ensure that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants at the event organized by Consumer Energy Alliance, an ideal group called "the voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to handling Russia and Iran, and noted that they are really the same.
"The economic alternative to Iran and Russia is more or less to exploit and exchange fuel," he said, while referring to Russia as a "day country" with an economy dependent on fossil fuel.
The statement will be after the Trump administration has aimed to increase exports of its liquid natural gas to Europe, in order to replace Russia, the far cheaper alternative for European consumers.
To this end, officials of the Trump administration, including President Donald Trump of the United States, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "unappropriate" Nord Stream 2-pipeline project, which according to Trump made Berlin to Moscow "capture".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2 pipeline of $11 billion, which will double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
They claim that Washington’s opposition to the project is driven only by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose the suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position was backed up by Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industry organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I strongly hate that a third party disturbs our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Vladimir Putin of Russia.
Elizabeth Warren will take a "ordinary thinker" if she is going to vote in the 2020 presidential election," says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would take a "ordinary thinker" around her participation in the presidential election after the mid-term election of the United States.
At a meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider becoming a candidate.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and set our tragic government and it includes a woman at the top," she said, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will take a real thinker to run for the president's office."
Warren pointed to President Donald Trump during the council meeting and said that he "took this country in the wrong direction.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing for our democracy," she said.
Warren has been free of language in his criticism of Trump and his candidate to the Supreme Court, Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
However, a vote on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own supporters did not believe that she would run 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "trust" Massachusetts voters said that the senator should not run, according to a study by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidacy.
The investigation showed more support for a candidacy by former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent for a potential candidacy and 48 per cent against.
Other highly-profiled democratic names discussed with respect to a potential 2020 candidate include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would decide officially in January, reported the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin quotes Track Palin's PTSD at Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after taking up the acquisition in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night
"When my own son goes through, what he goes through now when he is back, I can relate to other families who have experience of PTSD and some of the trauma our soldiers return with," she told the audience at a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest for "the elephant in the room" and said about his son and other war veterans that "they will return as other people, they will return, they will return and wonder if there is respect for what their colleagues, soldiers and pilots and all other members of the military have given the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, trying to prevent a report of domestic violence and armed possession, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for Wasilla Police Department.
18 countries, as well as the District of Colombia support the question of a new asylum policy
Arton states and District of Columbia support a legal trial aimed at a new American policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang-related violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the district submitted a friend-of-the-court application on Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenges the police, NBC News reported.
The full name of the charges in the Grace v. Sessions case submitted by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the police has not been disclosed.
She said her partner, "and his violent gang members," abused her, but American officials refused her asylum on July 20th.
She was imprisoned in Texas.
State lawyers supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, countries producing a large number of asylum seekers, as nations facing major problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy amended a 2014 decision by the immigration authorities which enabled illegal immigrants to seek asylum in order to escape domestic violence.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law."
"The Federal Law requires all asylum applications to be assessed on the basis of specific facts and circumstances of the claim and such a provision is contrary to that principle", according to the friendly-of-the court report.
Lawyers further argued in the report that policies that deny immigrants' entry harm the American economy and argue that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary labour force".
In June, Justice Minister Jeff Sessions ordered a judge in asylum cases to no longer grant asylum to victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
"Asyl is available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion," the session said when the police were announced on 11 June.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all the problems - even all the serious problems - that people face every day throughout the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu when the death count is doubled in the search for survivors
For the survivors, the situation looked more and more bleak.
"It feels very excited," said the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, who comforted her feverish boy in an evacuation center in the city of Palu.
"The ambulance collects dead bodies all the time.
Clean water is a missing product."
The inhabitants were seen returning to their ruined homes, rotting through damaged property and trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, which were damaged in the 7.5 earthquake, were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who were affected by a broken back and shoulder, stayed outside the Palu's Army Hospital, where the patients were treated outside due to continued severe post-mortem.
With tears in his eyes, he told us that the violent earthquake shook the room on the fifth floor of the hotel he shared with his wife and daughter.
"We don't run away from him.
I was pushed into the ruins of the wall, I think," Harris told the Associated Press and allowed his family to be in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife screaming for help, and then it got quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
US Ambassador accuses China of "mobbing" with "propaganda ads"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four - page ad in an American newspaper on the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to China Daily paying a grant in the Des Moines Register - the state of Iowa's best selling newspaper - after accusing China of trying to participate in the 6th U.S. Congress elections, something China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to get mixed up in American elections marked what American officials told Reuters where a new phase of an escalating campaign from Washington was about to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to use advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in a escalating trade war with high tariffs on each other's imports.
China’s reimbursement rates were designed early in the trade war to affect exporters in countries like Iowa that support Trump’s Republican Party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and former Governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had damaged US workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a debate article in the Sunday Des Moines Register, "now doubles the mob by posting propaganda ads in our own free press."
"The Chinese government uses America's dear tradition of freedom of opinion and a free press to spread the propaganda by publishing paid advertisements in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, in the newspaper library on the street here in Beijing you will find a limited number of divergent voices and will not see any true reflection of the different views that the Chinese people may have about China's worrying economy, because the media is controlled by the iron hand of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He allowed "one of China's most prominent newspapers to notice the offer to publish" his article, even though he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans scare out female voters before the mid-year elections through Kavanaugh fiascot, warns analysts
Since many top republics defend the Supreme Court’s nominated Brett Kavanaugh, who is facing several charges of sexual abuse, analysts have warned that there will be a backlog, especially from women, during the forthcoming election.
The feelings about this have been extremely high, and most Republicans have already shown where they stand in the election.
It is not possible to turn back the clock, says Grant Reeher, professor of State Science at Syracuse Universities Maxwell School, to The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted Senator Jeff Flakes (R-Arizona) the last attempt on an FBI investigation will suffice to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow and not in November," says Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the Progressive Group MoveOn on Friday, according to Washington, DC.
On Friday morning, the demonstrators "November comes!" when they demonstrated in the hall to the late building when the Republicans controlling the Court Committee chose to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go up," said Stu Rothenberg, a neutral political analyst, to the news site.
"People say it's already been high, it's true.
But it could be higher, especially among still undecided female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18- to 29-year-olds, who, although they do not like the president, often do not vote."
Already before Ford’s public testimony with allegations of sexual abuse against the nominated candidate to the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that a backlog could follow if the Republicans pressed through the confirmation.
"This has become a confusing touch for GOP," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It is not only about the Committee's vote or the final vote or about Kavanaugh coming through, it is also about how Republicans have handled this and how they have treated it," said Guy Cecil, Head of Priorities USA, a group that helps democratic election campaigns, for the news channel.
But Americans in general seem to be divided over who they should believe in in the cold water of Ford's and Kavanaugh's testimony, and the latter seems to be the most they believe in.
A new opinion poll by YeGov shows that 41 per cent of respondents definitely or probably believed in Ford’s testimony, while 35 per cent said that they definitely or probably believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought Kavanaugh was probably or definitely lying under his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following the pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the claims made by Ford, as well as by at least another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified to the Senate Court Committee during the last week that Kavanaugh violently attacked her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate to the Supreme Court exposed his sexual organs to her while they attended a party during their time as students at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to start a new internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup aimed at competing with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legacy projects, Inrupt, are a company based on Berners-Lees open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which persons can access what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt was "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said about the startup company.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "Personal Online Data Large" or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, make-lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in a browser at the same time.
What is unique with the personal online data storage is that it is completely up to the user who can get access to what type of information.
The company calls it "personal authorization through data."
The idea of Inrupt, according to the company's CEO John Bruce, is to include resources, processes and appropriate skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some programme developers to work with the project and a group of volunteer encoders.
From this week onwards, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team don't talk to "Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a complete change where all business models are placed on top of one night.
"We don't ask them for permission."
In an article on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new web created by Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee converted the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate over recent months on net neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and head of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I am very optimistic about this new era on the web," allowed Berners-Lee.
Bernard Water: Priest rewarded with Victoria Cross during World War I
The only priest in the English Church who was rewarded with a Victorian Cross during the first world war is now celebrated in his home town 100 years later.
Lt Col Reverend Bernard Water received the award for his action during the attack on Bellengise and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
However, he was killed by a bullet four days later and never learned that he had been awarded the most prestigious prize of the British military.
A monument was discovered by his two children during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that it was "bright symbolic", that the stone would be exposed exactly 100 years after his grandfather was rewarded with the price.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918 Lt Col won his battalion over Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog and under heavy fire from field and masking weapons."
He later rushed up to the shooting line and led the "great bravery" line forward before he alone decided the battle.
Lt Col Water was killed by a German dot shot on October 4, 1918 - a little more than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I know I could never live up to, but something I am very humble before."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid down a crown after the parade, led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he was "very honored to play a role in the parade" and allowed "a true hero to be demonstrated by the support that will be given by many people".
MMA fans stayed up all night looking at Bellator 206 and instead got to see Greta Gris
Imagine this, you have stood up all night to see Bellator 206 just to be refused to look at the main event.
The show from San Jose contained 13 matches, including sex on the main card and was shown live at night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 06:00, just as Gegard Mousesi and Rory MacDonald prepared to meet each other, the British viewers were surprised when the program suddenly changed to Greta Gris.
Many were so impressed by their keeping awake to the early hours of the morning to watch the game.
A fan on Twitter described the program change to a drawn child program as "a sick joke".
"It was the Government's decision that the content was not appropriate so early in the morning, so they had to switch to child programs," said Dave Schwartz, Vice-President of Bellator for marketing and communication when he was asked about the transmission.
"Greta gray, yes"
Bellators CEO Scott Coker said they will work with their schedule to better include British viewers in the future.
"I think we'll be able to find a solution to the recurrence," said Coker.
"But it's sex in the morning on a Sunday there and we won't be able to solve this until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Trust me, the program changed a lot.
We tried to do that, we thought it was a technical error.
But it was actually a government issue.
I can promise you it won't happen next time.
We will show five matches instead of sex - as we normally do. We took water over our head in our pursuit to satisfy the fan.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "undercovered" because of sexuality
The Olympic diver Tom Daley says that he felt the underside of his friends during his upbringing because of his sexuality - but it also moved him to be successful.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize he wasn't like everyone else until he went to high school."
When he spoke in the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about the rights of homosexuals to give others "hop".
He also said that he cared less about winning OS after becoming a parent.
The popular show's regular programmer, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off due to illness.
During his one-time performance at Lavernes' first program, Daley tells how he felt "less worthy" than others during his upbringing, because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls".
He said, "This feeling of feeling less worthy and feeling differently has been a real source of strength and strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "someone," he said, so he didn't let everyone down when they eventually found out about his sexuality.
The two-fold Olympic bronze medalist has become a highly profiled advocate for HBT rights and has taken advantage of his appearance at the Commonwealth Games in Australia in order to convince more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said he took the floor because he felt he had the trip to live open without limits and wanted to give others "hop".
The three-fold world champion said his love in a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "come as a surprise".
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscars winner last year, but he said the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you go through so much in such a young age" - he participated in his first OS as a 14-year-old and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was difficult to find someone at the same age with similar life experience.
The couple became parents in June to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his "whole perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it was just about making gold," he said.
"But you know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My gold medal is Robbie."
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that Dad did not accept that he would die and one of the last things he had asked about whether they got their tickets to the 2012 London Olympics - where he wanted to sit on the first row.
"I couldn't tell him: you won't be able to sit on the front row of Dad," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it was not until he actually stopped breathing and he was dead as I finally recognized that he was not invincible," he said.
The year after that, Daley competed at OS 2012 and won bronze.
"I only knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life - to appear before a home audience on an Olympic arena, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first song - Proud by Heather Small - a song that had followed him up to OS and that still gave him rhymes.

Mickelson from the shape of the bench during Saturday's Ryder Cup
The American Phil Mickelson will hit the record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but then he has to fix the form to avoid an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who played for the 12th time in a row, was founded by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being in the center of events, which he has often been for the United States, the five-time winner spent his day between acting hejaklock and practicing his game in hopes of having a chance to demonstrate his ability.
He has never been the busiest of drivers, not even at the top of his career, and the 48-year-old is not in shape in front of the tough track on Le Golf National, where the long run often misses punishment.
It's not just the path that scares, in the ninth match on Sunday, Mickelson meets Master Francesco Molinari, who won all four matches this week along with the novel Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans, who are 4 points below the front of the 12 single games have taken place at the start, the Mickelson match can be absolutely crucial.
Fury expressed confidence for his player, not because he could say much more.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a kick on my back and put his arm around me and said that he would be ready tomorrow," Fury said.
"His self-confidence is not wrong.
He is a celebrity and he has added so much to these laws during previous seasons and last week.
I probably didn't think he'd be able to play two games.
I thought he was going to do more, but now it's what it is and we're going to enjoy it.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else."
On Sunday, Mickelson Nick Faldo's record passes for most Ryder Cup matches played.
It can mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that never fully lived up to the heights in its individual results.
Mickelson has 18 winners, 20 losses and seven-halfs, but Furyk said his presence brought other qualities to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, mercury, he likes to joke with people and he's a good guy to have in the team," he explained.
"I also think that the younger players thought it was fun to play against him this week, which was fun to see.
He adds so much more than just games."
Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the great leadership can soon be a memory just
Thomas Bjorn, the European Captain, knows from experience that a significant lead in the last few days of Ryder Cup can quickly turn into an unpleasant experience.
Dane did his debut in 1997 at Valderrama, where a team under the direction of Seven Ballestero held a five-point advantage over the Americans but who finally won with the lowest possible margin with the result 1411⁄2-131.2.
"It reminds you that we led big on Valderrama, we led big on Brooklyn where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won with urgency and nerve," said Bjorn (on the photo) after seeing the 2018 class win 5-3 both on Friday and yesterday and leads with 10-6 on Le Golf National.
So the story will prove to me and everyone in the team that this isn't over.
Tomorrow we'll give everything.
Go out and do everything right.
This is not over until we see the point on the table.
Our goal is to try to win this pod and that's where our focus is.
I have said it all the time, I focus on the 12 players that are on our side, but we are well aware of what lies ahead on the other side - the best players in the world."
Björn was pleased with the performance of his players on a tough golf course and allowed: "I would never be able to do this myself.
Tomorrow, new challenges await us.
Tomorrow it is the individual performances that apply and it is a completely different thing.
It's fun to be out with a partner when it's good, but when you're out there on your own, your capacity as golf players is tested out.
It is the message you need to convey to the players, to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind you and he must also go and get the best out of himself."
Unlike Björn, the opponent Jim Furyk will want the players to perform better individually than they did as partners, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who fought at home three points of four.
Furyk himself has been on both sides of major turns during the last days of a competition, both in the winning team in Brooklyn before he ended up as a loser when Europe was driving "Miracle at Medina".
"I remember every fucking word of it," he said in reply when he was asked how Ben Crenshaw, captain 1999, had gathered his players before the last day.
"We have 12 major matches tomorrow, but you would like to go out as quickly as on Brooklyn, as on Medina.
When the tempo starts one way, there will be a lot of pressure on these intermediates.
We did our setup and placed the guys that we wanted to, you know, create some magic tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned to try to lead the fight and meet Rory McIlroy in the top game, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter meet the other Europeans in the upper half of the regime.
"I went with this group of guys in this arrangement because I think it's enough," said Bjorn about his single election.
Germany’s new warships are being relaunched
The German fleet's latest cargo would have been set up in 2014 to replace warships from the cold time of war, but it will not be set up until at least next year due to incorrect systems and high costs, reported local media.
The launch of "Reinland-Pfalz", the flagship of the entirely new Baden-Wuerttemberg fleets, has now been launched until the first half of 2019, according to the Die Zeit newspaper, which quotes a military speaker.
The ship should have joined the fleet by 2014, but the problems that arose after delivery were detrimental to the ambitious project.
The four boats in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class that the fleet ordered in 2007 will replace the old Bremen freighters.
They will contain a powerful cannon, a series of air and maritime missiles, as well as certain techniques such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signature.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to station the latest cargoes for up to two years without contact with home ports.
However, continuous delays mean that the rail-breaking warships - which allow Germany to design power abroad - are already obsolete when they are in operation, Die Zeit writes.
The fateful F125 fleet created headlines last year, when the German fleet officially refused to put the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the fleet returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the causes of the return, but German media reported a number of important "software and hardware warships" that made the warship valueless if used on a war mission.
The lack of software was particularly important as ships in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be driven by a crew of about 120 sailors - only half the crew of older freighters in the Bremen class.
It also showed that the ship has a significant overweight, which leads to a deterioration of performance and limits the marine’s ability to carry out future upgrades.
The 7 000 tonnes of heavy "Rheinland-Pfalz" is assumed to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans during World War II.
Apart from faulty hardware, the entire project's price gap - including the training of the crew - becomes a problem.
It is said to have amounted to EUR 3.1 billion (US$ 3.6 billion) - compared to EUR 2.2 billion at the start.
Problems affecting the latest freight will become particularly important in the light of the latest warnings that Germany's maritime power will decrease.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, acknowledged that the fleet actually "starts to lack fully equipped vessels".
The officer said it was a growing problem, since old ships were being dismantled but no replacement ships were provided.
He complained that none of the frigates in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the Navy.
National Trust Listens to the Secret Life of the Footwear
New research carried out on a property in the Scottish highlands is aimed at revealing how flat möss uses the landscape in its hunt for food.
We hope that the results will shed new light on the behavior of unique flying mammals and contribute to the management of future conservation activities.
The study, carried out by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland, will follow the southern and western pipstrill as well as the brown long-lined and Daubenton plainmöss at Inverewe Gardens in Western Ross.
Special players will be placed in important places around the property to track fieldmus activities throughout the season.
NHS personnel and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
Expert noise analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of field mouse sounds and what species do what.
A life map and report will then be produced to create a detailed area image of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, NTS Nature Care Advisor, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of life are most important to the soil and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of life-environmental management work such as the creation of agas and how best to maintain forest areas for wild moss and other related species.
Flemish mus population in Scotland and the United Kingdom has decreased significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by building and development work that affects the well-being and loss of living environments.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, such as aircraft and certain chemical treatments of construction materials and attacks from household taxes.
Flanders are actually not blind.
But because of their nightly hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching the prey.
They use sophisticated eco-location technology to find insects and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes flat möss seriously.
The organisation has ten trained experts, who regularly carry out investigations, examine the benefits and sometimes perform rescue operations.
The organisation has also established Scotland's first and only dedicated flatdermus reserve at Thrave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten flatdermus.
Owner David Thompson says that property is the ideal area for them.
"Here at Thrave we have a good area for foot-and-mouth," he said.
"We have the old buildings, lots of vets and a lot of beneficial living environments.
But there is a lot about bats that are still unknown, so the work we do here and on other property helps us to understand more about what they need to thrive.
He stresses the importance of looking for flat moustache before performing maintenance in properties, since it is possible that accidental destruction of a single dwelling could kill up to 400 honors and young people, and possibly rob an entire population.
Flemishness is peaceful and it is illegal to kill, trouble or disturb them or destroy their possessions.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish Officer for Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and too many of our species we don't know how their populations are."
Ronaldo rejects violence while his lawyers threaten to vote for the German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the charges of violence against him for "false news" and says that people "want to market themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers will vote in favour of the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the claims.
Portugal and Juventus forward have been accused of having raped an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, at a hotel in Las Vegas 2009.
He claims to have paid her $375.000 to keep quiet about the event, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In a live video on Instagram, Ronaldo (33) beat himself with the reports as "false news" when he spoke to his 142 million followers, only hours after the requirements were reported.
"Not the least.
What they said today was false news," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
"They want to market themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be known by using my name, but it's part of the job.
I am a happy man and everything good," said the player and log.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to vote in favour of Der Spiegel's claims, which they have called "an unauthorised reporting of suspicions of integrity", according to Reuters.
Advocate Christian Schertz said that the player would seek compensation for "moral damage to an amount corresponding to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged event is said to have taken place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub Ronaldo and Mayorga went back to the player's room, where he was supposed to have raped her anal, according to documents submitted by Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was "99 percent" a "good guy" the failure of the "last percentage".
According to the document, Ronaldo had confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was in agreement.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and took photographs of her injuries in a hospital, but later agreed on a reconciliation because she felt "fear for revenge" and was concerned about "being humiliated publicly".
The 34th year says that she is now trying to cancel the reconciliation because she continues to be traumatized by the alleged event.
Ronaldo was about to join the Royal Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and last summer he moved to the Italian giant Juve in an agreement of EUR 100 million.
Brexit: United Kingdom "comes forever regret" to lose car manufacturers
UK "should regret it forever" if you lost your status as world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, Business Minister Greg Clark said.
He allowed it to be "inconvenient" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, they would temporarily stop production at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer reported that the effects of delays at the border in the event of no agreement being concluded could result in lost jobs.
The Burnaston factory, which manufactures Toyota's Auris and Avensis, produced almost 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the EU.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see the production stop in our factory," says Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota at Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers have communicated their concern about leaving the EU without agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its mini-installation in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main problems concern what car manufacturers say are risks to the supply chain in the event of a Brexit without resolution.
Toyota's production line is operated on a "just-in-time" basis, with parts that will come every 37th minute from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars ordered.
If Britain leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, it can lead to disturbances at the border as the industry says it can lead to delays and lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's consumption in stock at its Derbyshire factory, the company said, and hence the production would be forced to stop.
Clark said theresa May's Chequer's plan for future relations with the EU is "exactly calibrated to avoid border checks".
"We need a settlement. We want the best agreement that enables, as I say, not only success at present to be appreciated now, but for us to take this opportunity." he told BBC Radio 4:'s program Today.
"The wording of not only Toyota but other manufacturers is that we must be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supplier chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped, but in the longer term warned that increased costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and thus cost work.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the head of the Unite trade union at the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "My experience is that these jobs will never come back.
One government official said: "We have put forward an accurate and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be delayed again," says the White House
Donald Trump's meeting with Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein could be "shooted for another week" while the fight against the Supreme Court appointed Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein is monitoring the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, relations between Trump and Russia and the President's potential obstacle to justice.
Whether Trump will fire the Deputy Minister of Justice, thereby endangering Mueller's independence, has fueled Washington's troops for months.
Earlier this month, New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of carrying hearing equipment to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of decommissioning the president via the 25th addendum of the American Constitution.
Rosenstein rejected the report.
But on Monday he went to the White House, and reported that he was going to leave.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump, who was then in the United Nations headquarters in New York, to be held on Thursday.
Trump said that he would "forward" not to kick Rosenstein, but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a conflict with the Senate's legal committee's hearing where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation of charges against Kavanaugh, which further delayed a full vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, spoke in Fox News on Sunday.
When she was asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "A date for it has not been fixed, it can happen this week, or a one-week postponement, taking into account all other matters that occur at the highest court.
But we will see, and I always like to keep the press up to date."
Some reporters would argue that claim: Sanders has not had a press conference from the White House since 10 September.
The value of Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the lack of press conferences was not due to any objection to TV reporters who "played for the gallery", even though she said, "I agree with the fact that they play for the gallery."
She then said that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The President holds several questions than any president before him," she said, and allowed without quoting the evidence: "We have looked at these figures."
Conferences will still take place, Sanders said, but "if the press gets the chance to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, it is infinitely much better than talking to me.
We are trying to do this often and you have seen us do a lot over the last few weeks and it will replace press conferences, and then you can ask questions directly to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Solo press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why, with spontaneous statements and sometimes bizarre performances in front of the gathered reporters.
Minister of Health writes to EU employees at NHS Scotland taking into account Brexit's concerns
The Minister of Health has written to EU staff working in Scotland's NHS to express the country's gratitude and wish to stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter less than six months before Britain withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to covering the cost of settled status applications for EU citizens working in the country's decentralised public sector.
In the letter, Freeman wrote: "In the summer negotiations between Britain and the EU continue to take place, in the face of decisions expected to come in the autumn.
However, the British Government has also intensified its preparations for a possible scenario without agreement.
I know that this must be a very worrying time for all of you.
That is why I would like to repeat how much I value every employee's effort, regardless of nationality.
Members of the European Union, and the rest of the world, provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the health care work and benefit the patients and societies we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christian Abercrombie undergoes acute surgery after suffering from head injury
Tennessee State Tiger's lineback Christian Abercrombie underwent an acute operation after having suffered a major injury in Saturday's loss of 31-27 against Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee's Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State Chief Coach Rod Reed told reporters that the damage occurred immediately before half an hour ago.
"He came to the sideline and just collapsed," Reed said.
Trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie acid on the side line before placing it on a bar was carried out for further evaluation.
A representative from Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie was operated at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris allowed "there is no information on the type/intent of the damage yet" and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie, a redshirt second year student, is in her first season with Tennessee State after a transfer from Illinois.
He had a total of five rounds on Saturday before leaving the match, which gave him a season total of 18 rounds.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp tax when they buy a property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers may pay higher stamp tax when buying property in the United Kingdom, and the extra money is used to help homeless people, according to Tory's new plans
The measure should neutralise Corby's success by attracting young voters
The increase in stamp tax will apply to those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The UK Department of Finance estimates that up to 120 million pounds a year to help homeless people
Foreign buyers will be paid a higher stamp tax when they buy property in the United Kingdom. The extra money will be used to help homeless people, which will be announced by Prime Minister Theresa May today.
The action will be seen as an attempt to neutralise Jeremy Corby's success by attracting young voters with promises of more affordable housing and targeting high-income people.
The increase in stamp tax will be taken out of individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
The additional fee is in addition to the current stamp tax, including the higher levels introduced two years ago in holiday homes and homes purchased for rent. It may amount to up to three per cent.
The Ministry of Finance believes that the measure will amount to 120 million pounds per year.
estimated 13% of the newly built properties in London are purchased by people living outside the UK. This increases prices and makes it more difficult for first-time buyers to get a foot on the housing market.
Many well-off areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become ghost cities because of the high number of foreign buyers spending most of their time abroad.
The new game will only come a few weeks after Boris Johnson requested a reduction in the stamp tax to help more young people buy their first apartment.
He accused large construction companies of keeping prices up by buying up land without using it, and urged Theresa May to refrain from allowances on housing with affordable prices to solve the "poor housing situation" of the United Kingdom.
Jeremy Corbyn has launched an exciting enough proposal for housing reforms, including rental and an end to rentals without the fault of the tenant.
He also wants to give municipalities more opportunities to build new dwellings.
Theresa May says: "Last year I said that I would devote my time as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream, that life would be better for every new generation.
This means solving the problems on the housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
But it cannot stand when it is as easy for people who do not live in the United Kingdom, and also for companies based abroad, to buy dwellings as hard-working residents in our country.
The dream of owning his home has become too many people just a distant dream, and homelessness is still an unworthy fact."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to train Scotland"
Sunderland leader Jack Ross says his "final goal" is to ever become Scotland's coach.
The 42-year-old Scotch looks forward to the challenge of blowing up life in the club from northeastern England, which is currently in third place in League One, three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light in the summer after taking St. Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I played a match in the B country team and that's all," Ross says to BBC Scotland's Sport Sound.
"But when I grew up, I looked a lot at Scotland at the Hampden with my dad, and it has always drawn me back.
But that chance can only come if I succeed in leading a club."
Among Ross's trainers are Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former leader of Alloa Athletic says he wasn't worried about succeeding so established names in such a big club. He's previously thanks no to Barnsley and Ipswich Town offers.
"Just now I'm judging success from the answer to the question 'Can I get this club back to Premier League?'
This club is absolutely home to Premier League, considering its structure and talents," he says.
"It's not easy to get there, but I'd probably just see myself as successful here if I could get the club back there."
Ross has only been a coach for three years, after a period as an assistant coach in Dumbarton and a 15-month vacation as a member of Heart's training team.
Then he helped Alloa to return from the move to the third division, and lifted St. Mirren from being close to the move to become the winner of the season's championship title.
Ross says he is more satisfied now than ever during his career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a reason," he recalls and aims at when he took command of Alloa.
"I really thought leadership was absolutely right for me, in a completely different way than playing.
It sounds strange, because I had good results and could live on it, and I had some great success.
But playing can be tough.
There's a lot to go through every week.
It's still stress and pressure on my job, but training feels right.
I've always wanted to practice and now I'm doing it. I feel better than I've ever done in my adult life."

A study shows that the perfect time to take a beer is 17:30 on a Saturday
The summer's heat cover has generated increased revenue for the country's fighting pubs, but the restaurant chains have got more pressure on themselves.
The figures showed that pub and bar groups increased sales by 2.7% in July, but the revenues of restaurants decreased by 4.8%.
Peter Martin of the CGA corporate consulting company, which has compiled the figures, said: "Continued beautiful weather and the fact that England remained in VM longer than expected meant that we saw a similar pattern in July compared to June, when the public went up by 2.8%.
The decrease in the turnover of restaurants by 1.8% in June was only worse in July.
Pubars and bars that mainly offer drinks showed the absolute best result with figures for the same period last year that had gone up more than the restaurants had gone down.
Pubars offering food were also difficult in the beautiful weather, even though it was not as dramatic as for restaurant owners.
People seem to have just wanted to go out and drink something.
The output of managed pubs and bars went up by 6,6 % that month, and the food sales down by 3 %."
Paul Newman of the service and entertainment industry analyst RSM says: "These results are a continuation of the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and major sporting events are still the most important factors for sales on the wholesale kitchen market.
It is no surprise that restaurant groups still have difficulties, even though a reduction in sales of 4.8 % each year is particularly difficult to deal with in addition to the current cost pressure.
The long warm summer could not have come any more uncomfortable for businesses driven by food sales. Time can show whether the more moderate temperatures we have had in August give any needed respect."
The total sales increase in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened facilities, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the fact that fewer new brands are now being launched.
Industry sales monitor Coffer Peach Tracker for the pub and restaurant industry in the United Kingdom collects and analyzes information on how 47 active groups with a total turnover of over 9 billion pounds, and is an established benchmark in the industry.
One of five children has secret social media accounts they hide for their parents
A survey shows that one of the five children, sometimes as young as 11 years old, have secret accounts on social media that they hide for their parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 students in high school and high school shows an increase in the number of fake Instagram pages
The result has increased the concern that there is sexual content being put up there
20% of students reported having a "main account" they showed their parents
One of five children, some as young as 11 years of age, create social media accounts that they keep secret for adults.
A survey of 20,000 students in high school and high school showed a rapid increase in the number of "false Instagram", a reference to the Instagram image sharing service.
The result has caused concern that there is sexual content posted there.
20% of students reported that they have a clean "main account" that they can show to their parents, and that they also have private accounts.
A mother who snooped over her 13-year-old daughter's secret page found a teenager who urged others to "violent me."
According to the study carried out by the Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of Independent Schools, 40% of children aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted having private accounts.
HMC President Mike Buchanan says: "It is worrying that so many teenagers are attracted to creating places on the Internet where parents and teachers do not find them."
Elid Doyle will be "the voice of athletes" in the board of the Scottish Free Sport Association, Scottish Athletics
Elid Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletics Board as an external board member at the annual meeting of the Governing Body.
Doyle is Scotland's most prized free sport player, and President Ian Beattie describes the election as an excellent opportunity for those who are leading the sport to benefit from her wide international experience in the past decade.
"Eilid has gained great respect throughout the Scottish, British and international sports world, and we are sure that athletes in Scotland will benefit greatly from becoming a member of the board," Beattie says.
Doyle says, "I would like to be a voice for athletes and I hope that I can help and help lead sports in Scotland."
The American, who won 200 meters and 400 meters at OS in Atlanta 1996, has a total of four Olympic gold and is now an expert commentator on BBC. He lost his ability to go after a mini-stroke.
He writes on Twitter: "Today a month ago I got a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that it was time for me to recover, and to what extent.
It has been hard work, but I have recovered completely, learned to go again, and now I do mobility exercises!
Thank you for all the encouragement!"
Advertising for breast pumps compared to moms with whom the internet shares
A company that sells breast pumps has caused significant differences of opinion on the Internet with an ad that compares breast-feeding mothers with cows that are milked.
In order to pay attention to the launch of what is said to be "the world's first silent portable breast pump", consumer technology company Elvie released a music video-inspired advertising film with humouristic estimation to show on which freedom the new pump gives mothers pumping breast milk.
Four real moms dance in a crowded bed with choirs to a song with text lines like, "Yes, I'm milking myself, but I don't have any swings" and "If you didn't know, this is not a cheerleader, it's a joke."
The refrence continues: "pump out, pump out, feed the babies, pump out, pump out, milk the ladies."
But the advertising film, which has been published on the company's Facebook page, has caused Internet conflict.
The film has received 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, and has met mixed reactions from the viewers. Many say it sheds light on the "fashor" of the dairy industry.
"A very bad decision to use cows to market this product.
Just as we have to get pregnant and feed to produce milk, their young people are taken away from them only a few days after birth," writes one person.

Another comments: "You understand that it is traumatic for both mother and child.
But of course, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can keep their children?"
Another added: "What reality-based advertising film."
Others defend the film, and a woman admits that she thinks the song is "hysterically fun."
"I think this is brilliant.
I'd have gotten one if I was still breast-feeding.
Pumping made me feel just like a cow.
The commercial is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
This is a brilliant product," says someone.
Another comments: "This is a funny advertising film that turns to moms who pump (usually at work or in the toilet) and feels like 'cossor'."
This is not a film that praises or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the film, the women reveal that they have all danced with the discreet pump stuck in their behavior.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the fact that many women pumping milk say they feel like cows.
But the Elvie pump is completely quiet, has no cables or pipes and can be worn discreetly in a nursing home, which gives women freedom to move, keep their babies and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balarin is co-owner and ECD at Mother, and she says: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between women pumping breast milk and milk, we wanted to shed light on breast pumping and the challenges with it, while at the same time showing in a entertaining and easily recognizable way what an incredible sense of freedom the new pump gives.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump creates headlines.
During London’s fashion week, a two-child mom appeared on the catwalk with clothes from designer Marta Jakubowski while she used the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent near the Texas border
The number of children deprived of their liberty has increased even though the number of persons crossing the border each month is relatively unchanged, partly due to the fact that the violent rhetoric and harsh policies introduced by the Trump government have made it more difficult to place the children in reference persons.
In the past, most referees themselves have been paperless immigrants, and fear to put their own chances of staying in the country at risk by declaring themselves willing to receive a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential reference persons and other adult members of the household would have to leave fingerprints and that the data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Immigration and Customs Authority, witnessed before the Congress that the Authority had arrested dozens of people who had applied to be referred to single minors.
The Authority subsequently confirmed that 70% of those arrested were not known to law enforcement authorities since then.
"Almost 80% of the persons who are either referred persons or family members of reference persons are illegal in the country, and a large part of them are criminal aliens.
So we continue to pursue these individuals," said Albence.
In order to handle children's affairs more quickly, officials have introduced new rules requiring some of them to be in court within one month after they were deprived of their liberty, rather than after 60 days, which used to be practical, according to the staff of the institutions.
Many of them are currently on video link rather than personally to bring their statement of legal status before an immigrant judge.
Those who are not considered entitled to protection shall be deported quickly.
The longer children are deprived of freedom the more likely it is that they are affected by anxiety or depression, which may lead to violent outbreaks or refugee attempts, according to the staff at the establishments and reports that have come from the system in recent months.
Proponents say that anxiety rises at larger facilities such as Tornillo, where signs that a child is more likely to be ignored due to the size of the facility.
They add that if children are moved to the tent without having enough time to prepare emotionally and take good care of friends, they can aggravate the traumas many have already been broken.
Syria demands that American, French and Turkish "occupational forces" withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also urged Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that the war in the country is in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces are illegally on Syrian soil, under the pretext of combating terrorism, and "will be handled accordingly."
"They must retreat immediately and unconditionally," he said to the General Assembly.
Moualem stressed that "the war against terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have died since 2011, and millions have left their homes.
He said that the government of Damascus would continue to "fight this sacred battle until we have freed all Syrian territories" from both terrorist groups and "all illegal foreign presence".
The U.S. has some 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who primarily train and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in the war-torn country.
As for the refugees, Moualem said that the circumstances are good for them to come home, and accused "some Western countries" of "spreading irrational fear" that enables refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate their return," he said.
"They are politicizing something that should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The US and the EU have warned that there will be no help in rebuilding Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say that a fresh agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel Idlib has created an opportunity to move on with political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement disrupted a large-scale attack by Russian-supported Syrian troops against the province, which has three million inhabitants.
Moualem stressed, however, that the agreement had "significant deadlines", and expressed hope that a military intervention would be directed against jihadists, including warriors from the Al Qaida-connected Nusra Front, who would "be evicted".
The UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to be able to convene the first meetings of a new committee consisting of government members and members of the opposition, in order to make a draft post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set out the conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the committee and said that the work of the group would be limited to "review of the articles of the current Constitution", and warned of interference.
Why Donald Trump will win a re-election
With that logic, Donald Trump would win the re-election 2020 if his presidency did not end in the past through the rule of law and scandal, which many liberal viewers are likely to hope for.
In what would no doubt be "the most dramatic final of a presidency ever!"
At present, there are no signs that the viewers have grown tired.
Since 2014, the watch numbers at best transmission time have been more than doubled to 1.05 million at CNN, and are almost three times as high, 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at the best transmission time, which is an increase of 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has peaked the list of cable channels with as many as 3.5 million viewers during large news evenings.
"This is like a fire that people are drawn to, because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, who runs the show for ABC's "Designated Survival" drama, which is about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack has destroyed Capitolium.
Nell Scovell is a generous comedy author and has written "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club". She has another theory.
She remembers a taxi trip in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told me he would vote on Donald Trump.
Then why? She asked.
"He said, 'cause he makes me laugh'," Nell Scovell told me.
The chaos has a value of entertainment.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, Washington's report can determine the future of abortion law, Roe vs Wade, whether immigrant families can be reunited and the welfare of the global economy.
Closing is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
However, it goes beyond being an informed citizen when one has suddenly sat down and watched for six hours on an expert panel discussing Bob Woodward's use of "deep background sources" to his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's bomber jacket of strutslader for $15,000 ("a plague filled with hybrids", as Washington Post sa) and the meaning in Stormy Daniel's macabre descriptions of Donald Trumps, hm, anatomy.
I'll never look at Super Mario myself the same way again.
"A part of what he does that makes it feel like a reality series is that he comes with something every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", about Trump's rotating role crew and day-to-day intrigues (a lot of fun with NFL, praised Kim Jong-un).
If you miss a single section, you'll be in the back.
When I spoke to the TV producer Mr. Fleiss this week it was sun and 27 degrees outside his house on the northern Kauai in Hawaii, but he sat down and knocked in the house and looked at MSNBC at the same time as he recorded a broadcast from CNN.
He could not get tired, not when Brett Kavanaugh was to be brought before the Senate's Justice Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was in the wake of the wake.
"I remember when we did all those crazy programs in the past and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," Mr. Fleiss said to me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right."

Money from currents into the evenest race ever before the mid-year elections
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania 17th Congressional District receives a lot of money. It is thanks to the restructuring of a Congressional District that has made two members compete for the same place.
This recently bordered district of Pittsburgh is represented by the Democrat Conor Lamb, who took his place in another district at a special election last spring.
Lamb is campaigning against another member, the Republican Keith Rothfus. He is currently representing the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps the new 17th district.
The maps were rewritten after Pennsylvania’s Supreme Court in January decided that the old districts were constitutionally changed to the benefit of the Republics.
The coup d'état in the new 17th district has led to a campaign financing dispute between the major economic sections of the parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a known name in Pennsylvania after a brief victory in a wide-ranging special election in March to Pennsylvania 18th Congressional District.
That place had been held by a republic for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points.
Political experts had given the Democrats some impetus.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for China aid but then backed up
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognised Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
Donald Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the participants had won the troupe team.
Officials of the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs decided to call home the heads of the US missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of the "new decision to no longer recognise Taiwan", said Heather Naurut, the department’s spokesman, in a statement earlier this month.
However, only sanctions were planned against El Salvador, which received estimated $140 million in U.S. assistance 2017. The money would go to drug control and development and constitute financial support.
The proposed sanctions, including reduced financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have hit the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder statistics.
At the same time as the internal meetings continued, US and Central American officials launched a high-level conference focusing on security and economic well-being to follow up a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step in the right direction to prevent migrants from moving to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior officials within the administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, which in practice put an end to the considerations of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence will now speak at the conference, which will take place in mid-October.
And the three American envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new hard messages or punishments from Washington.
A spokesperson for John Bolton from the White House refused to comment on the details of the debate, which were described by the three American officials, two of whom were diplomats, who took part in discussing the internal debates against the promise of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an extensive analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke anonymously.
Study history
The next inevitable step could be the Special Investigator Robert Mueller's report on Donald Trump's alleged violations in the case, as there is now considerable evidence in public registers.
Mueller is also reported to direct his investigation into whether Donald Trump's campaign collaborated with Russia in its attack on the US election.
If the congress were to change the majority, Trump would be held accountable to that congregation just as he prepares to once again stand up for the election, and perhaps finally before a civil jury.
There are many uncertain factors in this, and I do not want to say that Trump will inevitably fall, nor will his colleagues in Europe.
We all have to meet different choices, on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how the withdrawal of the fight can be.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup against Hitler, if only the western countries had stood against him and stood behind the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and we missed an opportunity to avoid the years of bloodbath that followed.
History revolves around such crucial events, and the unnecessary march of democracy is speeding up either on or off.
Americans are now facing several of these crucial events.
What should we do if Donald Trump gives the assistant Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls what's going to happen to Mueller's investigation, fired?
Rosenstein has been in trouble ever since this paper reported that he should have proposed to record the president in secret last year, and speculated that he would not be fit for the office.
Rosenstein says The Times reporting is wrong.
"How should we respond if the recently requested FBI study of Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unjust, or if he is allowed to access the Supreme Court in spite of credible allegations of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And above all, are we going to vote in the middle of the year at a convention that holds Donald Trump responsible?
If we fail in these trials, democracy stands before a dark period.
But I don't think we're going to fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech-Slovenian Jew and was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazistregim who once occupied my embassy residence.
She survived, immigrated to the United States, and 60 years later she sent me on the way to light the Sabbath light on the table decorated with the hacker.
With that as an inheritance, how could I be anything but optimistic about the future?"

Graham Dorrans in Rangers is optimistic in front of the Rapid Wien meeting
Rangers receive Rapid Wien on Thursday. They know that they are winning the Austrians after the impressive Spanish match against Villareal that ended undecided earlier this month will put them in a strong position to qualify from Group G of Europe League.
One kneecrowd prevented the midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance for the season, until the 2-2-match against Villareal. But he thinks Rangers can use the result as a springboard against greater success.
"It was a good point for us, because Villareal is a good team," says the 31st.
"We went into the game in faith that we could get something, and went from there with a point.
We might have gotten it in the end, but in the big deal, it was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half. We came back in the second half and it was the best team.
On Thursday it will be an important evening in Europe again.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it will be a tough match. They got a good result at their last match, but if we have the audience with us we can certainly get ahead and get a good result.
Last year was very hard, with everything that happened to my injuries and changes in the club, but now we have a good feeling.
The troops are good and the guys are fun, the training is good.
Hopefully we can move forward now, put the last season behind us and succeed."
Women sleep poorly because of fear of pensions savings
Although the participants in the survey had a clear picture of how they wanted to be treated, few spoke to their family members about it.
About half of those who participated in the countrywide study said that they had talked to their husbands about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% said they had talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't get up and talk about it," said Holly Snyder, Vice-President of Life Insurance at Nationalwide.
This is how you can start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to care if you don’t talk about how you want it in good time.
Work with your advisor and your family and discuss where and how you want to care. Your choices can be of great importance to the costs.
Get help from your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for the costs.
Your choice of long-term care financing may include a traditional long-term care insurance solution, a hybrid life-insurance solution with cash to cover the costs, or self-insurance with your own resources, if you have advice.
Establish legal documents: Avoid legal disputes from the beginning.
Create a care agent so that you can select a trusted person who will look after your medical care and ensure that your healthcare staff will follow your wishes if you become unable to communicate.
Consider also a mandate for your economy.
You then choose a trusted person who can make economic decisions instead and make sure that your bills are paid if you are unable.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that you have an elderly parent who is in an emergency medical condition and is on her way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write down such details so you're ready.
"It's not just the economy that's at stake, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What kind of medicine is that?
Who's taking care of the dog?
Make sure the plan is ready."
Shooted several times with air rifles in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with a gun when he walked home from one evening.
The victim, who is in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe in Devon when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
The police describe the shooting, which took place about 02:30, as a "single event".
The victim didn't see his attacker.
The damage is not life-threatening, and the police call the witnesses to hear from themselves.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the city of Palu in Indonesia on Friday.
The communications are off, and rescue personnel have not yet been able to obtain any information from the Donghala management area, a region north of Palu, which is close to the epicenter of the earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu after the disaster.
Here are some facts about Palu and Dongala, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Centrala Sulawesi province and is located in a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi. The city's population was estimated to be 379 800 people in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit.
Donghala is a management area that extends more than 300 km from the northwest coast of Sulawesis.
The administrative area, which is an administrative region under a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
The pillars of Centrala Sulawesis's economy are fisheries and agriculture.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the past hundred years, according to the Indonesian disaster management authority.
In 1938 more than 200 people were killed by a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongala.
Even in 1996, West Dongala was hit by a tsunami that killed nine people.
Indonesia is located in the circulatory seismic fire, which is often hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian Aceh Province in northern Sumatra on 26 December triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries. 226,000 people, however, along the coasts of the Indian Ocean. More than half of them were in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of magnitude 6.8 on the Richter scale struck the south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, and triggered a tsunami that struck the southern coast and killed almost 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of magnitude 7.6 struck near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1 100 people died.
2010: An earthquake of magnitude 7.5 struck one of the Mentawai islands outside Sumatra. A tsunami of up to ten meters was triggered. Thousands of villages were destroyed and about 300 people were killed.
2016: One reason for the earthquake hit the management area of Pidie Jaya in Aceh and caused destruction and panic, as people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly earthquake and tsunami 2004.
This time no tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 people were killed by destroyed buildings.
2018: Great earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island Lombok. More than 500 people died, most of them on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists were temporarily beached.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former Alaska governor and vice-president Sarah Palin, has been arrested for abuse.
Palin, who is 29 years old and from Wasilla in Alaska, was arrested suspected of domestic violence, for having submitted a report on domestic violence and for having opposed the arrest, according to a report released on Saturday by the Alaska National Police.
According to the police report, he should have picked up the phone from a woman who tried to call the police and report the alleged crimes.
Palin sits freely in the Mat-Su fence and is held against the $500 debt to be paid if the suspect breaks the terms of the debt, according to the TV channel KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday and declared himself "guaranteeed not guilty" when he was asked to give up his position, according to the TV channel.
Palin is suspected of three cases of minor offences under Class A, which means that he can be imprisoned for up to a year and $250,000 in fines.
He has also been charged with a case of less serious B crime, punishing one day in prison and $2,000 in fines.
It's not the first time Palin's been charged with a crime.
In December 2017 he was charged with violence against his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged crime.
The case is now handled by Alaska's Veterans Chair.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, for reporting domestic violence and for holding arms under the influence of that incident.
His girlfriend accuses him of beating her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans in 2016 after she had linked her son’s violent behavior to post-traumatic stress syndrome, resulting from his military service in Iraq.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia on Friday.
The earthquake, measuring 7.5 on the Richter scale, triggered a tsunami and destroyed hundreds of homes.
Electricity and communications are down, and death figures are expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake struck right outside the central Sulawesi, north-east of the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta.
Films that show when it hit are now circulating on social media.
Hundreds of people had gathered to a beach festival in the city of Palu when Tsunamin crossed the coast.
Federal prosecutors report a rare death penalty for a terrorist attack suspect in New York City
Federal Prosecutor of New York is calling for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people. It is a rare punishment that has not been committed for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is supposed to have used a rental car from the building and interior chain Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bicycle road along the West Side Highway on the lower Manhattan. He threw down pedestrians and cyclists in his path at the attack, which took place in October.
In order to justify a death sentence, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov "willfully" killed the eight victims and "willfully" caused serious bodily harm, according to the death penalty declaration filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both charges may constitute a death sentence, according to the case-law.
Several weeks after the attack, Saipov was accused by a federal jury of 22 points, including eight cases of murder to support defence activities, often used by federal prosecutors for organised crime, as well as abuse and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack demanded "wide planning and willful", the prosecutors said, while describing the way Saipov carried it out as "disgusting, cruel and inhuman".
Sayfull Habibullaevic Saipov has caused family and friends to Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco damage and loss," says the statement of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
New York's South District has not been charged with a death penalty for a decade.
The accused Khalid Barnes was murdered by two drug addicts, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York in 1953. The married couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being sentenced to imprisonment for espionage to the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenberg couple were both executed in the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, a Uzbek citizen, showed a lack of remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to the court documents.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he was satisfied with what he had done.
According to the trial, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired by the attack after watching IS films on his phone.
He also asked for the IS flag to be set up in his hospital room, the police reported.
He has not declared himself guilty of the 22 charges.
David Patton is one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov. He stated that they are "of course disappointed" in the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to invoke the death penalty instead of going to life imprisonment without the possibility of conditional release if the accused confesses to himself only prolongs the trauma caused by these events for all involved," Patton said.
Saipov's team of defenders had previously asked the prosecutors not to pursue a death penalty.
Mr Tories says that NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the army of the people" today during a protest at the Tories conference.
The former UKIP leader said that politicians must "know the heat" of the European skeptics when one of Theresa May's own parliamentarians suggested that he would lead the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative Member Peter Bone said at the Birmingham march that Britain "should have already left" if Nigel Farage had been Brexit Minister.
However, the challenge facing Theresa May in getting the deeply shared followers to be reconciled has been compounded by positive EU touring members who have joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is fighting to keep his compromise plan, the Chequers Agreement, alive during attacks by Brexit supporters, people who want to stay in the Union and the EU themselves.
Her allies have insisted that she should press and try to get an agreement with Brussels despite the backdrop, and force EU skeptics and Labour Party to choose between her package solution and "caustics".
Bone said at a mass meeting organized by the organization Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted to "spola Chequers Agreement".
He indicated that Nigel Farage should have been made equal and given responsibilities in the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had stood at the wheel, we would have been at this team," he said.
Peter Bone, who represents the Wellingborough District in Parliament, said, "I will stand up for Brexit, but we have to split the Chequers Agreement."
He explained his opposition to the EU and said: "We have not fought the world war to become a subject.
We want to establish our own laws in our own country."
Bone rejected the claims that the public opinion would have changed since the referendum 2016: "The idea that the British would have changed and now want to stay is totally unconcerned."
Brexitan Hanger Andrea Jenkins from the Tory Party was also on the march and spoke to the journalists. "I just want to say, 'The Prime Minister, listen to the people.'
The Chequers agreement is unpopular in the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular in the party and in our voters who are out in the streets and make sure that we are elected.
Put off the Chequers deal and start listening."
And she allowed a sharp message addressed to Theresa May: "Ministers are allowed to keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Nigel Farage said at the meeting that politicians must "know the heat" if they would fail the decision taken in and with the referendum 2016.
"Now it's about trust between us, that is, the people, and the political class," he said.
"They're trying to cheat Brexit, and we're here today to say to them, 'We're not going to let you get away with it.'
In front of the enthusiastic crowd he allowed: "I want you to have our political class, which is close to betray Brexit, to feel the heat.
We mobilize the people's army in this country that gave us victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until we have become an independent, self-government and proud Great Britain."
At the same time, EU supporters marched through Birmingham and then held a two-hour mass meeting in the central city.
A group of activists fanned with trails with the text "Torymemmen v. Brexit" after the group was launched this weekend.
The Labour Parliamentarian Lord Adonis of the Overhouse founded the conservatives for the security problems they supported with a party when the conference opened.
"It is these people who say they can have on-the-spot IT systems and all the technology for Canada plus plus the agreement, for free-of-frequent frontiers and free-trade in Ireland," he said.
"It's a pure father.
There's no good Brexit," he said.
Warren plans a "ordinary thinker" to run for the president's office
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she's going to take a "ordinary thinker to run for the president's office" after the November election.
The Boston Globe newspaper reports that the Democrats from Massachusetts spoke about their future during a cityhouse meeting in Western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren has often criticised President Donald Trump, and is now renouncing Republican State Representative Geoff Diehl, who was the assistant president of the Donald Trump campaign in Massachusetts 2016.
She has been subject to speculation that she may be taking off Donald Trump 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting of the city hall with the electors since Donald Trump arrived.
Someone asked her if she was planning to run for the president's office.
Warren replied that it's time for women to go to Washington to repair our terrible government.
A person arrested for shooting the basketball player Sims from LSU
The Baton Rouge police in Louisiana announced on Saturday that a suspect had been arrested for shooting the LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police announced that Dyteon Simpson, 20, had been arrested at a press conference at 11:00 for ET.
They had released a film of the shooting on Friday to help identify a man who sees the images.
Twenty-year-old Sims was shot to death near the Southern University campus early on Friday.
"Wayde Sims got shot in the head and eventually died of this," said police chief Murphy J. Paul to the media on Saturday via the news site 247 sports.
Wayde went in the middle to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he had been on the scene and had a gun, and he admitted that he had shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without any incidents and taken to the police station in East Baton Rouge.
Sims was a junior player, 198 cm long and grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 games with 10 starting last season, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 returns per match.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world champion title after teammurder gave him a win over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that Mercedes' teams would play a major role in the race.
Bottas had a good start and almost hung Hamilton on the dry ground when he defended his position during the first two waves, and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went in first and let Hamilton drive into the back of the shed, which should have been crucial.
The Mercedes went on a ship later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton went forward after a bit of wheel-mot-wheel action where the Ferrari-driver reluctantly left the inside free with risk to offer in place after a double step to defend himself in the third curve.
Max Versteppen started in the back row and was seven at the end of the first ship on his 21-year-old day.
He then led a large part of the race and held on to the deck to reach a quick target and run over Kimi Raikkonen and become four.
Finally, he came to the bottom of the 44th ship but failed to raise the pace during the remaining eight ships when the Raikkonen went up in fourth place.
It's a hard day, because Valteri did a great job all week and was a real gentleman who walked by me.
The team has done an exceptional job and received one and two," Hamilton said.
Very bad body language
President Donald Trump accused Senator Dianne Feinstein at a mass meeting on Saturday, because she maintains that she has not leaked the letter from Christine Blasey Ford in which Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated judge of the Supreme Court, is charged with sexual abuse.
The president, who spoke at a mass meeting in West Virginia, did not bring up the testimony from Ford directly before the Senate's Justice Committee. Instead, he commented that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "bad, unscrupulous and false."
"The only thing that could happen and the good things that have happened in the last days in the Senate, when you see evil, when you see people who are angry, angry, unseeing and lying," he said.
"You see the press messages and leaks and then they say, 'No, I haven't.
I haven't done it.'
Do you remember?
Have you lost your mind, Diane Feinstein?
Do you remember her answer? 'Have you leaked the document?' 'Oh, what?'
Oh, no.
I haven't missed it.'
Wait a minute.
'Have we leaked... no, we haven't leaked anything'', he allowed, and imitated the senator.
The letter with details about Ford's charges against Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein in July, and leaked in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak would have come from her office.
"I haven't obscured Ford's accusations, I haven't missed her story," Feinstein told the committee according to The Hill.
"She asked me to keep this confidential, and I kept it confidential, as she wished."
But her dementia does not seem to have happened to the president, who, during the Saturday evening's meeting, commented: "I will tell you one thing: that was really bad body language.
She may not have, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The President continues to support the candidate to the Supreme Court, who has been charged with three women's sexual offences, and he indicated that the Democrats used the charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain power by all necessary means.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control," said the president, according to the digital news site Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars-Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer made two goals for Belfast Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars played Friday's loss in Elite League against Belfast Giants by winning the return match with 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
Belfast Giants received an early two-way lead through Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie headed for the home team before Dwyer re-established Belfast Giants.
Francois Bouchard wrote for Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen won the victory.
It was the third loss in Elite League for the Adam Keefs season, which came from behind and beat Dundee with 2-1 in Belfast on Friday evening.
It was the fourth meeting of the season for the two laws, and Belfast Giants had won the three previous matches.
Dwyer's opening target came in the fourth minute at 3:35 on assistance from Kendall McFaull, and David Rutherford gave assistance when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In the intensive first period, Sullivan brought home to match at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt delivered to Cownie who wrote at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that Belfast Giants was in charge at the first break when he made his second goal for the evening at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard cheered again with a goal in power play at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran cooperated to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the match at the end of the second period, and he secured the win with his team's fifth half-way through the final period.
Belfast Giants, who have now lost four of their last five matches, will play home against Milton Keynes at his next match on Friday.
Aeroplanes died so that hundreds of people on a plane could flee from earthquakes
A pilot in Indonesia is now hailed as a hero after he was born when he made sure that a plane with hundreds of people on board could lift safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to plague the area, and many are stuck in the bust of the city of Palu.
However, despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post in the wildly waving check tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
He stayed to ensure that Batik Air's flight 6321, which was then on the runway, could lift safely.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought it was going to race.
He was born later in a hospital.
The spokesperson for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirat, said that the decision could have saved hundreds of people's lives, according to the Australian TV channel ABC News.
"We arranged with a helicopter from Balikpapan on Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
We're confused about hearing this," he said.
At the same time, the authorities maintain that the death rate can increase to more than a thousand people. The country's disaster relief authority says that access to the cities of Donganga, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The death rate is believed to continue to increase as there are still many bodies left in the ruins, and many have not been able to reach," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesperson for the Authority.
Up to six meters high waves have destroyed Palu, where a mass burial will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft fly in aid and supplies.
The 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma said to Sky News: "One minute comes an ambulance with dead bodies.
It's bad about clean water.
Mini markets are plundered everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is fighting to help survive, but we don't know what they're going to meet from there.
This is already a tragedy, but it may be much worse."
President Joko Widodo of Indonesia arrived at Palu on Sunday and said to the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" according to CNN.
Indonesia suffered earlier this year from earthquakes in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Aerial crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now states that a man is missing after an aircraft crashed in a lagoon
The airline responsible for the plane crashing into a lagoon in Micronesia in the Pacific Ocean now states that one man is missing. Previously it was said that all 47 passengers and crew had been evacuated from the sinking plane and were safe.
Air Niugini said in a press release that a male passenger was still missing on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it worked with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately answer the questions about more details about the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water when it tried to land at the airport at Chuuköna.
Officials reported on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers were staying at the hospital on Saturday and that their condition was stable.
It's still unclear what caused the crash and how the incident looked.
The airline and the U.S. fleet both reported that the plane landed in the lagoon without reaching the landing path.
Some Witnesses thought that the planet flew past the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane flew in very low.
"It's extremely good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and others were able to swim through deep water to the emergency exits on the sinking planet.
He said that the cabin staff panicked and screamed, and that he had a minor damage to his skull.
The U.S. fleet said that seamen working near the development of a ship’s shipyard also helped in the rescue work by using an inflatable boat to drive people in the land before the plane sank in the 30 - foot - deep water.
Data from Aviation Safety Network show that 111 people have died in accidents with airlines registered in Papua New Guinea in the last two years, but Air Niugini has not been involved in any of them.
Analysts draw up a timeline for the night when a woman burned alive
On Saturday, the Ålgagarside ended its fight in the second trial against a man accused of having burned a woman in Mississippi alive 2014.
Analyst Paul Rowlett of the U.S. Department of Justice spoke for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he had used mobile phone lists to puzzle the 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chamber's movements that night she died.
Rowlett said he had received location data from several mobile phones that showed that Telllis was with Chambers that night she died, which contradicted his earlier claims, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chamber's cell phone during the time he said he had been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked about Tellis telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lieving, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis stated that he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Mobile phone records showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that Tellis once after Chambers' death deleted Chambers' text messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He pulled her out of her life," said Hale.
The defence is scheduled to begin its conclusion on Sunday.
The judge said he was expecting the trial to be handed over to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is a conscious hippop?
A hippop-trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling his music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol believes that the hippo has come far away from its origin in political messages and to tackle social issues.
They want to go back to the roots and make a conscious hippop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently received a reinvigoration in Britain through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
A black one again?!
A child girl in New York agrees with a couple because of their rejection after a "racist" text message
A child girl in New York agrees to a couple of discriminatory dismissals after receiving a wrong text message from modern, who complained that she was "a black again".
The couple deny that they would be racist and compare the mood with "expression".
Two-child mother Lynsey Plasco-Faxman expressed fear when she realized that the new girl Giselle Maurice was black when she arrived at her first working day in 2016.
"NOEEEEEEEEEEEEEJ NOT A DIFFERENT ONE," Lynsey Plasco-Faxman wrote in a text to her husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Giselle Maurice, twice.
After she realized her mistake, Plasco-Faxman was "Ill to Ops", and Maurice fired, claiming that their former child girl, who was an African American, had done a bad job and that instead she was expecting a Filipino woman, according to New York Post.
Maurice got paid for one day's work and was sent home by taxi.
Now she agrees with the couple to get compensation for the dismissal, she asks for compensation under the $350 per day scheme for the job she was initially hired to do, which would be six months and where she would live with the couple.
"I want to show them that you don't do that," she said to New York Post on Friday. "I know it's discrimination."
The couple's noticing that they'd be racist and saying that the only reason was to end Giselle Maurice's employment, they were worried that they wouldn't be able to trust her when they had offended her.
"My wife had sent her something she didn't mean.
She's not racist.
We're not racist," said Joel Plasco to New York Post.
"But would you trust your children to someone you had been unconcerned about, even though it was a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
I'm serious."
Plasco compared the mood to "expression" and said that his wife would give birth to children two months later and was in a "very difficult situation".
"Are you going to give yourself to such a person?
It is not particularly pleasant," said investment banker Plasco.
The legal process is still ongoing, but the public opinion has quickly condemned the couple on social media and criticises them for their behaviour and reasoning.
The Paddington publishers didn't think readers could relate to a talking bear, revealing a new letter
Author Michael Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, commented: "It's hard to think about what it was like to read it for the first time before it was issued.
It is very fun, given what we now know about Paddington's great success."
She told her father, who had worked as a cameraman on BBC before he was inspired by a little toy bear to write the children's book, had been optimistic when his work was rejected. She allowed the 60th anniversary of the first edition to be "bitter love" after his death last year.
She describes Paddington as a "very important member of our family", and allowed her father to be proud of his final success.
"He was quite quiet of himself, and not a strange person," she said.
"But Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who succeeds in something. You become proud of the child even though it is not yourself who has achieved it.
I think he saw Paddington's successes a little like that.
Even though it was his creation and his fantasy he always used to give Paddington his own honor."
My daughter was going to die, and I got to say good-bye on the phone.
When she landed, her daughter had been taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors worked to save her life.
"Nade called regularly to say that it was really bad, and that you didn't expect her to succeed," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperous.
"Then I got a call from Nad who said that she would die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "I love you so much, Tashi, my dear.
I'll come to you soon.
I'm coming to you.
The doctors who had given her to keep her heart alive slowly poured out and left her body.
She had died right before, and now everything was gone.
I just got to sit there and wait and know that all this happened.
I couldn't cheer or scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to get together."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperous, who now suffered the loss of her daughter, went on board with the other passengers, who were completely unaware of the difficult test she was going through.
"No one knew about it," she said.
"I bowed my head, and the tears ran all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the flight I felt an overwhelming sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and my understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Grieving women set up road maps to prevent suicide on a bridge
Two women who have lost relatives because of suicide work to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have set up a bridge in Wales with inspiring messages and phone numbers that you can call to get support.
Sharon Davis' son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression, and he took his life when he was 18.
"I don't want any parents to need as bad as I do every day," she says.
Sharon Davis is 45 years old and lives in Lydney. She tells me her son was a promising cook who had a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew who he was because of his smile.
They said his smile lit up the room."
But he stopped working before he died because he was "in a very dark place."
Tyler's brother, then 11 years old, was the one who found his sister when he took his life in 2014.
Sharon Davis says, "I'm worried about consequences all the time."
Sharon Davis created the card "for people to know that there are people who can go and talk to, even though it is a friend.
Don't be quiet, talk about it."
Kelly Humphreys, who has been a friend of Sharon Davies for years, lost his partner 15 years ago, Mark, a while after his mother died.
"He had not said he felt depressed or depressed or anything," she says.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed that he acted differently.
On Christmas day he was at the bottom, and when the children opened their Christmas covers, he had no eye contact with them or anything."
She says his death was a very severe blow to them, but they have to get through it. "It breaks up a wound in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we must continue to fight all over the world."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake when the FBI launches an investigation
"I thought that if we could achieve something similar to what he asked for - a study that is limited in time and scope - we could perhaps have a little agreement," said Jeff Flake on Saturday. He allowed him to fear that the committee would be "split" because of deep rooted party differences.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate the case?
Their resistance depends entirely on the time.
The mid-term elections will take place in just five weeks, on 6 November.
George W. Bush has picked up the phone and called senators to influence them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for Bush in the White House, and through him met his wife Ashley, who was personal secretary for George W. Bush.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are now 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can have at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice-President Mike Pence to break the death penalty and confirm his election to the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean landfillers under Kim
The number of North Koreans jumping to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, says a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from the Ministry of Reunion of South Korea, says that 1,127 people hoped for last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park says stronger border controls between North Korea and China and higher taxes on human smugglers are important causes.
Pyongyang has not come with any public comments.
Finally, most of North Korea's returnees are offered South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flights via China, which has the longest border with North Korea and whose border is easier to cross than the heavily guarded demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korean states.
China sees despair as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often sends them back with violence.
The relationship between the North and the South, which is technically still at war with each other, has improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two Pyongyang countries met for talks with the focus on the ongoing negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This happened after the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed in general terms to work for the Korean peninsula to be free from nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho, accused the US of failing success since then.
"Without confidence for the United States there is no trust in our national security, and in such circumstances we cannot fully disarm ourselves unilaterally first," said Ri at a speech in the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical", and says he is unfit to serve in the Supreme Court
The minority leader of the Chamber, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said that he was temperamentalally inappropriate to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosis comments came in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman had acted like that, she would be called 'hysterical'," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate's Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh became emotional when he denied the charges of having offered Dr. Christine Blasey Ford sexually when they were both teenagers.
During his opening presentation, Kavanaugh was deeply touched, and then he almost screamed and the voice stopped when he spoke about his family and his years in high school.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the committee, and said that the charges against him were a "grotesy and coordinated murder" organised by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said she believed that Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because it showed that he was partial to the detriment of the Democrats.
"I think he is disqualifying himself with his statements and the way he attacked the Clinton couple and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi doubted when she received the question of whether she would try to bring Kavanaugh before the State Court if he was elected, and whether the Democrats get a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I can say this – if he does not tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he is not only inappropriate to sit in the Supreme Court, but also to work in the court he is at present," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Court of Appeal in Washington D.C.
Pelosi allowed her as a democrat to be concerned about what decisions Kavanaugh might face against the Affordable Care Act or the abortion Roe vs. Wade, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he would change certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
It is not possible for a hysterical and partisan person to sit in court and expect us all to applaud," Pelosi said.
Women have to stand out.
It is a righteous criticism, months and years of evil that boils over, and she cannot get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Mrs. Steinem said to me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual.
And she continued: "I got good help from a woman who was the CEO somewhere. She said she also cried when she got angry, but had developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying, she said to the person she spoke with: 'You might think I'm sorry because I'm crying.
I'm angry.'
And then she went on.
I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are allowed to lead to anger in part because they are often misunderstood in the basics.
One of my clearest memories of one of my first jobs in a man-dominated office, where once I cried out of indescribable pity, was that I was taken into the arms of an older woman. It was a cool boss I had always been a little scared of, and she dragged me into a stairwell.
"Let them never see you cry," she said to me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sorry and they'll be happy to press you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic Congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential election campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart was caught up with an out-of-court business on a boat named Monkey Business and pulled out of the campaign, a very frustrated Schroeder felt that there was no reason to investigate the idea of putting himself in the presidential election.
"It wasn't a well-thought decision," she said with a laugh to me 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates, the last one they needed was another.
Someone called it "Snovit and the seven dwarves."
Because she was late out, she lay behind with the money collection, and promised not to go in as a candidate if she didn't get $2 million.
It was a project condemned to fail.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men just gave her $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she wondered.
When she announced in a talk that she would not start a formal presidential campaign, she was so overwhelmed by feelings, gratitude for those who had supported her, frustration over the system that made it so difficult to collect money and address voters rather than delegates, and angry about sexism, that the voice stopped.
"You could have thought I had a nervous breakdown," recalls Schröder near the press.
"You could have thought Kleinex was my business sponsor.
I remember thinking, "What are they gonna write on my gravestone?"
'She's crying?'
Why the US-China trade war can be good for Beijing
The opening of the trade war between the United States and China was listening. The war is far from over, but the gap between countries can benefit the Chinese government in the long term, according to experts.
U.S. President Donald Trump launched the first warning panel earlier this year by covering important Chinese export goods such as solar panels, steel and aluminium with customs.
The most important event came this week, with new customs duties on goods for $200 billion, which in practice means that half of all the goods coming into the USA from China are customs-coated.
Peking has responded with the same coin every time, and recently it was spent on taxes of between five and ten percent on American goods for $60 billion.
China has promised to match US action. The next largest economy in the world will probably not step down in a seemingly time-consuming manner.
To get Washington back means to bow to demands, but to publicly cry for the United States would be too generous for China's President Xi Jinping.
However, experts believe that if Beijing plays its short right, the US trade war press can provide positive support to China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"A quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing can create conditions for economic panic in the single country, and it is actually much more dangerous than the observers previously wanted to acknowledge," says Abigail Grace, a research assistant focusing on Asia at the Center for New American Security.
Syria "ready" for returning refugees, according to the Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready to accept voluntary return refugees and plead for help to build up the country, which lies in ruins after the more than seven years of war.
In a speech before the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country are now improving.
"The situation on the ground today is more stable and secure, thanks to our success in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to build up the areas that have been destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normality.
There are now all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they were forced to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihood.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have moved the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian support.
According to Al-Moualem, the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the devastated country.
However, he stressed that it does not receive conditional support or assistance from countries that have supported the rebellion.
Europe won with the victory in Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe has won Ryder Cup 2018 by defeating Team USA with the 16.5 against 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris in France.
The United States has now lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won again when the Danish captain Thomas Bjørn's team reached the 14.5 points required to beat the United States.
The U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who was able to fight hard during most of the tournament, landed in the water at the end of the 16th stage of the hole, and lost to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari shined in all rounds and became one of four players who have ever made 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament was introduced in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was kicked out 5 & 4 by the European team's lowest ranking players, Thorbjørn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's highest ranking player, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 & 1 against Ian Poulter from England, who may have made his last Ryder Cup.
The Spanish Sergio Garcia, who is a veteran with eight Ryder Cup behind him, became the most successful European of the tournament ever with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
I'm so grateful that Thomas chose me and believed me.
I'm so happy, so happy to win back the victory.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could be of help," said a touching Garcia after the victory of the European team.
He left his countryman John Ram across the stick, who defeated the American golfer Tiger Woods 2+1 alone on Sunday.
"What incredible pride, to have Tiger Woods hit. I'm grown up looking at him," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all his four matches in France, and now has the result 13-21-3 for his career in Ryder Cup.
A special statistics for one of the world's best players ever, who has won 14 major titles, which has only been surpassed by Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA fought all weekend to find fairway, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-class golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk said after the team's downsizing performance: "I'm proud of these guys they've fought.
It was morning when we were raising the temperature in Europe.
We took the lead.
Hat off for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played really well.
We're gonna regroup, I'm gonna work with the U.S. PGA tour and our Ryder Cup committee and then we're gonna move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be the captain.
You'll get bows and kisses.
They played better than us."
The algal flower: The stops decrease in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report by the Florida Fisheries and Forestry Commission shows a general reduction in algal flowering concentrations for parts of the area around Tampa Bay.
According to the Commission, more uneven flowering is reported in areas around the municipalities Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier.
The algal flower extends along more than 20 miles from the coast, from North Pinellas to South Lee.
Flakes can be seen about one and a half miles out of the sea outside the municipality of Hillsborough, but in fewer places compared to last week.
Algal flowering has also been observed in the large municipality of Pasco.
Average concentrations in or outside the coast of Pinellas have been reported during the past week. Outside the coast of Hillsborough low to high concentrations, background concentrations to high concentrations in Manatee, background concentrations to high concentrations in or outside the coast of Sarasota, background concentrations to medium to high concentrations in or outside the coast of Lee, and low concentrations in Collier.
Reports of respiratory irritation continue to come from the municipalities Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
There were no reports of respiratory irritation in northwestern Florida last week.
