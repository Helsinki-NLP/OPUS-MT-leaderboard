Black box in your car?
While U.S. street planners are struggling with the lack of wealth to repair the high-level system, there are many people who are looking at its resolution in a small black box, which goes clean on your car's dashboard.
This device, which tracks every mile driven by the motor car and communicates that information to the authorities, has become an issue for Washington and the Kingdom Administration Office, which is now old enough to feed the major American roads.
As a general rule, such as high-level work has become the subject of a sudden deep debate and living groups.
The miles you've been driving, and possibly the locations you've been driving - and then using this information to prepare a tax bill - have joined the librarian environmental groups to allow the government to use these black boxes.
It's a tea party.
The U.S. Civil Liberties Association is also very concerned by raising various issues of confidentiality.
While Congress did not agree on whether to act in the future, many Kingdoms are not waiting.
They're looking for ways in which they can go in the next decade to pay for every mile on the road.
Thousands of motorists have already taken the black box for the test drive, some of which include GPS monitoring.
It's really a necessary thing for our country.
"It's not a matter of being chosen by us or not," says Hamsan Ikhata, who is the executive director of the South California government, who is planning to start tracking every mile designated by motorists in California by 2025.
There's going to be a change in the way we pay.
It's technological to do that.
The main reason for this is that the country's High Trust Fund has become almost a waste, which is paid by U.S. citizens on gas pumps.
Americans don't buy as much gas as they used to.
Now a gallon of gas is already driving more miles.
There was no increase in federal tax in the last 20 years, which is 18.4 cents per gallon.
Because of the high value of gas, politicians avoid even raising money in taxes.
Minnesota University Transport Policy expert Le Monich says, "Gasping is not entirely acceptable."
Their government has recently installed tracking devices in 500 cars to test the anti-missile payment system.
They say, "In the long run, it will work as the most reasonable option."
Wunks call it the Miles-based user Salk.
It's not surprising that this idea is pleasing to urban donors, because it can be transformed into a car-barrier for example, which can help reduce the charge and reduce the greenhouse gas.
California's planners are keen on this system while they are developing strategies to meet the goals set by the government's major global warming laws.
But the Chair of the Home Transport Committee, Rap. Bill Sister (A.P.A.) also considers the Black Box as the most viable long-term option.
Free sellers in the Regen Foundation are also in favour of per mile payment by the driver.
Adrian Moore, the president of the police in Reygen, said, "It's not just what's going on in the dark."
People are paying more clearly for what they're getting.
The campaign has been supported by two former U.S. transport agencies, who in 2011 favoured moving from Congress to a counter-major payment in 2011.
U.S. Senate approved the 90-million dollar test project, involving 10,000 cars last year.
But working on the concerns of rural lawmakers, who were representing people who had to go to work or go to work on a daily basis, the leader of Sadan concluded the proposal there.
Yet many kingdoms and cities themselves are moving forward in this direction.
It has the most desirable Oregon, which has listed 5,000 drivers in the country's largest use.
These drivers will soon pay Miles Salk instead of throwing the kingdom away.
Nevada has already completed the initial test.
New York City is also moving in this direction.
Illinois is testing with trucks on a limited basis.
And the I-95 grouping, which includes the 17 state transport departments with the former cjord (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), are studying how they can implement this change.
This idea was not supported everywhere.
In Nevada, where some time ago 50 voluntary car drivers had installed this device on their cars, the driver was very patient to think that the government could monitor each step of theirs.
In the Nevada Transport Section, the leaders of the strategic and performance management, Alaudin Khan, say, "Big Brother and other things of the same kind were the main concerns."
It's not what people wanted.
As the test progressed, the U.S.A. warned on its website: "It will be very easy to turn this device into a complete tracking device."
There is no need to develop a large, unmanaged technological framework-setting, which has to be spread accidentally to keep a record of each person's daily arrival.
Nevada is one of many states that is trying every possible way to obtain unique technology, with the help of the government to get a description of how many miles are running every day, but not where and when it is running.
Khan said that if you can do that, people can feel easier.
This researcher's search brought some government agencies to a small California Startup called True Miles.
This farm was not in the business of helping drivers to rule.
She was trying to get into the market while the car got sick, where the drivers had to pay for their mail.
But the device that is being tested was very good for high-quality schemes because it does not use GPS and provides a lot of limited information, which is uploaded by modem over a certain amount of time.
True Miles said, "If you don't track people's speed and location, they'll be more willing to adopt this way."
These early Kingdom programs have made some major mistakes.
There are very few cost-effective and less intervention ways to do so.
In Oregon, planner drivers are using different options.
They can choose a device for GPS devices or without GPS.
Or they can choose no device again, but they can choose to give the money determined on the basis of the average miles determined by the inhabitants of the Kingdom.
Other places hope that this could be sold regularly to concerned citizens instead of providing less and more facilities on the device.
In New York City, transport authorities are trying to develop a taxiing device, which will also provide parking meters to pay, "pay according to your drive" will provide insurance, and will build a real-time data collection from other drivers that can be used to avoid motor traffic.
The city plan document states, "The motorists will be attracted to participate in the benefits it brings."
Although some transport planners are surprised that the entire discussion on pay according to mile is perhaps a big distraction.
The Metropoliton Transport Agency in San Francisco Bridge area has said that the problem of the Dawalia High Trust Fund can easily be tackled by increasing Congress's gas tax.
An additional one-time or annual shock may be imposed on drivers of hybrids or other cars whose vehicles do not use much more gas to pay for their share.
Randy Rentseller said, "What is the basic surgery for him when he can work with Esprin?"
If we do, millions of drivers will be worried about their privacy and many other things.
According to the police, his death is due to drowning.
Albate, the police have taken away his friend's property in search of hiding it with him.
The police have submitted the final report of the death trial to the court.
It was learned that on August 26th, the police had raided Iqbal, a native of the Patriarchial Garden in the Sea of the Sea.

Snow Dan is ready to "cooperate" with Germany on the U.S. Coast
Edward Snow Dan, U.S.A.'s secret minister, has announced that Berlin is ready to travel to Germany for proof if the US National Security Agency and its director, Keith Alexander, fail to respond to their activities.
German M.P. Hans Christian Strao Belle met Mr. Snow Dan on Tuesday in Russia, where he was given refuge to speak about the witness in Germany.
Saturday, a letter presented by Mr. Snow Dane to the media in Berlin, said: "Although my efforts have a positive effect, my government believes that there is a change of party, and does not provide any defence that seeks to criminalize the political speech with the accusations of the Prosecutor."
Although speaking the truth is not a crime.
In a letter, Mr. Snow Dan said that they believe that the support of the international community can rule the US government to reject their criminal charges.
The U.S. Department of Justice is involved in the theft of bribery and the property of the government.
Hans Peter Frederic, German Minister of Interior, told Online Time: "Mr. Snow Dan is ready to talk to the German authorities, so we will find ways to make it possible."
The relationship between America and Germany has been under pressure because the NSA has claimed that Chancellor Angela Marcel's phone has been bugged.
Thomas Operman, who is the chairman of the Committee on Cultural Affairs, said that if Mr. Snow Dan was a witness, it would be possible to "debate relations with the United States completely and without endangering them," then it should be taken.
Mr. Bell, a member of the Green Party of Germany, posted a photo of himself with Mr. Snow Dan on Twitter.
He was on his trip to Russia with two German journalists.
Mr. Bellene said that, according to the disturbing lawyer of the former NSA, if they left Russia, they are not able to return Snow Dan Russia.
If Snow Dan witnessed in Germany, he would be "safe" there, which would require assurances, Ssad said.
Mr. Snow Dan said in his letter that "they had to face terrible and persistent efforts" they had to leave home.
While they said that the world is happy and proud by the vast responses "to its work of political expression."
Along with the United States - with the world's citizens, senior officials have estimated the mystery of a vast system of public service surveillance.
The letter extends a proposal to cooperate with the German authorities "when the problems of the human situation have been solved."
Frontier Airlines Carrie - On Baggage
In Frontier Airlines there is a plan to charge $100 for passengers on their flight board to store supplies.
Frontier Airlines is planning to start a charge for $100 for a carriage bag and will pay $2 for coffee or release, although Wednesday's announcement said that travelers can keep the whole day.
New Cari - On Sholk Overhead Bin is for bag in bin, so the small bag under the seat will still be empty.
Frontier said that $25 would charge if paid in Advans, $100 would wait if the travelers waited to pay until they were on the gate.
Frontier spokesperson Kate O' Mellie said that $100 is to be obtained to care for the charge in the adventure of a hundred-fifty travelers.
"We don't want him to charge," he said.
Airlines launched charges for the first and second check baggage in 2008.
Those who are trying to escape the shock are filling as much as they can do in the carrier's luggage that's standing in the overhead deck, which means there's a lot of space in this deck.
There's a way to bring down passengers on the chess board.
O' Mellie said it's not really about raising the new charge.
This is about Frontier for the most loyal customers that the search for overhead bin has quickly become difficult.
This should not be done by airline travelers who buy tickets on their websites.
This means that the next person in the line can pay 100 dollars for the same bag, while a traveler in the line on a frontier gate can get a bag free of charge.
O'Malley said that Frontier's website and the check are changing their processes before getting the gate to make sure that the travelers know about the fiss.
The new Carrier - On Face will not start up to heat, although a date has not been set.
Travelers often find dissatisfaction with luggage and other bulk, but they like air services.
They argue that it costs money to manage the luggage, and those who want travel services should pay for it.
Many of the passengers on Wall Street are looking at as a sign that many airlines are charging enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of loss.
Most of them don't even touch the cari-on bag.
Spirit Airlines Inc. began the first three years before Carrie-on-Shulk, and the partner of the Allegiant Air Discounter later.
Wizz Air, along with another airline from Hungary, is one of those who said that the airline consultant Sorensen, who is running the AIDS-on-face track.
He said the Spirit's Care - On-Shulk brings $50 million in a year that was estimated in the December 2011 report.
Sorensen, a former officer of Midwest Airlines, recently flew into the spirit and the passengers had to face the unusual bag face on the gate but were surprised.
"The boarding process that I had seen in my airline career was easy," he said.
I was hoping to look out at the toothbrush and a fight gate.
"It was full of air and they said it came up pickety-split."
Frontier is also following the $2 worth of coffee, tea, quit, or juice for Juice.
Frontier Nekaha that the traveler who left, or takes Jus, they can keep the whole debauchery, and this free coffee will only be given for once.
It'll still take away the water.
In 2008, US Airways attempted to charge for drinking substances, but seven months later after the travel complaints they withdrew and followed any other main airline there.
If passengers of Frontier's don't buy directly from the airline, this step of Frontier's is your modern effort to direct customers to your own website.
Airlines pays the online Travel seller Orbitz for tickets like this from $10 to $25 per ticket.
That's why all Airlines has been encouraged to run travelers directly from them instead of going through an online Travel Agency.
Frontier though, has gone forward in this area.
In September, a number of airliners began to offer half a mile away for customers who were bought from an online Travel Agency from these people
On Wednesday, it reduced the Mailage Ward to 25 percent of Trip Mil.
So an online Travel Agency purchased a 1,000 - mile [1,500 km] Frontier Trip will charge a 250 - mile [250 km] distance.
It's also that they allow Frontier to select its seat in advance for direct purchase from the website.
In Denver, Frontier has a loyal customer base in his home city, but it's falling down and it's losing money.
The decline of 9 percent in politics and its flying capacity in the first trimester has decreased by about 13 percent, according to the financial results of the corporate parent of the Republic of Air Holdings Inc.
Trying to set the cost of Frontier as part of the sales of the Republican Airlines.
NSB reported on "Internal Error" instead of hackers to be website crashing
The secret national security agency told Friday that our website had been closed for a few hours because of some technical failure, not because of hackers, as some people have claimed online.
At the time of the e-mail, the Bufia Agency said, "Today night was not accessible to NSA.gov for several hours, which was due to an internal error during the pre-specified update."
Tonight will solve this problem.
This claim is not true that this obstacle was caused by the widespread denial of service [D.V.S.] because of the attack.
The evening an online server tracker was found that the website of NS.A. was closed for at least six hours, and the site is not yet accessible for some users.
N.S.A. spokesperson told the N.B.C. News that the agency's internal, sensitive network was "not quite understood".
The speaker said that no classified information is in danger.
At least one hectivist group has claimed online that they are responsible for blocking the website of the NSS by D.O.S. attack.
The CD-ROM attack is designed so that the target website can send traffic to so far until the site is overloaded by the server.
This cyber strategy is unspecified and the target attack is not to distinguish the internal network of the target system.
Formerly extremely secretive N.S.A., which has never been called "such an agency", has become the subject of discussion between the general public and discussion between foreign and domestic social events in recent months - which has been the subject of collectively disrupted N.S.A.
As a result of such an increasing debate about the agency, arrests were made today after nighttime events that resulted in a marked cyber operation.
According to the 'one and the antiquities' story, which is consistent with today's circumstances, beautiful expressions were presented.
It has been shown which lines in today's debate are bound to follow a teacher's wrong path.
The performance was celebrated by St. Joseph Inter College, Chief Justice Minister Walmiki, Prime Minister of the Army, Shipra Rustotti, Naresh Consul, and Power Lion.
The drama showed the similarity between the dwarves of the Age of Age and the circumstances of a professor who is currently unaccompanied.
In the performance directed by Niel Sharma, India's heritage Sharma, Niel Sharma, Winod Bechan, Hemanth Goyel, Border Samar, the descendants of the Quartet, Abid Sammy, Shiva Gajala, Amethyth, Ramesh, Arjun, etc., gave a wonderful presentation in full judgment with the Kurds.
In the drama, the light system was designed by the Young Colorful Singer C. King and Set's Design Hemanth Kumar.
At its summit, various events were given to the cultural, cultural, and literary organizations from the Octa.
It was given to the king by the Udu division of the lion Vivi, Dr. Jamsedpuri, chief journalist Shamunathat Sukla, and the colourful Giantrra C.
The organisation's success was a contribution to the executive's office, Seichi Surendra Sharma, Rakesh Kushik, Abhid Rizavi, etc.
As a delivery of air, bombings against Bombardier, arrests in warrants
Canada's airship and train Mekker Bombardier Inc reported a 15 per cent increase in net profits on Thursday, in its third team in the train unit and less by air command and promotion.
The Montreal-based Bombardier also presented no flight test data for its Brand New CSeries aircraft to complete its major commercial service program from September to September.
Almost half a month after the first flight of the test aircraft, it's just three times blown, the question is whether the test step is on the track.
The result was lower than expected and Share Toronto Stock Exchange sent for more than 8 percent slideshows.
With Cameroon Dorsen, a analyst with the National Bank Financials, she has reduced her rating for "the field display" on Thursday from one or two weeks to the next.
"The weaker aircraft suppliers were expecting more, we are clearly disappointed with the Margin display in transport," Dorsen said in a client note.
We will receive a new command for Bombardier CSeries as the progress of the flight test program.
Although, if no new commands are announced in the coming months, the market will probably be suspected.
Bombardier is expected to be able to cut it at the very end of the Boing and Airbus trade.
The first test failed in March and was carried out for the first time in September after a month.
The potential Kreta waits for the results of the flight test to confirm the company's claims on fuel efficiency and potential cost savings but, for example, for CSeries by means of a fixed order of up to 177.
There are 403 full orders and prohibitions available with 15 customers and operators.
The chief executive officer of Pierre Bodoin believed that Bombardier would meet his 300-year-old ordering goal from the time he used the jet business first.
Authorities assured analysts and teachers that the program was running according to index.
"The test air was on the ground for a long time in relation to the expected comparison," Bodoin said in a conference call, adding it to the ground test and software update interval.

New research has found that we work with full honesty and dedication in the morning.
They don't lie to anyone, they don't consider lying, they don't consider lying, they don't understand.
But in the evening, our minds change and we start going against the rules.
Researchers at Harvard University and Utto have provided interesting facts in this research by researchers at the David Plus School of Business.
According to researchers, without stress in the morning, we prefer moral values, but in the evening, fatigue or more pressure causes honesty to decline.
The researchers used two for that.
He told some people to tell the number of dots on the computer screen.
For example, people were told that the point is more to the left or to the right.
It has been said to those who took part in it, 'If they give false testimony in return, it will be given them.'
This experiment showed that people used between 8 and 12 in the morning did not make any mistakes and responded correctly.
It was that afternoon between noon and noon at 6:00 p.m. when they used the people, they deliberately gave their principles with a wrong answer.
The researchers have been able to prove that the desire for money in the morning does not make any difference to our honesty, but at night we stop giving in to morality.
This research is published in the latest issue of Psychological Science.

Mr. Big, an ordinary lawyer from the Koken who's leaking confidential information about the police investigation
42 - year - old bulldozers report to the criminal Neal Scarboro in the kitchen
The prosecutor felt that his secret drug could be known to people.
Liverpool Crown Court sentenced him to three years in prison
The chief attorney on the rescue side, who told Mr. Big about the main police investigation, because he was afraid of being exposed to his secret medical condition, is three years old.
After 42-year-old Drashat Dita agreed with her cocaine bed, the Pakistani criminal Neal Scarboro provided sensitive information about her drug-related activities.
This defendant, who was nicknamed "Bish" and who was praised by criminals as "Top Brief", was arrested by the police in Scarboro in 2011, who was represented in the previous Narcotics trial.
The officials saw Scarboro 32 years old in Blackburn, Lancashire, with three bags of cocaine in the lawyer's house, while he was out with his associates for the Lo Society Diner.
After receiving the corner of cocaine in the teeth, her buttocks, and her credit cards, the test found that the teeth of category A was "a regular user".
During the eight-month period between August 2011, he attempted to obtain unlawful information about the arrest of two people by Scarboro and his associate.
Heroin and Koken were then being monitored by the police as part of the main test of the Lukashair, Kumbria, Mercescied, Berkssair and West Yorkshire.
There were 32 others who had been sent to prison after more than 200,000 pounds of heroin and cocaine during several prints by the police.
Forty-two years old was reported to criminals because he feared that people might know about his cocaine.
In Blackbankard, the state law of Forbes Solicitors was in operation in the form of a standstill in Forbes Solicitors, three weeks after the trial in Liverpool Crown, after the trial had been held in two cases, there was a failure in Liverpool Crown Court.
He agreed to keep cocaine in his previous hearing.
The lawyer's bad time began when the police found out that he was regularly in contact with Dita on the phone since February 2011.
Two spies followed the link and saw it coming to the ditta house and holding more than 60 per cent of the lawyer's fine in Black Golf Glove.
After the drug was put on the phone regularly with Scarboro Dita, who had gone out to dier at the Black Rouvers Football Stadium in Evod Park.
When the lawyer came home, he found out that there was a drug she had used there, and there was nine times a conversation between them.
The court heard that he had been found "regular user" of cocaine in an examination of the skin, buttocks and credit cards on the teeth.
Dita was arrested later, but she refused to use cocaine and said she was talking to the related dealer because he was her client and said that their discussion was "normal privilege".
During his arrest, Dita tried to pull out her wallet and remove many credit cards, but they were arrested, and her hair was sampled.
In the police testimony, he said he was also running his office with his office, and his clients were calling his home for medical matters.
After the arresters told them what the Nazis knew about them, it was said in a court hearing that the DIT was calling people in the main supply chain, some of whom he had previously presented.
On the side of the project, Annie White said: "Our criminal advocate should be best aware of not breaking the law."
As a criminal defendant on Mr. Dent, there is a charge of abuse of his position, of connecting much more with his particular client.
We're not talking about the general drug dealer, we're not talking about the dealer who's giving his lawyer the drug.
Their talk will without a doubt stand, for he was a judge.
But he got out of his line of relationship somewhere.
He forced the police to investigate as much as possible to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Dentistry was not a respect for his profession, but a disgrace.
He made much closer than some certain clients, especially Scarboro, and he allowed compromise with his freedom.
Dita denied any wrongs and claimed: "If I were a corrupt lawyer, who I am, and if I wanted to inform Mr. Scarboro, I would not wait for 15 hours, but I would do it right away.
But after hearing the Lukashair police chief Lee Hallstead said: "At the time Mr. Dita started taking drugs from organized criminals, they turned themselves into criminals."
Because of their cocaine addiction, they agreed more and became much weaker for the purposes of former members of organised crime groups, who used it to obtain important information related to police investigations.
Speakers must maintain the highest standard of integrity, and have faith and self-confidence in people.
Mr. Dita has deceived with this faith and has tried to save her profession.
The Lukashair's serious and organized crime unit tested Mr. Dita, in which three cases were found to be guilty of holding them to cocaine and now to imprison the way of justice, which demonstrates our resistance to bringing the criminals to justice.
This matter must be warned against, that no man is far from the law.
We'll find you and present you to the court.
Scarboro was sentenced to 14 years in prison after he was convicted of offering heroin, cocaine and gang rape.
Fifty other members of the group were sent to Karavas for 153 years for drug abuse.
Dita gave questions and answers about herself on her website, in which she said that her fancy job would be to be a lawyer for a death penalty client in America, to be a guest of Muhammad Ali's diner, and to be a source of inequality for their work.
Kenya’s press on the disputed media law is crying
The newspaper challenged the lawyer as an illegal saying, "This is a terrible place, and it's valid to ask that: what is to prevent the lawyer from taking away his freedom by parliament tomorrow?"
The capital group - the largest free radio station in Kenya and the news website, the director of CapitolFM, said, "This is a law that is cruel and highly punishable, and we reject it."
He said that the new media jurisdiction "we will remain impartial because it is only a member of the government" and said that banning content and advertising would harm Kenya's place in the global economy.
They said, "I hope the president will listen to us, and we will appeal to them to deny this verdict and send M.P. people back."
According to The Star Newspaper, the new law firm will provide "hard control over the media", while The Standard said that the freedom to speak and speak in Kenya has "suddenly shaken" and has cruelly told the law firm.
This lawyer is being passed as one of the means of strengthening national security after the attack by the Islamic gunman at the Westgate shopping mall in September.
The Kenyan media had released security camera footage of the hands sent to the attack site, showing them that they had been deliberately robbed of the mall, which caused the authorities to become angry with Kenyan media.
Police chief David Kimio had sent a match to two journalists and media workers for questioning, although it had been taken back after media harassment.

According to the Daily Nation, "the majority of F.M. is enough to move the foundation of stations."
It also said that these measures could have a devastating effect on Kenya's "Live Blogosphere".
By stopping the media, politicians know that they can do their best.
Journalist Mutuma Matthew of the nation describes Kenyan media as the main source of control and balance in public life "no one will ever know."
They said, "If they were left behind, they would surely bring us back to the world as captives and as captives."
In the past, Kenyans have had to deal with people's anger.
In May, they refused to deny the cuts ordered by the national payroll, and restored about 532,000 shillings, with free pay, which is considered to be the highest in the world.

The U.N. has set new targets to deal with poverty
The United Nations is about to begin its work on a new set of goals, which will replace the global development goals, which were launched 12 years ago to deal with global poverty.
To replace M.D. in 2015, the Australian politician played an important role in advancing the "Constantive Development Goals" that began all night in Rio de Janeiro.
They were included in the final format of the document, which will be supported by world leaders, along with Sisters.
U.N. Grandfather Ban Ki-moon said at the Night Summit that the time has come to "get up from national virtues".
He said, "I am very pleased that the Member States have agreed to initiate and take over the process to set global sustainable development goals."

Mozambique’s security concerns grow as powerful personalities

For two weeks, the conflict between government forces and Ré Nomo has been reported almost daily, more than 20 years after a peace agreement.
Re Nomo was a notorious rebel of the white ruling Rhodesia and the colourful government of South Africa as part of the efforts to dissipate the country's independent government.
After the 1992 peace agreement, it became a refugee party.
Analysts believe it is not possible to return to the country's developed conflict, but recent events have encouraged foreign intruders and local people.
The dams are rising rapidly for the more economical economy of the vastly positive gas storage of western motors and the search for Rio Tinto, Brazil's Well, some of the companies with Eni may bring more than $50bn in the next year.
The government's Frelimo party, the main political force since 1975, and Ray Nomo's pressure blame each other.
Ré Nomo says the government launched a recent attack on its members in Sofia on October 17th, a traditional Ré Nomo fortress.
On the rise of the former rebels, the government forces attacked Renomo and told the Financial Times to try to kill the spokesperson of Rénom.
The government accuses Rea Nomo of being attacked by soldiers.
President Armando Gibuz has urged to disregard concerns about instability.
Mr. Gibuzan told the French news agency on Wednesday that Mr. Dhakama had seen himself as a "dar" "anybody has tried to prove that he can apply his own decision to the government."
Free Limo and Ray Nomo insist that they want to escape the war.
Mr. Mong was quoted as saying that Re Nomo had withdrawn the peace agreement in 1992 but later became a matter of concern.
They're telling FT what reconciliation isn't being honored by Free Limlo.
Our view is to return to the conversation of reconciliation, but seriously," said Mr. Mangane.
The last story between the two parties did nothing to reduce the stress of a series of battles this year.
"It's about two big men fighting together," Joseph Han of London Open University and Mozambique expert said.
They're not good talkers, and they don't have to be ready to make jokes.
Ra Nomo, insisting on the election improvements, said about the expulsion of the city of nagam elections in November already.
The presidential and cultural elections are scheduled for the following year.
Some commentators have explained their use of force as a patient movement in trying to win government and financial theft.
Rea Nomo's participation in Madrid has decreased since 1992, while a new party, a former Rea Nomo member, is expected to improve its demonstration in the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM) in elections.
Mr. Mong says Mr. Gibuzenko-- who left office next year at the end of his second term -- wants to destroy the country's democracy.
"He doesn't want multilingual democracy, he even wants to leave the presidency because he doesn't want peace, he doesn't want a transparent choice," said Mr. Mong.
What kind of ability has not been defined, but it's been done around a major hit and run by police stations and vehicles on the northern highway.
Most of the storms are located in the country, hundreds of kilometres north of Jomaputo, where the host bears the port that trusts to export koala with Rio Tinto and the valley.
After threatening to attack Re Nomo Line in June, the railway delayed its use for about a week.
Re Nomo would have repeated this threat or not, Mr. Mango was asked.
Re Nomo "things were not going well in Mozambique that wanted to warn the international community, Mr. Mong said.
The government of instability has increased the stakes, Fernando Lima, Media Cop, says, which is also concerned about the recent rise in corruption, slow development and ageing by the head of a free media company.
"People have government and presidents responsible for the country's future, and they think they should be one to find a solution to problems," they say.
The Omar Empire, a viewer, still needs people to stay.
"No one cares about Ra Nomo and Free Limo, they just want peace again, they want free access to the streets," he said.
Children should be taught "as a model for a way of writing life", myths and myths.
The stories of the Great could show "the power of the Crusades is no match for all the plans," while the importance of having a dream in the Turkish continents is evident.
Many of the myths will also not be useful for teaching "even in faraway places, even in rural areas and in some cases, it will not be appropriate to teach it in rape and in schools," Cross Le Holland said one of the most appropriate tasks of age.
"I think it's amazing, in the United States, a part of myth and geography already in the field of education," he said.
I'm supporting it as a plan for twenty years.
They've told writers and teachers "more educator" and it's "a new turn" for children, together with "presenting" messages in entertaining stories.
Cross Le Holland, who translated the book by Beauwulf from Anglo-Saxon, along with Norwegian myths and British stories, said: "Your intentions may be very much, but it will be better to keep it out of sight."
Perhaps for a child an older writer and an older writer writing requires some meanings of the great hope between an older one.
Everything has to be simplified or a happy ending, because it's a simple sense of good and evil.

Ben Greenman: Tenth Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New York
People can argue that New York City is the birthplace of a standup comedy in the United States: about a hundred years ago, the audience began to hear loud talk about the audience of the audience who were working as a teacher at the Pales theatre in Broadway.
Fae's search has been extended over the years, most recently in New York Comedy Fostive.
This year's 10th anniversary, which included more than sixty shows in small clubs and big theatres, was celebrated and celebrated by Caroline Hirher, the founder of the Standup Organization of Carolines.
Hersh says, "Most of these were seen in the Carolines, and were very successful, to the extent that they became too large to be played at the club."
We created this festival as a way to continue working with them.
This year's program includes the presence of Wanda Six, Katie Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as the annual music and comedy benefits for military service in Madison Square Garden, "Stand Up for Heroes", which included other artists, including Bruce Springstein, John Stewart, Roger Waters, and Bill Cosby.
The Comedy world has been expanded as well as its celebrations have been extended.
Many of those participating in this year's celebration have come from comical non-traditional means, such as comedy Central, F.X., and Spyk's coming to small networks such as
Nick Kroll, DP-Cable Sitcom (F.X.C.) came to the leading position from Ronchi fantasy football theme "Di Leg", and now their own comedy Central Chess show.
Jenny Slate is a member of "Satrede Night Live" and "Parks and recreation", although they are best known for their online video series "Marsell The Shelves on."
With Crall and Slatt, other young comedians with different sounds (mostly disillusioned), Anthony Jesellnik, who is centred on violent, racial, and comical, are the products of the American comedy.
One of the main attractions of the festival will be the testimony: Talking to Larry David of David Stinburg:
Stinburg had begun to work as a standup comedian, but they have become renowned television and film directors, as well as unauthorized comedy historians.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a show called "Site Down Comedy by David Steinberg" on TV Land.
This meeting will be in downtown Manhattan, Town Hall.
Stinburg said, "The city is definitely in the commod d.N.A. of all Larry's tasks."
They were telling me that when they were here, sometimes they would go between the two buildings and think that if I ever lost all my money, I would stay here.
Oil 96 per barrel was still falling
The oil prices continue to fall as far as Friday is concerned with a report offset where the hungry area of power building is being strengthened in China.
For the December delivery, the United States of America was down 14 cents per barrel at New York Mercantile Exchange in electronic trading in Europe until late morning.
The deal has fallen 5.8% for the month of October, 39 cents fell on Thursday.
The raw oil supply is sufficient at the price in recent weeks.
The Energy Department told Wednesday that the U.S. supply increased by 4.1 million barrels last week
Over five weeks, the supply has increased over 25 million barrels.
However, in one of the suggested activities of the strong demand, it was found by Jjafa that two reports on the Chinese construction had arrived on Friday.
This shows that Kiwikas can continue to strengthen China's economic recovery after a low concentration of 7.8 per cent in the third quarter of a decade.
Brand Crud also fell from $108.58 per barrel to $26.58 per barrel to a benchmark for international crude oil used by US refiners in London.
The Court has held that the New York Police Department has been obstructing its action on the interruption of the game policy
On Thursday, a U.S. Court of Appeal ordered a judge to stop the changes and remove the judge from the case.
The U.S. Circuit Court Judge Shira Shingler said that judges would delay the results of an appeal through the city.
In the city of the judge, they had decided to stop the people and to break the constitution out of their program of questioning in August.
The City Police Department has also decided to assign a supervisor to help with its policy and associated training program changes, its conclusion and its medical instructions have been adopted.
The Court of Appeal heard arguments yesterday on the motion for a resolution.
The Court of Appeal has said that since he agreed on the need for a judge to avoid bias in part of a series of media testimony, he should be removed from the case of the judge, and should be held publicly responsible for criticizing the Court of Justice for the conduct of U.S. judges.
The judge even ruled that police officers wrongly violated the civil rights of thousands of people by marking black and Spanish men with their break and play.
He has set up an out-of-the-way monitor to monitor major changes in policy, training and surveillance, and he is most shut down where he has ordered a pilot program to test body clothing cameras in some areas.
In August, New York City agreed to end the practice of collecting names and addresses after a police stop.
An oral argument on the city's appeal is indicated for some time after March 14, 2014.
The pause and play device has been compromised with the citizens' rights.
The break and play policy has been around for some decades, but most black and Spanish men, the free mayor Michael Blomberg, has recorded a dramatic increase under the administration of the administration to raise all the time from 684330 to 2011.
A trial was conducted by four men by all the small numbers in 2004 and a class of action became a case.
A supporter of the change in NYPD's break and play show said that the inappropriate behavior will end another more reliable and effective police force and may influence the use of police in the other police department.
Opponents say the changes will reduce police emotion, but crime, money and not money will solve a huge problem of police force pressure by thousands of officials over the past decade.
The judge noted that the break and the gamer had not ended, which is arbitrary, but had improved the implementation of the NYPD stop.
In training were many Goddas, Papuds, Jamsedpur, rich men, thousands of villages, and four districts.
During the seven-day period, all participants were informed of a number of studies, including Tent Pitching, Flag Pole.
Dr. Happy Princess Ray and the participation of Jesus' proclamation of training is being accomplished.
All religions are joining in prayer, spreading the feeling of unity.
The chief of the camp is providing special cooperation with the government training program.
Kolson used the phone hacking to confirm the secret
The former editor of the News of the World has been accused of using "phone hacking, surveillance and Ammana-samana" in an attempt to confirm their intimate relationship with Charles Clark's house.
Professor Andrew Addus Q.C. told Old Bally that the news of the World heard a false claim in May 2005 that Clark was joining Hannah Polby's "attractive special advisor".
According to the court, the newspaper appointed private investigator Glen Mulkair to hack into and "keep watch" the man in Polby, but Colson also called and left him.
Mr. Addis said, "The idea of the party that Mr. Colson, who is now the editor of the N.O.T.W., is not known to stand outside people's homes and watch them, but they have articles in front of people, seeing how people react to him."
They said that N.O.T.W.L. used three ways to investigate cases: phone hacking, surveillance and amena-samana.
The editor itself was included in the third party.
Clearly, they knew other ways, of course they knew about surveillance.
What about the first - century Christians?
Did they know about phone hacking?
They say, no, we say, "Yes, they certainly knew."
The complaint about Clark's marital relationships was first presented by the A.T.D.L.'s Facebook desk when a well-wished source in Sister Polby said, "Don't waste your time, he's with Charles."
In August 2006, at least three times the Waissell tape from the home of Mulkair was jammed from the phone of Sister Polby.
Investigators also found entries on the private investigator's computer, which was named "project" by Sister Polby and their sister.
At the time they were being tested, they were being called by their grandfather-in-law.
During this time, former chief reporter Neville Turlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup saw the monitoring of the arrival of Sister Polby.
On June 18, 2005, Colson told them through a Wais Samuel: "I've got a store that we're planning to run tomorrow, which I'd definitely want to talk to Charles about."
Mr. Addis said that colson's involvement in this case is only in the partnership of other important individuals, such as former home archive David Blanket.
The judge told the teacher that Colson spoke to Mr. Blanket about marital relations with a married woman, while he was seeing the case of co-op Rebecca Brooks who were then married.
Colson and Brooks refused to contact other people to make telephone calls between October 3 200 and August 9, 2006.
Mulkair, Thurlback and Interup have accepted phone hacking.

In all the reports by Mr. Snodon, however, there is no evidence to date that America went to the business secrets of foreign companies for its companies.
Politicians have expressed concern about the lack of Internet capabilities of the European Union and should try to reduce their dependence on America.
The business leaders of the world are doubting this.
Someone in the German parliament said we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly reopen them...
Haso Platner, president of the German Business Software Company SAP, said, "This is no way,"
If anyone wanted a strong European IT industry, he would not be allowed to die 20 years ago.
In Germany, everything goes smoothly, from coal to car, to whales.
But the IT industry is everything.
Snodon has openly proved to be an attack by some companies on U.S. technology and social access that was previously believed to be at the greatest risk of surveillance.
A major change is taking place in the cloud computing sector, where European officials are more vigilant that the collected data in the United States is subject to that jurisdiction and are thus likely to become sensitive.
Cloud Security Alliances, according to a survey conducted by a trade organization, some 10 percent of non-American members cancelled their plan to use an American-based cloud vendor after opening up the data promulgated crime program.
Jim Snabe, chief executives with SAP, say, "We have seen a new question that customers didn't come a year ago – that's what - my data said is stored? And can you guarantee that this will remain physically in that area?"
Many German officials argue that the latest report is just confirming whether they already knew: that the powerful kingdom wants to steal their most secure secrets and data and should therefore be guarded at all costs.
It's not a surprise that the economy is being exploited.
It's always happened.
"It's been a topic for many years, and through the original current discussion, nothing has changed," says Kurt Bock, chief executive of the chemical manufacturer BASF.
America boasts us at a commercial and industrial level, and so do we, because it is in the national interest to protect our business.
Corporate leaders generally don't want the security system and it's a benefit to the attacker.
For large companies, the message is being recorded for a long time, even though it is not easy to leave one in the house business by taking usb stick, or leaving a laptop bepanah in a hotel room to say less.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the board of car makers Od, says that this is an old system before board meetings to collect mobile phones because their use could not be as remote audio devices.
Germany's BfV operator, while Smart Phones are agreeing to use simple prepaid mobiles, is recommending that you consider using smart phones abroad.
Preped mobile phone was dropped later.
While small and medium-sized companies are at risk of hacking and monitoring it is a matter of concern.
In Germany, this company is located in the global market in a special place.
"Small and medium-sized companies often warn against lack of experience, workers and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets," BfV warns in a report.
America has warned other countries about its own financial assets.
According to France The Washington Post, in February, the name of the U.S. National Chufia with Russia and Israel, after China's financial reporting, was named in another tire of related criminals in hacking.
According to a German Blue Chip Company board member when it comes to making money, "French are the worst."
Bernard Squarcini French Interior Agency DCRI, former head of the witness, says: "Services are well aware that all countries are involved in a non-terrorist war, and overlook their partners."
America boasts us at a commercial and industrial level, and so do we, because it is in the national interest to protect our business.
Don't make any fool.
The parents of Georgia's teenager who was killed in the "unbelievable accident" believed their son was killed
A teenager in Georgia whose dead body was found wrapped in a restaurant mat in his high school Jim believes his son was killed, the family leader told the teacher.
Weldosta, J.A., was arrested on January 11 within his high school Jim, right behind Blechers.
London County Sheriff's investigators concluded that Johnson was dead in an 'unique' accident, but the 17-year-old boy's family denied it.
Benjamin Rape, who presented Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson, told Fox News Dotcom that "they must fully believe that their son has been killed."
They don't trust death in the way that Sheriff told them.
Rape said, "They believe that this is beyond the logic of physical law and common sense."
They believe that this conclusion is an excuse for the death of their son or for the protection of people.
They said, "They sent their son to school with a bookback, and he went back to a body bag."
U.S. Prime Minister Michael Mulre told the teacher that he was investigating an official on Johnson's death, as many important questions were answered.
What was the cause of death?
Was his murder a result of a crime?
Myrre said these words to my teacher at a newspaper conference in the afternoon.
I will follow the truth. They will lead us wherever they are.
My purpose is to bring forth the truth.
They said, "I think there's an environmental reason for an official investigation."
Mure told the reporter that the initial test showed that Johnson's death resulted from "state fever".
According to Mure, another cause of death was found in a second saw test."
They said, "There are many questions that should be answered or confirmed."
Mure also said that if he finds sufficient witnesses to request a criminal in the case of Johnson's death or to investigate civil rights, he will ask the F.B.I. to do so.
When a contact was made on Thursday, the delegate was not immediately available from the London County Sheriff's office for comments.
On Wednesday, the South Georgia judge ordered officials to release all surveillance videos reviewed by investigators.
The boy's parents say they hope that the video footage will give some indication of how his death occurred.
C.C. continued the children's allergic direction to children
On Wednesday, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention issued guidance to control children's food allergy at the school.
The U.S. government has released guidelines for the first time because the number of children attending the school is increasing.
Now in the U.S., one child has food allergy.
C.D.C. found that between 1997 and 2007, children had increased 18 percent in food allergy cases.
This guide informs students how teachers and workers should be informed about children's food allergy, and how to manage it in the event of an allergic reaction.
The students are also suggested to keep the Epinephrine stock in order to deal with possibly life-threatening typhylaxis (anaphylaxis), which is an autoinjector of the Appen Brand, which is usually used.
The Kingdom resolution has recently been updated in laws that allow students to keep the stock of Epiphany more easily.
This report also contains a list of common signs that are transmitted by children affected by an allergic reaction.
Children can say, "It seems like something's going on in my tongue," "It seems like there's hair on my tongue," or, "It's going to be on my tongue."
Intersex children's parents can choose their children's ‘undefined’ sex
Germany has become the first European Union country to approve the third sex for children born with indistinct genes.
The newborn will no longer be specified by male or female in a parental way.
Under the new law, parents do not need to announce sex for such children, this law allows them to declare sex "unspecified" or "unspecified" on the child's birth certificate.
The aim of the new law is to reduce the pressure on parents who can make decisions regarding sex-specification for newborns in a hurry, and to combat discrimination against intersex children.
According to B.C., an intersex person said years later, "I am neither a man nor a woman."
I'm going to be a pain in the ass made by doctors.
One child is born to one of two thousand, each year not having a son or a daughter.
They are intersex, part of a group of nearly 60 situations, which involves testing sexually developed diseases, a common word that is used for unusual characteristics, genetics (indangible or reproductive) or unusually developed sex.
Maybe Wallace Simpson is intersexing.
Gender identification is not yet fully understood, but most experts in the United States believe that when sex cannot be determined, it is better to use the best information available to specify sex and to perform surgery, if such a change occurs, to monitor the psychological and physical development of the child.
Dr. Jack Dresser of New York City Psychology, who is a specialist in sex issues, said that Germany's new law "seems good."
Intersex children create moral imbalances.
They said, “Some people are in a state of ill health, and they need medical attention, but most of them do not have children.”
You can specify sex without surgery, and then see how identification develops.
The science of how any sex in a child will develop is not very accurate.
No one can properly answer why it is.
It's a kind of puzzle why people get gay.
The report submitted to the European Commission in 2011 describes intersex people as being different from transsexual or transgender people, because their situation is not related to sex, but is related to the design of their lives, which is not clearly male, but is either a female or both, or is not clearly defined.
These characteristics can show themselves secondary sexual imagery, such as weight of the muscles, the distribution of the hair, the column and length; primary sexual imagery such as reproductive limbs and genitalia; or qualitative structure and hormone.
This report provides insight into the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in the labour field, as well as about oppression, violence and biased crimes.
Now there are special camps for boys who don't have sex.
Australia and Nepal have already allowed elderly people to mark men, women or "third sex" on their official documents.
In June, 52-year-old Australian Nori May-Walby became the world's first recognized "lingless" person after winning the "unspecified" sex class for life.
According to the interior ministry, there will be a third specification for M or F in the German passport as well as for intersex persons as X.
According to the news report on France 24, issues related to sex in the neighbouring country of France are still controversial.
In 2011, French method designers from this strictly Catholic country signed the "Ling Principles" in order to return from the university's books.
The website of the U.S. Catholic Online has also opposed this German law, saying, "While the world is going to be in a position where sex is the choice of its own, but not of action, we're taking two columns in the opposite direction."
In Maryland, the mother of a newborn baby also told Baby John that she would like to see sex specified at birth.
He said about parenting on the website, "The parenting is very stressful without any limits, especially if you don't even know what your child's sex is."
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born with both genders were called Harmafrodites (Ubillingi), a beautiful Greek god named Divilingi.
And less than a decade ago, the medical world considered sex to be a slat that could be removed and rewritten.
But now many people are challenging the morality of surgery, they understand that sex is complex work, and sometimes even doctors may be wrong, who don't know how children will feel about their gender specification when they grow up.
Drescher says "in the middle of the 20th century, it was called "monorogen early".
When these children were born, you didn't call the psychiatrist, you called the surgeon.
The current principle of treatment for indistinct genital mutilation was presented by Dr. John Mani, of John Hepkins University, who considered sex to be an aberrant.
They gave the word "ling identification" and argued how social and environmental signs -- how parents raise the child -- interacting with the child's genes and hormones to identify him as a man or as a woman.
But in a 1966 case, which is known as "John/Joan", the principles became controversial.
He advised a child whose parents had had an accident during the sex relationship (sirculation) to tie the child in full and release the child and like a red-palon girl.
Dresser said, "Manny presented the matter as a success case, but he did not."
At the age of 15, the child returned to become a man and married a woman.
But when he was 38 years old, he committed suicide.
Dresser said some doctors are still "following the same image".
But with the arrival of the Internet in the 1990s, these sex healers began to "not happy with the results."
This was the case with 36-year-old author Jim Bruce of Montana, who was born with X.wai.
Doctors did not clearly understand that his sex was small, or his cousin was great, but they were sure he could never live "satisfying life" as a man.
Thus, shortly after her birth in 1976, she was excommunicated from outside Bruce's limbs and angina, and became like her adult daughter.
He was given a female hormone in 12 years of age.
He said to ABCNews.com, "I knew I wasn't a girl."
I wasn't happy, but it was very difficult to question.
In 18 years of age, she was going to have Vizinoplastics with her.
But feeling unwell and some confusion, he asked for medical records.
This led him to learn the terrible truth.
When I was born, I was bound and nobody ever told me.
Bruce was born with D.S.D., who prevented his body from producing enough testosterone, causing his genes to fail to develop properly.
After learning the truth, he became a man again, he took testosterone's shirt and removed his tooth.
He's gone for surgery.
Today, he explains to people about intersex people in an organisation called the Interface Project to make their opinion normal.
However, the California-based state-of-the-art group Advocates For Infomd Quiz expresses concern that the German law "invites chipi and kangaroo."
They say, "Many activists think that the German law will move parents and children to specify "undetermined."
We fear that this will encourage action.
We think it's better to specify a male or female sex than to wait.
But we don't know how the law will play its role, so we can only assume.
Tamer-Matis said their organization supports the Australian law because "it allows adults to get to know the third sex."
He said, "Adolescents should be able to make their own decisions about medical sex."
The law of Germany relates to specifying the time of birth.
It's not a war to be fought by newborn children at this time.
When they grow up, they can make their own body-related decisions.
But Pittsburgh's tin radiologist Dr. Erlin Baratz, whose daughter is in the process of developing, and who helps hundreds of others in the support group, said that Germany's law would "give power to both parents and children."
The daughter of Katy man of Baratz had been born with qualities, but she had a complete androgen insensitiveness called D.S.D.
Since his androids were faulty in Greece, the female embolism in Katy developed.
Jonah is in her body, but she is not pregnant or obese.
Now 29 years old Kate is married and resident at the University of Pennsylvania in the Department of Child Psychology.
Although she is pregnant, she expects to get well or become a mother through Gestational Disease.
He said, "This is a law that enables parents not to make a decision without delay."
It gives them time to understand and understand through some tests before writing 'man' or 'woman'.
So, you're okay - raise the child, love the child.
You have a love child and enjoy it.
We don't need to do any medical treatment that can't be returned immediately.
They said: "This (the will) gives birth to sons, and frees (their parents) from anguish, because they do not believe that they are doing right."
Finally, the child will determine with which sex she is easier -- and it will be very good.
It enables children to make their own decisions.
The Committee's Chairman and all judges of the Sandip Qahar were organized in the middle school camp of Ramangar, in the middle school camp, under the chairmanship of the Thai Legal Service Committee of Ramangir.
In which students and others were informed of the law for the rights of education and economically for those who were left behind.
In the camp, Advocate Emil Kupta, Rohan Indian, and Sarpuch woke up people speaking on the subject.
A large number of villagers were present in the program.
Report: Think of Biden dumping Obama’s campaign for Hillary’s client.
According to the New York Times, the close advisers of President Barack Obama quietly considered Hillary Clinton’s 2012 ticket instead of Vice President Kelly Biden.
The most remarkable threat in the mystery opening is that Mark Halperin and John Helman expect the 2012 campaign Tom, "Double Down: Change Game 2012."
Times received a copy of the next book and announced on Thursday evening that the president's top advisors could help Obama to find out what dumping biden could help to organize "a wide range of group sessions and late 2011" in the hope of re-election.
According to National Political Dialoguer Jonathan Martin, the book is full of information on the efforts made by the chief officials to put ahead of the White House, the head of the former White House staff, to know what the change from the vice president of the former government has to do with Paul’s change.
The possible switch was a very secure secret within the basic framework of the Chicago campaign and within the Oval Office.
Only half of the President-in-Office – including close advisors – knew about changes in East Obama's campaign chief Jim Masina, and East White House counselors David Axlerrod and David Plouffe.
"Double Down" claims that the Drop tried to change Biden in spite of their personal status before finally deciding when they were reporting that there would be no improvement in Obama's situation from the client's ticket.
In a testimony with Martin, Dale has confirmed that the administration had actually considered the client's place with Biden.
"I said, keeping an eye on the whole view, and one of them, it was," he said to the newspaper.
Remember that the president was in danger at that time, and we were in such a position as to say, "Holy Christ, what more shall we do?"
While Falle told the research as "warning," Martin told the CNN's Anderson Cooper that the election campaign again introduced a significant effort to find how much this claim would benefit from being a Pole.
"The campaign did not spend money and attention on central groups as long as they were seriously considering something," Martin told C360.
It's unclear, recently, what Obama knew their team was looking for.
Martin told CNN that they had asked him if he knew about the possible change in their boss?
While he said they didn't think the president knew about possible changes," former Chief of Staff admitted it was "possible" that Obama knew.
"Double Down" is certain: won't answer whether Obama's political investigation has reached the desk? Martin further explained.
Cooper asked Martin if he didn't know seriously about Obama's dumping ticket investigation.
"Probably," said Martin.
Does Glo-In-De-Dark Like Cream?
A British inventor used the world's first Glo-in-Dia-Dark Ice Cream-Jelifish.
Charlie Francis has benefited greatly from the marine animals to develop better habitats.
He came up with this idea after reading a search letter on Zelipish, and China's confident scientists used chemical light to re-light the protein.
This cream will increase the PCP level of the protein by reacting with the eating language and will brighten the ice cream.
Chris says ice cream is glowing with a warm reaction to the mouth, that is, more chatting, so much more will be glowing.
Lick I, the founder of the M Dellius Ice cream company, said: "This is incredible, but the production of the early days will get me about 2 grams of material from £200."
The protein we are using in ice cream will react with neutral PCH in the language.
As soon as the face is warmed, the protein peach levels will increase and ice cream will shine.
We've been investigating it for the past few months and it's been looking really good to share it with Halloween because it has a wonderful effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream that's ever made because the yellowish's light is four times more expensive than gold.
So I have to pay about 140 pounds each.
But the taste of it is good.
Apne is known for its unusual taste, based on Charlie's Bristol-based commercial company, beer, cheese, meat and gold.
But its next design is going to be more important.
He said, "I really wanted to develop an invisible ice cream."
It's natural impossible because of ice crystals that make ice cream aberration, but I think we'll find a way to do it.
This cream is used as a imitation of a gelifish, which is analyzed by Chinese scientists
The Queen's garden market was full of customers.
It was recently that people had to wait 15 to 20 minutes to buy cargo.
This is the recent Vajerpur, the city's ruins, the riverpur, the Ashok Bridge Central Market, and the Pacific Bridge in the Central Market.
Some of them were visited by Pitmpura, Ashok Bridge, and Sarrafa shops in Model Town.
They also bought gold, and silver, and precious stones, and vessels.
That's why the outside ring was also stuck in other shops with Rod.
Although it took hours to get home from office.
BY AWAKE! WRITER IN HELLOVEN 2013
When I was a kid, Halloween was magic.
My sister and I were allowed to play dress up for our neighbors to eat, stay quiet for a while, and play.

These options include -- upgraded break, service package that provides baller work mechanics, logistic support, and access to the vehicle collection between events.
Dr. Baller, Managing Director of Motorsport, said: "Raily customers coming to Baller have changed."
They are not all experienced racers, but are people who are searching for ways to reach the direction of exciting and Roman and global events.

The dream of tradesmen in Pataka market in transport Aria is not over.
The Krakow merchants are trapped in fun after the command of Heicourt.
They cannot now operate in the temporary patent market created in the rank of Avenue, nor have they been licensed to operate in Transport Aria.
The Commission, organised by Punjab and Haryanha Heicourt, announced the temporary Pakthu Market, classified as insecure during its tour.
And the captain of the guard took up ten thousand pieces of silver, because there was no proper management there.
In his order, Heicourt has called on the authorities of the Immortals to condemn what administration has not been able to solve a problem for nine years.
They could not be made available in the city.
After that, shipowners were asked to issue a licence for business in the shipping market.
After the order, the bakers were pleased, but on Friday, the police returned to their joy.
The real police license branch team came to the patch market and sold a farm on the counter there.
What they were told then was impossible to meet in one day.
The CIP East Gorg, the Ingenuity of the License Branch, Unup Kumar, SCHO Sultanwind, entered the Shama Patach market.
They expressed dissatisfaction with the arrangements made by trade unions.
Therefore, no licenses were issued to patent traders.
The lamp has one day left.
It's a busy business.
They're looking at millions of lost money.
The greedy merchants say, "If they have lost millions of silver, they will complain against the government."
Angry barbarians pulled out of the ship on Friday night, from the shipyard to the reddish avenue.
The police and the Gila government have been working against it.

On one farm, a fire department was called to protect a lost pipe at the face of a stormy mountain.
The Koker Spanil Ruby was away after arriving in a small street corner.
He was seen by a dog Walker in the grave three days later
Fireworkers brought down the stone from the bush to protect the dog from death
After being captured by the Pope from some sort of ground on 50 feet above the face of a troubled mountain, he was given a life of happiness from being called firemen.
For nine months, the Koker Spanil Ruby had fled on Sunday afternoon after arriving in a street corner and three days alone before being rescued from the field.
His master Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, Denhome, were at the flepite pit in West Yorkshire to meet him again, and he has blessed the West Yorkshire fire and the rescue service.
After a small accident, they had been looking like crazy people for their lost dog, and there was an appeal post on social networking sites.
On Wednesday at 2.15 p.m., a bright - looking Dock Walker looked at Ruby, at 50 feet high from the ground on the ground in the ground.
A technical rescue team came to the scene from the clickheaton fire station and used a pet tube to bring it down from the rock to save Ruby.
Technical Defence Officer Andy Clayton said: ‘It was in a dire situation.
It stood between the middle of the rock, above and below, fifty feet.
He did no mighty work in the days of his salvation: it was a stone.
But now he's good.
After that she was eating biscuits.
It was an unusual call for help.
But it is impossible to see the dog.
Special Technical Defence Officer Peter Loo said: "Ruby has survived in a positive way."
It was possible to be seriously injured or worsened.
Ruby was taken to an animal doctor for testing, where she was found to be better than fatigue and decomposition.
Halifax, from West Yorkshire, Mrs. Hall said: "Seeing the healing work was terrible."
At first I couldn't believe how she got there.
It's amazing to get her back in her hands.
The animal doctor said that if she got too tired and fell, she would certainly fall down.
The fire squad did much better.
What they did is really brave.
We are grateful to them, and they were all better.
Mr. Elderson also said: "We were afraid that she might fall, but she was there."
The fire department has done a great job.
I can't believe how he got there.
Mike Jagger says that when Katy was 18, they did not attack him.
This week, during a witness with Australian radio show, Pon Star said he was singing back vocals for the "Old Hobbits Day Hard" song in Jagar in 2004.
Perry said he had slept with Major Rocker, and "When I was 18, they beat me."
They said: "It is old age, and they treat me well."
A 70-year-old Jagger said in a speech to the teacher that he "clearly refuses to attack Katie Perry ever."
The representative also said, "Perhaps Perry is talking about them in the misunderstanding of someone else."
Paris this year was one of the guest musicians on the Rolling Stone Tour.

George Kerewon: Euro Debate gave Scotts an option
Another Day, Another Story of Fear of Freedom
This time we have been warned that as a condition of U.S. membership, it will require free Scotland to join the whole of Europe as a free travel area.
Port control on Berwick and on the walls of the Hadrian indicate stories about the boundary of the contilla wire.
It is true that the Strathclid Paper described the potential economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, although it has not been described in the - predicted - headlines.
No one described that members spend most of their time changing their professional rules according to their needs.
Since Scotland is no longer an area of peace, Brussels will be constantly set free for non-compliance Brussels instead of getting what it really wants from Scotland.
So, then, A-Kahani.
And the thing that's been stuck for so long has come together. First, I heard "freedom means passport control" about 40 years ago.
Yet this amazing old story is lost.
Why should we expect Europe to be built from a free country?
Why is London's Yok sold for Brussels, especially now?
Here is the real European news: Europe's big, post-war plan has finally stopped.
With the Euro crisis, the project is officially dead.
In the U.S., groups are gaining strength to oppose or close the EU as a currency.
Even in Germany, the Euroskeptile Alternative for German Party -- which has been set up this year -- suddenly received about fifty million votes in the September union election, thus effectively expelled the Free Democrats (our lib demos equivalent) from the Bundestag.
The EU's plans to build Europe are always domestically opposed.
However, the current economic crisis has proved to be a major changer.
As well as the harsh rules imposed by the Berlin and the European Central Bank, many people are thinking that the European project has gone far beyond the obstacles imposed on national economic systems.
There was no much more role in the over-budget loss of national governments than the Euro disaster - only the truth in the case of Greece.
Instead, the EU system has fixed the exchange rate on the part of German exporters - things that German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of home currency underestimation, South Europe finds itself in a situation of internal loss of production compared to Germany.
The only way is to reduce pay and public policy - promoted by Berlin.
Deep European producers suffer from current budgets and money problems.
In order to release French and German energy farms on the consumer's practice -- the "harvet" energy produced by Brussels -- the European industry pays four times for electricity and gas in comparison to the United Nations.
It's a pulsating cost damage that we've seen before in Grangemouth.
Even if all payments are frozen in the world, the European petrochemicals industry cannot save itself from being influenced by the U.S. Shell Gas.
As a result, the feeling of rebellion among the people has been exacerbated, especially in France, which was once the chief of the U.S.
After the war, French top politicians saw the E.U. as a way to control Germany, and Paris as a way to provide a world-wide equivalent billing.
But Berlin now does not need Paris as a passport for political validity, and it has applied its own economic policies to Europe, which is causing the economic downturn of France.
Results: Marine Le Pen's Southern Pan, U.S. opposition national front, has won a third-place ruling socialist in recent subordination.
At this time, France is the most popular group with 24 percent vote -- this is a timely warning to the British Leber that they can't live to believe that the left will benefit automatically for the right.
What is Le Pen French gorillas doing with their newfound reputation among the working class?
The group wants to use the EU elections that will be held next year in the European Parliament.
If, as far as possible, these elections show a good deal of U.S. opposition groups, the group can first influence the European Parliament.
My view is that soon, in Europe, the U.S. and the most loyal currency will put an end to Europe's anti-moneyism.
The euro will not be completely over, but it will be brought back as a "Europe of (Lord) Nations" that will support General De Gall.
Germany and some of its successor economies can maintain the euro, but France and southern Europe will re-launch their currency.
I expect that the US will keep itself away from this project, hoping to increase its proximity with USS.
However, in the Pacific, the growing interest in humigton indicates that Britain will be left in the cold Atlantic.
What will happen next to Scotland?
We can choose to build a small England area (required).
Or we can protect our own financial assets -- including telling Berlin and Brussels to separate at the right time.
I think Scotland can do better in slow European law, provided we keep our own money.
It will be easy to work together with other countries with similar ideas in non-EU countries.
Otherwise we should think about maintaining our economic freedom as we walk along the path of Norway.
In Scotland, S.N.P. government - remarkablely - is the most successful anti-government political campaign in Europe, which won an amazing majority in 2011 on the basis of Tori-Lib Dam Association, which was proposed by the Chancellor of Leber's Elistier Darling.
It would be pointless to vote for freedom at this time for Scotland, because in that situation it will be accepted by the rules of arbitration imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
YOUNG PEOPLE ASK...
Research shows that African-American and Hispanic girls get young compared to girls of their own age.
Physical change does not mean that youth is near
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals can be blamed
Experts believe that rigidity can be one of the causes of youth in less than a year.
Young people are not so effective in pre - Christian times
Former U.N. spokesperson Pat Heathridge is an expert journalist on children's health and family issues.
Should a mother worry, if her daughter develops breast development and develops during the age of 7 or 8 years?
This week in Orlando, Florida, U.S. Children's Medical Academy Annual Assembly, Dr. Paul Caplovitz, explained that these initial physical changes are common in American girls, they show new behavior.
Caplowitz says, "I spend a lot of time giving this trust to the stakeholders -- that it generally does not show rapid progress towards full youth."
It is seen before in the hair of the ear and of the ear, and in the flesh of the nose and of the nose, as well as in the flesh of the nose.
But in the last four decades, there has been a very dramatic change in the era of Revelation (first monthly religion).
In the United States, the average age was 12.5 years, which was 12.75 in 1970.
"When the stems begin to develop, it takes at least two or three years in the first experiment," explains Caplowitz, who is also the author of "the time-before youth in girls: the guidance needed to deal with this common problem."
Youth development is the most accurate test time.
The beginning of youth argues about what it is, but when it's grown with breast development before 8 years old, it's called "child-adult."
In most cases this process will be slowed down or stopped - which children can monitor closely.
In a more rapid state of progress, it may be necessary to test by the endocrinologist to remove the possibility of serious problems such as tumors or the system.
Treatments to delay time-pre-munist religion and other results are: advance age-increasing time-increasing, which can lead to steady growth and aging.
Drug or hormone treatment depends on child life, development rate, growth rate, and emotional age.
Psychological aspects are also important.
The news of Caplowitz's medications is, but they admit, "The pressure of youth can increase, and girls can feel different from their peers."
Another major problem can be understood: affectives do not just want their minor daughter to have a monthly religion.
He said, "They're worried about the risk of pregnancy, or how they'll keep it clean."
A woman whose daughter had started her monthly religion at the age of 10 remembers, "It was a shock."
Although there were signs of this and we were talking about journalism, she wasn't emotionally prepared.
She was afraid of her school and got upset that she had the first monthly religion among her friends.
There are many popular principles about the causes of somatic youth.
However, there is no constant witness to the fact that in milk or other foods, hormones, chemicals, or the media could be accused of being adjudicated.
Boys - just like girls - are getting youth in the past.
Caplowitz determines the rule that it is the main reason for stability.
She helped to conduct a study on girls aged 6 to 9 years in 2001, which adds weight to youth.
Other results support this conclusion, but there are many other factors contributing to it.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to get young girls before their lifetime.
There are many explanations of this.
At a global level, the representation of time-before-youth, from economic situations to climate and genders, appears to be influenced by all things.
Other puzzles: Even though boys grow up with face and gender, the behavior of young men is not as clear as they are.
Other doctors attending the A.P. assembly supported complexities of the subject.
Even among children and babes it is common to see both the naked and the bear.
"We need to be careful about how we recognize the real beginning of youth."
In order to make the parents feel better about this, you should not hesitate to take guidance from your child’s doctor how to talk to your children.
Caplowitz advised, "This may mean talking before the expected time."
If you remain silent, your child will usually answer correctly.
Pre-development girls need to be assured that even if this is happening before the time, it is part of normal life.
On Friday, 3.1 degrees Celsius crashed.
And it came to pass on the morrow, that the rain and the cold fell upon the people; and they were sore afraid.
And on the sabbath they went out, clothed in fine linen, and went out to their villages.
The rains of the cold have taken away light.
And in the morning, when the people saw the sun, they rejoiced.
When the weather changes, including the disease and the disease, there will be plenty of relief, but after that, the sun will continue to burn all day long.
The children also came to their school wearing sweatshirts.
There, according to the Airfors Weather Department, the maximum temperature was 25.1 degrees Celsius and the minimum temperature was 13.7 degrees Celsius.
While 7.8 millimetres of rain has been recorded.
The clouds will continue to cover the sky according to the weather.
For the width of the seat, there is a dialogue on the large orders of jet manufacturers.
There is a gap between the above-mentioned aircraft manufacturers for the width of the passenger-class seats for long-distance flights between the two-month-year-olds and the two-month-olds.
In long flights, there is a focus on the width of the seat of the economic class, not always as if given by Airlines but whose assigned location has claimed to be key to the latter jet Arbas SAS and Boing company.
Erbus this week has an extended seat of at least 18 inches (46 cm) in Economic Cabin, which is expected by the industry standard, but it should be determined by the Airlines by its chief protest Boing.
It comes between the air traffic controllers when a large version of the aircraft was sold from a long distance from the order after a possible 17-21 event.
How is the last section of the plane constructed? In particular, whether the seat is 9 or 10 is equal to more capacity, considering the design of the mini jumbo jets?
Boing says it's "777 X" that will keep 406 people 17 in width and 10 in a row in the same compartment.
Airbus says that, with A350, it will take 350 people to a 9-inch seat left.
Airplanes often engage in commercials through advertising.
Now, with Airbus 777 X, there is hope to be more than 100 orders in Duboi Arsho, which is appealing to the public.
Recently it's been seen that there's anything going on at the beginning of the war, showing this to the Fencers together in a restaurant. Would you accept it together?
Aerbus sales chief John Leigh said that "Boing is also flying long distances from regional turbo".
As a change, people are getting better, but there's no way to sit.
According to U.S. health statistics, between the 1970 ’ s, when Boing 747 Jombo ne modern - day travels were defined as tha, with an average of 40 - 49 - year - old male weight increased by 10 percent.
According to U.S. Health Statistics, the average male in the 21st century is 39.7 in the United States.
Aerbus says it is stuck with a 1950 seat position when the new name was the average band of "jet set" .
Airbus says they have set up a research commission to suggest improvements in the quality of 53 percent sleep in the width of the seat.
Boing argued on Airbus's seat size data, saying that it does not depend on the decision of the manufacturers how to rent Airlines and make a balance between the facilities.
It also says, the research reveals that more than one seat's width depends on the experience of kabin.
Boing Cabin expert Kent Craver said, "It actually tells airlines what they need to do to be successful and what they believe they need to do."
"They don't want to tell us what's good for them."
They know their business better than anyone else.
It's about the corner room for Fliers, but it's a quick point for suppliers that this might affect IE.
At least 700 billion dollars of trade after this dispute is estimated to be sufficient in the coming decades to comment on the American and European export balance.
The first time in July to report on the Reuters, what is the issue of whether the seat layout really is a battle between new jet planes.
Airbus and Boing claimed 20 per cent of their new joint engine design leader, 365-Cit Boing, compared to 777-300 years ago.
Boing’s claim is based on a 10 - vol. 777 x - van - base 9 - vol. 777 design.
The same value is now used to compare 10 equal to the profit.
Kevin Keniston, Europe's Airbus Traveller's head, says, "Boing's flying is making it more competitive with our products and more seats."
On the other hand, analysts say that the whole 10-seat line-up for the current 777 S suggests that many travelers are on the side of the Denser Layout, who can go with the rest.
Kevin's internal expert, my carbie, the founder and editor's Runwee's network "will be very good for 18-inch seat width travelers, but the fact is that this commercial point of Airbus is run by the threat of 777."
Airbus and Boing do not provide seats but provide a list of providers for Airlines.
Even the jet sellers around the world are careful to check out this leouts competition.
More relaxedly, all the buildings are also providing high-density flights for low-cost flight services and regional travel.
Aerbus is giving a 10 equal A350 but they say it's not sold yet.
But until recently, Airbus insisted on some of its jet flights on large cabin seats to provide more cabin facilities.
It is not possible to fly a new industry standard without the support of another manufacturer of modern jet planes, but it can be diverted by 777 X sales waves.
New anti-Nicotine vaccines can end the joy of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotinic vaccine that can end the fun of smoking.
The same strain of vaccine was able to keep mice safe from Nicotine's bed for the rest of their lives.
Prior to the initiation of human tests, and the need for tests, which may take several years, Professor Ronald Crystal of the University of New York Medical College said that initial signs are positive.
Professor Cornell said, "We are very much hoping that this kind of vaccine strategy can ultimately help millions of smokers who have tried to quit using all the existing methods in the market today, but they found that nicotine is more powerful than these current methods."
The new vaccine has a virus that has been prepared to provide reproductive information for the purpose of creating anti-nicotinic antibodies.
This virus, selectively engineered cells, starts creating a permanent stream of antibodies after it.
Antibodies search for any nicotine molecule in the blood, and prevents nicotine from standing at the bottom of nicotine within the smoker by infecting them before they reach the brain.
In the test, vaccines given to mice that were later given nicotine continued to perform their normal function.
Researchers say that the dog that was not given the vaccine was "well", a sign that nicotine had reached its brain.
This use was described in the journal Science Translation Medicine.
The vaccines of the previous tobacco had failed because they had antibodies.
It had to be done at regular intervals in order to maintain the antibodies level, but it turned out to be great and uninhabitable.
But the cost of the new vaccine is expected to be high, because it will make the artificial cell a factory of antibodies.
Professor Crystal said that if the human virus of the future remained completely safe, it could be given to children before they were tempted to smoke, thereby saving them from nicotine.
But it will probably be used by smokers to quit smoking.
They said, "They will know that if they start smoking again, they will find no pleasure in smoking because of nicotine vaccines, which can help save their habit.
British scientists have reported the results interestingly, but warned of the need to be searched much more.
Even after Postmartm, the real cause of Bagin''s death could not be hidden.
The forest department is naturally describing the death of Bagin, giving a powerful answer to this question.
On Thursday night, the workers of the forest of Ramangir Von Pradesh found a garden tree near the river Knervasn Reservoir.
There were no signs of injury or of injury on him, except that all the members of the branch of Bashan were secure.
On Friday, the Forest Protector's conscience was replaced by CTIR's Vice-President Bodala, DFO Qaksha Nizim, and CTIR's animal health and animal health care in the presence of CTIR.
According to sources, the interior foam of the garden is reported to be damaged during the post-mortem period.
It didn't seem to know the real causes of the home's death.
The district officials were responding to the death of Bagin.
However, the internal limbs of the Bagin have been sent to IVIRI Brazil for a topsiological test to confirm the presence of the pit.
The West Wharf said that the death of Bagin can only be described as natural.
There's no sign of the beginning of the Basin.
However, it is also sent to Bisra to confirm that the area around it is being searched.
The tripods deny that we are being influenced by Obide.
Former NSW Labour Minister Joe Tripod will be tested by State Corps Watchdog.
Former NSW Labour Minister Joe Tripodi has refused to appeal to his political master E.O.I.D.O.D., former protector of New South Wales, E.O.D., whose government-controlled role was self-relianced in three roles.
On Friday, the IAC went to check whether Mr. Obide had violated several government ministers for violations of the policy of patriarchs? Where the two restaurants and cafes owned by Obide were located after their expiry in August 2005 without tender.
Lin Asphole, the former Deputy Chief of Staff, after the testimony of the teacher that Mr. Tripody knew of Mr. Obid's hidden selfishness of the charge?
During the years of the talks in 2005, the government had pressured public tenders to be launched.
The cops were against it, and they wanted more time.
In 2009, the company of the teacher for the boards, with which Obied earned 2.5 million dollars a year, was renovated from the tender without the boards.
Mr. Tripody, who served as the Minister of Railways from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially in favour of Public Tender.
But they refused to change at Mr. Obide's request, Mr. Tripody had called for a change in government policy.
Mr. Obid and Mr. Tripod and Mr. Steve Dan, a senior officer who came to the section of Mr. Obid in August and September 2007 after serving in the port ministry
An assistant, Anthony Wheely, asked Mr. Tripodi. "Was the phone conversation about the development of commercial policy being discussed?"
"No," Mr. Tripod answered.
I couldn't remember what the discussion was, but it was definitely not.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obide.
Officials say that Israeli warplanes fled to Syria.
The Israeli warplanes set the city of Latakia at the port of Syria on the night of Thursday, a chief administrative officer confirmed the Fox News.
The officer didn't tell us what the plan was, but there was at least one goal.
The report of the Associated Press reports that the target was the Russian missile SA-125.
Israel has attacked the missiles in Syria at least twice this year.
Foreign workers can pass an "authentic" test on 457 V.A.
The government is considering an "authenticity" test for foreign workers on 457 Vja, as it aims to extend a harsh operation.
If adopted, this test will be carried out by means of a command issued to prevent 457 family and friends who will be used in order to fill out or perform informal positions in Australia.
Today, a government discussion letter was issued, condemning the government's former liberator M.P. Maxine McQu, who said it might upset the neighboring countries of Australia.
He told the American Institute today that "foreigners are coming to the end of Qatar" and that "Australian people are going to work before" is a very bad time when the Union has demanded a safe trade."
Historically, it was the assumption that white workers should be protected -- and if some people in the area had seen the response to that historic witness, I would not be surprised.
The discussion paper shows the outline of 12 measures previously considered by Prime Minister Chris Boven.
Foreign Minister Brandon O'Conner, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he met with officials about the people who spoke, has activated five constitutional changes, while the rest are questioned.
If the "certificate" command is adopted, the verification of the applicant may be made as to "what number is true in situations where the named person, the owner or the associated person, or the associated person, is associated with the designated person."
Businesses may need to count the number of 457 powerholders, because the former businessmen who wanted to project workers at least had hundreds of people at work.
During this time, 35-year-old Sri Lankan refugee, died of a related heart attack on Christmas Island this week.
And his nine year old son was there with him in the way; and on the morrow after the death of his father his brother his mother, his mother's brother, his mother's brother.
Australian officials brought him to Christmas Island, where he died.
The British government has announced a study to increase the benefits of the HS2 rail project in Scotland.
The HS2 works for high-speed services in the northern part of Scotland and England, which will soon begin with the first step in 2026.
Minister of Transport Birones Kremer said the project would be "British One."
Minister of Transport Keith Brown of Scotland said they are very "encouraged" by working with the British government on the project.
The first step will include a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.
When the second step is completed, the lines reach Manchester and Lids.
In June, the government revised the cost of building a high-speed link between London and Northern England with £31.7 billion and revised £42.6 billion.
The British government, which was talking with Scotland Transport, ordered the HS2 Limited to consider rail capacity and travel time and the possibility of improving.
This includes the possibility of a three-hour trip from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Byrones Kremer says: "Our goal for HS2 is a real national network that will bring the Yukon and its cities closer together."
We're moving forward with HS2, because it's going to be much more profitable.
Without it, we will face problems related to the capacity of our rail network.
But it is also about the connectivity of 18 cities in Britain with Glasgow and Edinburgh, which will be linked to HS2.
According to the Scottish archive Elistier Carmik: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown appealed to Mr. Carmikl for "clear" Scotland's return to the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: "Scotland is likely to benefit heavily from high-speed trains, but this will increase its economic burden on Scotland in the whole of Britain.
Therefore, we are encouraged to work in partnership with the British government so that we can check options to bring high-speed rails to Scotland, create benefits for all, and implement the Glasgow-Edinburg line, which the Scottish government is already planning.
I am ready to review the test report with the British government ministers next year and to decide together on future action.
Air - power regulations will now be effective in Australia
Despite the gentle steps taken in device-related arrangements in the US, Australian air passengers must continue to shut down their tablets and smartphones while flying and flying.
The U.S. Air Force has left open the option to change its processes to enable US Air Service companies to read, watch videos or play games on their devices during important flight steps, provided they remain in "Air".
Travelers can still do this during many flights, but many people do not like being able to reach their e-book at the time of flying and flying.
Australian air service companies are considering this decision, according to which U.S. air service companies will do much more to meet this need, but they have indicated that they have no immediate plan to change their processes.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said that it is considering the announcement, but stressed that there are still restrictions on the use of electrical devices in major flight steps in Australia.
"At CASA, there is no specific arrangement to control the use of electrical devices in the air," the authorization said, "this is the subject of regulations, according to which air service companies must ensure that the security system has always been fully established, and that passengers must comply with the security instructions given by the members of the driver's team."
Virgin, who is already talking to CASA about expanding her in-flight wi-fi entertainment system, is ready to follow this change, but she said to move forward on the manager's instructions.
The speaker said, "We will welcome a review by CASA on the use of electrical devices, because we really think it will give customers a better experience, because now we have (Viarless In-Flight Entertainment) on our flights.
Quantas said that it will now comply with the current rules.
He said, "We don't have an immediate plan to change it when flying and flying, according to our current policy."
FAA decisions apply to U.S. Allerlines.
So, we're always interested in dynamic developments that can benefit travelers and we'll definitely think about FAA's decisions and the reasons behind them.
The impact of this decision will be different on each U.S. air service company and will depend on their flight time.
Air service companies will need to certify that their aircraft can tolerate radio operation with mobile devices, as well as to review their rules books, training materials, car-on-bags program and short details for travellers.
FAA said, "After confirming their airline's patience, it will allow passengers to use light weight electric devices such as tablets, e-readers and smartphones on all heights."
In rare cases of low visibility, the pilot team will order the aircraft to shut down its equipment while landing passengers.
The group has also suggested that heavy equipment should be placed safely below the seat or in the upper decks while flying and landing.
The money of the Pohnbrokers because of the difficulty experienced by the middle class in Singapore
Janny Amirthalinga, at the Bendemier shopping center in Singapore, is taking her gold, fingers, and nails to pay for her daughter's school fiss.
She said, “My husband and I have recently purchased a house, so our money is trapped in it.”
They say that although they buy 3,000 Singapore dollars (U.S. dollars) as administrators and their husbands also work, the family's monthly income is not enough.
In fact, in parts of South-East Asia -- where domestic loans are increasing -- Volumemax, where they are investing, became the third panshop on Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
It's not the only way to get a drop -- in the case of Sister Amirthalinga, 1,300 Singapore dollars -- but in almost unsecured bank loans.
In Singapore, panbrokers generally make 17 per cent a year, which is slightly higher than 15.4 per cent of the United Supervisory Bank, which is a local lender with a branch in the same shopping center.
However, Ponbrokers have no benefit from the credit check or the need for proof, and they can make more money available faster than the bank.
In this area, millions of people are ponshop-supplying because of the rising cost of living by families and households and consumer loans.
For five years after the global financial crisis, strong growth, and simple maritime policy in developed economies, have been halted by low- and medium-sized families, following a steady decline in credit lines, to meet their needs.
This week's rating agency, Standards Ange Powers, was particularly critical of the increase in household profits due to the increase in the number of banks in Asia.
He said that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest domestic debt ratio in Asia.
Malaysia is up to 80 percent of GDP, while in 2008 it was 60 percent.
Economist Thailand is concerned about high levels of consumer loans, which are slightly rising this week from the technical point of view.
On Thursday, data has been constantly exported and user demand has declined.
The Malaysian Bank, C.I.M.B., said: "The crucial point is that with increased prices, people coming into the lower classes will try to increase their income as much as possible."
In the last two years, high values of gold have historically led people to capture personal property because they are taking advantage of the opportunity to lose the value of their family possessions.
In Singapore, there are 70 percent of gold items trapped in 200 pounds of city-state.
People say, "The feeling of hearing is good. Let's keep your grandmother's gold ring down, and take it back next month.
The largest panshop operator in Thailand, Ejimney, has seen a 20 percent increase in the number of customers using their outlet in recent months.
There is such an increase in the fallout business that the director of Outlet in Bendimire and in Singapore, such as 15 others, not only in their neighbors, are planning to expand in Malaysia where it has four shops, but also plans to expand outside Asia, says Volmix's executive director Yah Le Ching.
The company will use 60 per cent of Singapore's $66 million on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week's listing.
While some discount Landers (the lender) have been affected by high interest rates, Sister Yah says that not only does the rate of falling fall from other lenders remain constant, but it does not increase clearly in the loan.
They say, "The customers have fallen into things that they already have, and the loss of personal property does not increase in household debt.
Social acceptance of ponbroking for short-term and safe financial assistance is increasing.
It's not that Ponnbrokers only use economically weak people.
The wealthy in Singapore also use the Volumex Outlet, which they have dropped gold bars or Rolex hours to pay up to 60 percent of their purchases.
We have customers from all classes of society.
Sister Yah says, "It includes rich people who need to borrow for a little while for business or investment, or small businesses who need to meet their own needs."
Sometimes they only need money in very little time.
India's largest business model, Mukesh, is banning Wif Niita, on November 1, 2013, on its 50th birthday.
The Nita are not in Mumbai, but in Mumbai.
They organized a very large party on this occasion.
Many big stars from Bolivia arrived to join this party. On the late evening of October 31st, several large stars were seen flying on Mumbai Airport.
These are the stars of Kishma Kophur, the song of Bozrah, Winod Khnna, and their waif kwieta Kophur, the anointing of Malik, the sugar kophur, the king's princess Hirani, the Raquesh Om Light Mehra, the name of Rahul Bos, etc.
It's obvious that when you join the party, you can count on how much it's going to cost.
325 Million Dollar Protection Package for Taji's Health
The United States has stressed that the current health system in Tasmania is linked to the 325 million-dollar security package, which will ensure that the government cannot destroy the regime.
United Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the National Assembly, the island's elderly population, the high rate of germ diseases, and the system's limits are "quick action" to address the current crisis.
The decision to feed for four years was made after the government's consultation with Andru Wilki, the independent state of Tasmania.
Ms. Plibersek said today, "The government has brought an immediate rescue package, which we believe will meet the special challenges facing the government.
The 325 million dollar package includes an alternative surgery plan of 31 million dollars.
A total of 2,600 additional operations, including orthopaedic and motiabin surgery, will help resolve the previous cases.
In Hobart and Lonstation, it also includes better care, training of medical professionals, mental health services, and personal electronic health archives to start the system.
Ms. Plibersek said, "These interventions are in line with the best ways I can improve the health system of Tasmania by the first doctors."
The minister stressed that the government of Tasmania would face severe reporting and accountability.
The government must maintain the current level of food supply in order to obtain national funds, and report each month on where additional work is being done.
Three members will be organized to ensure that they are served in an effective and efficient manner by the government.
Mr. Wilkey said that 325 million dollars would not mean much more, "until the public health system of Tasmania is actually improved to achieve a more sustainable level."
Yet they commended the government for responding to their urgent request for help, which they brought to the Prime Minister in early May."
Mr. Wilkey said, "I hope the Union's assistance package will be very helpful in separating the government's public health system from the crisis list."
According to the government, these additional alternative processes will mainly reverse recent cuts.
But the Union's refugee health spokesperson Peter Stanton believes today's announcement is "Band-Aid Resolution."
He said to the B.C.T.V., "We're here because the Leber State government has taken 430 million dollars in its health system.
You can't believe that about half a billion dollars are taken by the government and that 300 million dollars are given by the National Assembly as a good news day.
Mr. Dutton asked that Sister Plibersec be guaranteed that no one of the rescue packages will be employed on additional employment.

Observers said Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons capability
The group monitoring Thursday said that Syria has destroyed important devices to build chemical weapons and diesel gas war materials, while there was a heated conflict in northern Syria, which is very close to where poison agents are believed to be.
As well as on Thursday, the Syrian Armed Group said about three years ago, about 120,000 people have been killed since the beginning of the Syrian home war.
This announcement of the chemical weapons ban organization occurred one day before the end of November 1st
The Heg-Stated Organization has designated Damascus to destroy or "make ineffective" the machinery used to produce all chemical weapons and toxic gases and fill the war materials.
The primary completion of the initial phase of destruction is the stone of the Creator's Mill in this major event, which aims to destroy all chemical weapons in Damascus by mid-2014.
Destroying the device means that Syria can no longer build a new chemical weapon.
Although Damascus still has to destroy the existing weapons and the collection.
Syria is now considered to have 1000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons, including Mustard Gas and Norwegian Agent Serine.
The British state of Syrian observatory For Human Rights reported that this announcement occurred at a time when Thursday had increased in the conflict in Sapphira, which experts believe is the center of chemical weapons production as well as storage.
In Syria, a group describing the number of deaths through the network of Antolon in Syria told Thursday that 120,296 people have died.
He said that 6,365 children included 61,067 civilians.
The government has said that 29,954 President Bashar is a member of the army of Asad, 18678 fighters fighting on behalf of the government and 187 Lebanese Hizbullah Ugarit.
He also said that there are 2,202 soldiers in the dead and about 5,375 refugee soldiers, many of whom are foreigners.
On July 25, the UN estimated that nearly 100,000 people have died in the conflict since March 2011.
It hasn't updated the data since then.
This struggle has forced some 20 million people to leave the country.
Asad's army was fighting rebels for weeks in Sapphira, many of which were linked to al-Qaeda groups.
The observatory said that people were murdered on both sides, but clearly didn't say anything.
It represents the threat posed by observers of chemical weapons, who have a mission to end toxic weapons in Syria during the ongoing domestic war.
The O.P.C.W., working with the United Nations, said in a statement that its team "is still satisfied and has confirmed - and has seen all the important products and mixed/filling devices declared by Syria - destroyed."
He also said, "No monitoring plan has been made."
At the beginning of this week, observers said they have completed the first step of confirmatory work on 21 of the 23 centres announced by Damascus.
Observers said they weren't able to go to two centers for security reasons.
On Friday, O.P.C.W. said that, according to Syria, these two centers "have been abandoned and... the chemical weapons products stored there have been brought to other declared centres, which have been monitored."
It was not immediately clear that the unit in Sapphira was one of the two centers, where O.P.D.L. could not be visited.
Syria has submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, to be approved by the O.P.C.D. Working Committee next month.
O.P.D.L., chief director of the monitoring group, Ahmed Uzumku, said, "I welcome the strength and encouragement you have shown by people in fulfilling the most challenging mission you have ever undertaken by this organization."
The house war has been going on for three years, mainly by the government of failure and its security forces, including members of the Alawit sect, and the conflict between rebel Sunni Muslims.
In another event, Rami Abdurrahman, chief of the Abzervetry, said that the Syrian coastal area of Latvia had severely exploded at the Air Defence Centre on Wednesday.
He said that the cause of this explosion is not yet known.
The police have seized Internet registers, web stamps, laptops, and web records.
The Moti City Police has filed a case against all the defendants.
The police commissioner, the Supreme Lion, Gil, said that the arresters included the king's throne of the Moon, the royal head of the city of Havbowal, the royal crown of the Tower, the royal crown of the Temple, the crown of the mountains, the lion of the hill, and the golden crown of the temple.
The registry office (formerly) has been depleted by the Balbir Lion.
According to the police, the charges were taken out of the blank and old land records with Clark and the Recorder Blair Lion by the Office of the Prosecutor's Office and then made a web record on them.
It was not until then that real registers were lost and uploaded to the web record.
And then they sold the land for millions of pieces of money, after they had sold it on the net.
There, they took Lone on the paper.
Then the real owner of the land was seized by police and administration.
Networkers were particularly interested in NARIG’s landfills, which were preparing for registration.
Because there's no one to oversee NARIG's land.
So the network register of those lands is easy to sell.
Police Commissioner Gil reported that the accused reported in the poll that they have prepared network records of around 150.
According to the police, Sargana's group's anti-registrations include fraud and theft.
A cry at the court of the bomber who is recommending the explosion in Bali
In 2002, the 202 people who were killed in the bombing cried out to the bomb blaster's court, saying that the age panel should face the firing squad.
The panel, which has been running away as one of the most wanted in South-East Asia for nearly 10 years, has been announced for its 20-year sentence to build the explosive device used in the bomb explosion.
If the password is given, it can be released within 15 years.
At 45 years of age, two night clubs were attacked in the famous tourist area of Cuta, where 202 people were killed, including 88 Australians, and many were injured.
He was also found guilty of many other charges related to terrorism, including a series of bomb explosions in Indonesia on Christmas's first night in 2000.
The organizers had asked for the trial of Aguivan Karavas, although they could also ask that the death penalty be imposed on this person who is called the "destructive person" as a bomb maker.
This decision renewed the painful memories of a woman living in Perth, Jun Cortin, who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters in a devastating attack by a decade ago and her associates.
By stopping their tears, they said that Pentecost should be put to death.
I really feel that he should have been punished just like other fine terrorists.
Ms. Cortin said to the A.P., "He should be stationed in front of the firing squad."
I live every day without my relatives and my daughters.
On 12 October 2002, just after 11 blogs at night, this club was destroyed after the explosion of the bomb that was loaded outside the entire club.
Peter Hughes was in the pajamas bar 20 seconds before the explosion of the bagpack filled with explosives by the suicide bombers.
As a result of this bomb explosion, they went into a long coma for a month and were "dead" three times while living on life-saving devices.
Mr. Hughes said that the plot should have been the same as the three other members of the Islamic terrorist group, Amorozy, Mukhals and Imam, who were sentenced to death four years ago.
In fact, this person should be executed before anyone else dies.
There is no reason for him to live. Behold, he has no reason to live.
After killing 202 people and hurting countless people, 20 years of punishment is not enough.
The panel is the last person to get a verdict from the Bali bomb blasts.
He survived arrest for nearly a decade, but finally, in January 2011, he was arrested in the Pakistani continent, where the U.S. Army had recently killed Prime Minister Osama Bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, F.B.I. Agents presented evidence that the report found that the South-East Asian terrorist groups were in Pakistan in an attempt to re-establish contact with Bill Laden.
Sister Cortin says, "She didn't give herself up."
Even today, he is not really suffering so much mental pain.
This decision came before the 10th anniversary of the attack, which will be marked by celebrations in Bali and Australia.
Ms. Cortin said, "This year there will be a lot of tears."
The panel can still appeal against its punishment.
F.A.: Air travel can now use a gate in the air (but can't call a cell phone)
From entering the air travel gate to reading, working, playing games, watching music, using your electronic devices - but they won't be able to talk to their phones - such a teacher is required by the United Air Force.
But travelers should not expect these changes immediately.
At a news conference, Governor Michael Huarta of the F.A. said how fast these changes are being implemented, it will be different in each airline.
Airlines needs to show how their flights, new directions, and how to update the rules for collecting and storing their drivers' training books and instructions.
F.A. said it's already got plans from some Airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices on air.
Delta and Zetblu are among those who have already presented plans.
The F.A. said in a statement, "On the basis of the state of the plan, we can accept the extended use of the electronic device very soon.
At the moment, passengers need to close their smartphones, tablets, and other devices when the flight door is closed.
They are expected not to start them until they reach the altitude of 10,000 feet of the plane and are permitted by the captain.
Travelers are expected to stop their device again when they land on the plane, and do not start until the flight is fully down.
F.A. said that within new directions, airlines whose aircraft are fully protected from electronic regulations may allow their passengers to fly by air, when they land and when they are taxiing.
Most new airlines and other aircraft that have been researched so that passengers can use wifi at higher altitudes are expected to comply with these orders.
The president of the Association of Professional Flight Agents has welcomed these changes.
Glading said in a statement, "When policy is safely implemented -- and we will work together with Airlines companies -- it will be a win-win thing for both sides."
When it comes to this issue, we've just gone through the "Hall Monitors" feeling.
The Agency said that it would still be prohibited to browse the Internet for less than 10,000 feet, provide e-mails, send or receive messages, or download data.
Travelers will be asked to keep their smartphones, tablets and other devices in airplane mode.
So no conversation can yet be made with friends, such as the online Scrabble game, with which the famous event is that in 2011 when Acter Elek Baldwin was playing on his smartphone while the air park was on the door, American Airlines dropped them off when they were forbidden from stopping the device.
And heavy equipment will still have to store laptops, such as laptops, because they will be worried about hurting someone else in the Cabin.
Phone calls will continue to be banned during the flight.
Mobile phone-related wireless access is near the Association Communications Agency, not F.A.
F.A. can remove restrictions on some electronic devices while flying and dropping.
Last month, Mark Rozenken of the National Transportation Safety Unit, who is a national transport safety expert at C.B. News, said that Cell Phone is still considered dangerous.
Roger said, "The cell phone is really a serious issue, not just because they can possibly generate interference in the navigation-related device, but also because they can generate interference in the cell phone towers when they are in the air.
The World Consultative Committee, organized by the F.A. to examine this issue last month, has established that the government should allow more use of personal electronic devices.
Pressing F.A. to reduce their use is increasing in recent years.
San. Claire McCassick, a D-Mo critic, said there's no valid security reason for the ban.
These restrictions are becoming more difficult because the use of the device is widespread.
Some studies also indicate that approximately three thirds of passengers forget or ignore orders to shut down their device.
F.A. began to restrict the use of electronic devices by travelers in 1996, when F.M. radio and high-tech gadgets were reported by travelers on the basis of a report of interference in navigation and communication devices.
New Airlines companies are more dependent on the electronic system than on the last generation of flights, but they are also designed and approved to resist electronic intervention by F.A.
Airlines has been proposing the use of Wi-Fi at cruising altitude for years.
The revised flights for the Wi-Fi system are also more resistant to interference.
Huarta said that most Airlines companies should be able to use more electronic devices within the new direction.
Today's electronic devices generate very few radio transmissions of power compared to the electronic devices of the last generation.
For example, e-readers transmits only nominal messages when the page returns.
But the transmission is possible when downloading or sending data from the device.
Amazon.com is also one of those who take sides in reducing restrictions on the use of devices by travelers.
In 2011 the company's officials launched their entire core e-readers in Airlines and flew him into trouble testing, but there was no such problem.
The F.A.A. Advisory Committee has expressed mixed feelings about the risks of the device.
The National Aviation Traveller's Douglas Kid said they believe that the device is real, regardless of its name.
Other members of the committee said that only the reports described by pilots, most of whom are too old, are in support of the deployment of the device in the aircraft system.
However, members of the committee suggested that the F.A.P.L. should allow pilots to stop the device when flying in low visibility.
The Travel Industry Group has welcomed the changes, and they are said to be a common knowledge tool for people who travel through the most recent period of technology.
U.S. Travel Association C.O. Roger Doe said that we are pleased that the F.A. recognizes that the travelers who travel with joy are not immune to security.
The U.S. Police, learning from the attacks of Silsilwevar bomb on the platform, have been able to provide a room for Quick Reaction during the emergency crisis.

Birds were left in the forest by air transport to protect them from the North Sea.
The bird found on the North Sea Ridge has been abandoned by air transport from the coast back to the forest.
The bird named this town's railway was sent back to the Helicopter before being cured by the Scottish SPCA.
Central Administrator Colin Seden said: "It was probably the North Europe's winter-time passenger who came to the high seas in the heat of the wind."
It seems that the bird was tired and he took refuge on the oil rig.
They said: "He was unable to fly again, so we were contacted for help."
Before leaving, the train was healthy and healthy.
Is Europe ready to deal with Britain?
In April, Business For Britain was launched and business was promised to bring together and determine what changes we want to see in our relationship with U.K., the U.S. journalist and the developer of wealth.
For him, we asked them what they thought about the business of Britain with the U.S. by organizing the largest and most extensive survey of the business of Britain.
U-Gov has been responsible for the thinking of 1000 business leaders, who are representatives of the business size, areas and locations of Britain.
The conclusions of this survey can be amazing for many people.
We found that most businesses now want to export out of Europe, and focus on countries that are becoming modern and growing, while the U.S. member countries are slowing down.
They want the government to give priority to new business relations with countries such as China, India and Brazil, rather than to the long-term and bad process of reforming the UN's secret organizations.
When they asked about specific policy areas such as product law from the single administration, most business leaders believed that these crucial skills should be controlled back to the Westminster.
With the single market, the general dissatisfaction could be seen very easily, businessmen say that the cost of Brussels's administration is far more than the benefits of becoming part of Europe's commercial field -- even that large businesses that traditionally belonged to European companies agreed on this.
In the end and most clearly, our survey of professional leaders found that, a large part clearly wants Britain, the U.S., to move ahead on the path of trade-based relations and time-changing changes instead of politics.
This conclusion, which was seen in the main business groups levels, showed that businesses are pushing towards a "creative change", which would give the US back its lost power.
This is a very high price - British currency change and a better trade issue changed 16 percent of the U.S.'s non-consistency in the non-consultation.
The prime minister should have no doubt: it indicates that British businessmen support their plans to talk about British membership conditions in the U.S.
It also showed that businessmen expect to return to the current power balance to make a significant change to the U.K. side.
A better deal for British businesses is possible, and it is becoming imperative very quickly, because the eurozone, the associated economy and the royal associations are moving forward.
Priority must be given to jobs and growth in Britain, as the conclusions of our survey show that this means a new focus on trade and fundamental changes in the management of Brussels.
Alexi Miler of Gazprom described the pipeline in Bulgaria as the beginning of a new cycle
The head of Gazprom said that the start of the construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria marked the start of Europe's largest energy projects.
"Today is a historic event: construction began on the Bulgarian part of the South Stream pipeline, which is the largest and most important project in Europe."
The project is a major element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream will diversify Russian export routes in Europe.
Officials said that Ukraine, where most of Russia's gas for Europe is involved, presents a critical dialogue between the counterpart of gasprom and the relationship between gasprom.
Miler said that a member of the European Union means a direct connection to Bulgaria, to end the "for ever" of joint geo-registration injuries associated with the countries of Paragon.
After the launch of this whole project in 2015, Bulgarian customers will receive gas at rates that will be released from the South Stream.
Gazprom said that construction should begin in other Downstream countries by the end of the year.
This pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic feet.

The Royal Commission heard the charges against two employees of W.M.C. before the charges against Jonathan Lord.
In 2011, before the charge against Jonathan Lord was brought against two N.S.D. workers in Caringabah, the child's juvenile crimes were committed.
But in his statement to Ajum, he said that he "never faced the case of child Jan's persecution within his organization", said Ajum.
The chief executive officer of Philip Green was asked about the case in which he was charged with child pornography offences on a staff member of W.M.A., and another case in which he was charged with child John's crime against his children in his custody at W.M.C. Caringbah Jim Instructor in 1991.
Mr. Greene, French-aided paramedics, told them they knew about the first case, but they didn't know about the second case.
They also admitted that the statement of Yam's Y.M.S.A. was "externally tested by Wai.M.S.A. and they found Wai.M.A. to be the best in the field of child protection" is not true.
Assam's testimony is that W.M.S.A. was notified, and this year he received the second lowest rating in four possible ratings in education and community quality audit in August.
Mr. Greene, who has been associated with W.M.A. for 21 years, admitted that the administration of "self with me" failed to appoint Lord, and failed to ensure that workers were clearly aware of their duties in reporting violations of child protection policy.
At the beginning of this year, Lord was accused of juvenile crimes with 12 children during his two years in W.M.A.
He was sentenced to a minimum of six years.
But Mr. Greene rejected the suggestion that there was a cultural problem in W.M.A., which resulted in workers not reporting child protection violations by Lord.
What the workers saw about the crime, they gave the witnesses who spent time alone with the children by Lord, they personally sat down, they sat in the yard, they said he loved them, and they were allowed to play on their mobile phone.
Daniel Okwell, who was in the custody of Lord, and he said that he was concerned about child protection training, testified that the Lord's inspecter Wai.M.C. Caringbah Child Service Manager Jackie Burnat was "hard to find the most threatening and time-consuming"
C.O. said he did not accept the workers' testimony that they were not easy to inform their administrator.
He said, rather, that their friend with the Lord had confused their decision to inform him about it.
Mr. Greene said he had given the N.S.A.B. the congregation his opinion that the "not to be informed" text for the organization was "Johnathan Lord's Event".
Mr. Greene said that shortly after the charge was brought, the decision to sign a confidentiality agreement by employees was made by High Manager Liam Whiteley of Child Service at W.M.C..
He said his aim was to avoid interference with the witness, but it was not "serious" and was not properly executed.
Professor Stephen Smalbon of the University of Griffith said that between 2099 and 2011 Jonathan Lord’s work was not a safe organization during his stay at W.M.M.A.N.S.D.
He said the appointment of employees was "serious problems" in the field of research, entry, training and survey.
The hearing is suspended until December 20.
Blier says they want Britain back.
Tony Blair said they would want to re-establish Britain's prime minister -- but they believe there is no possibility of a return.
At the time of the fifth anniversary of their education, 59-year-old Blair expressed his thoughts on various household policies.
After leaving office as leader for a decade in June 2007, Mr. Blair abstained from discussing British politics to a considerable extent, limiting the role of representatives of the Middle Group in foreign affairs and peacemakers.
When asked whether they would like to return to the prime minister's office, Mr. Blair was presented by the London Evening Standard newspaper saying, "Yes, yes, but it is not possible, so..."
They urged leaders not to ignore the commercial community after the financial crisis.
When the Cardiff gathered a group of experts demonstrating the horse for the greatest horse of the year, they knew it would be a challenging competition.
But no one was ready for three-year-old Fentan Kirkland.
Not yet at school and a few months away from taking their first steps, this little kid and his pilot Settland Tuffi took three easy steps and won the top prize - he left behind his 30-year-old rivals.
In the annual competition organised by the Suniback Equestrian Center in Cardiff near Rudrim, a couple who could not be separated - who have shown the same length - were greatly praised for their behavior and style.
In front of beautiful baller hats men and women, he shook his flat top on a smooth corner and rounded his two-year-old toffee ring.
The decision-makers praised Fenton for his natural skills in controlling his age.
And Toffi got the highest score for his performance and personality.
Fenton was given a gift last March on his third birthday, and he has studied with this day-to-day storm in Shetland.
His 30-year-old mother, Donna, said, "Fonton and Toby are a wonderful couple."
They had to face all expectations, but they both won Gold Cup and Rosette.
It was only the second time that he took part in a competition with Tofi, and we are all very happy to win.
The most different in this color area, he seemed so wonderful to everyone that they wanted to take pictures with him.
This little child of the nearby town of Nantiglo, in the South Wales, is walking on the steps of his aunt Sharon Howels, who has been showing horses for more than 10 years.
Mr. Howels said, "The whole place was filled with enthusiasm, and everyone was enjoying and playing.
And he ran upon the face of the earth with all his might, and did wonderful things, yet so little.
Fonton's wildest animals -- he loves horses, tractors and fields, and he's got two cows he's taking care of.
The way he started, he's going to be the greatest horse of the year, and I'm sure he'll be doing a very good show.
The speaker of the annual horse show said: "Fonton's life is only three years old, but he has to control his back."
They're a very good couple.
The decision-makers gave the figures as they saw their presentation in the Fenton and Tofu show and in the show ring.
He saw good team work between the bush and his riders - the best in this case was Fenton and Tofuy Ring.
I'm sure Fentan's favorite clothes helped her, she was really looking very different.
The Chinese newspaper that argues will be the "Ginning Rescue"
A Chinese newspaper, which had an appeal on the front page to leave Manhani's fault, will be rescinded, said a presswoman.
The newspaper New Express of Guangzhou provided a series of public arguments for the freedom of journalist Chen Yongjo.
But after that, Mr. Chen agreed on television that he had agreed to write a thorough report about the government's partial-owned company.
Winjamk said that the new expression must now be "completely corrected".
The command of "correction" came from Guangdong Press and the publishing, radio, film and television administration.
"A primary test showed that the New Express of the Hong Kong Evening News Group had published a lot of false news about the Listed Company Jumullion between September 2012 and mid-August 2013.
Vinjamk said in a statement that "the editorial management of the New Express was irregular."
He said he had decided to impose an administrative penalty on "by canceling the licence of Chen Yongjo's reporter."
It "commanded the Hong Kong Evening News Group to complete a complete reform of the New Express, set up an immediate review of responsible people in the New Express and the leadership of the New Express."
Mr. Chen wrote a number of articles in the New Express condemning financial irregularities in a construction-use company called Jomloin.
After they were released, their newspaper published two headlines for their release, and said he supported Mr. Chen's journalism.
But after that, Mr. Chen agreed to write and publish false stories for the money on Kingdom television.
He told C.T.V.: "In this case, I have damaged the Jumolion and the entire news industry and its ability to win the faith of the people."
I did this mainly because I had a desire for money and fame.
I've realized my mistakes.
After Mr. Chen's apology, the New Express continued an apology, saying it had failed to verify their report properly.
Most recent high-profile individuals have recently admitted to TV-based convictions.

This information was given to the public after they were invited by Mr. Hindu Justice's chief spokesperson, Viven Dung and Ashvani Bunga, Pandtra Bonga, Sr. Jan, Bonti Bozza, Raman Khosla, Bontu and Nil Sharma.
They praised Mr. Hindu's efforts to connect children with eternal culture through the back of justice.
He said that religious education with worldly education is also needed to ensure the unity and integrity of the country.
U.S.-Mexico drug mines have found their own rails
One of the most complex drug mines between the U.S.A. and Mexico has been found, including its own lighting, ventilation and electrical rail system.
U.S. officials have described four-foot qualities as one of the most complex hidden ways to search for three feet.
The fungus is about six football peachs, which connects to Tizúana, close to Mexico, and San Diego, U.S.A.
This area is filled with one of the same mushrooms, which makes it easy to hide the drug-filled truck.
Officials said it was closed before a drug was released from the mine.
According to the court's archives, the authorities have imposed eight tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine on the search for mines.
Three people, about whom the authorities said they were operating as drivers, were accused of being detained for distribution by Marijuana and cocaine.
When convicted, they may be sentenced from ten years of age to ten years of age to abstinence.

British police sent Asja a note of submission
The British Police sent a note of submission to the founder of Wikilix today, who has taken refuge in Ecuador's embassy in London and applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard said he had sent 40-year-old Australian Assja a "sacrifice note", for which they would have to attend the police station, and said he would be responsible for being arrested if he failed to do so.
As the young criminals are facing an appeal in Sweden, as well as their options under the British law ended at the time when the Supreme Court rejected their appeal at the beginning of the month.
Stokhom will hand them over to the U.S., for fear they had asked the country of South America to take refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy on June 19th.
One speaker said that Scotland Yard sent "40-year-old Azja a self-sacrifice note for which they needed to attend the police station on the date and time they were chosen by us."
They are in violation of the conditions of their power.
The company refused to comment on the release of police notes.
Astej is afraid that more than 250,000 U.S. political cables on the Wiklix encryption-opposite website, United States will be sent from Sweden to deal with possible charges.
With a hot drink between the feet, the driver is charged 1,000 pounds (£1,000) per hour with 130 miles per car.
On the engine, 1,000 pounds (£1,000) are convicted of driving at a speed of 130 miles per hour (110 km/h) between feet.
Tiptri, 35-year-old Andrew Howy of Exx, was seen running his Mercedes Benz on May 27 in Brentri.
When the police stopped them, they found a drink on their feet.
Howie has accepted the award of driving a car in the Colchester Magistrate Court.
Seven points were added to their license, which has prevented them from driving for six months.
Howie was also ordered to charge 90 pounds (£90) and 100 pounds (£100) for the treatment.
Foreign property on owners will end London's creative situation
The Finance Department has mostly calculated C.G.T. measures, but Mr. Osborne is waiting for the final decision, which presented a 7-percent stamp duty for the 2012 budget of 2 million pounds, as well as for people who prefer to stay in a separate company instead of a separate person.
In 2012/13, there were 708 million pounds in the cities of Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea, which are already worth more than the combined sum of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, and the North West and Yorkshire.
Mr. Cook said: "After the submission of the Anti-Evoidance Statements in the Stamp Duty of High Valued Houses, it is very difficult to argue that there is less appropriate tax on the high valued property, which is not related to the effects of the system since it was old.
They added, "But this step can make some foreign immigrants quiet in London and unwilling to sell the current owners."
The top 5 to 10 percent of the house market, which has spread from Fulham to Vimbledon, has increased record 11.8 percent last year, according to the value in the rich south-west of London.
According to Sevils' search, the values of Central London continued to increase by 5.6 per cent each year, but growing slightly compared to the "harrelu market" because the city's southern west, north (7.4 per cent) and east (6.5 per cent) were seen as well.
Scientists have also shed light on the relationship between dog hunting and its mutiny.
The previous research has found that happy dogs move their tail more to the right (from the dog's point of view), while unscathed dogs move more to the left.
But now scientists say that partners of dogs can recognize this little secret of the dog and can respond to it.
This study has been published in the Journal of Canada.
From the University of Trento, neuroscientist professor Georgia Wellertigara said: "People know that the left and right parts of the brain are involved in the different ways that produce positive or negative emotions."
Here we have tried to see it in other nations.
They said that the right hand was responsible for the affairs of the left hand and the opposite, and that the two-year-olds played different roles in the emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to each other's movements through other dogs, investigators looked at animals in the movies of other dogs.
They measured the beatings of the dogs' hearts and analyzed their behavior.
We probably don't need more time to understand why their tails sometimes move to each other.
Prof. Wellertigara said: "We presented the dogs with the films of the dogs - in a shadow to deal with the exactistic version of the dog or other conflicting points, and we could see the bird's work and present the bird on the left or the right."
And when they saw the beast moving upon his back, they were at rest.
But when they saw the bird turning about, and moving primarily to the left, (from the dog's sight again), their hearts were hardened, and they were troubled.
According to Prof. Wellertiger, they don't think dogs were communicating with each other through these things.
Rather, they believe that dogs have learned from their experience what they should be concerned about and not about.
They said, “If you have received other dogs, and if they keep moving towards one another, then this is more of your friendly behavior, and your right behavior is less of your friendly behavior, so you will react on the basis of the same experience.”
Researchers say that these conclusions can provide better information about animal feelings to owners, animal physicians and trainers.
John Bradshaw, a specialist in dog behavior at the University of Bristol's School of Veterinary Science, said that this is not the first study to examine whether the left or right part of the dog is important.
Last year, the University of Linking team found that when dogs look at an aggressive dog, they turn their heads to the left and turn their heads to the right when they see the happy dog.
In another research by the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: "In contrast to the Italian study - when the robot moved to the left of the right wing of the dog, it was more likely that the dogs would not be at ease with him."
They said that this distance was because in various studies dogs were not completely familiar with animals or robots.
They explained that it can help study ways to react to real dogs.
"While the various stems have received sufficient evidence that two parts of the brain are used for different purposes, more information is still available - and dogs are not exceptions in this case," they said.
Although, in view of the ease with which their conduct can be recorded, it seems that we will probably not take more time to understand why their tail sometimes moves on one side.
Because of Alex Turner’s illness, Arctic Manchise stopped Glossog
The Rock Bank, called Arctic Manchij, has stopped Gigg in Glasgow after suffering from the shock of its lead singer.
On Friday, the Sheffield group had a program to show on the hydro site in the city.
But their chief singer Alex Turner's illness forced them to redefine the date of the show.
The band's announcement came when they were obliged to stop Gig in Burkina Faso in the same way.
In commenting on his official website, Arctic Manchie said that after taking medical advice tonight, after the decision to hold a show in LG Erina, Arctic Manchie must also hold a show in Glasgow on Friday.
"Alex Turner was diagnosed with convulsions in the test, and they're not very capable of displaying."
In Burma, there will be show on 20 November in LG Erina, and there will be show on 21 November in Glasgow.
All tickets will be accepted for this show.
We're sorry for any inconvenience that will happen to all the ticketmakers.

Pope Francis will announce the name of the first Cardinal in February
The Vatican has announced on Thursday that Pope Francis will be the new cardinal of the Catholic Church for the first time in his work.
Cardinals, there are high-ranking priests in the Catholic Church, their position is only lower than the pope, and these people choose the pope, so France will recruit the first group of its people, who will eventually help them choose their successor.
Now there are 201 cardinals.
Thus, after arriving at the age of 80, Cardinal is not allowed to participate in the Pope's election - it comes into the 120 "cardinal electorate" group.
At a time when the news was announced, Vatican spokesperson Father Federico Lombardy said that all current Cardinals' meetings, called the Pope, would be held before the New Cardinals were invited.
Lombardy said, "Pop Francis has decided to announce his decision to organize the February Pope's Day in order to facilitate the making of plans for other meetings of Cardinals from different countries in the world."
Jack Valero of the Catholic Voyage said that by February the number of cardinals was likely to fall.
He said that as a general rule, the number of cardinals is less than 120, so many cardinals, and according to their will, declare the names of Cardinals who are over 80 years of age.
Valero said that the next year's Pope's meeting would be important, because this year after the election of France, this will be the first Pope's meeting.
Currently, Europe and especially Italy have a kind of precedent.
He said, "It will be interesting to see whether the new pope, including Cardinals from the rest of the world, can reintroduce the balance.
There are forty percent of Roman Catholics in South America, but their number is very low in Cardinals.
Cardinals by France -- a group of eight cardinals from all over the world, whose work is being sought after by the Church, will also be the first Cardinals to be selected after being formed.
Before that, the pope made all the decisions himself.
Valero said, "Now France has chosen eight cardinals to help it."
He said it's possible that French Cardinals would ask for advice.
But we're not in this situation first - it's totally new.
Valero said that the Pope usually appoints the bishop of great places as Cardinal, but France "was going to be quite surprising - so we don't know who they're going to declare their name."
Callback to be issued by G.M. to fix seatbacks in U.S.
On Friday, according to information from the U.S. Auto Security Managers, the General Motors Company, has called back nearly 19,000 trucks to correct a decrease in the seatback rotating from the U.S.S.O.S.S.S.A., in its brand-new 2014 Shevory Silver and G.M.S.S.S.
There may be a decrease in front seat rotation in some tracks.
As a result, the United Nations has failed to comply with automatic security standards about sitback.
According to a statement posted on the website of the National Government of Security on the National Royal Ways, "If the vehicle is blocked from the rear, it may not be possible to protect the head of the restaurant, the driver's proper way to increase the risk of injury."
Models called back were created between August 1 and September 10.
It began being sent to the GM Track in June and, after the 2009 Demonstration Update, it represents the most important Vohan launch for the U.S. Automacher.
G.M. told the truck owners about this mistake in response to October.
N.S.M.A.'s 16-day government ban, which had forced an increase in auto sales in October, could not be considered by the owner's notice letter.
G.M. told Friday that, in the sales of Silver and Sierra Trucks that were redesigned for the 2014 model year, 20 percent had been raised in the first 10 months of this year.
In October, G.M. sold 42,660 Silver and 16,503 Sira Pickap Truck.
On Friday afternoon, 1.4 percent of GM shares in New York Stock Exchange.
The Discouragement of Obama’s Meditators
I gave Obama twice as much as I expected to change
They say Obama's great efforts have been hampered by the anti-GP policy.
Obstacles to the policy of Obama’s website can’t explain the suffering of drone attacks
Obama’s 2008 campaign reminds us of what could have happened
Natenal P. Morris Harvard Medical School is a second-year graduate.
I'm reading a lot of sad books today.
It's a book that I think this second year of medical school will boost my enthusiasm and hope in me.
It's called "the courage to win", and it's the 2008 election campaign of the President of Barak Obama.
When I wake up at night from my bedside and go to bed, this book takes me to a time where politics has inspired millions and talks could stop your breath.
The elections were held, and the press spokesmen had paused to show the historic importance of the time.
The tears of joy were in the eyes of my fellow workers; and my father and my mother saved every messenger that came to me.
A group of young television viewers were going to White House, and the whole country was ready to change.
In 2008, they had an 82% credit rating during Obama's presidency.
And then I closed the Book.
The present truth is a harsh truth, such as returning from the world of dreams.
It's hard to remember those days of hope - they seem to be a distant memory, a painful memory of lost occasions.
I actually changed the first time I got paid.
It's easy to say that none of them could have imagined it.
I commend Obama for his many supplies, from the Afordable Cairo Act to the return of our army from Iraq, "Don't ask" until Osama bin Laden is killed.
In addition, I believe that the anti-partisan policy has prevented many efforts to advance our country: including options for non-traveling improvements, public health services, banning barriers on Guatemala Bay, and other issues.
But the many times I have taken sides with the Obama administration in front of my colleagues and colleagues, I have the answer that I can give them.
I've reached the point of political despair.
Republikan's opposition to politics is not the answer to the succession of foreign leaders, nor is it the answer to drone attacks on children in foreign countries.
This national security agency cannot answer the data on the private life of American citizens, nor can it answer the contributions of those who expose the wrong actions of the government.
It cannot explain why U.S. citizen Unver El area was killed without a trial, nor could it be the lack of public authority and employment limits during the presidential campaign.
It cannot answer the conclusions of the report, which says that the White House's attempt to silence the media "has been the most shocking since the Nixon administration."
And recently, it cannot explain the failure to design a simple website even after three years of signature in the law of the Afordable Cairo Act.
I don't know if I expected it.
If, at the age of 18, I had to assume that the government system could break down the political campaign that would lead to it.
Clearly, the uninhabited office is not a predictive way, because opposition political parties and memorable events such as the Newtown massacre will give the size of our public debate.
However, the examples I have given above most of them seem to be chosen by the administration.
That's the most disturbing thing you've ever had.
I voted back for Obama in 2012, but not because I was curious about her hope.
Mitt Romani presented a misleading and uncertain option that did not seem to determine their principles or their position.
I thought that another work would be done for Obama, which will be free from the pressure of future elections, to fulfill the hopes of which we have been hearing for a long time.
However, while Obama's permit rating is less than 45 percent this week, it has become very difficult to return to 2008.
I remember their promises when I saw them disappear.
This week he was reading a portion of the book, which described how Clinton had been badly damaged by the Pennsylvania Prime Minister in Obama.
At a post-Martm Campaign meeting, they told their subordinate workers that they needed to return to the panel, and that they needed to remain faithful to their purposes.
He said, "I want my mojo back."
We should remember who we are."
Today, five years later, President, I cannot agree more with you.
The thoughts expressed in this comment are of the Nataniel Morris.
Clive Pomer claimed that P.M. Tony Abot is a good match for the Patriotic Holiday Plan.
The Arab Prime Minister M.P. Clive Pomer said that Prime Minister Tony Abbott's fight about the Patrin's holiday plan is good because his daughters may be pregnant and can benefit from it.
The mayors of the Khanun area, such as 6 million dollars carbon-surcharged bill, have claimed to be in dispute, while they have tried to answer questions about the conflict.
The Palmer United Party can control up to four votes in the Senate, which can be important in determining the reduction of carbon and minerals.
But Mr. Palmer claimed that only the ministers could have a good fight, and said that Mr. Abbot's daughters could benefit personally from the consequences.
Mr. Pomer said, "They may have an important good fight in the matter of parental leave, because if any of their daughters are pregnant, it would be a good thing for them whether or not they get it."
Two months after the election, the election agency officially announced Mr. Palmer with 53 votes in the Sunshine Costs Seat of Fairfax after the resurgence.
Mr. Pomer asked the process to move forward quickly to the election of the count.
The daughters of Tony Aut, Francis and Bridget.
Should the outcome of the choice be two months after we have been awarded?
They said, "We should have a better system."
Why can't we have a system where we fill out our coverage on the computer, immediately vote and have a result at 6:30 at night.
Mr. Palmer also criticised the use of a pencil to mark the letters.
For if a man doesn't like him, can he strip him of his outer garments?
The use of pencils around today seems totally pointless.
The election agency is studying options for electronic communications, and recently published a combined newsletter with New Zealand.
59-year-old Pammer said that their followers included building an international air barrier for Sunshine Coast, and they would take their new work "very seriously".
Public position is for public service.
He said, "We appreciate history that we can serve the community at this important time, and we need no other reward."
Which troubled the doubters.
Referring to the meeting held on this occasion, Association President Ramesh Singh Naji voiced a strong cry at the country's law-enforcement regime.
They have said that the perpetrators and their relatives are becoming more and more infrequent.
There's no fear of the police and the administrative system.
He recently mentioned such events in different places, saying that when the candidate society is not safe, the general human security can be easily calculated.
RBS delayed two forextra traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has slowed down two traders of its foreign currency, two scientists have received this information from the case, another sign that the global speed of the exchange rate test by the investors is advancing.
UBS Barclay, Dish Bank and some of the world's largest banks, including RBS, have confirmed that the world's largest financial market with $5.3 trillion per day, they are collaborating with investors in the polls.
These two traders will be the first employees of RBS, who have been delayed by the continuation of the re-test-reading of the liberal interbank loan of the Herfer Kund.
The bank has refused to comment on the delay and has confirmed that the bank has received a request for information from this month's distributors.
Two weeks ago, the bank said, "We have continued our investigation in this case, and we are fully cooperating with FCA and other lenders."
Last month, scientists said that RBS sent the former trader and sent the archives of e-mails and accelerated messages to the UK Dynamic, Financial Behavioural Authorisation.
Richard Usher left RBS in 2010, and it is believed that it has been released from its current position by the European Chief of Forex Spot Trading in J.P. Morgan.
The main European spot trading in the city was Rohan Ramadani last week, while the former highest Korean trader in Barclay and UBS was suspended by the Standard Charter this week.
None of these traders have been charged with any wrongdoing.
In the case, the scientists reported that Mr. Eusher's rapid message group included Barclays and Sitigroup banks.
UBS said that, after being told by Swiss Winjamk, the film, that she is investigating the foreign currency market related herfer, she has been working against some of her employees this week.
At least six global authorizations - European Agency, Finland, Switzerland's Competition Authorisation Viko, the Justice Department in FCA, and Hong Kong's Maritime Authorisation - are investigating allegations of disparity in order to ensure that money is properly disposed of in the money market.
People who are familiar with the case said that HSBC, Sitgroup, J.P.Morgan, and credit Switzerland have also undergone internal checks, or have received requests for information from investors.
Banks are searching for a misdemeanor for as many years as for quick messages and e-mails.
The news of the polling has sparked confusion in trades in the area, which have been among the most profitable in the trading unit of entry banks since several years ago, but they are facing a challenge this year because of the low drop-down in the currency.
Some bankers tried to suppress the issue by saying that it is impossible to inherit a vast and excessive foreign currency in the exchange market, but senior traders say it is not necessary to do so.
The chief trader said that foreign currency use between the break-up of the different trading platform and the increased use by banks of their own platform means that "you can start to influence the market on a little bit of ticket value."
The news came the same day that Credit Switzerland announced its foreign trade funds desk in London to the trader this week, which lost about $6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank has immediately notified the corresponding authorities and is cooperating with its policy makers.
Credit Switzerland said, "We believe that the trader has worked alone and has been controlled."

The Supreme Court upheld Obama’s health service law
As a major victory for Obama's administration, the U.S. Supreme Court today announced health service law on behalf of Barak Obama.
With 5-4 opinions, the judges decided on the side of the different health and non-care law - which would require citizens to buy or punish health insurance before 2014 - that it was the will of the government's power to condemn it.
Judge General John Robert supported four other court-contributing members, while other judges Skalia, Thomas, Elito, and Kennedy became disillusioned.
The court has also supported the remaining paragraphs of the 2700-page law, and said that the health service law's condition to increase the ability of the government to medicalize or to feed all the combined medical bills is not unconstitutional.
The paper was brought by 26 states and the National Free Trade Association to prevent this law.
During the early session of 2012, this law was opposed by all the main Republican Presidents of the Republic, including project-designated Mit Romanians.

No wealth is good.

Let us therefore give to the treasure that is holy, and use it to the profit of the Holy One.

So that no one is rich, and yet one is not able to make good use of it, neither can be profitable to another.
Let no one rob him of his wealth.
A true rich man is he that made a way into the multitude of the hands of the rich.

The cost of PDS Kerosin and Dzel is currently 37 dollars.
It encourages those who are involved.
In countries where the sale of oil companies will be closed without PDS, Kerosin will sell at the full price in the open market.
Oil companies are currently losing more than 39 dollars per litre on Kerosin.
Kerosin Subsidy's burden is expected to be around $31 billion in 2013-14.

Believed in the first freely elected president in Egypt
Mohammed Morsi has sworn to his position, but their victory day in Egypt may have ended the political struggle.
Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised "New Egypt" when he vowed to take office as the first independent president of the country to replace Hosni Mubark 16 months ago.
At its official establishment before the Supreme Legislative Court, the first Islamic President of the Morsi Arab World, and about 60 years after the removal of the regime, have become the fifth national president of Egypt.
And they took an oath of the children of Israel, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake unto the children of Israel, by the hand of their father, and by the hand of their father, and by the hand of their father, and by the hand of their father, and by the hand of their father, and by the hand of their father, and by the hand of their father, and by the hand of their father, and by the hand of their father, and by the hand of their father, and by the hand of their father, and by the hand of their father.
Morsi said during an official festival on national television: "We are looking forward to a better future, new Egypt and other republics."
The Crusader Group Muslim Brotherhood, who has been a non-legal organization since its establishment for 84 years, and who is on the mark of the previous governments, trained by a 60-year-old engineer in the U.S. Party, Morsi said: "Today the people of Egypt have laid the foundation of a new life - complete freedom, true democracy and stability."
Hundreds of soldiers and policemen protected the building and, according to local time, came to Morsi's little car cafe shortly after 11 B.C.E.
Since Mubark's time, only a few hundred supporters have been gathered outside the court to reward the new president from the dust of the President's office, and the punishment has been suspended for a short time, so that their motor cafilla can be released from the streets that are normally occupied, which connects the city centre with its southern suburbs.
Brotherhood's non-Christianity was greatly enhanced in the personal dignity of Morsi, who was ridiculed as a "low tire" and presented them not only as a Islamist but as hopeful of all those who wanted to carry out the work of terror of 2011.
The blue-colored business suit and red-coloured Morsi swore to the judges sitting in the wooden chamber, saying "Today Egypt is a citizen, national, legislative and modern nation."

Founded in 1908 as the foundation of independent religious education, Cairo University later became the foundation of Islamic student groups in the 1970s.
On Friday, Morsi took a symbolic oath in Tahr Square, which is the origin of the empire, which ended the reign of the Tanash-Kabark last year, and swore to withdraw the presidential forces from their position by the removed leader last year.
But they bowed to the will of the army, which indicates that the struggle for power would continue.
Morsi's speech in Tahrir Square was filled with dramatic popular coins.

A name for such qualities comes from patience.

There their older brother Romnikal had kept all the laws for them, so they had no trouble finding a job abroad.
But there was something else going on in the mind of patience.
So in 1954 they returned to their home.

Patience was released from the world on July 6, 2002.

Instead, during the reign of Andy (between 1999 and 2004) in the reverse of Modi's claims, there was no announcement by the government over two years (2001-2002) during the stay of the Atal Bahrhei PAM.

Moving forward from land, rivers, and forests to offer free medical services
Dr. Georges Well, bringing free health services to the rural areas of Cameroon
Well and their group watch the disease every week for almost a hundred years
There are not much doctors in West African countries; there is only one doctor for 5,000 people
Set your voice here or use your mobile phone
Dr. Georges Well in 2013 is one of the top 10 leaders of the UN.
You can vote for them or other top 10 for someone to make C.N.N. Year Heads.
The winner will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, George Well had seen his sick father come to his mind and faint, going to the hospital, which had not been properly completed to help them.
Jamel Well, in 1981, Cameroon’s capital, Yoonde, was injured in a car accident.
At first, their hands were broken, but an infection spread to their brains, and he made blood clots that affected their rest of their lives.
George Well says, "There was no neurosurgery in Cameroon."
Had we had money, we would have brought our father out of Cameroon.
Instead, Well took his father and searched for a multitude of clinics and hospitals, and obtained whatever treatment they could get.
Well, he said, "It's not easy."
You leave home on 5am, hoping you'll be the first to get to the hospital, but you won't.
There's a lot of disease there.
Some people can wait for death to die.
After the death of Well's father in 2002, the situation did not change much.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people in Cameroon.
If you compare, there's a doctor for every 413 people in the United States.
And if they have healed there, yet cannot many of the inhabitants of Cameroon bear his burden.
Two out of five people live below the poverty line in the country, and about two thirds of all health care in the country is private.
Well says, "They only have a problem with poverty."
And because they are poor, they cannot make their lives glad.
And it came to pass, when he saw the plague of his father, and the plague of his people, that he took strong counsel to do according to all that he had done for him.
Dr. Georges and his team of volunteers spent 700 free medical care last year.
They also became doctors themselves, and began to work as avascular surgeon at the Central Hospital of Greece.
And they started a non-profit organization, Escowiem, which goes to rural areas on weekends to provide free medical services.
Since 2008, he and his group have helped some 32,000 people.
Nearly every Friday they sit in a van and up to 30 people, lock up medical supplies from the roof and go to rural areas where people need medical treatment.
Sometimes the type doesn't even go with them.
They shall drive them through the rivers and through the earth, every one more than one.
But when they arrive, they are truly honored by leaders: the best home that can be offered by poetry, song and dance, and the community.
In these villages there is a real reason to celebrate free medical services, and well - with their great smile and endless energy - it is included joyfully.
The next morning, their group begins to meet with hundreds of people.
Well said, "We're meeting 500 people on each trip."
They come from the village about 60 km away, and they walk on foot.
All these weeks provide clinical services of a variety of types.
Many people are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites, and chronic diseases.
Others can get a visa or a free birth certificate -- the need for this document is in school, but many poor families can't afford it.
In the evening, the group simply heals with local counseling.
The operation is usually carried out at the school's house, town hall or house; after the process, the disease goes to the recovery site, and makes room for the next person.
The group publishes equipment in the General Operation room and sanitizing equipment, and works up and up in the morning on Sundays and Sundays.
It's a roundabout speed, but village musicians usually help to motivate the group.
He said, “They keep us alive and keep us busy all night playing.”
On the Sundays their people return to the city. They are weary, but they are proud for their work.
This group -- including Cameroon's medical and foreign medical students -- had 700 free doctors last year, and they know that their help can change the world of those they help.
One person said that he would be able to go back to work because of the free Hernia medical treatment.
He said: This shall be changed to me and to my family.
In addition to running clinics for weeks and working as medical surgeons in the hospital, there are private medical clinics around Well Night.
They said it's their other job, which depletes 60% of their earnings; the rest are filled with private donations.
"I don't know when they're asleep."
They're always in the hospital, or trying to make money for their organization, to keep these campaigns going.
This is a practical opportunity for students from the United States and Europe, such as O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join the Wells campaign, which they can never get in their country.
O'Mally said, "In Gin-Shile Medicine, we help to get the medicine for Dr. Well or to clean up blood clots, among them we are able to gain practical experience."
You'll never get a chance to do that as a second-year medical student in America.
Voluntary students usually work with themselves to get to Cameroon, and they often come with donations.
But after the Greeks have come, their dwelling place is in heaven, and their commandment is in earth.
O'Malley says, "There is no doubt that they are heroes."
They give their lives for this organization, and their desire to help Cameroon's people will never end.
For Well, there's almost one job like a burden, no difficulty.
To help others to live a good life, to fulfill the promise made to their Father, which gives them much joy.
Well says, "I'm very happy to do this."
And I think about my father.
I hope they'll see what I'm doing.
I'm doing this to make people laugh, to ease their pain.

You won't be sure but it's true.
