Members of the Assembly (AM, for their English stamps) of Gales are concerned about "looking muppets"
Some Members of the Assembly are confused by the suggestion that their title should be changed to Members of the Parliament of Wales (MWP, for their English stamps).
This confusion arises from the plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Assembly of all political spectrum are concerned that this can be ridiculous.
A member of the Labour Party Assembly stated that his group was concerned about "remaining with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means stupid and pwp means cocoa.
A member of the Assembly of the Gales Party commented that the whole group was "unsatisfied" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Wales Conservative Party said his group was "open" to the change of name, but noted that MWP's Muppet speech jump was small.
In this context, the pronunciation of the letter w in Welsh is similar to that of the letter or English of Yorkshire.
The Commission of the Assembly, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the change of name, states: "Of course, the final decision on any descriptive element of the appointment of members of the Assembly will be the matter of the members themselves."
The Gales Government Act 2017 gave the Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation of the proposals which revealed broad support for calling the Parliament of Wales to the Assembly.
On the issue of the title of Members of the Assembly, the Commission preferred members of the Wales Parliament (or WMP), but the MWP option obtained most of the support in a public consultation.
Members of the Assembly seem to be suggesting alternative options, but the struggle for consensus could lead to the President of the Assembly, Elin Jones, who should send the bill on change in a few weeks.
Reform legislation will include other changes related to the functioning of the assembly, such as rules on the disqualification of members of the Assembly and the design of the committee system.
Members of the Assembly will have the last word in the question of how they should be called when they decide on legislation.
Macedonians turn to the polls to vote on a referendum on the country's change of name
The voters will vote Sunday on whether their country's name is going to change to "North Macedonia Republic".
The popular vote was convened in an attempt to resolve a decade-long conflict with the neighbouring country, Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has always insisted that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim from its territory and has repeatedly opposed its application for membership to the EU and NATO.
The President of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the plebiscite on the change of name, has said that he will ignore the vote.
However, the supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of name is simply the price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
San Martín's campaigns keep silence for the difficulties of the churches of Harlem
" Historically, the older people I've talked to say there was a bar and a church in each corner," says Mr. Adams.
"Today, there's not one thing or the other."
He noted that the disappearance of bars was understandable.
"Now socialist people in another way," he says.
"Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhoods to which neighbors regularly go."
With regard to the churches, he is concerned that the money obtained from the sale of goods will not last as long as the leaders expect and that "before or after, they will return to the point of departure".
The churches, he added, could be replaced by buildings full of people who will not help the sanctuaries that remain in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white people," he said, "and therefore will accelerate the closure of these churches, since it is unlikely that most of the people who change to these apartments will end up being members of these churches."
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and San Martín a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation was formed in the 1930 ’ s.
A black congregation that was close to worship acquired the building.
A black congregation took the returns of St. Martin, under the direction of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott to the 125th street merchants, a main shopping street in Harlem, who were resistant to hire or promote black people.
In 1939, a fire left the building badly damaged, and while Father Johnson’s happy people made plans for his reconstruction, they also carried the carriage.
Reverend David Johnson, son and successor of Father Johnson in San Martin, proudly called him "the campaigns of the poor".
In July, the expert who played the carriage called: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
In addition, the expert Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan pointed out that it was the first carriage of the world used by a black musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who went to play Riverside Church carriage 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather commented that San Martin did not replace him.
What has happened in San Martín in recent months has been a complicated story of architects and contractors, some brought by the lay leaders of the church and others by the Bishop Diocese.
The parish council, the governing body of the parish, composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July commenting on its concern that the diocese "try to pass the costs" to the board, although it had not participated in the recruitment of the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some happy people complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Tiburon is a 13-year-old boy who was looking for langostas in California
A shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old child on Saturday while searching for langostas in California on the day the langostas season was opened, according to the authorities.
The attack took place shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel informed the channel KSWB-TV of San Diego that he had been knocking with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the child asking for help, so he approached a group to get him out of the water.
Hammel commented that, at first, he thought he was just excited because he had caught a loathsome, but then he realized that "he was screaming that he had been bitten
,
He had the broken key," observed Hammel when he came to the boy.
"Grieve everyone out of the water because there was a shark," Hammel added.
The child was transported by helicopter to the Children's Council Hospital, where he is in critical condition.
The type of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The rescuer, Captain Larry Giles, commented on a press wheel that had seen a shark in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it had not been considered a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim showed traumatic injuries in the upper torso area.
The authorities closed access to the beach, from Ponto Beach, Casablanca, to Swami Beach, Encinitas, for 48 hours to investigate and for security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans drive the UK's beauty market
Sainsbury's acquires Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, which have many employees specialized in the halls of their style and beauty facilities.
In order to significantly boost the UK's beauty market, valued at 2800 billion pounds and with growth increasing compared to the fall in fashion and household management, the largest beauty halls will be tested in 11 shops across the country and, if they succeed, the same will be done in more shops next year.
The investment in beauty comes at the same time as this supermarket chain seeks ways to use space in barns that were used for televisions, microwaves and household handling.
Sainsbury's stated that she would double her beauty offer with up to 3000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweeterman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
In addition, there will be more space for existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees, with areas similar to those of other establishments such as Boots.
The chain will also relaunch its range of Boutique makeup with a majority of animal-friendly products, something increasingly demanded by younger customers.
In the perfume shop The Fragrance Shop will also try its concessions in two Sansbury's establishments, the first newly opened in Croydon, South London, last week. The second will be opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shops and the change to the daily purchase of small amounts of food in local stores force supermarkets to strive to convince people that they visit them.
Mike Coupe, Executive Director of Sainsbury's, has said that shops will increasingly look like malls while the supermarket chain is trying to combat Aldi and Lidl discount facilities by offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has integrated Argos discount points in hundreds of establishments and has introduced several Habitats since its purchase of these chains two years ago. This is considered to have boosted the sales of edibles and made more profitable purchases.
The previous attempt of the supermarket chain to renew their beauty and pharmacy departments was a failure.
Sainsbury's tested a joint operation with Boots in the early 2000s, but the collaboration ended after a discussion on how to divide the revenues of pharmaceutical sales points into their supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after the sale of the 281 pharmaceutical establishments from Sainsbury to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
It is noted that Lloyds will participate in the plan, adding an extended range of luxury brands for skin care, such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
As Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director of Sainsbury's commented: "We have transformed the appearance and environment of our beauty corridors so that they can enhance the environment for our customers.
In addition, we have invested in a specialized staff that will be available to offer advice.
Our brand offer is designed to adapt to all needs. On the other hand, an attractive environment and a comfortable location makes us an irresistable destination of beauty products, challenging the old way to buy."
Peter Jones is "furnished" after Holly Willoughby breaks an 11 million pounds deal
Peter Jones, the Dragon's Den star, was "further" after the television shower Holly Willoughby broke an 11 million pounds agreement with his life-style business line to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time to dedicate to the fashion brand and True plugins.
This business had been compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
This morning's 37-year-old presenter announced he was leaving the business in Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has pissed off Peter Jones, the Dragon's Den star, leaving his lucrative lifestyle business in the last minute to focus on his extraordinary new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to the sources consulted, Jones was "angrily" when the television gold girl admitted that her new agreements, valued at up to 1.5 million pounds, did not leave time to dedicate herself to True, her brand of fashion and compliments, during a tight meeting held on Tuesday in the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire.
The business had been compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow and was profiled as a favourite to duplicate Willoughby's fortune of about 11 million pounds.
While Willoughby, 37 years old, announced that he had left Instagram business, Jones left Britain to go to one of his holiday homes.
As one source commented: "Truly was, unlike, Holly's main priority.
It would be her long-term future, which would keep her in the next two decades.
His decision to leave left all those involved completely paralyzed.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of merchandise in Marlow's headquarters, ready for sale."
Experts believe that this morning's presentation, one of Britain's most profitable stars, could cost the company millions because of the important investment in products that go from kitchens and candles to clothes, and possibly delay even more their launch.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, are parents of three children and ten years ago they have a close relationship with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby established True with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as president in March.
The couples went on vacation together and Jones has a 40% share in Baldwin's television producer.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as a presenter of the I'm A Celebrity program on the ITV channel.
A nearby source to Jones said that last night, "it wasn't about business issues."
A difficult conversation "and then we fall in love"
He was joking about the criticisms he received from the media to make a comment that some would consider "unpresidative" and to be so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so many things?
Trump commented with his ridiculous voice of "representative of news".
"I haven't given up anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in meeting with him again after Trump commended the first meeting held in June in Singapore, which considered a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations for denuclearization have been halted.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's major diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, explained to the world leaders gathered at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that his country did not see a "adequate response" from the United States at the first steps to the disarmament of North Korea.
On the contrary, he pointed out that the United States continued to apply sanctions in order to maintain pressure.
Trump's perspective was much more optimistic in the speech he gave during his mitin.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
"We were going into war with North Korea.
They would have killed millions of people.
Now we have a fantastic relationship."
He said his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim have generated positive results: the end of the tests with missiles, help to free hostages and bring the remains of US soldiers back home.
In addition, he defended his unusual approach to talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's very easy to be presidential, but so, instead of 10,000 people there was trying to enter this full stage, we'd have about 200 people here," Trump commented, pointing out to people who were right in front of him.
A tsunami and an earthquake in Indonesia destroy an island, leaving hundreds of dead
Following the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were informed that their assistance was not necessary.
Although more than 10 per cent of the Lombok population had had to move, there was no national emergency, a prior requirement to catalyze international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they do not seek international assistance, which complicates a little," Mrs. Sumbung explains.
Although Save the Children is preparing a team that will send to Palu, they are not sure if foreign personnel can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the National Emergency Agency, explained that the authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international organizations were allowed to provide assistance.
In view of the constant movement of the earth in Indonesia, the country is still incredibly poorly prepared when nature eases its anger.
Although shelters for tsunamis have been built in Aceh, not so many are seen in other coastal areas.
It is likely that the apparent lack of tsunami alert sirens in Palu, even though there was a previous warning, has contributed to the loss of life.
In the best case, traveling from one island to another is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that was in Lombok to assist the victims of the earthquake is headed to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the key to the new catastrophe.
President Joko Widodo has converted the improvement of Indonesia's waste infrastructure into the central axis of his electoral campaign, and has devoted a lot of money to railways and lines.
However, the lack of funding has affected Mr. Joko's administration, which is facing a re-election next year.
In addition, it must face the pressure of persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the majority of Muslims have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people died and tens of thousands had to leave their homes while gangs of Christians and Muslims fought in the streets using machetes, bows and arrows, and other rudimentary weapons.
Look at this: Daniel Sturridge, from Liverpool, compares the marker to Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat at the Premier League in front of Chelsea with a goal in minute 89 on Saturday at the Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a passage from Xherdan Shaqiri to something over 27 meters from Chelsea's gate when the marker was 1-0.
He placed the ball on his left foot with a touch before throwing it to the second pole.
The action sent him over the area and directed to the top right corner of the network.
Finally, the balloon passed over Kepa Arrizabalaga that tried to stop him with a jump and fell off the net.
"I was trying to put myself in that position to play with the ball and players like Shaq always play very advanced, so I tried to give me all the time," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching and telling her a touch. I didn't think too much of it. I just threw the shot."
Chelsea was going to win 1-0 in the first half after the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in minute 25.
The Blues midpoint made a taco pass to Mateo Kovacic in that game, before turning around by making a stream near the middle field and entering the Liverpool field.
Kovacic passed the balloon quickly and ran out in the middle of the field.
Then he made a nice pass to the space that took Hazard to the area.
Hazard stood in front of the defense and ended by throwing the balloon into the second post with a left foot pad that Alisson Becker, from Liverpool, couldn't stop.
On Wednesday at 3 p.m., Liverpool plays against Naples in the group phase of the Champions League. The meeting will be held at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
For its part, Chelsea faces Videoton at UEFA Europe League on Thursday at 3:00 in London.
The number of victims of Indonesia's tsunami increases to 832
The number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has increased to 832, as reported by the country ' s emergency agency at the first hour of Sunday.
Many people were trapped among the ruins of the buildings that collapsed during the magnitude 7.5 earthquake that occurred on Friday and that dropped waves of up to six meters, according to the agency's spokesman, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, during a press wheel.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with remains of the collapsed buildings.

The statue of Cromwell of Parliament becomes the last memorable success for "rewriting history"
His ban would be an act of poetic justice for this Taliban-style destruction of so many cultural and religious objects of England carried out by their fanatic Puritan followers.
However, Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's suggestions as a "crazy" and an "try to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, commented: "In the current debate on the elimination of statues, it was inevitable that the figure of Oliver Cromwell from the Palace of Westminster would become a goal.
The iconoclasy of British civil wars was not ordered or carried out by Cromwell.
It may be sacrificed to Cromwell wrong by the actions of his predecessor, Thomas, during the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft of Cromwell is proof of the opinion of the 19th century and of the history of a figure that many consider worthy to celebrate.
As Mr Goldsmith pointed out to The Sunday Telegraph: "Many consider Cromwell, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than at present, a parliamentary defender in the face of external pressure, in this case, is clear, the monarchy.
If this is a very precise description, it is a matter of continuing with the historical debate.
What is true is that the 17th-century mid-conflict has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognized figure that represents a face of that division.
Your achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy to celebrate and commemorate.".
A killer pig attacks a Chinese shepherd
A pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwest China, according to local media.
The man, identified only by his name "Yuan", was found dead with a blood-stained and blood-covered artery close to a handful of the Liupanshui market in the province of Guizhou, as South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
On 30 May 2005, a pig breeder prepares to inject pigs into a pighouse in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
It seems that he traveled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of a nearby pouch was open.
He said there was a big pig with blood in his mouth.
The forensic examination confirmed that the pig had attacked the livestock until death, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bleeding and ruined," said the cousin, to whom they address by his name, "Wu", to The Guiyang Evening News.
The images of the security camera showed Yuan entering the market on Thursday at 4:40 to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager informed The Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent him from attacking anyone else, while the police were collecting evidence on the spot.
It seems that the Yuan family and the market authorities are negotiating compensation for their death.
Although they're rare, it's not the first time a pig attacks a person.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in their Massachusetts farm, leaving the injured man seriously.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighed nearly 295 pounds [295 kg] to a farmer in his tractor until his wife spooked the animal.
After that, in 2012, some pigs started out to a cattle owner in Orgon, a manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a "blighter".
"They're just playing.
They're like children, very curious... their intention is not to hurt.
What you have to do is have proper respect for them," he said.
The remains of the Red Hurricane will leave strong widespread rains in the southwest of the United States.
As expected, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves on the coldest waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will leave torrential rains throughout the north of Mexico and southwest of the United States in the coming days.
Rosa caused winds of more than 136 km/h, a Category 1 hurricane from Sunday to five in the morning (ear East) and was located almost 620 kilometres south-west of Punta Eugenia (Mexico).
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, in the Pacific Ocean they are beginning to generate low pressures, which are moving east towards the West Coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the peninsula of Baja California on Monday, a tropical storm will begin to push the intense tropical rains in the north, to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will leave more than 25 centimeters of rain in some areas of Mexico on Monday.
Finally, when the tropical rain shocks with the low pressure it is approaching, there will be strong generalized precipitation in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, between 2 and 10 centimeters of rain will cause dangerous sudden floods, floods of garbage and possible spills in the desert.
Heavy tropical rains will cause precipitation of almost 5 to 8 centimeters per hour in specific areas, especially in parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected between 5 and 10 centimeters of rain in parts of the southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
Due to the dispersal nature of tropical rains, sudden floods may occur with conditions that rapidly deteriorate.
Because of this threat of tropical torrential rains, it is not recommended at all to venture into the desert on foot.
Heavy rains could turn the canyons into rainy rivers and storms will cause torn winds and clouds of dust locally.
The low pressure approaching will leave heavy rains in concrete parts of the southern coast of California.
The torrential rains may leave up to almost two centimeters of water, which could cause small streams of garbage and make roads resbalage.
It would be the first torrential rains in the region during the wet season.
Some scattered tropical chaparrons will begin to approach Arizona at the last hour of Sunday and the first hour of Monday, before the rain is generalized at the end of Monday and Tuesday.
The strong rains will extend to the Four Corners on Tuesday and throughout the Wednesday.
In October, some intense temperature changes in the U.S. may be observed due to the cooling of the Arctic and the heat of the tropics.
Sometimes this involves radical temperature changes in short distances.
A good example of these temperature differences is what will happen throughout the U.S. centre on Sunday.
There will be a difference of almost 7 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha (Nebraska), and between St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa).
Over the next few days, the prolonged summer heat will try to recover and expand again.
In a large part of the centre and the east of the United States, a warm beginning is expected, with generalized temperatures that will range from 26 degrees from the South Lanura to parts of the north-east.
On Tuesday, temperatures of up to 26 degrees could be reached in New York, about 12 degrees above the average.
Our long-term forecast indicates high probability of temperatures above the average for the east of the United States during the first half of October.
Over 20 million people saw Brett Kavanaugh's presence
More than 20 million people followed the dissident testimony that Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of alleged sexual assault in the 1980s, gave Thursday in six television channels.
Meanwhile, politics continued to be dead, and the media interrupted their usual programming to re-transmit the latest Friday news: an agreement designed by Senator of Arizona, Jeff Blake, for the FBI to conduct an investigation of the charges for a week.
Ford informed the Senate Judicial Commission that he had absolute confidence that Kavanaugh had hit her as a drunk and that he was trying to get her clothes off at a college party.
During his passionate testimony, Kavanaugh said he was absolutely certain that this had not happened.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people who commented on Nielsen saw it on Friday.
The company accounted for the average audience in CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other channels that forwarded it, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has some problems calculating how many people see something in the office.
To put it in perspective, it is a hearing similar to that of an American football party of the playoffs or the Oscar prizes.
Fox News Channel, whose Tertullians have strongly supported the designation of Kavanaugh, fueled the leading channel, with an average of 5.69 million spectators during a day-long appearance, Nielsen pointed out.
ABC occupied the second place, with 3.26 million spectators.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen commented.
After the presence, he continued to show great interest.
Flake was the central character of the drama on Friday.
After the office of the moderate Republican issued a communiqué informing him that he would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, on Friday morning the CNN and CBS cameras caught up with how some protesters called him when he was trying to climb an elevator to attend a meeting with the Judicial Commission.
While I received these complaints, broadcast live by the CNN, it was shown that they had been defeated.
"Looking at my face," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?"
And he continued: "You have power when there are many women who don't have it."
Flake said that his office had issued a communication and, before the elevator doors closed, that it would tell more in its presence to the Commission.
Cable and broadcasting television channels broadcast it all live hours later, when the Judicial Commission had to vote to propose Kavanaugh's candidacy to the Senate to vote.
However, Flake said that he would only do so if the FBI investigated the allegations against the candidate during the following week, which had been requesting some Democrats.
Flake was partly convinced by the conversations he had had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision was fundamental, as it was clear that Republicans would not have the votes enough to approve Kavanaugh without that investigation.
President Trump has opened an investigation by the FBI regarding allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "making politics" with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics with his plan to leave the European Union of "making politics" with Britain's future and of undermining national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Congress to be held in Birmingham, Great Britain, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview published alongside her on the cover of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister, Boris Johnson, insisted on his attack on the alleged Chequers plan for the Brexit, claiming that a proposal for Britain and the EU to charge the tariffs of the other was "totally absurd".
Wayde's murder: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson as a suspect of the LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect for the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player, during a shooting.
Dieteon Simpson, aged 20, has been arrested and imprisoned for second-degree murder, according to Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities made public a video of the clash between Sims and Simpson, and the police point out that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police recovered the glasses on the crime scene and said they had found Simpson's DNA in them, according to WAFB, a CBS branch.
After questioning Simpson, the police say he admitted to shooting Wayde.
A security of USD 350 000 has been established, according to the defence.
The Baton Rouge District Training Court published a preliminary report on Friday, indicating that the cause of death had been a bullet wound in the neck that had reached the head.
The Department recognizes the merits of the refugee unit of the Luisiana State Police, the State Police Criminal Laboratory, the Southern University Police and citizens for their assistance in the investigation leading to the arrest.
Joe Aleva, the sports director of LSU, thanked the police forces in the area for their "diligence and search for justice".
Yeah, I was 20 years old.
The player, who measured more than two meters, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball in LSU.
I had obtained an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in a last-season game.
On Friday morning, Will Wade, LSU basketball coach, said his team is "damaged" and "in shock" for Wayde's death.
"These are the things people always worry about," Wade said.
A grey volcano in Mexico City
Ceniza from the Volcano Popocatepetl has reached the neighborhoods located south of the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned Mexicans on Saturday that they would stay away from the volcano after the crater showed activity and recorded 183 gas emissions and ashes in 24 hours.
The center recorded several tremors and shakes.
In the social networks, the images showed thin layers of ash covering the vehicle umbrellas in the neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Jochimilco.
Geophysics have observed a greater activity in the volcano, located 72 kilometres south-east of the capital, since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake hit the center of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police are facing Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence referendum
Six people were arrested on Saturday in Barcelona after independent protesters faced the anti-disquieting while thousands participated in opposition demonstrations coincided with the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarized referendum on secession.
A group of separatists who had the anti-disturbs cut off the passage threw eggs and paint in dust, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets, which are usually full of tourists.
Post-hour clashes were also held, and the police used pore to hold the fight.
For several hours, independent groups, with messages such as "not forgotten or forgiven", faced Unionist protesters in the cry of "Viva España".
Fourteen people were treated for mild injuries during the protests, according to local media.
The tensions remain high in this region one year after the vote of 1 October, considered illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The voters elected independence by a vast majority, although the participation was low, because the persons opposed to the secession had largely boycotted the referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to prevent the vote at electoral tables throughout the region, where violent clashes occurred.
The independence groups camped on Friday night to avoid a demonstration of support to the National Police.
The demonstration continued, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68 years old, an electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife said that he no longer had any hope of Catalonia becoming independent.
"Last year we lived one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy for being able to vote, but now we are stuck," he said.
Despite achieving a vital victory, although close, in the regional elections last December, the pro-Catalanist parties have struggled to retain momentum this year, as many of their most well-known leaders, whether in self-imposed or detained exile, are awaiting trial for their role in the organization of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of the police on his phone, said that the conflict had been initiated by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in preventive prison since the end of last year, announced that he would participate in the elections to the European Parliament next year.
"Being a candidate for European elections is the best way to denounce the decline in democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish Government," he said.
Londonderry: men arrested for embellishing a house with a car
Three men, 33, 34 and 39 years old, have been arrested after repeatedly planting a Londonderry house with a car.
The incident took place on Thursday at 19:30 in Ballynagard Crescent.
Inspector Bob Blemmings commented that damage was caused to access and to the building itself.
At some point, you might have shot the car with a bullet.
A Menga attack gives the 1-0 victory to Livingstone against Rangers
The first goal of Dolly Menga for Livingston assured victory
A promoted Livingston impressed the Rangers when they won the second defeat for Steven Gerrard in 18 matches as a coach of the Ibrox club.
The Dolly Menga attack marked the difference. Gary Holt's men took up a position with the Hibernian in second place.
This season, Gerrard's men have not yet won any victory out of the house, and next Sunday they face Hearts, leaders of the table with eight points of advantage.
Earlier, the Rangers received Rapid Vienna on Thursday at the League of Europe.
Meanwhile, Livingston has expanded its race of victories in the six-party division. Holt, the incumbent coach, has not yet tasted defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston lets opportunities pass to a fortune-seeker
Holt's team had to have gone a step ahead long before marking, causing all kinds of problems to the Rangers for their direct game.
Scott Robinson overcame the defense, but failed his attempt in front of the doorway. Then Alan Lithgow pulled out the shot that he had turned after he entered to finish Craig Halkett's head centre in front of the doorway.
The host team agreed to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause problems for visitors with standing ball games.
That's how the decisive goal came.
The Rangers gave them a free shot and Livingston sought an entry, with a combined game by Declan Gallagher and Robinson for Menga, who hit the balloon and marked it from the center of the area.
At that time, the Rangers dominated possession, but they could not pass the host's defense and the porter Liam Kelly was quite calm.
That game continued until the second part, although Alfredo Morelos forced a stop from Kelly.
Allan McGregor, Rangers' porter, rejected a shot from Scott Pittman from a crack, and Lithgow stayed away from another liveston game.
In the Livingston area they walked long steps continuously, but they were always cleared. Two requests of penalti were rejected, one after a Halkett entry on alternate Glenn Middleton and the other by one hand.
Livingstone's Phenomenal (analysis)
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Stadium
A performance and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
The unanimous view is that they made an excellent game that continued to surpass the expectations of an ascending trajectory.
Your game style and your template have only experienced changes since your rise, but this is largely due to Holt because of the way you have strengthened the team since your arrival.
He had a lot of heroes.
Halkett, the team captain, was huge and led a magnificently organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worall alert at all times.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although they had very good times with Gerrard, they were short.
They missed to materialize the games, as they only got into the opposite field once, which is a call for attention to the Rangers, which are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan has received an ambiguated welcome in Colonia
On Saturday, September 29, there were smiles and a blue sky during the breakfast of the leaders of Turkey and Germany in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, with the aim of restoring relations between NATO allies.
They have discussed issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Colonia to open a huge new mosque.
The city welcomes the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The Police claimed security reasons to prevent 25,000 people from meeting in front of the mosque, but many sympathizers were in the immediate process to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan opponents, many of them Kurdish, who condemned both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to receive it in the country, were also heard.
These manifestations reflect the divisiveness of this visitor, received as a hero by some German Turks and considered an autocrat by others.
Traffic accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies after collision with a vehicle
A cyclist died in a car accident in London.
The accident occurred near the Cross of Bestwook Street and Evelyn Street, a racing road from Deptford to the southeast of the city, at 10:15.
The driver of the car stopped and the cyclist was cared for by the paramedics, but he died right there.
The accident occurs after another cyclist dies after being hit by a vehicle that ran into Childers Street, almost two kilometers from the site of the accident on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said the agents were working to identify the man and inform his family.
Roads have been cut and buses have been diverted, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: six agents injured after some disturbance
Six prison officials have been injured in an altercation produced in a high-security prison for men, according to the Directorate of the Prison Centre.
The disturbances began in Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire at 9:30 a.m. and continue.
Experts from an elite team (called "Tornado") are in charge of controlling the altercations, in which eight internals participate and affect a pavilion.
Officers were assisted by slight facial injuries on the spot.
A spokesperson for the Prison Service commented: "There has been deployment of specialized prison personnel to deal with the current Long Lartin prison incident.
Six staff members have received health care for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and let it be clear that those responsible will be put in the hands of the police and could spend more time between bars."
The Long Lartin prison welcomes more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June it was reported that the director of the prison had received hospital medical assistance after a prisoner attacked him.
In addition, in October last year, anti-disruption agents were asked to go to prison to deal with a serious altercation in which they attacked prison staff with billiard balls.
The Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (arid areas could be benefited)
It is not uncommon for tropical depression to reach Arizona, but that is exactly what could happen at the beginning of the week that comes when the last collections of Hurricane Rosa cross the southwest of the desert, with the risk of sudden floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued alerts for sudden floods for Monday and Tuesday in West Arizona, South and East Nevada and Southeast California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to head straight to Phoenix on Tuesday, leaving rains at the end of Monday.
The Phoenix National Meteorology Service commented on a tweet that only "ten hurricanes had preserved their state of tropical storm or depression on a 321 kilometers radius of Phoenix since 1950.
In 1967, Hurricane Katrina approached almost 65 kilometers from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the Hurricane National Centre include between 5 and 10 centimeters of torrential rains, which can reach 15 centimeters in isolated areas of the Mogollón Scarpe in Arizona.
It is likely that it will fall between 2 and 5 centimeters of rain, with the possibility of reaching 10 in isolated places, in other areas of the southwest of the desert, including the Rocky Mountains and the Grand Cuenca.
In places that do not run the risk of sudden floods, the rains of Rosa can be considered a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious matter, some of these torrential rains are likely to be beneficial because of the drought conditions currently experiencing in the southwest.
According to the United States Drought Monitor, more than 40% of Arizona is suffering at least extreme drought, the second highest category, as reported in weather.com.
First of all, the Hurricane Rosa route will hit the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, that Sunday morning will still have a hurricaneed force with a maximum of 136 kilometers per hour, is 619 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and is moving north to 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific, so it is losing strength.
Thus, it is expected to rise in Mexico with the intensity of a tropical storm during the afternoon of Monday.
Heavy torrential rains could fall in some parts of Mexico, which run a considerable risk of flooding.
"There are expected torrential rains between 7 and 15 centimeters from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with the possibility of reaching 25 centimeters", as reported in weather.com.
Then, Rosa will head north of Mexico as a tropical storm, before arriving at the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression. Later, she will move through Arizona to the south of Utah at the last hour of Tuesday night.
"The main danger of Rosa or her remains is the strong torrential rain in Baja California, the northwest of Sonora and the southwest of the U.S. desert," says Hurricane National Centre.
These rains are expected to cause dangerous sudden floods and floods of garbage in the desert, as well as landslides in mountain areas.
Attack at Midsomer Norton: four arrests for attempted murder
Three adolescents and a 20-year-old girl have been arrested as suspects of an attempted murder after being found by another 16-year-old with white gun wounds in Somerset.
The adolescent was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area, in Midsomer Norton, towards 4:00 p.m. on Saturday.
He was transferred to a hospital, where he remains "stable".
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and one 20-year-olds were arrested that same night in the Radstock area in Avon, according to Somerset Police.
Agents have made an appeal to anyone who may have recorded what happened with the cell phone.
Trump says that Kavanaugh "suffered the poverty and anger" of the Democratic Party
"To vote in favour of Judge Kavanaugh is to vote to reject the repulsive and insulting tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said in a mitin celebrated in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has "suffered the poverty and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the appointment process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, vigorously and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that she had sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the meeting on this charge.
On Saturday, the president said that that day, the "United States saw Kavanaugh's skill, quality and courage."
"To vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is to vote to confirm one of the most accomplished lawyers of our day, a lawyer with an amazing history of public service," he told his followers from West Virginia.
The President made indirect references to Kavanaugh's candidacy when he spoke of the importance of Republican participation in the mid-term elections.
"It takes five weeks for one of the most important elections in our lives.
I don't introduce myself, but it's a career," he said.
"That's why I'm going from place to place struggling to get big candidates."
Trump claimed that the Democrats are on a mission of "resistance and obstruction".
It is expected that the first key procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh will be held no later than Friday, and reported a high post from the leadership of the Republican Party to the CNN.
Hundreds of deaths in an earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, the figure is increasing
At least 384 people have died and many have been dragged by the huge waves that hit the beaches after a strong earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, as the authorities reported on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered to celebrate a festival on the beach of the city of Palu on Friday when waves of up to six meters reached the coast at night, dragging many to death and destroying it all at once.
The tsunami occurred after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"When yesterday was warned that a tsunami could occur, people were still on the beach and did not run away immediately, so they were victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB) in Indonesia, on a press wheel in Yakarta.
"Tsunami didn't arrive alone, dragged cars, trunks, houses, soaked everything that was on the ground," Nugroho commented. Tsunami had moved through the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
He also added that some people had come up to the trees to escape the tsunami and had survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The air photographs published by the agency showed the destruction of many buildings and shops, broken and broken bridges, and a mixture surrounded by water.
The replicas continued to hit the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquake series was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT, for its Indonesian stamps) reported in a communiqué that the energy released by the great earthquake on Friday was 200 times higher than that of the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima in World War II.
He added that the city's geography, which sits at the end of a long and narrow bay, could have magnified the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "important" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had collapsed.
According to him, bodies of some victims were found trapped under the ruins of the destroyed buildings. In addition, 540 people had been injured and 29 had disappeared.
Nugroho noted that the number of victims and damage could be greater along the 300 km coast north of Palu, a zone called Dongala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications "were completely paralyzed and there was no information" by Dongala, Nugroho commented.
"There are more than 300,000 people living," said the Red Cross in a communiqué, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy for itself, but it could be much worse," he said.
On Saturday, the agency received many criticisms not to report that a tsunami had hit Palu, although the authorities claimed that waves had already reached the coast when the warning was issued.
In a recording taken by a fan and shared on social networks, a man who was on the last floor of a building is heard warning people who were on the street that a tsunami was approaching.
In a matter of minutes, a water wall hits the coast, taking buildings and cars in front of it.
Reuters could not authenticate immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a great cutoff that cut off communications around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue work.
The army began to send cargo planes with aid from Yakarta and other cities, the authorities declare, but the evacuated people still need food and other basic products.
The city airport has reopened only for relief tasks and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has a scheduled visit to Paul's evacuation centers on Sunday.
The number of victims by Indonesia's tsunami is more than 800.
It's a very bad thing.
Although World Vision staff from Dongala have arrived safely and safely to the city of Palu, where employees are sheltered under a few lounges installed in the garden of their offices, they have seen a devastating view on their way, said Mr. Doseba.
"They told me they had seen many destroyed houses," he said.
It's a very bad thing.
Even while relief groups launched disaster relief tools, some people complained that the movement of workers to Palu was not allowed with extensive experience.
According to Indonesian legislation, only funding, supplies and provision of foreign personnel can be used if the affected site is declared a national disaster area.
And that hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a provincial disaster," said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for the Red Cross in Indonesia.
"As the Government says it is considered a national disaster, we can begin to provide international aid, but it has not yet happened."
When the second night fell in Palu after the earthquake and the tsunami of Friday, friends and relatives of the people who were still missing had the hope that their loved ones would be the miracles that would bring light to the devastating stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a small child was taken out of an acantarilla.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under the trash for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandano, an instructor of Indonesia's national parachute team, had formed two of the missing parachutes for the Asian Games, which ended earlier that month in Indonesia.
Others who were trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandadi, were his students.
"For my experience in the field of paragliding, I carry my own emotional burden," he commented.
Mr. Gendon recalled how, in the hours that followed the release of the news that the Roa Roa hotel had collapsed in the parachute community, he had sent desperate messages from WhatsApp to Palu competitors, who participated in the festival that was held on the beach.
However, his messages only showed a gray check mark, not two in blue.
"I think that means the messages haven't been delivered," he said.
Thieves take 26 750 USD during a recharge of an automatic cashier in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves attacked an employee of Brink who recharged an automatic cashier at Newport on the Levee, taking 26 750 USD, according to a press note from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the vehicle had emptied an automatic casserole located in the center of leisure and was prepared to reload it with more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the note.
While he was busy, another man "became running behind Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money for recharge.
According to the note, there were witnesses who saw several suspects leaving the scene, but the police did not specify the number of persons involved in the incident.
Any person who has information about his identity must contact the Newport Police in number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: the rapper changes his name to Yes
Rapper Kanye West will begin to be called Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday: "The person previously known as Kanye West".
For a time now, West, 41 years old, has been arrested by Ye, a name that he used as a title for his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes before your appearance on Saturday Night Live, where you are expected to present your new album, Yandhi.
She replaced the singer Ariana Grande, who had to cancel her performance for "emotional reasons", as the program creator commented.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West had previously said that the word had a religious significance for him.
"I think it's the most used word in the Bible, where it means 'you'," said West at the beginning of this year while talking about the album's title with the radio speaker Big Boy.
"It's you, it's us, it means us.
It became Kanye, which means 'the only', a Ye, a reflection of our good, bad and confusing things, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
It is one of the many famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
An old West collaborator, JAY-Z, has used his name in capitals or minors, with or without script.
Mexican AMLO promises not to use the army against the civilian population
Andrés Manuel López Obrador, an elected Mexican president, has promised never to use the army against the civilian population, now approaching the 50th anniversary of a bloody rebate against students in the country.
On Saturday, López Obrador promised in Plaza Tlatelolco that "he would never use the army to oppress the people of Mexico".
On October 2, 1968, the troops fired against a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people at a time when left student movements were streaming across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has committed itself to supporting young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to those who study and open more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities led young people to integrate into criminal gangs.
The United States should duplicate the financing of I.A.
Now that China is more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double its investment in research in this field, says Kai-Fu Lee, I.A.'s investor and professional who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow the announcements concerning I. A. from several parts of the U.S. Government, even when, in general, the United States lacks an official I. A. strategy.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to become number 1 as innovation in I A. by 2030.
"Duplicate the I.A. research budget would be a good start, since all the other countries are going far behind the United States. We have the next look in the field of I.A." says Lee.
The double funding means the double possibility that the next major achievement in I.A. is achieved in the United States, as Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by the editorial Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the executive director of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of China's most important companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an I. A. system that won the best U.S. player in Othello. Later, he was executive in Microsoft Research and president of the Google branch in China.
Lee recognized the previous technological competitions of the United States Government, such as the DARPA Robotics Challenge, and asked when it would be the following, which would enable the next generation of visionaries to be identified.
In the United States, researchers often have to work hard to obtain government grants, Lee commented.
"It's not China that's taking academic leaders; it's corporations," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technological companies have hired prominent people from universities to work in I. A.
Lee noted that some changes in migration policy could also help the United States to intensify its initiatives in I.A.
"I think doctors in I. A. should have permanent residence cards automatically," he said.
The State Council of China presented its Plan for the Development of the Next Generation of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences of China finances people from academic institutions as well as the National Foundation for Science and other governmental organizations finance US researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee commented.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, which aims to attract partners in the industrial and academic fields. The White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, this month DARPA announced an investment of USD 2000 million in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the National Foundation for Science, it currently invests more than USD 100 million a year in research of I. A.
Meanwhile, the United States legislation that sought to create a National Commission for Security in the field of Artificial Intelligence has not taken any action in months.
Macedonians decided in a referendum on whether to change their country's name
The people of Macedonia decided in a referendum held Sunday on whether their name would change to "The Republic of North Macedonia", a gesture that would resolve a decade-long conflict with Greece, which had blocked their accession bid to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim from its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, both governments reached agreement on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic population, most in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has questioned whether the participation will reach the minimum required for the referendum to be considered valid.
The paper of the referendum raised the following question: "Is it in favour of joining NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
The name change supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that it is a price worth paying for Macedonia, one of the countries emerging from Yugoslavia's disintegration, to try to access bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, for the young Macedonians, so that they can live freely under the European Union, because this means a safer life for everyone," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska in Skopje.
Although it will not be legally binding, many Members of Parliament have said that they will respect the outcome of the vote in order to be decisive.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission stated that no irregularities had been reported at one afternoon.
However, participation was only 16 % compared to 34 % of Parliament's last elections in 2016, when 66 % of the registered voters deposited their vote.
"I have come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, who voted in the capital, Skopje.
Zoran Zaev, prime minister of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko deposited their vote in the Macedonia referendum on a change of name of the country that would open the way for joining NATO and the European Union in Strumica (Macedonia) on 30 September 2018.
In front of Parliament, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a small stage and taking seats in front of the campaign shops planted by those who were going to boycott the referendum.
"We are in favour of entering NATO and the EU, but we want to do so with a very high head, not through the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want us to enter Macedonia, we can establish relations with other countries, such as China and Russia, and form part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO accession would contribute to the investment so much needed by Macedonia, whose unemployment rate is more than 20 per cent.
"I think the vast majority will be in favour, as more than 80% of the citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after depositing his vote.
He said a positive result would be a "confirmation of our future".
In a survey published last Monday by the Policy Research Institute, it was ensured that between 30 and 43 per cent of voters were going to participate in the referendum, which meant a lower participation of the requested.
Another survey conducted by Telma TV from Macedonia revealed that 57% of respondents had planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said I would vote in favour.
For the referendum to be considered a success, participation should be of 50 % more than one vote.
If it fails, it would be the first serious blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since it came to power in May last year.
Look at this: Sergio Agüero, from Manchester City, skims all over Brighton's defense to mark a goal
Sergio Agüero and Raheem Sterling fanned Brighton's defense in the 2-0 victory that Manchester City won on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
For Aguero, it was ridiculously easy to score a goal in minute 65.
The Argentine midpoint received a pass in the middle field at the beginning of the game.
He went between three Brighton defenses before he entered the open field.
Once there, he was surrounded by four green shirts.
He escaped to a defense before crossing several more on the border of Brighton area.
He took a walk to the left, where he was Sterling.
The English front used his first touch in the area to return the balloon to Aguero, who hit him with his right foot to avoid porter Mathew Ryan with a shot that reached the right side of the network.
"Aguero has some problems on his foot," said Pep Guardiola, city coach, to journalists.
"Let's say he'd play between 55 and 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky to score a goal at that time."
However, it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the content of the First League.
The goal arrived in minute 29.
In that game, Agüero received the balloon very much within the territory of Brighton.
He made a nice balloon pass to the left flank for Leroy Sane.
Sane gave him some touch before heading to Sterling to the second pole.
Sky blues front launched the balloon to the net just before leaving the limit.
The city faces Hoffenheim in a group party of the Champions League on Tuesday at 12:55 in the Rhine-Neckar Arena of Sinsheim (Germany).
Scherzer wants to hold the party to the Rockies
With the Nationals removed from the content by the playoffs, there was no reason to force another opening.
Still, the always competitive Scherzer wants to ride the mountain on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if these triumphed before Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western Division of the National League, they still have opportunities in the playoffs.
The Rockies secured at least one wildcard post thanks to the victory 5-2 on the Nationals on Friday night, but still pursues their first division title.
"Although we're not playing anything, at least we can walk the tire with the assurance that the Denver public will be excited and that the other team will probably play the highest level I've ever faced this year.
Why wouldn't I want to participate?"
The Nationals still have to announce an opening for Sunday, but they seem to be inclined to let Scherzer launch in that situation.
Scherzer, who would make his opening number 34, held a practice session on Thursday and will return to his normal rest on Sunday.
Washington's left history is 18 victories and 7 victories, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts with 2/3 in 220 entries.
Mid-Trump in West Virginia
The President made indirect references to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, his selection for the Supreme Court, when he spoke of the importance of Republican participation in the mid-term elections.
"In November everything we've done is at stake.
Five weeks are missing for one of the most important elections in our lives.
It's one of the most important. I don't introduce myself, but it's a career, so I'm going from one place to another fighting for big candidates," he said.
And he continued: "We have this terrible radical group of democrats, it's happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by all necessary means, see the mixture, the evil.
They don't care who gets hurt or has to pass over to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control. And we're not going to give it."
The Democrats, he said, are aboard a mission of "resistance and obstruction".
"We've seen it these past four days," he said, saying that the Democrats "were angry, were evil, horrible and false."
He referred to the Senate Judicial Commission by appointing Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who received the applause of the public.
"Do you remember his answer?
Do you filter the document?
Mmm, mm, what?
No, no mmm, I expect an answer. His body language was terrible, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labor Party is already covering a wide range of opinions.
It is intolerant with people who say what they think
When Momentum activists from my local party voted to censor me, I was just surprised.
After all, I am the last of a series of Members of Parliament of the Labor Party who are told that it is not welcome, and just because we think.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, received a treatment that seemed to be categorically against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship motion criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
I was in disagreement with the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe.
As expressed in the notice of the Nottingham East Laborist Party meeting on Friday, "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For most of the eight years I have been a member of the Parliament of the local Labour Party, that is exactly what the evening meetings of the General Committee have been.
Unfortunately, this is not the current tone of many meetings and the promise of a "more kind and kind" policy is already more than forgotten, if it really applied at some point.
It is increasingly clear that discontinuing views are not tolerated in the Labor Party and that each opinion is judged on the basis of whether or not party leaders consider it acceptable.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues who previously thought he shared a similar political vision began to expect radical change of opinion and to adopt positions with which he would never have agreed, whether on national security or on the single EU market.
Whenever I speak in public, no matter what I say, there is a diabetes of insults on social networks demanding my withdrawal, denouncing the policies of the centre, telling me that it should not be in the Labor Party.
I'm not the only one who's ever experienced it.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, since comments about me tend to be political.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of colleagues facing a torrent of sexual or racist insults on a daily basis, but they never run away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the normalization of insults.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said the Labor Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer have that wide range of opinions and, with each "censorship" motion or each change in the selection rules, the party becomes more narrow.
In the last two years, I have received many advices that recommended that I keep my head down and don't make me hear so much and that it would be "good".
But I didn't get involved in politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labor Party 32 years ago as a secondary student, motivated by the neglect of thatcher's government that left the classroom of my full school literally in ruins, I have tried to support the improvement of public services for those who need them most, whether as a council member or as a government minister.
I've never hidden my political ideas, nor in the last elections.
It is impossible for anyone in Nottingham East to know my political positions or the areas in which I did not agree with the current leaders.
All I would say to those who promoted Friday's motion is that I do not understand these desires of wasting time and energy with questions about my loyalty to the leader of the Labor Party when the country is headed by a Brexit that will affect households, businesses and public services.
The real message is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for voters, whether or not the Labor Party: I am proud to serve them and I promise that no threat of withdrawal or political opportunism will prevent me from acting according to what I think is best for all of you.

Ayr 38 - Melrose 17: An Ayr invited up
Two trials at the end of the match may have decided to some extent the final result, but Ayr certainly deserved the victory in this most entertaining game of Tennent's Premiership day.
Now they're heading the table and it's the only invincible team of the ten participating.
In the end, it was the superiority of his defense, as well as his ability to make better use of the opportunities, which gave victory to the local team, so coach Peter Murchie had the full right to be happy.
"We have been tested in all parties and we have followed invitations, so I have to rejoice," he said.
Robyn Christie, from Melrose, commented: "The Ayr deserves recognition, they took advantage of opportunities better than us".
Grant Anderson's trial in minute 14, converted by Frazier Climo, placed Ayr ahead; but a yellow card to the Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, the Warriors' loan for the party, allowed Melrose to take advantage of this disadvantage of the opponent and Jason Baggot obtained an unconverted trial.
The climate extended the advantage of Ayr with a penalty. Before, just in the middle of time, it marked and turned into a solo trial, leaving the marker in 17-5 in favor of Ayr in the rest.
However, Melrose well started the second part and Patrick Anderson's trial, converted by Baggot, reduced this difference to five points.
Then there was a long interruption due to a serious injury by Ruarid Knott, to which they had to get into bed, and when the party resumed, Ayr progressed with a trial by Stafford McDowall converted by Climo.
The yellow card to Blair Macpherson, Captain of Ayr, allowed Melrose to re-use them to have another man with an unconverted trial of Bruce Colvine, at the end of a period of enormous pressure.
However, the premises were recovered and, when the yellow card was shown to Struan Hutchinson for plating to the air without the balloon, from the penalty line, MacPherson made a test when he was at the back of the male who was going ahead.
The climate turned it, as it was doing almost since the match was resumed, after Kyle Rowe received the balloon sent by David Armstrong from a kick and sent to Gregor Henry's wing to the bottom to do the fifth test of the premises.
Still Game's protagonist wants to guide his career towards the restoration sector
Ford Kieran, the protagonist of Still Game, seems determined to move to the restaurant sector after revealing that he has been appointed director of a restaurant chain.
The 56-year-old actor is Jack Jarvis in the famous BBC program, who writes and co-protagonizes with his fellow comedy for many years, Greg Hemphil.
The two have announced that the ninth season will be the last of the series, and it seems Kiernan is making plans for his life after Craiglang.
According to the official record, he is Director of Arigingmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to comment on the matter, although a Scottish Sun source pointed out that Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow's "floating restaurant market".
"The sea belongs to us": a landless Bolivia has the hope that the court will reopen its path to the Pacific
Marines are watching a naval headquarters in La Paz.
In the public buildings there are marine blue flags.
From Lake Titicaca to Amazon, the naval bases show the motto: "The sea belongs to us by law,
It's a duty to recover it."
Throughout Bolivia, a land without sea, they still vividly remember the lost coast before Chile in a bloody conflict over the resources that took place in the 19th century, as well as the longing for re-navigating the Pacific Ocean.
These expectations may be the greatest in decades, as Bolivia expects a resolution of the International Court of Justice for one October, after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the impulse, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, is waiting for the result with a positive vision," commented Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will observe the case of the International Court of Justice on large screens distributed throughout the country, with the hope that the Hague Court will pronounce in favour of Bolivia ' s claim that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile will be obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who delivers a controversial battle for the reelection next year, also has much to say about the resolution of Monday.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide in favour of Bolivia and that the situation would change little if it did.
The United Nations agency based in the Netherlands has no power to award Chilean territory and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the International Court of Justice resolution only arrives six months after the final allegations indicates that the case "was not complicated", said Paz Zarate, Chilean expert in international law.
Far from promoting the cause of Bolivia, it may have been delayed for the past four years.
"The problem of access to the sea has been kidnapped by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
In addition, he suggested that the belligerent rhetoric of Morales has undermined any good Chilean residual will.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to keep conversations after this.
The two countries have not been exchanging ambassadors since 1962.
President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making was unusually quick.
On Monday, Bolivia will be offered "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and the possibility of "end up 139 years of conflicts with mutual benefits", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, would use the maritime theme as a political mule.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific," he added.
"The resolution is an opportunity to see that we have to leave behind the past."
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament unless it can trust the United States.
Ri Yong Ho, Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea, says his nation will never be the first to bring nuclear disarmament to an end if he can't trust Washington.
He spoke on Saturday before the General Assembly of the United Nations.
He urged the United States to fulfil the promises made during a summit held in Singapore among rival leaders.
His comments arrive when Mike Pompeo, U.S. Secretary of State, appears to be about to resume diplomatic talks in the field of paralysed nuclear matters more than three months after this summit with North Korea's leader Kim Jong U.
Ri points out that the continuation of continued sanctions and the opposition of the United States to a statement ending with the Korean War to submit to the North is a "chemer."
Washington is reluctant to accept the statement without first making any significant disarmament movement.
Both Kim and US president Donald Trump want another summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism about the seriousness of Pyongyang to give up an arsenal that the country probably considers to be the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare another summit among the delegates.
Paris fashion shows reveal the last line of huge hats that are about to land on a shopping street near you
If you want to increase your collection of hats or protect yourself completely from the sun, don't look any more.
Valentine's and Thom Browne's designers presented a set of large-sized spare hats for their Spring Spring 2019 collection in the gateway, revealing the style of the Paris Fashion Week.
The impossible hats have flooded Instagram this summer and these designers have taken their spectacular creations to the gateway.
Valentino's most outstanding piece was a beige hat with a wide wing decorated with feathers that involved the heads of the models.
Other large-size supplements were sandals with jewelry, a magic hat and even a pine, but they are not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of ostrich masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had sewn lips and remembered Hannibal Lecter more than at the high edge.
One creation reminded a complete drilling team, snorkel and included glasses, while another looked like a melted ice cone.
If you like big-size fashion, you're lucky.
The style hunters predict that huge hats could begin to appear on the shopping streets.
The big hats come with strong hands from "La Bomba", with a pajamas hat with a wing of more than 60 centimeters used by all, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult mark after this so little practical hat that flooded the social networks presented another great creation in the gateway: a beach bag as large as the model in the bathroom that carried it.
The dark orange raffia bag, decorated with raffia arrows and with a white skin handle, was the main piece of the collection La Riviera de Jacquemus for spring-summer season 2019 in the Paris Fashion Week.
As the famous Stylist Luke Armitage commented to FEMAIL: "Next summer, I hope to see huge hats and beach bags on the shopping streets. Since the designer has had a great impact, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for large-size supplements."
John Edward: Linguistic skills are essential for the citizens of the world
The independent education centres in Scotland have a course of academic excellence that has continued in 2018 with another set of extraordinary results in the examinations that are reinforced by individual and collective successes in the fields of sport, art, music and other community projects.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these centres, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Colleges (SCIS) are trying to deliver the best level of service to students and parents.
Independent colleges aim to prepare their students to continue their higher education studies, the career they choose and the place they occupy as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement an adapted study plan, it is observed that modern languages remain a popular and desired assignment in the centres.
As Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, the message reaches his head.
If you speak in your language, it will reach your heart."
This is a powerful reminder that if you want to establish relationships and build trust with people from other countries, you cannot rely only on English.
If we take into account the recent results of this year's reviews, we can observe that languages are at the highest level in the classification tables, being the highest approval rates in independent colleges.
In total, 68% of students who studied foreign languages obtained an A, the highest score.
The data collected from 74 SCIS centres showed that 72% of students obtained an A in Mandarin, while 72% of German students, 69% of French students and 63% of Spanish students also achieved an A.
This shows that the independent colleges in Scotland support foreign languages because they consider them to be a fundamental competition that both children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
At present, it is considered that, as an assignment, languages are at the same level as CTIM allocations (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the study plans of independent colleges and everywhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK Employment and Skills Commission revealed that, for reasons given by entrepreneurs about the difficulties encountered in covering jobs, 17 % were attributed to the lack of linguistic skills.
Language skills are therefore increasingly necessary to prepare young people for their future careers.
The potential labour opportunities that require languages are increasing, so these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the race that someone chooses, if he has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future thanks to a competition like this, which will last forever.
The fact of being able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will allow that person to move automatically to competition.
According to a survey conducted by YouTube among over 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75% of them did not speak any foreign language as well as to maintain a conversation. It was also established that the only language spoken by a percentage of two digits, 15%, was French.
For this reason, investing in language teaching is now important for children today.
If they know a number of languages, especially those of developing economies, children will be equipped to have better opportunities to find quality employment.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Some centres will focus on the most classic modern languages, while others will teach the languages considered most important for the United Kingdom by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the interests of a child, independent colleges can always choose from a number of languages provided by specialized teaching staff in this area.
The independent education centres in Scotland devote all their efforts to providing a learning environment that prepares children and that equips them with the skills necessary to succeed, whatever the future holds.
At present, it is undisputed that, in a global business environment, languages continue to have a vital importance for the country's future, so this should be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "competences for international communication".
Independent colleges will continue to offer these options, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
It's a good thing to do.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Colleges
LeBron starts with the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait for fans waiting to see LeBron James begin his first game with Los Angeles Lakers is about to end.
Luke Walton, a coach of the Lakers, has announced that James will play the opening party of the pre-term that will be held on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it remains to be determined how many minutes will be played.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton commented on the Lakers' official website.
Laker reporter Mike Trudell posted on a tweet that was likely James to play a few minutes.
After a training session at the beginning of this week, James was asked by his plans for the six-party Lakers pre-term programme.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need pre-timers to prepare," he said.
Mid-Trump time in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump launches a series of campaign meetings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of Trump's five scheduled meetings for next week, including stops in places with supporters, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote of confirmation of his candidate to cover the pending vacancy of the Supreme Court, Trump seeks support for the forthcoming mid-term elections, as Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress when the votes are deposited in November.
What time is Trump's mid-term in West Virginia tonight and how can you view it online?
The Trump Mitin in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7:00 tonight, Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can view it online via a live streaming on YouTube.
Trump is likely to comment on the appearances of this week of the candidate to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who have been sued because of allegations of inappropriate sexual conduct and have left behind an anticipated vote of confirmation of the Senate for a week as much as the FBI investigates them.
However, the main objective of this series of meetings is to help Republicans facing the November elections to take the lead.
Thus, President Trump's campaign noted that next week's five meetings intend "to encourage volunteers and supporters while Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority that they retain in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so crucial to your agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we enter the campaign," a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters that he did not want to give his name.
Programmed at the Wesbanco Arena Stadium of Wheeling this evening, it could attract supporters of "Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as to have coverage in the Pittsburgh media," as West Virginia Metro News reported.
The Saturday will be the second time in a month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state in which he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate to the West Virginia Senate, who is being rejected in the polls.
"For Morrisey it's not a good sign that the president has to come to give him a push in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a politician at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team demonstrates that it dares to fight to keep the hope alive for the individual parties on Sunday.
After three individual sessions, the foursomes on Saturday afternoon may be what this Ryder Cup needed.
The oscillating impulse pendulum is a completely invented sports concept, but players really believe in it, even more in competitions like these.
So, where would they say the impulse is now?
"They took us six points of advantage and now they take us four, so I suppose that can be considered a small impulse," Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe has an advantage, of course: four points ahead with twelve more at stake.
As Spieth points out, Americans feel that they have something of wind in favor and reasons for survival to be animated, among other reasons by the couple formed by Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and achieved three points of four each.
Spieth has been lethal from tea to green and preach with the example.
The gutural cheers of celebration went up by volume as his round moved forward, introducing a vital putt to empathize the fourth party when he and Thomas went down two after two days.
The putt he gave them on the 15th was received with a similar cry, from those who transmit that he believes that the US team has not yet left.
"What needs to be done is to redouble efforts and concentrate on the party," Spieth commented.
That's what these players did.
18 days to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable story of the Ryder Cup.
The strange and lovely pair of Europe takes four out of four and nothing can hurt them.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't make a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and on the last nine days of Friday morning.
That rare and how its energy flows with the bullish public make it clear that these are the players to be beat on Sunday, and that there will not be other players as popular as Fleetwood and Molinari to seal a possible European victory when the sun sets in Le Golf National.
Preferably, both at the same time in different days.
Still, it is still premature to speak of European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson deployed Sergio Garcia, the four-ball hero of the morning, after forming a pair with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles in the first nine leaves buried Spanish and Swedish in a hole of which they could not get out.
But on Sunday there will be no kind of help getting out of the holes.
Fourballs and foursomes are fascinating to see them close because they appreciate the interactions between couples, the advice they give and those they don't give, and the way in which a strategy can change in a moment.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and brings great advantage to the last day, but this foursome session has also shown that the U.S. team dares to fight, something that some, especially the Americans, doubted.
Europe progresses by 10-6 the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe goes with a good advantage the last day of the Ryder Cup, after finishing the fourballs and the foursomes with a result of 10-6 on the United States.
The motivated duo composed by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the content with two victories over a Tiger Woods that was seen in a hurry, advancing four points in the ranking of Le Golf National.
European Thomas Bjorn, trying to preserve the trophy they lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American team that made many mistakes during the morning's fourballs, which ended 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the fursomes, winning two matches, but could not cut short distances.
U.S. Jim Furyk needs to get eight points from the 12 individual Sunday parties to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novel to win four consecutive points. In addition, he and Molinari, who received the "Molliwood" play after a sensational weekend, are the second pair to win four points in their first four matches in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, his magnificent union served to defeat a discouraged Woods and American novelty Bryson Decahmbeau for a round 5-4.
Woods, who had not highlighted too much on both Saturdays, had occasional moments of brightness, but now has lost 19 of its 29 fourballs and foursomes, and seven consecutive.
Justin Rose, who was resting for the fourballs in the morning, again became Henrik Stenson's partner in the foursomes, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, number one and number three of the world, respectively, with a result of 2-1.
Although the day was pleasant and quiet in southwest Paris, Europe did not have it all on its own.
Three times the winner, Jordan Spieth, and Justin Thomas served as reference to the U.S., getting two points on Saturday.
They won a passionate victory 2-1 in front of Ian Poulter and Spanish Jon Rahm in the fourballs and then defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy for 4-3 in the foursomes after losing the two initial slots.
In the story of the Ryder Cup, that a team recovers from a difference of four points in the individual parties has only happened on two occasions, although Furyk, as the owner of the trophy, only needs a empathy to preserve it.
Although it has been the best seconds for two days, it seems that carrying out a counterattack on Sunday is beyond its possibilities.
North Korea says that "there is no possibility" that they are first disarmed unilaterally if they do not have confidence
On Saturday, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea informed the United Nations that the continuation of sanctions had deepened his mistrust in the United States and that there was no possibility that his country would give up nuclear weapons unilaterally under those circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho stated to the annual General Assembly of the international organization that North Korea had adopted " important measures of good will" over the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile testing, dismantling nuclear testing facilities and committing itself to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not receive any similar response from the United States," he said.
"If we do not trust the United States, we cannot trust our national security, and, under these circumstances, there is no possibility that we will disarmament first unilaterally."
Although Ri reiterated the well-known North Korea complaints about Washington's resistance to a phase-by-phase denuclearization formula that rewards the country as it takes steps, its statement is important, as it has not rejected any further unilateral denuclearization, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong One and Donald Trump after the first summit between an active US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim committed himself to working for the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" and Trump ensured North Korea's security.
North Korea has pursued the official end of the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also resisted appeals to mitigate international sanctions in North Korea.
"The United States has insisted on denuclearization in the first place and has increased the pressure through sanctions in order to achieve its purpose in a coercive manner, including objecting to a declaration of end of war," said Ri.
"The idea that sanctions can make us fall on our knees is a chimera of people who don't know us.
The problem is that the continuation of sanctions deepens our distrust."
Ri made no mention of the plans of a second summit between Kim and Trump, announced by the United Nations leader in early weeks.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae, South Korea's leader in the past five months, and added: "If South Korea had been the interested party in denuclearization instead of the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have been in a similar stagnation."
Even so, Ri's tone of speech was radically different from last year's speech, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to lead North Korea missiles to US soil after the "malign president" Trump, on a suicide mission, was called Kim "cohet man".
This year in the United Nations, Trump, which threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea last year, praised Kim for her courage in advance of disarmament, but said there was still much to be done and that it was necessary to continue to apply sanctions until North Korea was denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no time limit for this: "We can take two years, three years or five months, no matter".
China and Russia claim that the United Nations Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its progress.
However, as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo informed the United Nations Security Council on Thursday: "The imposition of sanctions by the Security Council must continue vigorously and without failure until we realize the final and fully verified denuclearization".
The Security Council has imposed uniform sanctions on North Korea since 2006, in an attempt to cut funding for the Pyongyang ballistic and nuclear missile programmes.
Pompey spoke to Ri outside the United Nations General Assembly and then commented that he would visit Pyongyang again the month he came to prepare for a second summit.
Pompey has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not well.
It was from Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, but, a few hours later, North Korea complained that its "requirements were those of a mob."
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea committed itself to dismantle a missile location and a nuclear complex if the United States applied the “relevant measures”.
He said Kim had informed him that the "relevant measures" he was seeking were the security guarantees that Trump had promised in Singapore and steps towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to rest enough
Thanks to a new course this year at Harvard University, all university students sleep more in an attempt to fight the growing masquerade culture of studying all night drinking caffeine.
One professor found that students at the number one university in the world often have no idea of the basic care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard School of Medicine, and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital designed the course, is believed to be the first of his class in the United States.
His motivation to launch the course arose after giving a talk about how sleep deprivation affects learning.
"At the end of the course, a girl approached and asked me why she had just learned about this now, in her last year.
He said that no one had ever talked to him about the importance of the dream, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, given for the first time this year, explains to students the basic concepts of how good sleep habits contribute to academic and sports performance, as well as improving general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard School of Medicine and executive director of the university's health services, noted that the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that the students only slept during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is an image of a bedroom, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sports shoes and books that inform them of the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on sports performance and the importance of establishing a routine to go to sleep.
In another section, participants are informed how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, embolism, depression and cancer.
Then, an icon of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
"We know it's not going to change the students' behavior right now.
However, we believe that you have the right to know, just as anyone has the right to know the effects on tobacco smoking health," added Professor Cheisler.
He said that the culture of pride for "during the night in the evening" still exists and added that modern technology and the pressure to increase that students are subjected to meant that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Sleeping enough time and a good-quality dream should be "the secret weapon" for students to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety; even to avoid losing weight, as sleep deprivation causes the brain to generate a hunger, so they want to eat all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Cheisler design the course after attending one of his classes the previous year during his first year at Harvard.
He noted that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to extend it to the entire campus.
She hoped that the next step would be to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study programme before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler's recommendation is that students think about putting an alarm to go to bed and to wake up, and that they be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" that emit the screens of the electric appliances and LEDs, which can alter the circadian rhythms, so they would end up having problems sleeping.
Livingston 1 - Rangers 0: Menga's goal is to bury Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another episode of depression out of the house, when Dolly Menga's attack destroyed Steven Gerrard's disparate team to a 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
The Ibrox people wanted to win their first victory out of the house since the 4-1th of February in St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team defeated Gerrard for the second time in 18 games as a coach, leaving their team at eight points from the Hearts, led by the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga's attack took place about six minutes before the middle of the time and the poorly inspired alignment of the Rangers was at no time.
Now, the Rangers go down to sixth position, the Livingston goes up to third, behind the Hibernian because of the difference in goals.
The Rangers may encounter more problems, as the line judge Calum Spence had to receive medical assistance for a head injury after someone allegedly launches an object from the visiting background.
Gerard changed eight of the holders who won the match against Ayr, entering the semifinals of the Scottish League Cup.
Holt, for his part, took out the 11 players from Livingston who started a point at Hearts last week and would have been delighted by the way his most organized team drowned the competitors at all times.
The Rangers may have had more possession, but Livingston took better advantage of the balloon when he had it.
They should have marked it at two minutes from the beginning, when Menga made a pass to the space for Scott Pittman who passed between the defense, leaving him alone in front of Allan McGregor, but the mediocamlist sent her out.
Keaghan Jacobs made a deep mistake for Captain Craig Halket, but his partner in the defense, Alan Lithgow, could only send her out of the long pole.
The Rangers regained control, but there seemed to be more hopes than conviction about their game in the last third.
No doubt Alfredo Morelos felt that he had been punished in the 15th minute of the match, when he and Steven Lawless were shocked, but Arbitrary Steven Thomson made deaf to the Colombian's request.
The Rangers got two shots at the door in the first half, but the former porter of Ibrox, Liam Kelly, was only seen in trouble to deal with Lassana Coulibaly's head and the boring launch of Ovie Ejaria.
Although the goal marked in minute 34 by Livingston came against all predictions, no one can deny that they deserved it for the dedicated effort.
Again, the Rangers did not know how to deal with a deep ball game of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher hit the ball for Scott Robinson, who kept calm and passed Manga to mark the goal.
In the rest, Gerard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, which had an almost immediate impact, since the steering wheel passed it to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly left his line to block it.
Still, Livingston continued to take visitors exactly to the kind of game she likes, with Lithgow and Halkett clearing one long walk after another.
Holt's men could have gained more advantage in the final stages, but McGregor stood firm to reject Jacobs before Lithgow finished a corner of his head that he did not enter.
The Rangers' replacement, Glen Middleton, claimed a penalty to the end of the game after a meeting with Jacobs, but, again, Thomson looked elsewhere.
Almac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, a page from the Almanac section of "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, and CONTANDO... was born in Germany the physical future Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that culminated in the device known as Geiger counter.
The Count Geiger, who has since become a pillar of science, also became a pillar of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "The Crown Campaigns", with the actors Roy Rogers and Dale Evans on seemingly incompatible roles of Vaquer scientists:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put your earpieces on, you can hear the effect of the waves emitted by the radioactivity of the minerals."
Evans: "It's like a radio!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, when he was about 63 years old.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" the malignant cells and kill them.
As part of treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells.
The method requires the extraction of immune cells to a patient and alter them in the laboratory.
So you can "see" a common protein to many cancers and reinject them.
A vaccine test is generating promising results in patients with different cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method requires the extraction of immune cells to a patient and alter them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a common protein to many cancers, called HER2, and then regenerate the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, commented: "Our results suggest we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "promots the growth of different types of cancer", such as breast, ovary, lung or colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to taking immune cells from patients and "teaching them" to attack cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West was on a journey for Trump with a MAGA hat after his appearance in SNL.
It didn't work out well.
Kanye West was baffled in the study of Saturday Night Live after an erratic performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would be presented to the elections in 2020.
After the third song of the night, called Ghost Town, during which he used his hat with the message Make America Great Again, he began deporting the Democrats and repeating his support for Trump.
"I often talk to someone white and ask me how I like Trump if he's racist.
Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have gone from the United States a long time ago," he said.
SNL started the Matt Damon's sketch program in which Hollywood's star was making fun of Brett Kavanaugh's statement to the Senate's Judicial Committee on the allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it wasn't re-transmissioned, comedy Chris Rock went up the West branch on social networks.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to ridicule West with the publication.
In addition, West told the public that it had been wrong between builders to wear that hat.
"They went with me.
They told me not to go out with the hat.
They're stuck with me!
And then they tell me I'm asleep," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see what sleep I am?" and added that "you were going to put on your superman's coat, because that meant that no one could tell you what to do. Do you want the world to move on?
Try it with love."
His comments were addressed to the public at least two times and the members of the SNL seemed ashamed, as Variety reported. One person told the magazine: "The study remained completely silent".
West had been invited to replace the singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-husband, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days ago.
West distraught many when he went out to the stage to sing I Love It Dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West received the support of the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the most courageous spirits: GREECES CAN RESIST TO MUCHEDUMBRE".
Karen Hunter, presenter of an interview program, tweeted that West was just "being himself and that is absolutely wonderful".
"But I decide NOT to award someone (by buying his music or his clothes, or by supporting his art) who I think is embracing and spreading a dangerous ideology for my community.
He's free.
We too," he added.
Before the program, the rapper announced on Twitter that the name had changed, saying it was now "the person previously known as Kanye West".
Not the first artist to change his name, following Diddy's steps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague, Snoop Dogg has also been called Snoop Lion, without forgetting the missing legend of music, Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist previously known as Prince.
Murder attempt charge for torture at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, according to the Police.
The accused is expected to appear on Monday at the Belfast Court of First Instance.
The prosecutor will review the charges.
Kit Harington, star of Thrones Game, attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is famous for its role as Jon Nieve in the violent series of medieval fantasy of the HBO, The Thrones Game.
The 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of the male hero, saying that those screen roles often transmitted to young boys who had to be hard to respect.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit commented that he believes that "something has gone wrong" and questioned how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his partner in the Tronos game, Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, admitted that it seems "very important" to address this issue.
"Personally, it seems quite important to me at this moment, where have we made a mistake with masculinity?" he commented.
"What have we been teaching men as they grew up, thinking about the problems they see now?"
Kit believes that television can be part of the responsibility for increasing male toxicity due to its so male characters.
And he continued: "What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on television, and on the street, which makes young people feel that they have to be this particular form of man?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time. How do we change it?
Because it is clear that something has gone wrong in the education of young people."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in any precule or sequel of the Thrones Game when the series ended next summer, claiming that he is "hard of battlefields and horses".
As of November, Kit will be the protagonist of True West, Sam Shepard's theatrical work that tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
Shortly ago, the actor revealed that he believes that knowing his wife Rose is the best thing he's got out of the Thrones Game.
"I met my wife in the series, so in that sense she gave me my future family and my life from now on," she said.
Rose represented Ygritte, the loving interest of the character of Kit, Jon Nieve, in the fantastic award-winning series Emmy.
The couple got married in June 2018 in a municipality of the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% more than new cases
China has announced an increase of 14% of the population living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 people affected in the country, according to the health authorities.
Only in the second quarter of 2018 some 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of these were sexually infected, which implies a change in the past.
Traditionally, HIV was rapidly spread by some parts of China as a result of blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contracted HIV in this way has been reduced in its overall practice, the Chinese health authorities declared at a convention held in Yunnan province.
Each year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increases by some 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem in the Chinese LGTB community.
Homosexuality was staged in China in 1997, but the collective LGTB suffers much discrimination.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that between 70 per cent and 90 per cent of men who maintain sexual relations with other men will end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are because they do not use adequate protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised universal access to HIV drugs as part of an attempt to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of his staff is filtering data from senators of the Republican Party and confirms that it is "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
Representative Maxine Waters criticized the allegations on Saturday that a member of his staff had published the personal data of three United States senators of the Republican Party on the Wikipedia page on legislators.
The Democrat of Los Angeles said those accusations were driven by commentators and websites of "extreme right".
"Truths, lies and more false lies," Waters commented on a Twitter publication.
The published information allegedly included addresses and phone numbers of US senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
On Thursday, an unknown person from the Capitol published information on the Internet during a session of the Senate panel on allegations of inappropriate sexual conduct against Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court.
The filtration was carried out at some point after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Puntit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the origin of the publications was associated with the Waters office and made public the data of a Waters staff member, according to the Capitol.
"This baseless accusation is completely false and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff, whose identity, personal data and security have been affected as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations, was for nothing responsible for the filtration of this information.
This baseless claim is completely false and an absolute lie."
Waters' statement raised immediate criticism on the Internet, including those of the former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
"Excuse this information with anger," Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests that it is not the time required to be a member of Congress.
When someone's accused of something he didn't do, he shouldn't get angry.
You mustn't rebel.
You must not question the accused's reasons.
It must keep calm and serenity."
It seems that Fleischer wanted to compare Water's reaction to the democrats' criticisms to Judge Kavanaugh, whom the detractors accused of feeling too angry during Thursday's appearance.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who intends to unbundle Waters in the mid-term elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"If it's true, it's very serious," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said that his office had warned “the relevant authorities and entities responsible for the enforcement of the law of these fraudulent charges”.
"We will ensure that the authors are discovered," he continued, "and that they are legally held responsible for all these destructive and dangerous actions for all members of my staff."
Review by Johnny English: Again in action. The parody of Rowan Atkinson's spy is cut short
Now it has become a tradition to look for guides to Brexit in any new movie with a British approach. It seems that this is what it is to do with this new delivery of the parodic frankie of action and comes Johnny English, who started in 2003 with Johnny English and returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English Returns.
Will this self-satisfaction ironic about the clearly unsatisfied fact that we are the new opportunity to export the nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his eyes and his unexpressed face, has renewed his license to put the duck for the second time. Only his name already gives clues that, more than nothing, it is a comic creation designed for non-English speaking cinematographic territories.
Of course, it is the ridiculous secret agent who, despite his strange claims to overthrow glamour, has a bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr. Bean and a pizza of that kind that played one note on the theme of the Fire Cars that was played at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympic Games.
In addition, in its origin it was based on the mysterious traveling and international man represented by Atkinson years ago in the already forgotten TV ads of Barclaycard, sowing chaos after him.
In this last delivery, there are one or two good moments.
I was delighted to see Johnny English approaching a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor while the helicopters were crashing against the helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy jumps into sight, but humor remains rather short and is surprisingly superfluous, especially now that "serious" film franchises like 007 and impossible mission add no problem comic ingredients.
humour seems more aimed at children than adults and, for me, Johnny English's absurd adventures are not as ingenious and correct as Atkinson's silent jokes on Mr Bean's role.
Now, the repeated argument today is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A computer pirate has been infiltrated into Britain's spy supersecret network, revealing the identities of all its agents active in the face of the agent's confusion in service, a sadly small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the drop that fills the glass for the prime minister, a pumping and accorded character that is seeing how its political popularity sinks: Emma Thompson gives the best of himself in this character that is almost like Theresa May, but the script does not leave much room for work.
Your intelligence advisors inform you that, as all active spies are dangerous, you will have to resort to something that is withdrawn.
This has to be the Johnny English torpedoes, which now teaches in a bad college, although it gives extra-official classes about how to be a secret agent: there are some good jokes, as it is a spy academy similar to that of the Rock School.
English is transferred to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and meets with his former companion Bough, again represented by Ben Miller.
Now, Bough is a man married to a submarine captain, a nice role for which Vicki Pepperdine is not used enough.
Thus, the Batman and Robin who do things terriblely wrong in His Majesty's Secret Service are back to action, with the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletin, represented by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is falling into the dangerous snares of a multi-billion-year charismatic technology world that claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the son-in-law Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their hate of absurd situations: they dress up from comrades, they light up an elegant French restaurant, they hide their chaos in Volta's luxurious yacht; in addition, English becomes a pure anarchy when trying to use a virtual reality helmet to get familiar with the interior of Volta's house.
Definitely, they were used in depth in that last sequence, but, because of the very graceful and tightness of it, the set continues to convey a feeling of a bit childish.
A pretty regular product.
Like the other films by Johnny English, I couldn't help but wonder if the British film industry could not give Rowan Atkinson a role that makes real justice his talent.
The Labor Party denies that it is developing a plan for British workers to work four days a week, but covers five
Jeremy Corbyn's Labor Party is going to think about a radical plan with which British would work four days a week, but would charge five.
It is assumed that the party wants the owners of the companies to provide the savings obtained through the artificial intelligence revolution (IA) to the workers, giving them an additional day off.
Thus, employees would enjoy a three - day weekend for the same wage.
According to the sources, the idea of "cashing" into the plans and the economic agenda of the party to bend the country in favour of workers is noted.
This change to a four-day week has been supported by the Congress of Trade Unions, as it is a way for workers to take part in the changing economy.
As a senior member of the Labor Party commented to The Sunday Times: A revision of the directive is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"It will not be achieved one day for another, but the four-day working week is definitely a matter that the party expects to incorporate in order to rebalance the economy in favour of the worker, as well as in the party's general industrial strategy."
The Labor Party would not be the first to support this kind of idea, as the Green Party has already promised a four-day working week in its campaign for the 2017 general election.
However, for the time being, not all the Labor Party supports this decision.
A spokesperson for the workers said: "The four-day working week is not part of the party's policy and is not going to be discussed at this time."
Hacienda Minister in the shadow, John McDonnell, used the Labour Party conference that was held last week to expose his idea of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was willing to recover powers from "anonymous directors" and "exploited" from public service companies.
The Minister's plans in the shadow also include the idea that current water companies' shareholders do not recover their full participation, as a labor government could apply deductions corresponding to perceived irregularities.
It also confirmed its intention to include employees in corporate management councils and to create inclusive equity funds where 10 % of private sector corporate shares should be allocated to employees, which would amount to an annual dividend of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk in "60 Minutes" about FBI research about Kavanaugh and if I could make them change their mind
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed at least one week's final vote for his confirmation as a judge of the Supreme Court and also raises the question of whether the results that are concluded could influence any Republican senator who decides to withdraw his support.
In an interview that will be held on Sunday, the journalist of "60 Minutes", Scott Pelley, asked Republican senators. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham are talking about whether the FBI could bring out information that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
"I was in favour of the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after all this happened, the claim came out, and I asked him, 'Did you do it?'
He showed himself firm, resolute, secretive."
Graham's vote, however, seems unbearable.
"I already have a decision taken around Brett Kavanaugh and I'd drop the charge," he said.
"Mrs. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett firmly denied it," said Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of the people she's appointed has been able to confirm it.
36 years ago.
It's always the same, I don't see anything new in this case."
What is the Global Citizen Festival? Have you managed to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music festival, where an impressive star cartel is gathered for an equally impressive mission: to end poverty in the world.
This year, in its seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people move to the Great Lawn of Central Park to enjoy performances such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to realize the real goal of the event: to end extreme poverty in 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international awareness group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who actively fight against it.
If you want to receive a free entry for the event (unless you can pay a VIP entry), participants at the concerts have had to complete a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteers, send e-mails to a world leader, make a phone call or anything else that serves to realize their goal of ending poverty.
However, what has Global Citizen achieved at 12 years of age?
The idea of rewarding with a free concert is a genuine way to persuade people to take action or not more than a form of so-called "clittivism", which is called to the position that we adopt when we believe we are doing something really useful when signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has claimed to have registered more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters in favour of a large number of different objectives.
As a result of these actions, they claim to have been able to have global leaders announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which will affect lives of more than 2250 million in 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and announcements that arose from its actions, of which at least $10 billion have already been disbursed or recovered.
The group estimates that the guaranteed funds have directly affected almost 649 million people worldwide.
Among the most important commitments are "The Power of Nutrition", an association of investors and executives based in the United Kingdom together with the common commitment to "help children grow and develop with all their potential". To this end, it has been proposed to provide Rwanda $35 million to help end the country's malnutrition after receiving over 4700 tweets from Global Citizens' collaborators.
"Thanks to the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens' collaborators like you, we can mark a small hit in the history of social injustice of malnutrition," Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of "The Power of Nutrition", told the crowd during a concert in April 2018 in London.
The group also stated that, after conducting more than 5,000 actions to try to improve nutrition in the United Kingdom for mothers and children, the government announced the financing of a project, Power of Nutrition, with which 5 million women and children will benefit from nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on its website about what we believe can be done to address extreme poverty,
a Global Citizen collaborator replied: "It will be a long and hard path and, on many occasions, we will stumble and fall.
But as the human rights movements and against apartheid have already achieved before, we will achieve our goals, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae are some of the events we will have at the New York event this year, which will be presented by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
United States could use the Army to block Russia's energy exports - Secretariat of the Interior
"If necessary", Washington could use its Army to prevent Russian energy from disrupting markets, including those of the Middle East, revealed the United States Interior Secretary, Ryan Zinke, as published in Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia's alliance with Syria, in particular where it operates in legitimate government, is no more than a pretext for expansion in new markets.
"I am convinced that they are in the Middle East to negotiate with energy, as they do with Eastern Europe, becoming the most supplier in southern Europe," he said.
In addition, according to official information, there are ways and methods to address this issue.
"The United States, with its Armed Forces, has the ability to ensure that the maritime routes remain open and, when appropriate, could even block them to ensure that energy does not end in the market," he said.
Zinke was addressed to people who attended an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that is defined as the "voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
In it, he compared the approaches Washington maintains in its negotiations with Russia and Iran, and warned that they were, in fact, the same.
"The economic alternative in Iran and Russia is basically to exploit and replace fuels," he warned while pointing out that Russia can only do one thing, which is to base its economy on fossil fuels.
These statements are made when the Trump administration has been trying to boost the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe and highlight its role as Russia, which is the cheapest option for European consumers.
To this end, the members of the Trump administration, including Donald Trump themselves, are trying to persuade Germany to abandon the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, will turn Berlin into a reindeer in Moscow.
Moscow has at all times insisted that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which reaches a value of $11 billion and is intended to double the current capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the project only responds to economic reasons and is a further demonstration of unfair competition.
"I believe that we all share the idea that energy cannot become a pressure tool and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers," said Russian Minister of Energy Alexander Novak, after holding a meeting with Rick Perry, the United States Secretary of Energy last September in Moscow.
The US position, however, has been found with the rejection of Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The organization leading the industry in Germany, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has asked the US not to intervene in EU energy policy or in bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"There is a great problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, director of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a meeting recently held between the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will carefully examine the possibility of presenting himself as a candidate for the presidency in 2020, says Senator of Massachusetts
Senator for Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that he will study the possibility of joining the presidential career after the elections at half a term.
During a meeting in the town of Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that this challenge was under way.
"It is time for women to come to Washington to amend our fractured government and finally to have women among the leaders," The Hill said.
"After 6 November, I will seriously consider the possibility of presenting myself as a candidate for the presidency."
Warren gave his opinion on President Donald Trump during a meeting in the Town Hall and said that he was "carrying the country along the wrong path".
"I'm really worried about the damage Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren spoke unstoppable about Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet last Friday, Warren said that "it is absolutely necessary for the FBI to investigate what happened before the vote".
A survey was published on Thursday in which, however, a majority of Warren's own voters do not believe it should be presented for the 2020 elections.
A 58% of Massachusetts's "possible" voters said that the senator should not appear, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe survey.
However, 32% of respondents supported their candidacy.
The survey showed greater support for the former governor, Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent of support for a possible candidacy and 48 per cent against it.
Other recognized members of the Democratic Party spoke about the possible candidate for 2020 by former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide on this in January, as reported by the Associated Press Agency.
Sarah Palin talks about the post-traumatic stress disorder of Track Palin in a Donald Trump mitin
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being listed in September.
Last Monday night, he was arrested and accused of domestic violence.
"The situation that is going through my son, for all that has happened since he came back, is very well known by the other families that suffer from the effects of the TEPT and other injuries that our soldiers are returning with," said the public who gathered in a mitin for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin referred to this arrest as the great taboo of what no one wants to talk about, and commented on his son and other war veterans who "have different, hardened behavior, wondering if there really exists such respect for what their soldiers and aviators, as well as all the other members of the army, have given their country."
On Monday, he was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, accused of an episode of domestic violence against a woman, who interfered with a report of domestic violence and possession of weapons under the effects of drugs or alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesperson of the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. support the challenge of achieving a new asylum policy
18 States and the District of Colombia support a judicial appeal to the new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence or gangs.
Representatives of the 18 states and the district presented a "friendly" letter in Washington on Friday to show their support for an asylum seeker facing the current directive, NBC News reported.
The full name of the applicant has not been revealed in the case "Grace v. Sessions" that the US Civil Liberties Union (ACLU, American Civil Liberties Union) presented in August against federal policy.
He said his partner "and his children, who are members of a violent gang", abused her, but US officials denied her asylum request on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The lawyers representing these states that defend Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum applications to the United States, such as nations facing widespread problems related to domestic violence and gang violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy recalled a 2014 decision by the Migration Appeals Board (IAB) that undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence could apply for asylum in this country.
The District Attorney General of Columbia, Karl Racine, made a statement on Friday stating that the new policy "ignores decades of international, federal and state law".
"According to federal legislation, all asylum applications must fail under the particular facts and circumstances of the claim and, on the other hand, this exception violates that principle," says the friend curiae.
Lawyers also stated in writing that the policy that denies entry to immigrants damages the US economy by claiming that they usually become entrepreneurs more often and "supply a necessary hand of work".
The Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
"People who leave their countries of origin for persecution or threats of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a social group or a particular political opinion may apply for asylum," Sessions said when he announced this Directive on 11 June last.
Asylum has never been created as a means of dealing with all the problems, not even all the serious problems, faced daily by people around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the number of dead increases in a career to find survivors
For survivors, the situation was getting worse.
"The situation is very tense," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, while trying to comfort her baby with fever in an evacuation center of the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute ambulances arrive with more bodies.
And water is scarce."
Some residents have returned to their ruined homes to retrace the few stolen property remaining in an effort to recover what they can.
There are hundreds of injured people and hospitals, also damaged due to magnitude 7.5 earthquake, are flooded.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Harris, who had his back and a broken shoulder, rested outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were treated outside the building due to the continuous replicas, also very strong.
I couldn't help crying when he told us the violent earthquake he lived while on the fifth floor of the hotel with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I was trapped in the remains of the ruined wall, I think," Haris told Associated Press. He and his family were in town to celebrate a wedding.
"I heard my wife ask for help and then a tremendous silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're okay."
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of "bullying" with "propagandistic ads"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page announcement in a U.S. newspaper promoting the mutual benefits of trade between the U.S. and China, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread its propaganda.
Last Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump referred to China Daily's payment supplement at the Des Moines Register, Iowa's most-selling newspaper, after accusing China of wanting to interfere in the United States Congress elections on 6 November, something that China roundly denies.
The accusation that Trump launched on Beijing's attempt to influence the U.S. elections marked what U.S. officials indicated to Reuters as a new phase in a growing campaign launched by Washington to pressure China.
While it is common for foreign governments to publish advertisements to promote their trade activities, Beijing and Washington are currently blocked in a growing trade war that has led them to increase tariff levels in imports by both sides.
The countervailing tariffs of China applied to the beginning of the trade war were thought to reclaim state exporters such as Iowa, who supported the Republican Party of Trump, according to Chinese and US experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, who is one of China's major exporters of agricultural products, said Beijing had damaged US workers, farmers and entrepreneurs.
According to Branstad in an opinion article at the Des Moines Register Sunday, China "is still intensifying that pressure with advertisements in our free press."
"To try to spread its propaganda, the government of China is benefiting from the precious American tradition of freedom of expression and free press when trying to publish a payment announcement at the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the other hand, in the middle of the street where we are here in Beijing, there are only a few shocking voices and no real reflection of the clear views that people in China may have about the worrying trajectory that is taking over the economy of their country, as the media are controlled by the firm pressure of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most relevant journals eluded the offer to publish" his article, although he did not specify which journal it was.
Analysts point out that Republicans are distanced from women before the mid-legislative vote with the debacle of Kavanaugh
As many renowned Republicans are closing ranks in favour of the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh in the face of the various allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that a backlog, especially by women, can occur in the next half-legislative votes.
The emotions surrounding this fact have been very intense and are many Republicans who have expressed their desire to proceed with the vote.
"It is not possible to go back in this kind of business," said Grant Reeher, a professor of Political Sciences at Maxwell School at the University of Syracuse, to The Hill in an article that was published on Saturday.
Reeher argued that the last attempt by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to take a stand in favor of the FBI's investigation would be sufficient to calm the voters who were upset about this matter.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday; they will not forget it tomorrow or November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior and national spokesman of the Progressive Group MoveOn, according to Washington newspaper, D.C.
On Friday morning, protesters who gathered at the Senate's doors were horrified "November is coming!" (November will come soon!) at the time when the Republicans who controlled the Judicial Committee decided to proceed with Kavanaugh's candidacy, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, as Mic reported.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the democrats is out of the question," said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst, to the news site.
"People say that impact is already very relevant and, indeed, it is.
But it could be even bigger, especially among the indecisive women from the outside neighborhoods and the younger voters, between the ages of 18 and 29, who do not usually vote even though they don't like the president."
Even before Ford's public testimony, in which he had full details of his allegations of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts indicated that a backlog could occur if Republicans continued to confirm.
"This matter has become a big deal for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, the former president of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It is not only a question of the committee's vote or the final vote anymore, not even if they are sitting in the bench at Kavanaugh; it is also about how the Republicans have handled all this and how they have dealt with it," said Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities USA (a group that helps in the election of Democrats).
However, Americans seem to be divided; they do not know who they should believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, although they are a few more who stand aside from the latter.
A new YeGov survey indicates that 41% of respondents definitively or most likely believe in Ford's testimony, while 35% claim to believe in Kavanaugh definitively or most likely.
In addition, 38% said that he thought that Kavanaugh had probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while 30% said the same about Ford.
After Flake's push, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's statements, as well as at least those of the other complainant, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified under oath to the Senate Judicial Commission last week and indicated that Kavanaugh raped her by being drunk at the age of 17.
Ramirez claimed, for his part, that the candidate to the Supreme Court showed his genitals at a party when he studied in Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web intends to start a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new company that is trying to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt is the latest project of technology legend. A company based on Berners-Lee’s Solid Open Code Platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people will have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is to "dominating the world".
"It must be now," he said about the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology so that users can create their own "on-line personal data storage" or a POD.
You can include lists, pending to-dos, calendars, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in a browser and at the same time.
Something that is exclusive in storing personal data online is that the user is who decides completely who can access what kind of information.
The company calls it "personal training through data".
The idea of Inrupt, according to the company's CEO, John Bruce, is to incorporate the necessary resources, processes and skills so that Solid can reach the whole world.
At the moment, the company is composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform that bought IBM, some of the developers included in the template that were hired to work on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week on, technological developers around the world could create their own decentralized apps with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether or not you are going to introduce a radical change where all your business models are completely modified from day to day.
"We're not asking for permission."
In a publication in Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote about Inrupt that "his mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new solid web".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has played a very influential role in the debate on network neutrality.
Despite even being launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this next era of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: The Clerk Who Winned a Victory Cross in World War I
The only clergy of the Church of England who won a Victoria Cross during the 1st World War as a combatant has been honored in its hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann obtained this decoration on September 29, 1918 at the Bellenglise and Lehaucourt attack.
However, a sniper killed him four days later and I never knew that he had been granted the highest British military honor.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren discovered a memorial stone and a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of them, Michael Vann, said it was "a special symbolism" that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after the battle that earned his grandfather's decoration.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Canal of Saint-Quentin "through a thick fog and under the intense fire of meteors and cannons".
Then he ran to the line of fire and, with the "greater courage", made the line move before he reached a cannon with one hand and dropped to three of the highlights.
Lieutenant Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month after the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that the actions that his grandfather took were "so great that I could never reach his height, but they were very elective".
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also deposited a crown of flowers after the parade, which included the participation of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "it was all a privilege for him to be part of the parade" and added that "the value of an authentic hero is patented when he is shown such a countless support".
MMA followers were awake all night for Bellator 206, but only saw Peppa Pig
Imagine that you stay up all night to see the whole Bellator 206 so they won't let you see the main event in the end.
The San José cartel had 13 fights, six included in the main card, and in the United Kingdom it was going to be broadcast live at night on Channel 5.
At 6 p.m., just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were getting ready to face, the United Kingdom television viewers remained at a standstill when the program changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were not surprised when they had to stay up until the first hour of the morning just to see the fight.
A Twitter follower described the change in cartoons as "a heavy joke".
"There is a government regulation that regulates the content issued from 6am and this was not appropriate, so they had to change the programming of children," said Dave Schwartz, Senior Marketing and Communication Vice-President Bellator, when we asked him about the transmission.
"Puppa la farta", yes."
Bellator's president, Scott Coker, said they're going to change the program to include British spectators in the next editions.
"When I think of the retransmission option, I think it can work," Coker said.
"But it's 6:00 in the morning on Sunday, so we couldn't do it until Sunday at our time, which would already be Monday for them.
We're seeing how to do it.
Believe me, when programming changed, a lot of messages were received and not all were friendly, exactly.
We're trying to fix it, because at first we think it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't like that, it was a government problem.
I can promise you that next time it won't happen.
We will reduce it to five fights instead of six, which are what we have usually done. We try to offer more than usual so that the fans are happy and we pass.
It's a very unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior to her sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to the rest because of his sexuality, although this was, in turn, what motivated him to become a triumphalist.
At the age of 24, he told us that he didn't realize until he came to high school that "they weren't all like me."
In the first program of Desert Island Radio Discs 4, presented by Lauren Laverne, she said her intention in talking about gay rights was to convey "hope" to others.
He also told us that becoming a father made him begin to remain important in winning the Olympics.
The usual presenter of this mythical program, Kirsty Young, will be absent for a few months because of illness.
In Laverne's first program, Daley, who showed herself as a marginalist, commented that she felt "less" to the rest during her childhood, because "it was not socially acceptable that you liked children and girls".
He said, "To this day, that feeling of inferiority and being different has been what has really given me the power and strength to triumph."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he didn't disappoint when he finally discovered his sexuality.
The winner of two bronze medals in the Olympics has become a prominent profile of the LGBT movement and its image has been used in the Commonwealth Games this year held in Australia to claim more countries to commit homosexuality.
He said he told him because he was happy to live in freedom, without reprisals, and wanted to convey that "hope" to others.
The three times champion of the world said it was also a surprise for him to fall in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married the winner of an Oscar last year, who has been 20 years, although she said that the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you've lived so long since you were so young" (he was at his first 14-year-old Olympics and his father died of cancer three years later), it's hard to find someone of the same age who's been through the same high and low as you.
The couple had a child in June called Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said that their "global perspective" had changed.
"If they had asked me last year, all the answers would have turned around 'I have to win a gold medal'," he said.
"But you know what, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic Gold Medal is, of course, Robbie."
His son is called his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was going to die and, in fact, one of the last things he asked is whether they had the steps for London 2012, because he wanted to be in the first row.
"I wasn't able to tell him I wasn't going to be in the first row," he said.
"He held his hand between my hands when he stopped breathing and was not until that very moment when he stopped breathing and died that I realized that he was not invincible," he commented.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"At that moment I knew that was what I had dreamed of all my life: competing in the pool in front of mine in Olympic Games, there was nothing better," he said.
This fact was also the one that inspired you at the time of choosing your first song, the Proud of Heather Small, who accompanied you in the preparation phase of the Olympic Games. He was still wearing chicken skin.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, in low form, stayed in the bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to reverse his form if he wants to avoid becoming a sad hit.
Mickelson, who played at the event held every two years for a 12th time record, was released by Captain Furyk for the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as he has often done for the United States, the five-time major tournament champion had to comply with the encouragement at some point and, in others, try to perfect his game in the field and thus be able to correct his distress.
Never the most direct driver, not even at the highest moment of his career, the 48-year-old player is not in his best shape for the Le Golf National field, where the long round is constantly punishing with wrong hits.
And if the field is no longer sufficiently discouraging, Mickelson, on Sunday's ninth match, faces the brilliant British Open, Francesco Molinari champion, who has joined the debut Tommy Fleetwood to win the four games they have played this week.
If the Americans, who were four points below the start of the 12 individual parties, started out in an impressive way, the Mickelson party could have been decisive.
Furyk showed confidence in his companion, nor could he say much more.
"He perfectly understood the role he had today, gave me a palm in the back and, surrounding me with his arm, said he would be ready tomorrow," Fury said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He's in the Famous Hall and has made a lot of contributions to these teams before and this week.
I probably didn't think he was playing two games.
I thought it would be more, but that's how it came out and that's how we thought it had to be.
He wants to be there, like the rest."
On Sunday, Mickelson will overcome Nick Faldo's brand of the more games played by the Ryder Cup.
It could be the last of a whole Ryder Cups trail that had never so clearly equaled the levels of its individual brand.
Mickelson has 18 winnings, 20 losings and 7 equals, although Furyk said his presence brought many more untraceable values to the team.
"It's fun, sarcastic, ingenious, he likes to joke about others; it's great to have it on the team," he explained.
"I think the younger players have loved to have it as support this week, too; it was fun.
It brings much more than just a game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that leadership can disappear very soon
Thomas Bjorn, Captain of Europe, knows very well that, although you come with a substantial advantage in the last days of the Ryder Cup, you can easily become an uncomfortable tournament.
The Danes made their debut in the 1997 Valderrama match, where a band captained by Seven Ballesters maintained a five-point advantage over the Americans, but in the end they only managed to finish with the others by walking them down a minimum margin, winning 1411⁄2-1311⁄2.
"Don't stop remembering that we did a great tournament in Valderrama; we also did it in Brooklyn and lost, we did it in Valderrama and we won, but very little," said Bjorn, portraited, after seeing the 2018 generation win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday lead it with a 10-6 in Le Golf National.
History will teach me and everyone that this team is not finished.
You have to give it all morning.
Get out there and do what you have to do.
This doesn't end until the points are in the marker.
We have a goal to achieve, that is to win this trophy, and that is all we have to think about.
I say this all the time, I focus on the 12 players of our team, but we are very aware of what is on the other side where they are, no less, than the best players in the world."
proud of what their players have done in a very hard golf course, Bjorn added: "I don't want to move forward.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
What prevails tomorrow are individual actions and this is different.
It's great to share what's going on with a partner when things go well, but when you're alone there, you'll test all your ability as a golfer.
That's the message you have to convey to the players, get the best out of the same morning.
Now it's up to you to leave your partner aside, go and get the best out of yourself."
In front of Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will try to make his players do better individually than what they did as a couple, being the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who added three points of four.
The same Furyk has been in both extremes in the last days of those big tournaments and has been part of the team he won in Brooklyn and then ended up losing when Europe took over the "Miracle of Medina".
"I remember every word," he told us when we asked him how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, managed to motivate his players on the last day.
"We have 12 super important games tomorrow, but we have to start as well as we did in Brooklyn, as you saw in Medina.
When we all move in one direction, all the pressure falls on those intermediate parties.
We defined our strategy and made them come out with the feeling that we were going to try to do something magical tomorrow."
We assigned Thomas the task of trying to lead the fight and confront Rory McIlroy in the main match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the second half of the list.
"I went with this group of boys in this order because I think they cover the whole trip," Bjorn said about their individual selections.
The new German warship, postponed again
The new Fragata of the German Navy should have been commissioned in 2014 to replace the old ships of the Cold War era, but it will not be done until at least the year that comes due to defective systems and the progressive increase in costs, the local media reported.
The delivery of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the ship that heads the new baden-Württemberg class frigates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper.
The ship should have joined the Army in 2014, but the problems that arose after the delivery delayed the completion of the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class who applied for the Navy in 2007 will replace the old Bremen class frogs.
We know that they will include a powerful cannon, a set of anti-air and anti-bulk missiles, as well as some invisibility technologies, such as radar, infrared and very low acoustic signals.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, so that they can be deployed for up to two years away from the ports of origin.
However, the continued delays have caused the innovative ships (which were supposed to allow Germany to project its power at the overseas) to be old when they start providing service, says Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 Fragata occupied titlers last year, when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into operation and returned it to the shipyard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
It's been the first time that the Navy has returned a boat to a shipyard after its delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind the return, but the German media quoted a number of crucial "software and hardware defects" that left the ship virtually useless if sent to a combat mission.
Software deficiencies were particularly important, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors: half of the staff in the old Bremen class.
It was also found that the ship had an excessive burden, reducing its performance and limiting the capacity of the Navy to add future updates.
The "Reinland-Pfalz" of 7,000 tons is believed to be twice as heavy as other similar class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the cost of the whole project, including the training of the crew, has also posed a problem.
It is believed that it has reached €31 billion ($3600 million), instead of €22 billion initially.
The problems that are attributed to the new frogs are of particular relevance in the light of recent warnings on the reduction of German naval power.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, acknowledged that the Army is "remaining without ships capable of deploying".
The officer said that the problem had been getting worse over time, because the old boats were down but had not been replaced with others.
He lamented that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class frogs could have joined the Navy.
The National Trust mirrors the secret life of the martyrs
This new research, which has been carried out in a state of the Scottish Highlands, is trying to find out how Murcielagos use the landscape in their search for food.
Everything is expected to shed more light on the behaviour of the only flying mammals and help guide the next conservation activities.
The study, conducted by the National Trust for Scotland, will follow the common and soprano turtles, as well as the Daubenton coastal turtles and long ear browns of the Inverewe gardens in Western Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in strategic locations of the property to track the activities of the bats during the season.
The NHS template and volunteers will also carry out mobile research with portable detectors.
Experts will analyze the sounds collected in the recordings to discover the frequency of the calls of the bats and what species they do.
A report and a map of the habitat will then be produced to create a detailed picture of the environment and its behaviour.
Rob Dewar, Nature Conservation Advisor for NTS, expects the results to reveal what habitat areas are most important to the musculoskeletal and how each species uses them.
This information will determine the benefits of the habitat management work, such as the creation of meadows and how forests for turtles and other associated species should be maintained.
The populations of mussels in Scotland and the United Kingdom have been significantly reduced in the last century.
They are threatened by the construction and development that affects their nests and the loss of their habitat.
Wind turbines and electric cables may also pose a risk to them, as well as insecticides and other chemical treatments of building materials or domestic cats.
The musculoskeletals are not really blind,
but because of their nightly hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes to achieve their goal.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technique that locates ants and obstacles on their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76 000 hectares of land throughout the country, is taken seriously by the musciellagues.
He has ten trained experts in the field, who are dedicated to carrying out regular surveys, nest inspections and, at times, rescues.
The organization has even opened the first and only reserve dedicated to Scottish turtles in the state of Thrave in Dumfries and Galloway, which is the home of eight of the ten species of Scottish turtle.
The director of the property, David Thompson, says it's the ideal territory for them.
"Here, in Thrave, we have a fantastic area for turtles," he said.
"We have old buildings, many veteran trees and all the proper habitat.
However, there are still many unknown things about the murceliacs, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us better understand what they need to develop."
Stresses the importance of checking whether there are murceliacs before carrying out maintenance tasks within the property, as an involuntary breeding colony can be destroyed and 400 females and females could be killed, which would mean destroying the entire local population.
The Murcielagos are protected and it is illegal to kill, slaughter or disturb them, as well as to destroy their colonies.
Elizabeth Ferrell, the Scottish officer in charge of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to cooperate.
He said, "We still have a lot to learn about turtles and many other species we don't know how their populations evolve."
Ronaldo denies allegations of rape at the same time as his lawyers prosecute the German magazine
Christian Ronaldo has catalogued allegations of rape as "fake news", and says that people "want to get to know themselves" at the expense of their name.
His lawyers have received instructions to report to the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which was where the statements were published.
In front of Portugal and Juventus, he was accused of rapeing an American woman, named Kathryn Mayorga, at a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is accused of having paid $375 000 to hide the incident, as Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
With a video from Instagram Live that has already accumulated 142 million followers a few hours after the news was published, Ronaldo, 33 years of age, picked up the report as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they have said today is false," says the five-time winner of the Golden Ball looking at the camera.
"They only want advertising at the expense of my name.
It's always the same story.
They want to make themselves famous just to mention me, but that's right, I can't help it.
I'm a happy man and everything's okay," the player added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing a claim to Der Spiegel for the allegations that appear in what they have called "an unacceptable report of suspicions in the area of privacy", reports Reuters.
Counsel Christian Schertz said that the player will try to obtain compensation for "moral damage to an amount corresponding to the severity of the injury, which is probably one of the most serious violations of his personal rights in recent years".
It seems that the alleged incident took place in June 2009 at a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player's room and there he allegedly raped her annually, according to documents registered in the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga stated that Ronaldo was surrounded after the alleged incident and told him that he was in a "99 percent" a "good boy" and that he had cheated on that "one percent" remaining.
The documents state that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex but that he had consented.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that they took photographs of the injuries in the hospital, but later agreed to an extrajudicial arrangement because she had "terror in reparations" and concerned her "to be humiliated in public".
The 34-year-old woman claims that she is trying to cancel the agreement, as she is still being traumatized by the facts.
When the alleged aggression occurred, Ronaldo was about to join the Royal Madrid from Manchester United and this summer has changed to Juve, a big Italian football for a 100 million € contract.
Brexit: UK would always regret losing car manufacturers
The United Kingdom "would regret all its life" if it lost its position as world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, said Industry Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "anxious" that Toyota UK would inform the BBC that, if Britain left the EU without an agreement, production would temporarily be stopped at its Burnaston plant near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese manufacturer claimed that the impact of delays in customs duties on a Brexit could lead to loss of work.
The Burnston plant, which manufactures Toyota Auris and Avensis models, produced about 150 000 cars last year, of which 90% was exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain breaks up with the EU at the end of March, there will be production stalls in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Director General of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers have shown their fears about the EU's exit without an agreement, especially with regard to cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns addressed by car manufacturers revolve around the problems that could arise in the mounting chains in the case of a Brexit without agreement.
The Toyota production line is based on the adjusted production mode (‘just in time’) or at the last moment, where the pieces come every 37 minutes from UK and EU suppliers to manufacture cars for charge.
If, on 29 March, the United Kingdom leaves the European Union without an agreement, there could be an interruption at the border which, according to the sector, could result in delays and lack of parts.
For Toyota it would be impossible to accommodate the amount of material equivalent to more than one day of inventory on its Derbyshire plant, the company said and, if so, the production would be stopped.
Mr Clark said that the Theresa May Chequers plan, where future relations with the EU are established, is "precisely calibrated to avoid such controls at border crossings".
"We need an agreement. We want the best agreement that not only allows us to get out of the way right now but we need to take advantage of the opportunity," said the BBC Radio Today programme 4.
"The evidence of Toyota, among other things many manufacturers, is that we have to be able to continue with what has, so far, been a set of tremendously successful supply chains."
Toyota has not been able to say how long the production would be stopped, but warned that in the long term the added costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately costs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the head of the United Union on the plant, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "After my experience, once these jobs are lost, they will never be recovered."
One government spokesman said, "We have put in place a precise and convincing plan that limits our future relations with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, according to the White House
Donald Trump's high-risk meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could "stop for another week", as he continued the dispute over the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating interference in the Russian elections, links between Trump and Russia's aid, and a possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The expectation ahead if Trump decides to fire the deputy general or not and thus compromise Mueller's independence has fed Washington knives for months.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein recorded the conversations he had with Trump with a microphone that he himself was taking to try to untie the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied it was true.
Last Monday, however, he went to the White House, among the news where he said he was about to give up.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump (which was then in the United Nations in New York) for Thursday.
Trump said that "I would prefer not" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting had to be postponed to avoid a conflict with the hearing of the U.S. Senate Judicial Committee in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday Trump asked the FBI to investigate charges against Kavanaugh for one week, although this would delay the Senate's full vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared Sunday in Fox News.
When asked about Rosenstein's meeting, he said: "No date has been defined, could be this week or could be postponed another, considering everything that is happening with the Supreme Court.
We will decide on the move and I will inform the press, as usual."
Some journalists would reject this statement: Sanders has not carried out any press rounds in the White House since 10 September.
The presenter Chris Wallace asked what the reasons were.
Sanders said that the lack of press wheels was not due to an aberration to TV journalists who act with great frequency, although he said, "I will not disagree with the fact that they are fanfarron".
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would be increased.
"The President carries out more questions and answers than any other president before him," he said, while quoting without proof: "We have contrasted these numbers."
The press wheels will continue to take place, Sanders said, but "If the press has the option to ask the president of the United States directly, I think it's much better than doing it to me.
We try to do it many times and you've seen us do it many times in the last few weeks, so this would replace a press wheel when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump usually answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public meetings or press meetings with the dignitaries who visit him.
Press conferences with him only happen on very rare occasions.
In fact, this week, in New York, the president showed why he was so, where he made a rash appearance and, at times, bizarrely, before the journalists who were gathered there.
The State Health Secretary writes to the EU workers of the NHS Scotland about their fears in Brexit
The Secretary of Health has written to the EU template working in Scotland's HHS to express the country's gratitude and its desire to follow them after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter only six months before the United Kingdom withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed itself to covering the cost of citizenship applications for EU members working in public services that are not dependent on central power.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on the outcome of the decision-making process this autumn have followed.
However, the United Kingdom Government has also intensified preparations for a possible stage in which it would not agree.
I know that all this must be very confusing to you.
And that is why I would like to reiterate now how much I value the contribution of each member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
Professionals from all over the EU and other countries provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, which benefits patients and communities to whom we serve.
Scotland is, without a doubt, your home and we would love to keep counting on you."
Christion Abercrombie is under urgent surgery after having a head injury
Christian Abercrombie, a player of Tennessee State Tigers, was surgically involved in an emergency after having suffered a head injury last Saturday, when they lost 31-27 against Vanderbilt Commodores, Mike Organ of Tennessee reported.
Coach of Tennessee State, Rod Reed, told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the break.
"He came to the band and he blew himself up there," Reed said.
Both the trainers and the medical staff administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the band line before putting it on a bed and taking it to a thorough examination.
A member of the Tennessee State template told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the operation at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there were no details about the type of injury yet or the damage caused" and Tennessee State is trying to find out when it happened.
Abercrombie, redshirt sophomore, is playing in its first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five pickles on Saturday before leaving the field, with which he added a total of 18 throughout the season.

The Treasury expects to raise up to £ 120 million a year to the "no ceiling"
The additional money raised by the increase in the tax on the transfer of funds to foreign buyers of property in the United Kingdom will be allocated to aid to the "uncovered", Theresa May announced today.
The measure is understood as an attempt to neutralize the success that Jeremy Corbyn is reaping with his promises to provide more affordable housing to attract younger and host voters who have higher incomes.
The increase in money tax will be recorded for people and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and that money will be used to encourage government policy to combat the problem of mercenity in the streets.
The recharge, which is a supplement to the current transmission tax, including the increase in levels introduced two years ago on second-hand housing and the buy-to-let system, could be up to 3%.
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year with this change.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of London's new construction properties are purchased by people who do not live in the United Kingdom, leading to an increase in prices and making it difficult for people who buy for the first time to access affordable housing.
Many of the country's most densely populated areas (especially in the capital) have become "phantom cities" due to the large number of foreign buyers spending most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson claimed a reduction in the transmission tax in order to help young people buy their first home.
He accused the major builders of keeping very high prices in the properties by carefully buying land without intending to use it and urged Ms. May to eliminate the contributions that apply to affordable housing to solve the "golden housing problem" in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn has announced a number of very attractive housing reforms, including rental controls and the end of unwarranted evictions.
It also proposes to grant the local authorities more power to build new houses.
Ms. May said: "Last year I said that I would devote my duty as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream of improving the life of every new generation.
And that means solving the housing market, which is so devastated.
Great Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be that people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as foreign companies, can buy houses with more ease than the British working class.
The dream of having a house has become too difficult to achieve for many people and the humiliation of having to sleep on the street is still too real."
Jack Ross: "My primary goal is to lead Scotland"
Sunderland's coach says his "primordial objective" is to become Scotland's coach at some point.
The 42-year-old Scottish is shown to be deceived by the possibility of revitalizing the club in the north-east, which currently holds the third position in the League One (the third league division of England), at three points from the first.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after taking to St. Mirren again to the Scottish Prime Minister's last season.
"I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
But I only got a B hat," Ross told Sportsound on BBC Scotland.
"But I grew up seeing Scotland in Hampden with my father when he was a child and it's something he's always done that he wants to come back.
This opportunity will only become a reality, however, if I succeed in running a club."
Among Ross' predecessors are Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic says he didn't feel any fear when he came to names so established in such a big club after rejecting Barnsley and Ipswich Town proposals.
"At this moment, success for me is measured according to whether I can return this club to the Premier League,
because the structure and facilities of this club certainly correspond to those of the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get it, but I could only consider that I've achieved my goal here when I can get back to the club where I have to be."
Ross has only been practicing as a coach for three years, after being an assistant in Dumbarton and a period of 15 months in the technical body of Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa recover from the descent to the third division and made St. Mirren pass from being at the edge of the descent to win the championship in the next season.
In fact, Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever during his career as a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably an authentic crossroads," he recalled in reference to when the Alloa was commissioned.
"I always thought the direction was what was best for me, much more than playing.
It may sound strange, because it was good, I could earn my life very well with it and enjoy some epic moments.
But playing can be very hard.
You have to face a lot of things every week.
I still suffer from the stress and pressure of that work; however, in the direction I feel good.
I've always wanted to train and now I've managed to do it, it's the age of my adult life in which I feel better, no doubt."

According to one survey, the perfect time for a painting is 5.30 a.m. on Saturday
The heat wave of the summer has driven profits in British pubs struggling to survive, but concentrated all the pressure on restaurants' chains.
Pubs and bars groups saw their sales increased by 2.7 per cent in July, while the profits of restaurants fell by 4.8 per cent, according to figures.
Peter Martin, from the CGA Business Consultant, who was responsible for collecting the figures, commented: "The heat of these days and the fact that England continues in the world have still made it possible to maintain the pattern of the previous month of June, in which the pubs increased by 2.8% their profits, although the restaurants have fallen even more.
The fall of 1.8% in the commercial activity of restaurants in June was even worse in July.
Pubs and bars serving mainly drinks had their strongest month, in front of most restaurants, in which they reduced profits.
Pubs serving mainly food also suffered with heat, although not as drastic as restaurant operators.
Looks like people just want to go out for a drink.
In the managed bars and pubs, the sales of drinks rose to 6.6% during the month, while the food decreased by 3%.
Paul Newman, of RSM's hospitality and leisure analysts, said: "These results follow the trend we've seen since the end of April.
The time and impact of very important social or sporting events remain the most relevant factors in relation to sales in the outside market.
It is not surprising that the groups of restaurants continue to fight, although the drop of 4.8% in sales compared to last year will be particularly painful in view of continued cost pressures.
The long and warm summer could not have come at a worse time for gastronomic operators and time will tell if the more moderate temperatures we have in August will provide the relief they need.
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including the new ones that have opened, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slow decline in branding.
In Coffer Peach Tracker, which oversees sales in the UK restaurants, bars and pubs sector, the performance data of 47 operational groups are collected and analysed, with a combined turnover of more than £9 billion and is the market reference value.
One out of every five children have secret accounts on social networks behind their parents
One in every five children (some even 11 years old) have secret accounts on social networks behind their parents and teachers, as revealed by a survey.
The survey, carried out by 20,000 high school students, revealed growth on Instagram's fake pages
News has increased the fear that sexual content will be published
About 20% of students claimed to have a "principal" account showing their parents
One in five children (some even 11 years old) create accounts on social networks that hide adults.
A survey conducted by 20,000 secondary students revealed the rapid growth that has been experienced in Instagram's fake accounts, a reference site for sharing photos.
The news has increased the fear of sexual content being published.
A 20% of students said they had a healthy "principal" account that showed their parents, while they had other private ones.
A mother who accidentally met with her 13-year-old daughter's secret site saw how a teenager encouraged others to "violar" me.
The research carried out by the Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters" and Headmistresses" Conference (HMC) of independent colleges found that 40% of children between 11 and 18 years of age had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, director of HMC, said: "It is alarming that so many adolescents are tempted to create Internet spaces where their parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilid Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" in the Scottish Athletics Federation directive
Elid Doyle has been elected to be part of the Scottish Athletics Federation directive as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most talented athlete on the track and field in Scotland and his president, Ian Beattie, described the change as a great opportunity for those who claim that sport will benefit from its great international experience in the past decade.
"Eilid is recognized and respected in the entire community of Scottish, UK and the whole world, and we are sure that athleticism in Scotland will benefit greatly from its directive," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I like to be the spokesperson for athletes and I hope I can bring things and help develop sport in Scotland."
The American, who won 200 meters and 400 meters in the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta between the four golds he won and is now a usual expert on BBC, suffered a transitional ischemic attack that left him unable to walk.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago, I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
According to doctors, only time would determine if I would recover or to what extent I would do so.
It's been exhausting, but I managed to recover completely, I had to learn to walk again and I'm doing agility exercises right now.
Thank you for the messages and words of encouragement!"
The announcement of sacaleches where compared to mothers with cows divides the opinion on the Internet
A company of sacaleches has divided public opinion on the Internet with an ad where it compares to mothers who breast-feed the cows they order.
To mark the launch of what in theory is the "premier silences of the world", the technology company for consumer Elvie published an ad inspired in a video with something ironic music where it is shown to mothers who have the freedom that gives them the new milk extractor.
Four real women dance in a granary full of hay in dance mode, along with a few cows, with letters like, "Yes, I order myself alone, but I don't have tail" and "Because if you haven't noticed it, they're not obese, they're my breasts."
The choir continues to say, "Sort them, order them, I'm feeding their babies, order them, order them, I'm ordering my women."
However, the announcement, which was published on the company's Facebook page, has created a great controversy.
With 77,000 visualizations and hundreds of comments, the video has received reactions from all kinds of people who have seen it, where many say it is possible to focus on the "horrors" of the dairy sector.
"A very unfortunate decision to place cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to be pregnant before giving birth so that they can produce milk, except that they take away their babies days after they stop them," wrote one person.
The Elvie milk extractor is discreetly adapted to a lactating subjectant (Elvie/Mother).
Another person commented: "Troumatic for the mother and the baby.
But, yes, why don't you use them to announce a mother milk extractor that they're staying with their babies?"
Another comment was: "Go a more decalibrated ad."
However, other people defended the announcement, as a woman who admitted that the song was "desterlining".
"I think it's a great idea.
If I'm still breast-feeding, I'm sure I'd have one.
By using the bomb, I felt completely like a cow.
The ad is a bit dedicated, but I don't give it back.
It's a product genius," said a woman.
Another person said to us, "It's a funny announcement addressed to mothers who use a baby bomb (sometimes at work or in public toilets), which makes them feel like cows.
The announcement neither commends nor condemns the dairy sector."
At the end of the video, the group of women show that they have been dancing with the discreet bombs placed inside the subjects.
The concept of the campaign is based on the perception that many women who take out the milk with the bomb say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, has no cables or tubes, and is discreetly connected within the breast-feeder, making it possible for its users to move, subject their babies and even walk out the street with the pump in operation.
Ana Balarin, Mother's partner and ECD, comments: "Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
Showing parallelism between expressive women and milk cows, what we intended was to draw attention to the use of infants' bombs and their challenges, while we demonstrated in an entertaining and close manner the incredible feeling of freedom offered by the new bomb.
This is not the first time the Elvie bomb appears in the headliners.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two children paraded through the gateway for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of minor immigrants discreetly displaced to a camp on the Texas border
The number of minor immigrants detained has experienced a considerable increase, although monthly border fluctuation has been virtually maintained at the usual levels, partly because of the rhetorical toughness and policies introduced by the Trump administration are complicated by the possibility of neglecting these children.
Traditionally, the majority of the parents, who were also undocumented immigrants at the time, feared that the fact of proposing to welcome a child would put their own stay in danger in the country.
This risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential parents and other adult members of their families should present their fingerprints and that data would be shared with governmental immigration entities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior officer of the Immigration and Customs Office, testified to the Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had asked to arrest unaccompanied minors.
The agency confirmed after 70 per cent of those arrested had no criminal record.
"Approximately 80% of the sponsors or their families are illegally located in the country, and most of them are criminal immigrants.
Therefore, we continue to persecute these people," Albence said.
In its commitment to prosecute minors in the most rapid manner, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear before the court within a period of not more than one month from the detention, instead of 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to the workers of the reception centres.
Many of them will testify by videoconference, instead of in person, to defend their legal status before a judge for immigration matters.
Those who are not considered fit for the amperium shall be deported as soon as possible.
According to the workers of the reception centres and reports of the system that have emerged in recent months, the longer they remain under custody, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety or depression, which could lead to violent abductions or attempts to flee.
According to defenders, these concerns increase even more in larger facilities, such as Tornillo, where it is more likely that, due to its size, signs of malaise are ignored in these children.
Moreover, moving to the camp without giving them enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends could cause them a trauma that many are already suffering.
Syria requests the "occupational forces" of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, the Foreign Minister, Walid al-Moualem, also requested Syrian refugees to return to their homes, despite the fact that the country ' s war was in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also the Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces were illegally located in Syrian territory under the pretext of the fight against terrorism and that the topic "will be dealt with accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said to the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terrorism has almost ended" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and several million have been displaced from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue "fighting in this sacred battle until we clear all Syrian territories" of both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence".
The United States has some 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly providing training and advice to the Kurdish and Arab forces in Syria who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 ground soldiers in this country devastated by the war.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem stated that the conditions for returning and blaming "some Western countries" for "seeing irrational fears" that the refugees decided to stay outside the country.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union have already warned that they will not help with the reconstruction of Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
United Nations diplomats claim that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a detention area in the last major rebel base of Idlib has created an opportunity to force political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a large-scale attack by the Syrian and Russian forces in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem has made it clear that the agreement had "clear spaces" and has expressed the hope that military action will focus on the Yihadists, including combatants of the Nusra Front (linked to Al-Qaeda), who will "be eradicated".
Staffan de Miscura, a United Nations special envoy, hopes to convene shortly the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem laid down the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, arguing that the work of the panel should be restricted "to review the articles of the current constitution" and warned against any interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to that logic, Trump would win the re-election in 2020, unless, as many liberal spectators will probably expect, a resignation or a scandal would soon end their presidency.
This would certainly be "the most dramatic end of a presidency ever seen!"
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue in the viewers.
Since 2014, the indexes reached at the maximum audience time have doubled to CNN by up to 1.05 million and have nearly tripled to MSNBC by up to 1.6 million.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in maximum audience hours, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and The Rachel Maddow Show of MSNBC has exceeded the cable channels indexes with 3.5 million viewers for the main night news programs.
"It's a strange attraction that we haven't understood yet," says Neal Baer, author-producer of "Designed Survivor", a dramatic series of the ABC on a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
Remembers a taxi trip he made in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The cab driver told him to vote for Trump.
Why? He asked her.
"Because it makes me laugh," was the answer Scovell received.
Chaos is always up in the entertainment world.
Obviously, and unlike anything else that is seen on television, the arguments coming out of Washington could determine the future of the Roe Case against Wade, the possibility that immigrant families can meet together or the health of the global economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that can only be allowed by the most privileged spectators.
However, the information goes beyond the limits when you realize that you've been seeing a panel of experts for six hours discussing the use of the sources of "deep background" that Bob Woodward used for his book "Fare", Paul Manafort's leather hunter ($5,000) ("a piece of unscrupulous pride" in the words of The Washington Post) and the implications of the slender descriptions of Storm Daniels of Trump's anatomy.
As far as I'm concerned, I'll never see Super Mario again in the same way.
"By offering something new every night, it's part of what makes everything look like a reality show," says Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", when talking to us about the alternate division of Trump's show and its daily rounds of the plot (whether going into a fight against the NFL or praising Kim Jong-un).

When I went to talk to Mr. Fleiss this week, I had a sunny 27-degree day on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was on his way home looking at MSNBC while recording CNN.
I couldn't get rid of the TV, not with Brett Kavanaugh ready to face the Senate Judicial Commission and with the future of the Supreme Court hanging from a thread.
"I remember when we did all those crazy programs in those days and people told us that it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Fleiss says.
"I thought it was all a joke, but in the end it turned out they were right."

The external money flows in the most adjusted half term of office of the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that the flow of money is reaching the 17th district of Pennsylvania, thanks to the restructuring of a Congressional district with two candidates seeking re-election for the same rank.
This residential district of Pittsburgh, whose structure is recently redesigned, has the Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb faces another candidate for re-election, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, a district that is largely depleted with the new 17.
The maps were redesigned after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the former districts had been unconstitutionally manipulated in favour of the Republicans.
The new 17 has launched a funding content for campaigns between the main financial arms of the parties, the National Democratic Campaign Committee (NCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb's name became very familiar in Pennsylvania after a close victory in a special election held in March for the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania.
That seat had been occupied by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for its support for China, although after its failure
Diplomatics observed that the Dominican and Panamanian Republic had already recognized Beijing, with a slight rejection by Washington.
Trump met with President Juan Carlos Varela from Panama in June 2017 and held a hotel in Panama until the partners disbanded the Trump Management Team.
Officials of the Department of State decided to return to the heads of the United States diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of the "recent decisions to stop recognizing Taiwan", said Heather Naurut, the spokesman of the department, in a statement this month.
But it was only decided to punish El Salvador, which had already received some US$ 140 million in 2017 for, among other things, drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, including cuts to financial aid and restrictions on certain visas, would have been very painful for the Central American country and its high rates of unemployment and crime.
As the internal meetings progressed, American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting held last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to avoid emigration to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that their intention was to continue the conference, which would put an end to any consideration of sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence intends to speak at the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October and which, as diplomats, is seen as a sign of the importance the administration has given to the meeting.
The three United States envoys returned peacefully to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any further threats or punishment from Washington.
A spokesperson for the Bolton White House refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three United States officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to deal with internal deliberations under the condition of anonymity.
His explanations were corroborated by an external analyst near the administration, who also spoke under anonymity.
The Study of History
The following possible step could be the report of Special Counsel Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of Trump's justice, which already has considerable evidence in the public register.
It is believed that Mueller is also taking this research into the possibility that Trump's campaign worked in parallel with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If Congress changes hands, Trump will be accountable to that chamber, just when he prepares to re-present himself to the voters, and perhaps finally to a jury of his peers.
This is a lot of conditional, and I do not suggest that Trump's fall is inevitable, nor is it the equivalent in Europe.
We will all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will have an effect on the length of the content.
In 1938, German officials were ready to give a coup d'état against Hitler. It was only necessary for the West to resist and support the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We have failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of butchery that followed.
The course of history revolves around these points of inflection, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are now facing several of these inflection points.
What would we do if Trump fired General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been seen in a good way since this paper reported that last year he had suggested that the president should be secretly recorded and speculated about his inability to hold office.
Rosenstein says the explanation of The Times is not accurate.
"How will we respond if the new investigation requested by the F.B.I. on Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if it confirms its position in the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
In addition to all this, will we vote in the mid-term elections a Congress that will report to Trump?
If we fail these tests, we will meet with a long winter for democracy.
But thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague, I don't think we'll fail.
My mother was a Czech Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador's house.
He managed to survive, emigrated to the United States, and, 60 years later, sent me to set on fire the candles of Sabath on the same table decorated with a swastika.
With that legacy, how am I not going to be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorans de los Rangers, optimistic in front of the Rapid Vienna meeting
The Rangers will play at home on Thursday against the Rapid Vienna, knowing that a victory over the Austrians, after the impressive empate in Spain against the Villareal in early months, will put them in a strong position to be classified in Group G of the League of Europe.
A knee injury prevented the mid-campist Graham Dorans from achieving its first appearance of the season until the empate from 2 to 2 against the Villareal, but he believes the Rangers can use this result as a trampoline for bigger things.
"We managed to draw a good point, because Villareal is a good team," said the 31-year-old player.
"We started the game believing that we could get something and get out with a point.
Maybe we could have achieved the victory at the end, but, in general, the empathy was perhaps a fair result.
They were better in the first half, but after the rest we went out for everyone and we were the best team.
We will have another great European night this Thursday.
I hope that we can achieve the three points, but it will be a difficult game because they have already achieved a good result in the previous game, but with all the public supporting us, I am sure we will be able to move forward and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely hard with my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now a general environment is noticeable that everything will work out.
The team is well, the boys are enjoying a lot and we are having good training.
I hope we can move forward, leave behind the past season and achieve success."
Fear of retirement savings is making some women lose their sleep
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few people were talking about this to their relatives.
About half of the people who participated in the Nationwide study said they were talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they were talking to their children about this.
"People want a family to take care of them, but they are not taking steps to have this conversation," says Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationalwide Life Insurance Company.
This is the way to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: you cannot prepare your family for care if you do not express your wishes in advance.
Work with your advisor and your family to talk about where and how to get attention, as these options can be a determinant of the cost.
It incorporates in the conversion to its financial advisor, as it can also help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Your long-term care financing options can include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to help you cover your expenses or make sure yourself with your own savings, whenever you have the money.
Negotiate your legal documents: face legal battles.
Be responsible for obtaining a medical care power to designate a person of trust who supervises his medical care and ensures that professionals comply with their own wishes if they cannot communicate.
You can also prepare a notary power for your finances.
Select a trusted person to make financial decisions on his behalf and make sure that his bills are paid if he is incapacitated.
Do not forget about the small details: imagine your old father has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Describe all these details in a written plan so that you are always up to date.
"It's not just the finances that are at stake: what doctors should be treated with?" Martin asked.
"What medicines are you taking?
Who'll take care of the dog?
Everything has to be planned."
They shoot a man several times with a rifle in Ilfracombe
They shot a man with a rifle several times while he was walking home after going out at night.
The victim, a man about 40 years old, was in the area of Oxford Grove of Ilfracombe (Devon) when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Police officers described the shooting, which occurred around 02:30 (British time), as a "random act".
The victim didn't see his attacker.
His injuries are not mortal and the police have made an appeal to potential witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died because of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu last Friday, the authorities said.
With blocked communications, assistance officers have not been able to obtain any information from the Dongala Regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here you can see some important details about Palu and Dongala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Sulawesi Central, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Dongalla is a regent that extends along more than 300 km (180 miles) of coast in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
Regent, which is a hierarchically lower administrative region than the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of the province of Sulawesi Central, especially in the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but they focus mainly on Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongala have been affected by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongala.
A tsunami also struck the west of Dongala in 1996, with nine deaths.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Fire Zone, an area of great seismic activity, and it is often hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the main earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the province of Aceh in Indonesia, north of Sumatra, caused on 26 December a tsunami that affected 14 countries and killed 226,000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean. More than half of the victims occurred in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
There were hundreds of deaths on the island of Nias, opposite the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake hit the south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, and triggered a tsunami that affected the southern coast, with nearly 700 fatalities.
2009: A 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake of magnitude 7.5 struck one of the islands of Mentawai, near Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of people and killed about 300 people.
2016: A little deep earthquake struck the Pide Jaya Regency in Aceh, causing destruction and panic in recalling the destruction of the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
This time it caused no tsunamis, but the collapse of buildings caused the death of more than 100 people.
2018: The tourist island of Lombok (Indonesia) had a series of earthquakes of great magnitude that caused the death of more than 500 people, most in the north side of the island.
The earthquake devastated thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily evicted.
The eldest son of Sarah Palin arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice President Sarah Palin, has been arrested for acts of aggression.
Palin, 29 years old and a citizen of Wasilla (Alaska), was arrested under suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a report of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to the report published on Saturday by the Alaska State Police.
According to that police report, when one of his acquaintances tried to call the police to report alleged crimes, he removed the phone.
Palin has been sentenced to a pretrial facility in Mat-Su and is held with an unsecured guarantee of $500, KTUU reported.
He was brought before the court on Saturday, where he was declared "finally innocent" when his statement was requested, he informed the chain.
Palin faces three minor offences of Class A, which means he could spend up to a year in prison and receive a fine of $250,000.
He was also charged with a minor Class B crime, with one day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges against Palin are presented.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic aggression, of interfering with the complaint of a crime of domestic violence and of possession of a weapon in a state of drunkenness, in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend had said she gave him a punch on her face.
Several veteran groups criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 for linking her child's violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder resulting from her service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi last Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have fallen and the number of dead is expected to increase in the next few days.
The earthquake occurred right next to the center of Sulawesi, located north-east of Yakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
There are several videos that circulate on social networks and show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami arrived at the coast.
Federal prosecutors exceptionally seek the death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in New York
The federal prosecutors in New York are looking for the capital penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people, an exceptional punishment that has not been executed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack last October on a bicycle car on the West Side motorway of Bajo Manhattan, heading down to the pedestrians and cyclists on his way.
In order to justify a death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "intendedly" killed the eight victims and "intendedly" caused serious bodily injuries, according to the notice of intention to apply for a death penalty, presented in the South District of New York.
The two charges entail a possible death penalty, according to the court document.
Several weeks after the attack, a large federal jury filed a charge against Saipov with 22 charges including eight charges of murder with organized crime, which are usually used by federal prosecutors in these cases, and a charge of violence and destruction of motorized vehicles.
The attack required "substantial planning and premeditation", according to the prosecutors, who described the way Saipov carried it out as "atrocious, cruel and reckless".
"Sayful Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and losses to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", is specified in the notice of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been a decade since the South District of New York processed a death penalty case.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of murdering two drug traffickers, but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York went to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg in 1953. This marriage was executed after they were convicted of conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The two Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, an immigrant from Uzbekistan, demonstrated his lack of remorse during the days and months following the attack, according to judicial documents.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the charge, Saipov told the authorities that for his attack he was inspired by videos of ISIS on his phone.
He also asked for the ISIS flag to be issued in his hospital room, the police said.
The charge of 22 charges has been declared innocent.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders lawyers representing Saipov, said they are "of course disappointed" with the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept a declaration of guilt with a perpetual sentence of chains without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all the people involved," Patton said.
The Saipov defence team had previously requested prosecutors not to request the death penalty.
Mr Tory says that NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for Brexit's negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the popular army" today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former UKIP leader said that politicians had to "feel the warmth" of the Eurosceptics, while one of Theresa May's MPs suggested that he should deal with negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said at the Birmingham concentration that the United Kingdom "would have left" if Farage had been Brexit's secretary.
But the challenge faced by Prime Minister May to reconcile his divided rows has been even more highlighted when a Tories group for the sake of permanence have joined a protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to maintain the commitment plan signed in Chequers through the attacks of the Brexit supporters, their opponents and the EU.
The Allies insisted that they would continue to try to reach agreement with Brussels, despite the violent reaction, and would force the Eurosceptics and the Labor Party to choose between their package and the "chaos".
MEP Bone said at the Leave Means Leave concentration in Solihull that he wanted to reject the Chequers plan.
He suggested that Farage should have been given a position with responsibility in the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we would have gone out," he said.
This Member of Parliament by Wellingborough added, "I'm going to defend Brexit, but we have to get rid of Chequers."
In his statement of opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in world wars to be servants.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Bone rejected the suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their opinion and we want to remain in the European Union is completely false".
Tory pro-Brexit Andrea Jenkins was also in the concentration, where he told reporters: "I only say one thing: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The public in general does not like the Chequers plan, the opposition will not vote in favour and is not popular between our party and our activists, who are actually going out on the streets and voting first.
Forget the Chequers and start listening."
In a message addressed to May, he added: The prime ministers keep their positions when they fulfill their promises."
Farage told the concentrates that they would have to make politicians feel "heat" if they saw that they were going to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"Now this is a matter of trust between us, people, and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and today we're here to tell them that we won't let them out with theirs."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make our political class, who is about to betray Brexit, feel the heat.
"We will mobilize the popular army of this country that gave us the victory with Brexit and we will never rest until we have become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the supporters of the stay traveled the streets of Birmingham before half an hour in the city center.
Some activists were surfing Tories Against Brexit's banners after the group's presentation this weekend.
Labourer Lord Adonis took the conservatives away from the security problems they had with the party ' s implementation during the opening of the conference.
"These are the same people who tell us that they can implement the computer systems and all the technology for Canada Plus, for borders in harmony, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a total farce.
There is nothing that can be considered a good Brexit," he added.
Warren considers all the possibilities of presenting himself to the presidency
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says he will "consider all the possibilities of presenting himself to the presidency" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Democratic of Massachusetts spoke about its future during a municipal meeting held on Saturday in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, will be presented to the reelection in November against Geoff Diehl, the Republican state representative, who was co-chair of the Trump Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
Much speculation has been made on the possibility that Warren will face Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was its thirty-sixth meeting with voters using the municipal format since Trump took office.
An assistant asked him if he was planning to present himself for the presidency.
Warren replied that the time has come for "women to go to Washington to settle our irregular government, and that includes having a woman at the highest level".
Arrested by the LSU Sims player gun-gun murder
Baton Rouge (Luisiana) police announced this Saturday that a suspect has been arrested for killing Wayde Sims, the LSU's basketball player, last Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced 20-year-old Dieteon Simpson's arrest at a press conference at 11 a.m.
They had posted a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help to identify a man who is seen in the video.
Yes, at 20 years of age, he was shot near the Southern University campus in the first hour of Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound in his head that finally caused his death," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, for 247 sports.
Wayde went to defend a friend and received a shot from Simpson.
During the interrogation, Simpson admitted to having been on the scene of the crime in possession of a gun and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incidents and arrested in the police department of East Baton Rouge Parish.
Yes, an original player from Baton Rouge at 1.98 meters in height, played 32 games last season, with 10 of them holder, and had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Great Russian Prize: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after the team orders give him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the time that Valtteri Bottas was ranked in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was made clear that the orders of the Mercedes team would play an important role in the career.
From the pole, Bottas had a good start and almost threw Hamilton to the oblivion by defending his position in the first two rounds and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to enter boxes and let Hamilton run into the group's tail, something that should have been decisive.
Mercedes went out with strength a later turn and set himself behind Vettel, but Hamilton moved after an action with almost stuck wheels that made the Ferrari pilot have to give up badly the free interior at risk of resisting after a double movement to defend himself on the third curve.
Max Verstappen, who was 21 years old that day, began from the last row of the pearl and was placed in the seventh place at the end of the first turn.
He then led a large part of the race as he attached himself to his tires to achieve a quick finish and to overcome Kimi Raikkonen for the fourth position.
Finally, he entered boxes at round 44, but could not increase his pace in the eight remaining turns when Raikkonen was restored to fourth position.
It's been a hard day because Valtteri did a great job all weekend and he was a real gentleman when I let go.
The team has done an exceptional job to get a perfect couple," Hamilton said.
That has been a really bad body language
President Donald Trump laughed at Senator Diane Feinstein on a Saturday afternoon for his insistence that he did not filter Christine Blasey Ford's letter in which he accused Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault, the nomination for the Supreme Court.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention the testimony offered by Ford to the Senate Judicial Committee, but commented that what happened in the Senate showed that there are people who are "bad, disgusting and false".
"The only thing that could happen and the good that is happening these last days in the Senate is when you see anger, when you see people who are bad, disgusting and false," he said.
"When you read the publications and the filtrations, and then they say, "But if I didn't.
I didn't."
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you filter it?
Remember your answer... did you filter the document? "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't filter it."
Well, wait a minute.
No, we didn't filter it," he added as he imitated the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh on behalf of Ford in July and was filtered in early September, but Feinstein refused to have his office filtered.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't filter his story," Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to keep him confidential and therefore I did."
But his refusal did not seem to sit well with the president, who, during the middle of the Saturday night, commented: "I will tell you one thing: that was a really bad body language."
Maybe he didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing his defense against the appointment of the Supreme Court, which had been accused of misconduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain power by any means possible.
You see evil and hatred, they don't care who gets hurt, they have to come over to get power and control," the president told Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against the Dundee
The Dundee Stars repaired the defeat on Friday at the Elite League in front of the Belfast Giants when they won the game back on Saturday for 5-3 in Dundee.
The Giants achieved an initial advantage of two goals thanks to the attacks by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie got the local empath before Dwyer restored the leadership of the Giants.
Francois Bouchard equaled the Dundee before the two goals of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen assured his victory.
This was the third defeat of the season in the Elite League for the men of Adam Keefe, who had just won the Dundee for 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, of which the Giants won the previous three parties.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute (3:35) thanks to assistance from Kendall McFaul, while David Rutherford provided assistance so that Beauvillier would double the advantage four minutes later.
In what can be considered a very animated initial period, Sullivan again put the local team to play at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt attended Cownie to equal the game at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that the Giants would take advantage of the first break when he noted his second goal at night at the end of the first part.
The local team was regrouped and Bouchard once again leveled the match with a jolly in a minute 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee the leader for the first time in the party when the end of the second part arrived and secured the victory with the fifth goal of his team as the end approached.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, play at home in front of Milton Keynes in their next match on Friday.
An air traffic controller dies so that hundreds of people can escape on the plane of the earthquake
A Indonesia air traffic controller is being hailed as a hero after he died making sure that a plane that transported hundreds of people was able to safely disembark.
More than 800 people died and many disappeared after a large-scale earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
The strong replicas continue to shock the area, and many are trapped among the garbage dumps in the city of Palu.
Although his companions fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu airport control tower.
It remained firm to ensure that Batik Air's 6321 flight, which was on the track at that time, could safely disembark.
Then he jumped out of the traffic control tower when he thought he was falling apart.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirat said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, reported the Australian channel ABC News.
We had prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
"Our hearts break when we hear this," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the number of deaths may reach several thousand. The national disaster relief agency states that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is believed that the number of victims will continue to increase, as there were still many dead bodies under the ruins and could not be contacted with many people," says Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of the agency.
Waves that reached up to six meters have devastated Palu, which will celebrate a massive burial on Sunday.
Assistance and supplies are being carried on military and commercial aircraft.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance arrives with more bodies.
The water cleans scarce.
The mini-markets are being looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "The Red Cross in Indonesia is trying to help survivors as much as possible, but we don't know what they'll find there.
This is already a tragedy in itself, but it could have been much worse."
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo came to Palu on Sunday and told the country's army: "I ask everyone to work day and night to complete all the evacuation-related tasks.
Are they ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia had already been hit by earthquakes early this year in Lombok in which more than 550 people had died.
Aerial accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says that a man has disappeared after the air accident in a lagoon
The airline, which operates a flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now says that a man has disappeared, after saying that the 47 passengers and the crew had evacuated healthy and safe the plane that sank.
Air Niugini said in a statement that a male passenger could not be taken into account from Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to try to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats were used to help rescue other passengers and crew after the plane stared against the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
The authorities said on Friday that seven people had been transferred to a hospital.
The airline said that six passengers continued on Saturday at the hospital and were all in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events are still unclear.
The United States Air Company and the Army said the plane landed in the tunnel before the track.
Some Witnesses thought the plane had crossed the landing track.
US passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane got very low.
"That's something extremely good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes notes that he and other travelers managed to advance through a water that reached their waist down to the emergency exits of the plane that began to sink.
He said the flight attendants panicked and yelled, and he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Army said that the sailors who performed around a mill improvement work also helped in the rescue using an inflatable boat to transport people to the ground before the plane sank about 30 meters (100 feet) below the water.
Air Safety Network data indicate that 111 people have died in air carriers accidents registered in Papua New Guinea in the last two decades, but none with Air Niugini.
An analyst presents the chronology of the night in which a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor ended the presentation of his arguments on Saturday in the new trial of a man accused of burning alive to a woman in Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
I explained to the jury the way he used the mobile phone records to chain the movements of Quinton Tellis, the 29-year-old accused, and Jessica Chambers, the 19-year-old victim, the night she died.
Rowlett said he received the location data from several mobile phones that showed that Telllis was with Chambers on the night of his death, thus contradicting his previous statements, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone had been with Chambers during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford went up the road on Saturday and testified that he had not been in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "alloying, because my truck was in Nashville".
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he had met Chambers about two weeks before his death.
Mobile records indicated that they only met a week earlier.
Rowlett said that at some point after the death of Chambers, Tellis deleted the messages, calls and contact information from Chambers on his phone.
"The eraser of his life," said Hale.
The defence has scheduled to begin its final allegations on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to remain in the jury's hands that very day.
The High Breed: What is the conscious hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to fill your music with positive messages to challenge the negative image of the genre.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that the hip hop was separated from its origins of political messages and from addressing social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make the hip hop conscious to be popular again.
Interpreters such as The Escapes and Common have seen a recent resurrection in the United Kingdom thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
A New York girl asks a couple to fire her after a "racist" text
A New York girl is going to sue a couple for discriminatory dismissal after having received mistakenly a mother's text message complaining that she was "another black person".
The couple denies being racist and compares the demand with a case of "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Faxman, the mother of two children, expressed her confusion when she discovered that the new baby nurse, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived at her first working day in 2016.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
However, instead of sending it to her husband, he was sent to Maurice twice.
After learning about his foot measure, a "uncomfortable" Plasco-Faxman fired Maurice saying that his former African-American infant had done a bad job and that he was expecting a Filipino instead, as stated in the New York Post.
Maurice received the payment for one day's work and was sent home to Uber.
Maurice is now requesting compensation from the couple for dismissal with a view to receiving compensation of $350 per day for the position of six months of internal work for which she had been hired, although without a contract.
"I want to show you that things don't do that," he told The Post on Friday and added that "I know it's a case of discrimination."
The couple responded to claims that they were racist saying that the end of Maurice's employment was the most reasonable, as they feared that they could not trust her after they had offended her.
"My wife had sent you something I didn't mean.
She's not racist.
We're not racist," said the husband Joel Plasco to the Post.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you've been rude to, even if it was wrong?
To your newborn?
Come on!"
Comparing the demand as a "extortion", Plasco said that his wife had given birth to the baby two months earlier and that she was in a "very difficult situation".
"Are you going to go get someone like that?
That's not that it's a very decent thing," the investment banker added.
Although the legal case is still ongoing, the court of public opinion has been taken up to denounce the couple on social networks, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington editors feared that readers would not identify with a talking bear, revealing a new letter
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: "It was difficult to put in the place of someone who read it for the first time before her publication.
Thank you very much for knowing now what we know about the great success of Paddington."
After saying that his father, who had worked as a BBC camera before he was inspired by a toy to write the book for children, trusted that his work would be rejected, added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of books was something "agridulce" after his death last year.
From Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family", she added that her father was very proud of his final success.
"He was a very quiet man and he didn't like to assume," he said.
"But as Paddington had been so real to him, it was almost as if you had a son who achieved something important: you're proud of him, even though he's not really worthy of you.
I think he saw the success of Paddington that way.
Although it was his creation and product of his imagination, he always gave credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye by phone
Upon landing, his daughter was urgently transferred to Niza's Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nod called regularly to say that the situation was really bad, that it was not expected to succeed," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperous.
"Then I received Nad's call to tell me I was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And that's how I did it.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs doctors had given her to keep her heart pumping were slowly exhausted and left her system.
She had died before time and everything was turning off.
I could just sit there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn't study or cry or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I really had to stay firm."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperous, now suffering from the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane next to the other passengers, except for the terrible experience she was going through.
"No one knew," he said.
"I caught my head and tears fell all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was on the plane where I felt this overwhelming feeling of sympathy for Nad.
That needed all my love and understanding.
I knew how much I wanted her."
Women in mourning put cards to avoid suicide is a bridge
Two women who lost loved ones because of suicide are working to prevent others from leaving their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been putting cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call to ask for help.
Tyler, the son of Mrs. Davis, was 13 years old when she began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want no father to feel what I feel every day," he said.
Davis, 45 years old and living in Lydney, said his son was a promising boss with a contagious smile.
"They all knew him for his smile.
They always said that their smile lit up anywhere."
However, he left work before he died, since he was "in a really dark place".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, found him after he left life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that I might have an impact."
Davis created the cards "so that people know there are people you can come to and who you can talk to, even if he is a friend.
Don't feel silent, you have to talk about it."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner who was 15 years old, shortly after her mother's death.
"He didn't say he'd feel depressed or anything like that," he says.
"A couple of days before Christmas, we notice your change of attitude.
Christmas day came to its lowest point: when the children opened their gifts, he didn't even look at them."
He said his death was a great trauma to them, but they had to overcome it: "Leave a void throughout the family.
He's left us devastated.
But we all have to keep fighting."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs from a thread when the FBI starts the investigation
"I thought if we could really get something like what I was asking (a limited research in time, limited range), maybe we could bring some unity," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee would be "going to peak" in the midst of a partisan paralysis.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI's investigation to be carried out?
Its negativeness is entirely due to chronology.
Only five weeks are missing for the mid-term elections on 6 November. If, as expected, Republicans have bad results, their efforts to achieve the election of the man they want for the highest court in the country will be seriously weakened.
George W. Bush has been calling the senators, pressuring them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for him in the White House. Thanks to Bush, Kavanaugh met his wife Ashley, who was the president's personal secretary.
What happens once the FBI publishes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice-President Mike Pence to break the tie and confirm it for the Supreme Court.
North Korean deserters numbers "caen" with Kim
The number of North Korean deserters in South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong- one came to power seven years ago, a South Korean legislator said.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from the Ministry of Southern Unity, said that last year there were 1,127 deserts, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said that the more stringent border controls between North Korea and China, and the high rates that people's traffickers charge, have been the key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments on this.
The vast majority of North deserters are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seúl says that they have illegally crossed the border of more than 30,000 North Koreans since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most run across China, which has the longest border with North Korea and which is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China believes that the deserters are illegal immigrants instead of refugees and are often repatriated.
The relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to have discussions that focused on denuclearization negotiations.
This took place after the historic meeting in June between the President of the United States Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, who agreed in general to work on a nuclear-weapon-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress.
"Without US confidence, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under these circumstances, we will by no means be the first to disarm ourselves unilaterally," Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh " hysterical" and says he is not fit to serve in the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the minority of the House of Representatives, said that the appointment to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh was a "hysterical" and that he was not fit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival of Austin (Texas).
"I can't stop thinking that if a woman had acted that way, they would have said it was a hysterical," Pelosi said about her reaction to the testimony Kavanaugh gave on Thursday before the Senate Judicial Committee.
Kavanaugh was moved to deny the allegations that she had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both were teenagers.
During his initial statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, at times almost shouting and attracted as he spoke about his family and his years of secondary education.
In the committee, he also explicitly condemned the Democrats , qualifying the charges against them of "grotesque and clearly coordinated defamation" organized by angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential elections.
Pelosi said that, in his opinion, Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because he showed his participity against the Democrats.
"I believe that he dequalizes himself with those statements with and how he has persecuted the Clintons and the Democrats," he said.
Pelosi raised his objections when asked if he would challenge Kavanaugh in the event that he was confirmed in office and that the Democrats had obtained the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll just say one thing: if you're not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, you won't be able to be only in the Supreme Court, nor will you be in the court where you are now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the Washington D.C. Circuit Appeals Tribunal.
Pelosi added that, as a democrat, he was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible sentences against the Affordable Health Care Act or the Roe Case against Wade, as he was considered a conservative judge.
In its confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether certain decisions of the Supreme Court would be annulled.
"This is not the time for a hysterical and impartial person to go to court and wait for us to feel that everything is okay," Pelosi said.
And women have to push it.
It's a justifiable diatra, it's months and years of rage getting over, and she can't release it without crying.
"We cried when we got angry," Mrs. Steinem said 45 years later.
"I don't think that's so weird, do I?"
He continued speaking: "A woman who was executive in a company helped me a lot and who told me that she was also crying when she was angry, but who had developed a technique that when she was angry and started to cry, she said to the person she was talking to: "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
Well, no, I'm angry."
And then I went on with what I was doing.
I thought it was great."
The tears are allowed as a way out for anger in part because they are basically not well understood.
One of the clearest memories that I have of one of my first jobs, in an office dominated by men, was once I found myself crying with unexpressed anger. A larger woman, a serious manager of whom I had always had a slight fear, grabbed me by the cockpit and dragged me to a staircase.
"Don't let them ever see you cry," he said.
"They have no idea you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy because they think they've got you.
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a Democratic Congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential careers.
In 1987, when Hart was taken on an extra-marriage adventure aboard a boat called Monkey Business, which had to withdraw from the presidential career, Schroeder, deeply frustrated, it occurred to him that there was no reason not to explore the idea that she herself would present herself to the presidency.
"It wasn't a well-premeditated decision," he said 30 years later.
"There were already seven candidates in the race and the last they needed was another candidate.
Someone referred to us as Blancanieves and the seven-year-olds."
As the campaign was already very advanced, it remained behind in the fundraising process, so it was promised that it would not enter the race again unless it had raised two million dollars.
It was a lost battle.
He found that some of his supporters who gave $1,000 to men, only $250 to her.
"Do you think I have a discount?" he asked.
When he made his speech to announce that he would not have a formal campaign, he was so overcome by emotions (gratitude for the people who had supported it, frustration for a system that made it difficult to raise funds and focused on the capture of voters instead of delegates, and anger towards sexism), which he attracted.
"The logic would have been to think that he had had a nervous crisis," Schroeder said recalling the press's reaction.
"You might have thought Kleinex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they gonna put on my stone?
"Loró"?"
The trade war between the United States and China could benefit Beijing
The first survivors of the trade war between the United States and China were insurmountable, and although much remains to be done to end the war, a breakup between countries could benefit Beijing, experts say.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, issued the first warning at the beginning of the year by setting tariffs for the main Chinese exports, such as solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation took place this week with new tariffs that affect $20 billion (15 billion pounds) in products, which brings taxes on half of the products entering the United States from China.
On every occasion, Beijing has taken equivalent rebates, recently applying five to ten percent tariffs to American products worth $6 billion.
China has committed itself to equalizing the U.S. attacks, and it is unlikely that the second most powerful economy in the world will soon come to an end.
To achieve that Washington's back would mean surrendering to the demands, but submitting publicly to the United States would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Still, experts say that if Beijing played its cards well, the pressures of the United States trade war could help China in the long term by reducing interdependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can make it possible to start a fall in the economy in any of the two countries is actually much more dangerous than what viewers have recognized so far," said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher focused on issues of Asia for the Strategic Office Center for New American Security.
Syria is ready to return refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria claims it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and seeks help to rebuild a country devastated by a war that has been over seven years.
In a speech earlier to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the country ' s conditions were improving.
"The situation on the ground is now more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to try to restore normality.
All conditions for voluntary return to the country of refugees who had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that had affected their daily lives and their livelihoods were already met.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
There are another six million people who still live in the country and need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem acknowledged that the Syrian regime would appreciate the help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he also stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that promoted insurgency.
Europe is done with the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the Ryder Cup in 2018 by defeating the American team with a final score from 16,5 to 10,5 in Le Golf National, outside Paris (France).
The United States now has six consecutive defeats on European soil since it won a Ryder Cup in Europe in 1993.
Europe recovered the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had to fight during most of the tournament, threw his point of exit into the water on the 16 par 3, thus admitting his defeat before Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari pointed out in all his rounds, becoming one of the four players that have never achieved a 5-0-0 since it started the current format of the tournament in 1979.
US Jordan Spieth was defeated by 5 and 4 before the player with the lowest ranking of the European team, Danish Thorbjorn Olesen.
The number one player in the world, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 in front of the Englishman Ian Poulter, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
Spanish Sergio García, a veteran who has already taken eight Ryder Cups, became Europe with more winnings of the tournament at all times, with 25.5 points in his career.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
I am completely grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very, very happy I could have recovered the cup.
It is a achievement of the entire team and I am very glad that I have been able to help," said an excited Garcia after the victory of the European team.
Now you get your compatriot John Rahm, who already defeated the American Gulf legend Tiger Woods for 2 and 1 in an individual match on Sunday.
"I feel an incredible pride when I beat Tiger Woods, as I grew up seeing this man," said 23-year-old golfer John Rahm.
Woods lost four matches in France and now has a 13-21-3 record in his Ryder Cup career.
This is a strange statistics for one of the best players of all time, who has won 14 great titles, leaving only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had to fight all weekend to find the streets, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a high-level golf course throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk said after the disappointing performance of his team: "I'm very proud of these guys, they've never stopped fighting.
There was a moment this morning when we were warming up the situation in Europe.
But we lost him.
I want to congratulate Thomas.
He's a great captain.
Your 12 players have performed a very good game.
We will regroup, meet with the PGA of America and with our Ryder Cup Committee, and we will proceed.
I love these 12 boys a lot and I'm proud to be their captain.
Now it's up to us to bend our head.
They've overcome us."
