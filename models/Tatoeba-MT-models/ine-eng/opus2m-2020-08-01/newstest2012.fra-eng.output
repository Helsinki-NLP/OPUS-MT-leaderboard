Parliament has not ratified the amendment for the release of Tymosenko
As part of an amendment to criminal law, the Ukrainian Parliament rejected the draft annulment of the paragraph on the indictment of Julia Tymosenko, the head of the opposition.
In second reading, the Members rejected the draft amendment aimed at reducing penalties for economic crimes, which could have opened the doors of freedom for the former Prime Minister currently imprisoned.
Tymosenko was sentenced in October to 7 years in prison for having entered into an unfavourable prioritisation agreement with Russia for the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not final and the court must decide on the appeal of the convicted person in December.
Tymosenko qualified for the regime's political vengeful judgment and led to a process of partiality of the court also in the west.
The draft cancelling paragraph 365 of the criminal law, on the basis of which the former Prime Minister was sentenced, was signed by 147 Members.
There would have been 226 votes to approve.
Libya's Victory
Libyan liberation or rebellion has already won.
Muammar Kaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
It remains to determine the winners.
As is customary in the region, the winners of the elections are Islamists, but they are moderates or radicals.
The Provisional National Council has decreed the usual right of Charia and we already know what this is about.
Libya becomes a crime-free country because for a flight we cut our hand.
Women can forget emancipation, any disrespect for her faith are subject to capital punishment...
It is the Koran that will unite, instead of the dictator's personality, the society composed of opposing tribes.
In Libya there will be such an order that we cannot represent it and that we will certainly not love it.
But our way of life is not unique, is not objectively the best and would probably not be beneficial to Libyans.
It is particularly surprising that Islamic warriors have accepted help with the recognition of the unfaithful dogs.
The only excuse is that it is not an American general who led NATO strikes but rather Allah whose greatness they celebrated in each attack.
So when it comes to finding the winners in Libya, the West is not part of it.
We have participated in the shootings, served Islam, and our policies have turned away from the dictator as a political ally without any benefit.
After the recent bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not militaryly occupy Libya.
There is therefore no problem for the premises to get rid of "crossed".
Is it that oil companies will easily have access to Libya's black gold without an occupation of land?
Perhaps not as much as the West can finally boast of a disinterested protection of human rights.
Little by little, we're being prevented by these chariac fans.
A new era of crisis begins.
France and the rest of Europe are in the eyes of investors.
A tornado of statistics was passed on to Europe on Tuesday.
Each state published the relevant GDP information for 3A.
The Czech economy has stagnated this last quarter, while France and Germany are growing.
The mandatory market beats all the records.
Investors not only look at Italy, but also at Spain, France, Austria and others.
The euro area, Germany, the Czech Republic and other European countries' statistical offices published earlier their vision of economic development for the third quarter.
Germany's GDP is projected to grow by 0.5%, France's GDP by 0.4%.
The two countries changed the data for the second quarter in which Germany placed itself better than expected (a growth of 0.3 per cent instead of 0.1 per cent planned), but France reported a slight decrease of 0.1 per cent (it was the source of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 per cent during the third quarter.
But GDP has stagnated and, according to the Czech Statistics Office, it is confirmed that it is heading towards a gradual decline in economic growth.
The results are worse than the predictions of analysts.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% during the third quarter but stagnated during the last quarter.
The German economy has had a growth of 0.5 per cent in the third quarter according to the data planned and recalculated periodically.
The euro area economy and the European Union grew by 0.2% between July and September compared to the previous quarter, which corresponds to what the analysts predicted.
The Greek economy dropped by 5.2%.
Performance on obligations over ten years is 28.45%
The performance of the obligations of Spain and Italy is being pushed towards critical limits.
The problems start to feel in Austria, France, Belgium, etc.
The performance of the Czech obligations remains below 4 per cent, while the situation in the region is worsening.
There are voices in Germany saying that the ECB should be the last instance guarantee .
The Czechs qualified for the EURO.
They won at Montenegro 1:0 and celebrate the qualification for 200 million
The performance of the football has succeeded in its most difficult mission of the season!
In Montenegro, she also won thanks to Super Cech and Guardian Petr Jiracek 1:0.
The Czech football has also defended with a good deal of luck in the second part of its qualification and will not miss the European Championship.
IHNED.cz has followed the qualification match with a detailed report.
No particular excitement during the first part and a great deal of luck for the second part.
The Czech representation also won thanks to the super Czech and the hero Petr Jiracek with 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates its qualification at the European Championship.
The Montenegrins were under pressure until the second part due to a precise Czech defence.
The game's victims were Damjanovic and Vucinic who ran two chances of marking a goal.
And thanks to Super Petr Cech, the Czech representation will not be absent at the European Championship next year, and also a reward of 200 million crowns in the Czech football box.
In the first few minutes we played a warrior football.
The two teams were difficult to assemble combinations and the game focused mainly on the central line.
The pressure of the national footballers did not penetrate the Czech defence that accurately responded to the long shots even during the first half of the time.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's nuclear programme.
They created a human shield
A few hundred high school students have created a human shield around a nuclear site in Iran.
They want to support their country's nuclear programme through this gesture in the face of a possible Israeli assassination.
The students went to pray in the afternoon before the site and then wanted the death of the EU and Israel.
A few hundred students from the universities of Ispahan have created a human shield Tuesday around the nuclear technology centre of Ispahan where uranium is transformed.
They thus openly stated that they would defend their country's nuclear programme at the risk of their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has found in its latest information that Iran has not stopped strengthening its nuclear weapons.
A possible attack by Iranian nuclear facilities is reported in Israel.
The students went to pray in the afternoon before the site and then wanted the death of the EU and Israel.
In the event of an attack, whose aim would be to destroy the Iranian nuclear programme, the targets would be not only Ispahan, but also the Natanz site where uranium is enriched.
Feeding an obese child: don't take a little breakfast and take the shrimp for dinner
More than one third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 have overweight problems, 9% of the children are overweight, and 5% are obese.
As current research shows, obese children come from families who have a bad lifestyle.
This shows again the importance of the environment in which the human being evolves and the models that surround it.
On the tables of obese children, for example, there is 50% more carcutory than in normal-weight families.
19% of obese had dinner fries according to the survey carried out with a sensitization action "obesity is not a coincidence"
In the small families, sport is also not a habit, which is now the case of most schoolchildren today - only 15% replied that at least once a week parents found time for active movement.
Survey of 900 children
The survey took place during the last school year and participated in 900 pupils from primary schools in Czech Republic.
This was the second edition of "obesity is not a coincidence", supported by the General Health Insurance and Unilever.
Since the beginning, more than 12,000 students from sixth to third students have joined this project.
One of the determining factors that cause a dramatic increase in the number of overweight, even obese children is the lack of proper food and not enough physical exercise.
"Only half of the children in question indicate, for example, eating 5 times a day small breakfast - breakfast - tasting - dinner, which is the basic principle of good food," says one of the results of the survey.
No breakfast and snack at dinner
Experts draw attention to the fact that some basic details such as a small family lunch at the same time are needed for healthy development.
In Czech Republic, only 23% of the families of students eat at the same time.
In most families each takes its own breakfast alone.
And the worst thing that's been discovered is that a tenth of the population doesn't take all breakfast.
However, breakfast is the basis for a good daily diet.
The questionnaire showed that in the families of obese children, there was more consumption of malpractice.
Almost every student - without talking about weight - drinks every day of sweet drinks (70%).
More than 40% of the children in question are sports regularly but for parents it is half, only 15%.
Prepare Your Food
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to prepare their own food from opportunities offered according to their own taste and personal opinion.
"The preferences of Czech children from 12 to 15 years of age are far from the ideal for healthy food."
Among their favorite dishes there are many cakes, meats and sugars.
"The most alarming is, in particular, a great preference for sweet lemonades," the results of the investigation are indicated.
For lunch these are the pasta that took the first place just in front of the white meat.
Children did not really want feculents and the preference for fish and vegetable meals was very low.
Head of Health
The survey also showed that children are willing to change their habits from the time they receive ad hoc information.
"In the course of an inspection of a group of survey participants who had completed the questionnaire after the awareness session "Obsence is not an accident", we were told a determined will to go to healthy food," the results of the survey indicated.
The most striking was, for example, with regard to sweet lemonades because children started giving preference to drinking water.
Children have the most frequently cooked white meat and fish as the main dish on the questionnaire and would reduce the sugars and "knedliky" (Czech specialty of bread flour cakes or potatoes).
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, professionals say
In a presentation on how to learn for the stylists, I got a little angry at the fact that there was a lot of it from the beginning.
I didn't think about what was going to happen next.
The presentations of three professionals in the specialty, character clothing and a seminar on what is going on.
And it'll get worse.
We are closer to final reviews and we expect practical exercises and information.
And even when there are Saturdays and Sundays courses it's really "sucked."
This time we have with Director Allenka (in the course of which there is no boy) treated how to dress the woman who has no standard measurements.
And women of this kind are the majority.
One has a small tail, the other a boy's body, without a particular curve, another of the overweight.
The stylist must know how to visually reduce large arms, lengthen a tail or add the necessary curves.
We have thus come to highlight the character beautifully and also not to dress too much of the types of women such as Jennifer Lopez with a strong chest and pronounced hips and fine size.
For example, if there is a difference between the size and the sleeves in such a way that the skirts or pants do not go through at all, it is worth doing it in measure.
And you won't regret it because the clothes that fall are irreprehensible.
In a custom-made jacket you will feel much better than in the one that slips constantly, wraps around and doesn't hold on to the belt and so on.
For those who have a male appearance, a Tucker style dress, with woven fabrics or embroidery, may be allowed.
There are obviously many examples of different appearances and I am glad that I have all week to choose all the information I have received.
But I'm also afraid of what I have to do at home there is too much.
Each trainee receives a celebrity to dress for the day and the evening.
We must take into account the current appearance, the type of personality and its appearance.
I should "dress"Miranda Kerr, who maybe you know about Victoria's secret campaign.
At the bottom of me, it makes me happy because it's better to wear Britney Spears, Christina Agülera who has taken almost a hundred kilos in recent times (don't take my statement, svp, completely serious) or the young Selena Gomez.
We must cut and sew from magazines or search the Internet, print and work on graphics.
The Moodboard, as we say for the final result, expresses our personal style as well as our relationship with graphic creation.
Reflecting on the graphic part of styling is also important.
The stylist does not only dress the physical but also creates the productive pages in the magazines (on products given trends for handbags, coats, etc.).
Mario Kamenik, a stylist and graphicist, has kept us from all this.
But that's... until Sunday.
The stylist must have a general vision
Three special guests gave a diverse aspect at the Saturday session filled with information on the different types of characters.
Honza Pokorny, designer, Jakub Polanka fashion designer and Ben Renc, fashion photographer.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to use it.
And a talented stylist knows how to work with one dress in a different way.
The variability is for this primary example.
For example, this coat-brown that must be traditionally worn with a jeans and a t-shirt as a light coat but it can also wear the naked body, with scarves and take it in a photo as a dress.
Or it's enough to fix your sleeves or tail and have a new look immediately.
"Being with it" he stressed.
But I particularly appreciated the following advice: "For work you need to know the rules perfectly".
"You can then begin to break it," said Jakub.
Finally, I understand why we are trying to learn these rules, what to do with, what to do, why, while in fashion magazines we sometimes see something else.
No statement on fashion parades.
I know again, thanks to the fashion photographer Ben, that the stylist must have much more styles of clothing than those that are photographed.
That is, for fashion story that will have a dozen pages (so a dozen models) I have to be ready to "cut" at least one fifteen.
And also, a dress and its combination with other elements appear completely different than actually.
We must count on this during a model creation.
The fact that the image and style sometimes make half the success has been confirmed by Honza Pokorny.
It's enough to look at Madonna who's not a super singer but her image and marketing made it a world star.
In the Czech Republic, the approach to the use of stylistic services is still frugal.
And the known faces sometimes view them as useless (it's enough that I know something but what I seem to pass into second rank).
And if someone makes a styling on our part, then we have to rely on the fact that he is very likely to tell us a completely different (less) size than he actually has.
Then we just go on google and make sure that the boulevard information tells us about the celebrity in question, whether it's big or big, etc.
Honza and Mario put us on Sunday on the heart that it is not enough for the stylist to go in the fashion and know how to assemble models.
He has to communicate with the people he's wearing and so it's important to be a good psychologist.
To become people, not flattering themselves, to keep his opinion.
"When a manager asks you to choose his armor and fill him with new elements you can't throw everything away and tell him, "My God, what horror!"
"You'll find some things you'll find nice and advise him on what to carry with them," says Mario.
This one has specifically shown us what everything must contain what is called the "placovka" or the stylist's bag.
It's the one you hang around the size and you have yourself for everything you need.
In addition to things clearly defined as cissors, rollers for depilation or even food pins, there is also nylon thread (which the stylist uses to photograph products such as bags, or hats), special clips with which one closes a garment in the back, if it is too large (the pin or other type of agraph are not usable because they could strip the garment) or a sewing kit.
To be not only people who listen but who have tried something practically they taught us how to properly remove shoes.
And during the photo session in the workshop where the surface is equal, the seed could bend to the fortiori at the back.
And that's how we got together and got together.
We didn't have the right to touch the claws so as not to hurt ourselves by inadvertently.
It is therefore really necessary to have competence.
Mario made me happy when he congratulated me for my creation.
The account I'm making is not for my girlfriend.
This is just a little summary of what we learned during the second weekend of course
I'm starting to realize that making styling a profession isn't a walk in a rose garden, that everyone says what they want.
The need for speed Le Run competes across America.
Revision
At the origin of a run without problem, a whole set of stupid mistakes of people who have nothing to do with a routine morning shift to work.
It fills everyone's ambition to some extent, but it's useless if no one wants to do anything more.
The new sub-titled part The Run has produced great expectations before its exit.
He promised to take a new direction with the already old Need for Speed race series and to get out some sort of game from the playable parties that would not only deal with points.
So we were wondering how the rides would be the main hero out of his car and do what he wanted.
As already in the NFS series, the result is completely different from what was expected.
These are potentially arcade racing games but the whole pulls down due to some unnecessary mistakes that have already existed for several years.
These are not really mistakes, but rather the expression of incomprehensible pheneticism on the part of the developers.
The adventure starts very well.
You're in the adventure where Jack's main hero has character problems and to solve them is involved in illegal races across America.
You're sitting behind the steering wheel on the west coast in San Francisco and your mission is to get to New York first.
The idea has interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten steps and then into more than 50 races.
As a result, each race takes place on another route and the steps planned in different environments that are quite distinct from each other and interesting.
The player doesn't have the feeling one moment that the game offers him something identical.
Some environments are pretty pretty, even though the technical level is of the same type as the previous series.
After all, it's not the end of the world.
But driving through the desert, in autumn landscapes or in high snowy mountains is very pleasant visually.
The trials are increasingly time-consuming with an atypical element.
For example, in the desert you will find yourself in a sand storm that significantly reduces your visibility.
Then in the mountains you must be careful that an avalanche does not fall on you.
In addition, the different races are well-organized behind each other.
There is only a small number, but that is enough.
There are moments when you try to exceed the number of opponents requested (as in a classic race) then you run against the watch (classic duel with the timer) and then you are still waiting for another duel with an opponent.
From time to time you also have the police who enter the game and try to make the situation difficult for you.
Newness is the passage out of the vehicle.
Rather, it's an interactive animation when most of Jack's time runs out in front of someone and you have to help him by hitting the right button at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
What is surprising is that there are less times of this kind than you expect (to be concrete there are only three).
As a result, it is as well as this because this element is not likely to generate and places itself, in the context described above, in the elements that enhance the game.
The model of conduct is in the tradition of previous games.
Which means there's nothing extraordinary at present, but we can't say it's negative.
As for realistic simulation, you will have to go elsewhere.
But although we can find better in competition the model of conduct goes very well with the type of design of the races.
So everything's okay.
The problems begin to appear after some time.
In contrast to the driving model, the collision is not yet at the point.
We don't expect this game to be a complicated deformation and collisions, but when you don't have, in a collision with any object, the least idea of how your car behaves, it's not completely good.
During closed exceedances you sometimes touch each other slightly but otherwise your car part in crazy volleyballs.
Or you'll find yourself in the middle of nowhere.
Thanks to the restart system this is not really a problem but it really upsets you.
The restart is made so that when you break the figure or you are out in the decor the game brings you back at the last point on the route.
But you only have 5 reloads.
When you have used the 5 restarts you must restart the game from the beginning.
So it's more a tool, in case something doesn't happen as it should, than something you can really count on.
Sometimes the reloads do not help and the solution must be found by remembering the journey piece in question.
The big cock of this game is that the same actions are found in the same places.
For example, there are some turns that need to be done in a certain way if this does not happen.
Otherwise you will meet on a given location of "civil" vehicles in the same configuration as you arrive first, fifth, 5 seconds in advance or a minute in delay.
What makes you angry is the situations when you see the opponent easily passing between two cars coming in reverse direction and when you arrive, you either have to turn aside and turn them around or slow them down.
It's the same if you go in front of him because it's "calculated" in such a way that for the given situation it always comes close to your nose.
The opponents still have other advantages.
During all the time of the game, you arrive in certain places, again without worrying about time, and you always have the same opponent that precedes you in the same place.
This upsets the most at the end of the game when you roll on a long bridge in the opposite direction.
The opponent must pass before you at all costs.
When it passes before you it hides the sight of other vehicles in the opposite direction and you stumble a lot of times.
It can be understood that the purpose of this game is to do something captivating and full of adrenaline, but it is clear that you get bored quickly.
And it's bad because through a simple behavior model the game is interesting and places with so much action that you don't have time to follow everything that's going on.
And it is the same whether it is because of the concept of 50 unique routes, that the order of the races is such that there is no chance of getting bored or something else.
The original idea is to change the car during the race.
You have to be careful about the fuel pumps on the routes because you can change cars there however most of the time you have enough.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sport cars are ideal for cities, big American cylindricals for the right highways and super sports cars at exotic attors on very technical roads such as on lacquer roads in the mountains.
And the mode of challenge, which are racing in special places you know of the adventure, goes very well with the main regime of history.
You receive not only medals but also experience points that add to your profile that is common to challenges and adventure.
When you have reached the highest driver level, different objects begin to unravel:
This connects online with the Autolog function that compares your results with those of other players and provides you with other functions in the community.
One of the most difficult hits to understand is the situation of the last race of the adventure.
You arrive with your car in the subway tunnel (it looks like) where you are in the dark on the roads (it looks like).
Your speed indicator indicates you between 150 and 200 km/h (priority) and behind you comes a metro branch that sends you the car directly to the railway.
At the drafting we had a discussion for a few days whether someone really thought about when creating this game or whether the authors really take us for fools.
The technical part of the game is not extra, but the visual part is generally nice and in some cases really super.
What is obvious is that in more extreme situations, imagination does not keep the level and in some cases tragically.
This applies especially to accidents with a large number of participants when a fluid imagery is no longer useful to you.
The sound part is good and the track is optional.
In order to please the greatest number and especially the young audience, a new soundtrack has been created in the style "I mix everything", but one can expect that no one will buy the game for music.
General impression of Need for Speed: The Run is therefore really confused.
If the game didn't have these stupid mistakes we could say without fear that this is the best production of NFS in recent years.
But this game gives the impression that it's not over.
The fun is really good, but prepare for the mistakes you see in your eyes with the strength of an aerodrome reflector.
Students of speed in concert with the heart of Charles University
The festival Festa Academy offers for the third time the festival that links the International Study Day with the anniversary of the Velours Revolution with a musical part.

Vicenova, Ambassador to the European Union:
Czechs behave like negatives and Eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has radically abolished the balance between institutions"
"I didn't expect a war so hard."
"It will take 5.6 years before the situation calms down and all players get used to their new role," said Miléna Vicenova, who started his presentation at the Faculty of Law of the Czech Embassy near the European Union.
When she managed to describe the different bodies of the EU and their relations in such an understandable and visible way that a large number of speakers from the Faculty of Law at the University of Charles might have the desire, she showed how much she took her motto "understanding and open about Europe" very seriously.
Mrs Vicenova paid tribute to the work of Herman Van Rompuye, the new permanent President of the European Council.
"From the beginning the criticisms that he is tired, that it is a round-trip, that he cannot fulfill any mission, and I have to say that he has cut the blow to everyone because he has his role in perfection."
"It is a man who can listen to 27 member states, communicate well with them and has a clear vision of the direction to take from Europe."
She explained the new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Defence Policy in a response to the question: "Who is in the European Union?" "To what number should I call?", so as an important step towards the unity and greater flexibility of the Union's state policy, such as China or India.
No one wants to forbid us our syrecky (sweet pasta cheese that feels very strong)
Mrs Vicenova also mentioned the agenda she has lived, lived and will live in close proximity to the European Council.
She qualified the Czech Presidency two years ago.
The Czechs have resolved the financial crisis, the gas crisis, or have organized a Summit for an Eastern Partnership.
It qualified for the fall of very negative governance and damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is now very busy.
According to Mrs. the Ambassador, "activities have fought their full" not only for the Presidency but also for the financial crisis that continues to resolve now.
In addition, the new seven-year budget of the Union must be approved, which is becoming very complicated because of the current economic situation.
As it would appear that the budget will be thin and cost-effective, which sector will be the priority, which countries will be the most assisted, at least everything will be resolved in future negotiations.
The Ambassador recalled her slogans with which she arrived in Brussels "For a Europe that is understandable".
"I really don't like abbreviations, foreign words, jargons that no one understands.
As the citizen must understand that it is true that nobody in Brussels makes round or round cornices, bananas are different or that no one has forbidden us to make syrecky."
It wants to make better use of the EU environment and see more Czechs in the European institutions.
A Europe at multiple speeds awaits us
According to the Embassy, the Czechs have the reputation of being Eurosceptics and people who see things only in their negative aspect more than positively.
It is also sorry to see such a small Czech representation in the European institutions.
The fault, according to it, results from several factors, such as the shyness of our candidates, their inability to write a letter of motivation and low support from the Czech side.
In addition to a successful Czech presidency, it then stressed the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me, when the Polish, the Magyar, the Slovak, this French says to me, 'Hey, what are you doing there, what is still doing this Visegrad group?' and it's not quite content.
According to Mrs Vicenova, in the near future, these are tough new rules for budgetary policy that await Member States.
It is the concept of a Europe at two speeds, if it is not at several speeds, which, instead, provides for a "new European Federation".
"We have countries in the euro area and others outside the zone."
"We have the Schengen area, we also have the Institute for Enhanced Cooperation."
First of all, he said that they cooperated with each other, and those who did not want it did not remain in their midst."
"There will be a lot of such institutes and there will be a real Europe at two speeds," Mrs. Vicenova expects.
From this point of view, it also appreciated the Czech Republic's mission and Herman Van Rompuye to determine the basis on which all issues with an impact on the EU should be discussed between all EU members and not just the members of the euro area.
History of a brand:
The IBM Innovator begins the second century of its existence
If someone was to look for the vocabulary that expresses as close as possible to the IBM strategy, the closest would be "the long term".
For a large audience IBM is the symbol of the technological revolution, it is a firm feeling as very current and yet it has been over a hundred years since its creation.
The basis of this long-term strategy was launched by the first head of the firm, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He has left this slogan that a large number of global problems can be solved as soon as people are willing to think.
His slogan "PENSE" has become the print around which the life of a future giant will develop (and also the title of the internal magazine that IBM began publishing in 1935).
This was the basis of the company's culture carefully developed by Watson.
For us IBM means a long-term thought of continuous movements towards the future.
IBM survived for a hundred years because she remained faithful to its basic values and yet was not afraid to change everyone else around her.
This has enabled us to transform technology, business and society during our first century.
We hope that in the second century we will see even more"for the anniversary the current director of the company Samuel J. Palmisano.
A well-prepared system
Watson, in the 1930s, took care of his employees as Bata in the Czech Republic - the people of IBM were the only among the first American employees to have paid holidays, an insurance paid by the employer more an elegant employee uniform and a well-developed system of rewards for inventors and traders.
In the same way IBM has a well-developed relationship system.
The company was at the beginning of the discovery of talents – as one of the first firms to have abolished all forms of discrimination and could thus have the choice.
The current plan is fully in the spirit of the anti-discrimination strategy as it will be a woman - Virginia Rometty - who should replace Palmisano with the head of IBM.
It has been working with IBM for thirty years and currently holds the position of Chief of Sales, Marketing and the Strategy.
In recent years IBM has done what is called jamy, brainstorming online from what has resulted in many future strategies and innovations.
It is not surprising that there are many ideas - in the firm there are almost 500,000 people working.
An institution with a good name
It is the internal and external image of the company that assures it of a safe position in the area of business.
"From the beginning IBM had a concept of institution rather than a technological firm," said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, Economie Professor at Harvard Economic School and author of the book on IBM.
"IBM is not a technological firm but a firm that helps solve business world problems using its technology," said Geogre Colony of Consulting Forrester Research.
As the firm itself says, there is a difference between entering the market and creating this market.
IBM - or the Great Blue, as it is commonly called the United States because of its slogan - has grown to one of the largest companies in the world.
This is, of course, the most versatile technology firm - it develops software, hardware, infrastructure, accommodation, and services of the Council at the level of the server's products to nanotechnology.
She has many patents from all American technology firms and five of her employees have received a Nobel Prize.
Among its discoveries are the ticket distributor, payment card, financial swap, bar code or floppy disk.
IBM came back this year with $220 billion, the second largest technology firm, according to market capitalization (the first is Apple), when it first exceeded Microsoft in 1996.

These are not all the innovations and manufacturings that have had the preference of the client and the time - IBM for example failed the bet on an own OS/2 operating system, the Prodige online service or either the IBM PCjr computer:
"From the moment your business is built on the forward movement you cannot emotionally stay stuck to the past," said Samuel J. Palmisano.
For this reason IBM has no problem building its bases on many platforms and when they don't work it goes away.
Unlike Microsoft, for example, which is based on the Windows operating system, it remains under the Windows operating system.
A Perspective Technology
In IBM incomes, services, which are trained for a fifth by software and hardware, have a dominant place.
However, in 1990 it was with more than the strongest representative of hardware participation.
From the year 2000 IBM sold low-income assets for $15 billion, during this period it invested $58 billion in the purchase of prospective technologies.
It continues to invest, even from 2008, when it for the first time exceeded the new financial crisis.
IBM negotiates according to the precepts of its first chief Thomas J. Watson, who also increased its investment volume during the great economic crisis.
Did it now appear that IBM is going through the current crisis without worrying?
The IBM action price was projected from 2008 to 120 per cent, the net profit of the company continues to grow.
The logo of the company IBM is to change everything but not its values.
We can expect this flexible giant to control other crises.
IBM History: From cheese slices to flights in the cosmos.
IBM (International Business Machines) was born in New York a hundred years ago; it initially had the complex name of Computing Tabulation Recording Corporation.
She took the name IBM in 1924 - initially a brand used by a subsidiary of a company in Canada and South America.
The basis of the future IBM was the merger of four companies whose history is linked to the 1980s of the ninth century.
They had technologies such as the old "points", the pendulums that recorded the arrival and departure of the employees.
The architect of the new company was Charles Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 presided over the Society's Supervisory Board.
Flint hired the head of a competing firm Thomas J. Watson to help him run the company.
The leader then made shadow to the founder of the company - it is on Watson's ideas that so far rest on the identity and culture of society.
Watson led the firm in 1952.
IBM, as its name says, begins with the production of all possible machines for business and trade - cheese and meat cans up to registered boxes.
During the first four years of Watson's leadership, the number of business increased to $9 million and began to expand throughout the world.
Watson was for the firm so irreplaceable that after 40 years of leadership, he was his son who took charge of the manager's chair, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his direction IBM began the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, people and IBM computers helped NASA to guide flights to the cosmos - on Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the flight to the Moon.
Between time in 1964 IBM developed the first family of computers - the IBM System/360.
The classic PC that determined the computer standard of the time with the name IBM 5150 arrived on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later IBM sold its computer factory to the Chinese company Lenovo, but bought Consulting Pricewaterhouse Coopers and started to take care of advice and services with a high value added.
The strategy that has succeeded in IBM over the last three years - is the concept of Smarter Planet "a smarter planet".
Its aim is the intelligent use of technology in areas not yet exploited, such as the transport and management of cities.
With regard to the area of trade IBM has recently developed a "Smarter Commerce" platform that helps traders manage the entire business cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in our territory.
It was then established in Czechoslovakia in 1932 by the first countries of Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, in addition to IBM RT, there is also the Brno Outsourcing Strategic Centre.
The Centre for Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague and there is also the global research and development team that is responsible for the recognition of the word.
Righttanova about her unfaithful husband:
If you can keep this ass, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Richtarova (53 years old) said, it's over!
After her husband Joseph Richtar (53 years old) became a bodyguard and loved by Iveta Bartosova (45 years old), Darina still hoped that Joseph would wake up from his pink dream and return home.
Only she could not wait and established clear rules for future life.
"Pepa can come home, but not as my partner" explained Richtarova.
When Darina Richtarova gave asylum in summer in Bartosova's home, she did not doubt that her husband would not hold.
When Iveta insisted after 30 days on moving from Ricany, Pepa did not reject the singer.
And he told the public that he loved her.
With the time Darina resigned, she accepted her husband's relationship and ended by saying goodbye forever.
Rychtirova is not interested in knowing who her husband is sleeping with.
If Rychtar and Bartosova separate, there will be no wife to welcome her at the door of the house.
"It's my son's biological father and if he wants to end his life in our common house, no one's gonna put him out."
"He will no longer be my beloved and lost old ass, but a man with whom I have a special relationship," he left filter Richtarova showing that she has retired from her husband but that they only remain in a decent relationship.
The fact that Darina closed her door is not a problem for Joseph.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'll stay with Iveta and I won't change."
"My wife set up a marriage on paper and I respect it."
"The company continues, I take care of repairs, garden, real estate, I buy."
"With Darina we are discussed in a completely normal way, but we are not sleeping together," said Rychtar for Blesk.
If Rychtarova finds a new love, he won't stop it.
"We don't sleep together and he doesn't want me to know where she's going, with whom and if she has a relationship.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take full responsibility for myself," Joseph concluded.
The worst vices of women: Does this apply to you too?
If you ask men to determine typical vices of women, all, like each other, are able to "get out of their manhood".
My dear ladies, you will meet in the following lines of women's vices that can pump the blood of men's veins.
Purchases
Does your half make you notice that you are dependent on purchases?
Do you have to buy at least one dress a week?
Are you happy to buy packages at the time of the money?
In your case, we can talk about buying as a vice.
Some women believe that they should limit their passion for making purchases.
But will you say, which would resist the velvet lacquer of clothing stores, to search for yourself beautiful clothes and then try them all in a cabin (the ideal of different colors)?
And although for most women to buy is a hobby, it can become a real hell for man.
Just remember how many times you told your spouse that he was waiting for the entrance...
Dissatisfaction constant
"I'm not too big"?
"I'd need to chew at least 5 kilos - should I start doing sports?"
"Do you like it?"
Don't these phrases remind you of something?
Yeah?
You are therefore part of those women who are obsessed with their appearance.
It is not the question that you should stop taking care of yourself, but a large number of men are allergic because their partner is still complaining about his appearance.
Strong sex does not hesitate to say that the frequency of these complaints is increasing and that women are becoming poisoned.
Odour and cleanliness in the first place
It's like an end-of-life handle.
Wash the windows, wash the vacuum cleaner, clean the floor, dust, clean the bathroom - and that's twice a week.
Do you make notes to your partner that he walks with salt feet on his own ground, to the children that they have taken out the washbasin, engraved the glass of the living room, and what does that give you much work?
If you are suffering from this obsession, try to bear in mind that nothing should be exaggerated and that order and cleanliness should not be the first place in the family.
However, this harmless desire for cleanliness can damage your relationships and even family peace.
Soap work
"Put this overcoat on the trash."
"Are you gonna wear these old shoes again tomorrow?"
"A wet maid has nothing to do on the ground."
If you do this know-how work on your partner several times a day, you are really going to decompose it.
It's obvious that you don't think badly you want everything to be impeccable.
Maybe if men knew, women wouldn't have to do so much soap work...
The defamation, the periphery
The defamation, persiflation, but also the insults against someone are also the property of certain women.
Women are particularly involved in relations and are therefore happy to deal with issues such as where, with whom, how and why.
Maybe each of us can escape a small harmless persiflage here and there.
The hand on the heart, however, is a particular feature of women.
But the worst are those who advise, perceive, even despise others and are for their surroundings - especially at work in a group of women - especially dangerous.
Jagr and Voracek helped by their participation in the victory of Philadelphia
The hockeyist Jagr has twice participated in the victory of Philadelphia during the NHL Monday game on Caroline's ice and is again in the head of productive Czech players for the competition.
From the point of view of 39-year-old Claude Giroux, who has still made an extra pass and has been named the best player in the match, he has marked in both cases.
Jakub Voracek, who plays with Jagr also recorded two goals during the match.
Jagr after the match will declare to the extra-Atlantic journalists that he had prevented Giroux that it would be a big night.
"I told him before the match he'd give his hat-trick."
"I heard it."
"Sometimes this feeling falls on you" explained Jagr after his action Giroux marked a goal of the first shot of the Flyers.
A moment later, there was a second attack on the Czech team.
Voracek fought behind the Hurricanes for the palette and presented it to the Maxime Talbot butter.
A second before the first break, local player Patrick Dwyer made a descent, but the beginning of the second part belongs to the Flyers.
Concretely in Giroux.
In cooperation with Jagr he marks three goals, then Wayne Simmonds transforms a fourth goal.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't mean that he's the best player in the league, but he's really one of the three best," Jagr said about his center.
"I never thought I'd end up playing with a hockey player like him."
"I'm really happy about that."
"I want to play him."
"All these years in the NHL the other team players have tried to play on me, now it's my turn," Jagr added.
Caroline made a drama of this game because with a goal of Tuom Ruutu and again of Dwyer on a penalty shot she ends with a different goal.
Matt Read didn't get away with any other complications that ended up two against one.
"Pronger has carried out excellent attacks in our area."
"He wrote on the palette, I took the speed and (Read) left towards the most distant corner of the cage.
"I tried to hit him and I got there," describes the ultimate goal of the match from his point of view.
Philadelphia arrived with this victory in the head of the Conference of the East.
The Czech defender of Montreal Jaroslav Spacek did not finish the match with Buffalo he left in a second third due to an injury in the upper part of the body.
The Candians did not face an experienced defender whose advance of two shots lost after a penalty shot by 2:3.
Tomas Plekanec did not transform any of their attacks.
That's because the back line was sick, which mainly got the local coach rather than lost points because they only played the game with 5 defenders.
"It's zero."
"We only played the game with an experienced player, the rest were young."
"But there's nothing to do, that's how it is," says Jacques Martin.
"Replacement on replacement has not been enough and we have not been able to resist."
"We just had to simplify the game, push the palette out of our area."
For this we had limits," added one of the defenders P. K. Subban.
Ondrej Pavelec, Czech defender took part in the third attack of Winnipeg and the victory over Tampou Bay.
5 different shooters participated in uax goals of the Jets, which stopped a series of 5 lost matches.
How travel prices have changed since 1989
Until 1989 there were only 5 travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: Cedok, Sporturist, CKM, Recrea and Autotourist.
Travel agencies at that time offered travel mainly in the countries of the socialist bloc, because travel to the west was very limited.
Czech tourists traveled for holidays in East Germany, the Soviet Union (Sotchi, Crimea and the Black Sea), Bulgaria, Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A great exception for the period 1962 to 1972 when it was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia and then the regime began to have a tendency for the west and travel to Yugoslavia was very limited for Czech tourists.
The great paradox of the socialist era was that it was not allowed for citizens of the socialist bloc (also for Czechoslovakians) to travel individually even within the socialist countries.
In case the Czechoslovak citizen wanted to travel individually, for example in Poland or in the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter if the individual travel was not allowed.
Travel agencies at this time also offered travel to the West, however, it was necessary to make the queue all night with a sleeping bag or have a "good knowledge" within the travel agency.
And even after that, it wasn't earned yet.
The agreement for the currencies that were the condition to travel west was refused to people who were "politically wrong" who could not travel at all.
However, the Czechoslovak currency was not interchangeable and it was not possible to obtain financial means without the currency agreement (Western currency) to travel west.
The Czechs spent most of their vacations in the country where there were a lot of farm houses and chalets that the Czechs purchased and that habit is still hard.
The Czech travels have been a major revolution since 1989.
Although up until 1989 holidays in East Germany and Bulgaria were at the maximum, the Czechs spent 4 million days abroad in countries around the world last year.
The great paradox that we do not know today is that the most popular country is Croatia, where it was not possible to go freely until 1989 because part of Yugoslavia of that time.
The removal of visas in the 1990s in the neighbouring countries of the West caused a huge wave of short-term visits especially in Austria in Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks could not travel by plane to the west for a long time, which everyone wanted to see for at least one moment.
For example, travel organizations in Paris made the Czechs sleep in tents in the parks because our income did not allow us to pay for the hotel or a pension.
The typical course of a Czech trip was at this time to bring with it its own preserved food, sauce, etc.... to save.
Another important moment has also been the interchangeability of the Czech crown that has finally allowed our tourists after decades of free purchasing power from the Western currency.
Our standard of living, as well as the average wage, have increased what has led to another important moment around 1997.
As a result of a growing demand for travel, travel agencies have since 1997 started to prepare tours with air charter connections that have greatly reduced costs compared to what was before.
At the end of the 1990s, the Czechs had visa-free connections with virtually most of the developed countries around the world other than the EU, which later facilitated our travels.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolution tourism, when the first air charter was prepared for an exotic country, Thailand, from the Czech Republic.
Since this year, as every year of direct air charters, Czech tourists have taken to distant warm countries; this winter there will be 12 exotic destinations from the Czech Republic.
More than 100000 Czechs visit exotic countries every year!
Another interesting moment in this period that symbolizes our post-revolution development came in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the EU removed visas for Czech tourists and allowed our country to participate fully in the group of developed countries.
In 2008 the Czechs also spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%) for the first time in history more than 15,000 crowns per person for holidays abroad, including attachments. Crowns per person.
The General Assembly must find its President, but this may end with an unsolved "a pat"
Nearly 5 months already, Czech football is without a President, and it is likely that Ivan Hasek's successor to the head of the Czech Republic's Football Association will not yet be known after a General Assembly to be held in Nymburg on Thursday.
However, there is still no agreement on which voting arrangements should be made.
Without this agreement it is not possible to start voting for one of the three candidates.
Jindrich Rijkl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomas Palik are interested in the direction of the Czech football.
Hasek resigned in June and in the course of his departure he called on his colleagues to join and find a strong personality that will lead football in the future.
Only during the summer after Hasek did football come back to differences between the Association's rooms that cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was fully demonstrated on 16 September when a new president was to be elected.
The delegates of the General Assembly met in vain at the National House in Prague, as the negotiations remained blocked and it was not even a matter of dealing with the way to elect.
There was no agreement on who had the right to vote in the General Assembly - only, as it were, the statutory representatives or also the invested officials of full authority.
In this single point, there has been a partial agreement since then with the assistance of the Office for State and Law, according to which representation on the basis of full power is not possible.
Differences continue with regard to the electoral regulation.
It is too clear that the Executive Committee, which in its planned or extraordinary negotiations has not contributed to the situation
Opinions on the possibility of voting have changed several times, but the neurologic point remains the same.
The question is: how to proceed for the third round so as not to fall into bed.
"The apple of the dispute is based on either the status or another model," said one of the three vice-presidents of the Association of the Czech Football Republic Dusan Svoboda, who represents professional football within the association.
According to the rules of the proposed model, the third round will be the one of the candidates who will have received the highest percentage vote within the chamber for which he is a candidate.
Moravia is ready according to what has been said to withdraw to win the candidate who will have received the largest percentage of the votes of the two rooms.
And the Czech party is studying the condition that the winner should have at least two thirds of the vote.
"Only then would this cause the idea of two previous rounds to be lost and would completely deny the bicameral concept," Svoboda admits, who understands the objections of the Moravian party and says that it would be best not to change the regulation and vote in accordance with the existing statutes.
It is surprising that Tomas Palik also agrees, even if he considers that the electoral regulation is based on Pelta's most favourable status among all candidates.
"I wish we could vote to the maximum in accordance with the statutes of the Association."
"Because there is not yet any idea of salty ideas imagined by a representative as in the previous General Assemblys," said the owner of Victoria Plzen, who is a candidate for the first time and who in his presentations was particularly defined against Pelta.
She's still optimistic.
According to him, there will be a new President in Nymburg and he believes that candidates will cooperate in the future together and constructively.
"The possible qualification today at the European Championship should calm everyone down."
"The football will be back on a happy wave and there will be more training for cooperation" adds the Jablonec officer, who among the three has the greatest experience in driving both professional and regional football.
Rachel is more pessimistic.
"I believe in this agreement but unfortunately the situation is very tense."
"This is not a problem between the Czechs and the Moravians, but there are tendencies to want to change drawing regulations."
"This can cause another blockade at the General Assembly."
"I hope as much as the healthy reason will win," said Rajchl.
There is not much time left for a common agreement between all parties.
Some meetings should take place directly in Montenegro, but which can say whether the entire football board will be complete for the match.
The flight in which the Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl were to travel to Podgorica, did not take off for technical reasons, and sought an alternative to take part of the executive committee on the field of reprisals.
Finally, it is the ministerial meeting, which could take place on Wednesday, which should be decisive.
The Minister of Youth and Sports Education Joseph Dobes would be very happy to receive the parties that are part of the country's strongest sports association and bring them to an agreement.
In the game there are many: a state-owned staffing, the credibility of football and also the General Assembly of the Czech Union of Sports, which must determine the direction of Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
Palik is fighting for the President's position because he sees no right candidate.
If the head of footballers at Plzen Tomas Palik had seen before the General Assembly whose profile had responded to his request for a new president of the Association of Football of the Czech Republic (AFRT) he would not have been campaigned for this high-ranking function.
"If such a candidate exists, I support him, I fight for him and I do not present myself to the election."
"But in the current situation it was not possible to find such a candidate," Palik told the Czech Press Agency (CTK).
Palik's motivation is to compete with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rajchl to just try to prevent Pelta from accessing the head of the AFRT that would be given priority for this election.
Palik also points out that if he won the election, he would hold this position as President only until 2013 planned for a General Assembly.
He would well see in the function an experienced and high-level manager but who is not connected to the world of football.
"I've discussed with people who would have the profile," he said.
"For me this was terrible when some told me they didn't want to be identified with Czech football right now."
"I'd like to change this image," he added.
What is said, particularly Palik, is the relationship between Pelta and the President of the Regional Union of Plzen Roman Berbr ' s football, a man who is known as a lobbyist who can influence the vote of delegates of the General Assembly.
For Palkik it is not acceptable for Pelta to take over this position of President.
"If he won, the current state would remain and there would be nothing new in football."
"And with Berbr's support, which is a high-flight dealer, it would be even less favourable to football," Palik proclaimed.
What is more shocking is the fact that Pelta's name was pronounced a few years ago in an investigation into a corruption case, for which Pelta went out without a penalty.
"I don't know what prestige Pelta would bring to football."
"And how would we be considered in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA?"Palik said, who said some time ago, "If Pelta becomes President, I sell Plzen's club."
In the event that Palik won the vote on Thursday, he should prove that he could cooperate with Felta.
Rijkl, another candidate who had been supported by Paklik before the General Assembly in September who had completed a failure, thinks the same.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I'd go with."
"He's got great abilities."
"He would be able to present himself, for example, as head of representation."
"But as the Association Manager, he wouldn't be able to."
"I don't put my nose in what I don't know," said Paclik, who in September drew great attention when he spoke of the cancellation of the Arbitral Commission with Ludek Macela who replaced Dagmar Damkova.
Palik says he would be at the level to run the Association.
He takes as an example his ability to lead private firms and he has also been leading the Plzen club since last year, which has celebrated his victory in the first division with his support last May.
"I have the strength to change something in the sports world and to bring some culture into it."
"I would stop the influence of some interested groups who, for example, tend to influence the Disciplinary and Appeal Commission, which leads to bad tastes," Palik added, who did not check his antipathy for Spartan chief Daniel Kretinsky.
It would also consider harmonizing relations with the Czech Olympic Committee whose lobbying power with high-level policies would generate more money for sport tax on games.
"This is one of the key points the new President should address."
"When it comes to gambling tax as stated by the political parties, I understand their arguments, but they should also say where the money goes," he said.
Palik does not take his current relationship with the Plzen club as something negative even if he himself claims that the President of the AFRT should be "above the parties".
Pelta is again connected with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla de Prague.
"That's not the ideal."
I don't see any reason to transfer my shares from Plzen's club to someone if I have to come back a year and a half later," Palik said.
Pelta has promised new statutes for the AFRT that should put an end to the Pat situation.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of the candidates to the presidency of Miroslav Pelta promised that if he was elected, AFRT would have new statutes that should put an end to the electoral regulations in the future.
The Jablonec official is before the Thursday meeting in Nymburg very optimistic and thinks today the success of the football performance should calm this war before the vote.
Pelta, before the September election that has not been held, has just promised to dedicate herself to national representation and to obtaining financial means if elected.
He decided to become a candidate at the last moment just before the last General Assembly and this two-month delay could well enable him to defend his vision of the football leadership and present it in a broad context.
"People at all levels do football for a long time and expect Thursday to have a President."
"They feel that this is the best time for someone to take the leadership of the Association," he adds, but he is primarily linked to the Jablonec club, has worked for many years in Sparta and the Union Executive Committee.
This is also why he has enough experience to run the Czech football.
It is convinced that behind the current problems with the election there is a euphoria that ruled at the time of Ivan Hasek.
"Unfortunately at the June General Assembly of Statutes were approved which were not perfect as they were all seen."
"If there were not all these different interpretations, we would have already had a President since September," says Pelta.
It was precisely the revision of the most important document of the civic association that took full attention from delegates.
"If I become President, I take it as a personal mission and I am ready to take on all the responsibilities if that doesn't work."
"It's a principle without which we can't exist," Pelta added.
Then he tries, we say, not to confront his opponents.
He stated earlier that he could cooperate with Jindrich Rajchl that he recognized his legal training and that he knew that his opponent-candidate would be his first Vice-President.
He has not attacked Tonas Palik for a long time, which, on the contrary, does not stop criticizing Pelta.
"He's been changing in football for a year and has already had some success."
"His attacks, however, were not more honorable and surprised many people during the campaign."
"That is also why some have doubts about his character now," said Pelta at the address of his opponent, but he remains faithful to the proclamations he made in September.
His strongest weapon is his knowledge of football from the lowest-level competitions to national representation.
It's supposed to be a football vitreous.
"And I would also try to finish all the cases that start with the Bohemians or the result of the corruption scandal."
"I would immediately enter into negotiations with the public and private sector so that we can get enough money for all football," the Czech Press Agency TCK said the 46th candidate two months ago.
He also added that his appointment to the head of football would lead to no change in people.
"I should get to know all the employees," he said in Strahov where there is a sense of nervousness since there is no direction.
Although there are catastrophic scenarios planned with the General Assembly, he believes that delegates will not go to Nymburk for anything.
"If there is only one point of disagreement on how to vote in the third round, we will be able to overcome it."
"Football needs credibility and it will only get it when there's a new leader in its head," as Pelta said optimistically two days before the probably decisive day for his career as a civil servant.
Rajchl promises that under his direction the AFRT will start working hard
"If the current Vice-President Jindrich Rijkl was elected new President of the Association of Football of the Czech Republic to the General Assembly on Thursday, this would not please a large number of people, it seems.
However, Rijkl promises that if he is elected, he will start working hard.
He wants systematic changes and makes members of the Executive Committee responsible for the various areas of football.
He also promised to settle the Bohemian case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, contribute more money to football and continue the work started by former Ivan Hasek.
"As President, I want to take care of football in its entirety."
"International contacts with UEFA and FIFA through national representation, professional football and a performance football for youth."
"But I'm not saying that I'm gonna do this all alone," said Rijkl in an interview for CTC.
"I am a team player and I want to distribute the skills within the Executive Committee so that each member takes care of a specific area."
"And I'm going to distribute difficult missions so football can take a big step forward."
"Many people will not be happy because it will start working hard rather than criticizing others" he added.
He said that he would not represent himself as a candidate because of a critical atmosphere.
"About me, we know I work 20 hours a day."
"but I need to know if this is worth the shot and if I have people behind me who will put me in the wheels constantly and issue doubts about each of my actions," explaining why he hesitated.
"Many people have said to me anyway that I must not give up because they would give up too."
"This trust I can't betray," he said.
What motivates him, we say, is also to continue the work started with Hasek.
"Since the last two years, there's been a lot of work and I don't want to let it fall."
"There are processes that have been launched that will have consequences in a few years and I would not like anyone to stop them." he said with fear that in the case of the election of Miroslav Pelta the situation within the Union will not return as it was before Hasek.
"I believe in systematic work and this is something Mirek Pelta can't do."
"After him are people who would make football in such a way that it would only be for those who were chosen."
"You can blame me for a number of things, but you certainly can't bear someone."
"I'm trying to be a target."
"I want to do football for everyone because everyone will be happy not only those who have been chosen
And he reaffirms that he would only be a President for the Czech Republic.
"And if anyone says otherwise, I'm willing to do the best I can for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider that the second division will be divided into two parts by one Czech and the other Moravia whose winners will be in the first division."
"There would be no situation like at present with only three Moravian teams in the division because the problem is now to find young players.
As Tomas Paklik, president of the Plzen Club, entered the competition for the position of President, Rachel cannot assess her own chances of winning.
"I constantly feel the support of the Czech House who has elected me as Vice-President and knows that there will be success with me," said Rajchl, who is considering among his future success saving tens of millions of crowns on unfavourable contracts, negotiation of contracts with televisions and the game law.
On the contrary, the fact that the Association is not united is a common mistake for all.
While he says about Pelta "that he is disqualified because with him the Czech football would lose credibility", he thinks that the second opponent Palik is a strong candidate who has what to offer in football.
"No one can doubt Plzen that he did a wonderful job this year."
"If he had been elected, he would certainly continue in what Hasek started and would not make significant changes among the people in the Commissions."
"He wouldn't want to ruin his success," said Rajchl, who evaluated his rivals.
The most beautiful pools in Europe
A leap in the blue
De Julia Stanek
Ovni optical bats, magnificent Budapest swimming pools: Who travels across Europe can live his blue miracle - and after turning the city or taking a long walk - can allow his tired legs to rest in gas-water baths.
A book shows in which swimming pool you can experience the best of well-being.
When Iris Meder went on a search trip for the last 18 months, there was an object that should not be missing in his luggage: his bath bag.
Stretched over her back in the water, she observed the artisticly arranged dome, swimming against the Putten marbles waiting for her on the other side of the pool and not missing to admire the Art New methically restored from these converted pools.
If a covered pool pleased him, she noticed in her book all the details of interest on the type of construction and the history of the building without delay.
More than 200 swimming pools were investigated in this way by the Meder architecture historian and she presented them in her already published book: "Badefreuden (Joies du Bain". The municipal covered swimming pools in Munich, the historic bath palaces in the black forest, "Hardcore concrete buildings" in the Taunus.
In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia respectively.
The 46-year-old German is a true fervor of the culture of the bath.
Meder explains that she has little interest in sports but she feels attracted to water in a completely different way.
It's annoying that swimmers should just watch blue squares and take care of Javel's water pressure while the joggers breathe from the scent of spice forests or can listen to the gasuling of joyful birds in the park.
"I was wondering one day why the pools should always be so late," said vinnoise.
"So I started a collection of beautiful baths."
The water surface doubles the architecture
A dive in a swimming pool and volatile sauna oils - a factor of well-being in the swimming rooms are huge because all senses are awakened, according to Meder.
And if the builders had given themselves a little more time, the swimming rooms could be a real delight for the eyes: "In the swimming rooms there is a water surface instead of a floor."
"It is on the one hand transparent, but it reflects on the other hand the beauty of the whole building."
All surfaces are optically presented in a double way: high-voices, multi-coloured squares, tremlins.
The small-format image volume "Badefreuden" makes a report of worth 190 pages on the history of architecture and culture on the oasis of historical well-being - he certainly wants to make a leap in the blue.
Collector Meder discovered remarkable examples during his research in Hungary.
Alongside the beautiful well-being baths such as the 100-year-old Szechenyi bath in Budapest, she found water containing nitrate in a natural cave in the karst (a cave bath in Miscolc-Tapolca) as well as a bath of thermals whose pools are filled with water containing alcali and (Városi Termålfürdö in Jászberény) and located in a bottle-shaped building.
On the other hand, the heated pools of Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views. While from a roof of the Zürich bath we have the whole city in his eyes, we can admire the Arlberg surrounded by an outdoor pool of St. Anton: The Turkish bath is equipped with a window from which you can observe the animation on the ski track.
Perhaps the most extraordinary swimming pool design awaits swimmers in Langenfeld: The Aqua Dome Ötztal resembles an OVNI that has just landed on the Alps.
In winter, the steam rises from the three open plates, while in the background the mountains of the Ötztal rise to the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
The smell of Javel water does not emanate from all the pools in the Meder collection.
Many thermal baths emanate from the Arpád-spa in the Hungarian Bekescsaba, a strong smell of oil, which is hard to believe, is found in a health spa.
The smell comes from therapeutic alkaline waters containing carbon hydrogen that is almost black and its lemon takes you to the skin as soon as you let yourself slide into the pool - a special spa experience.
During her search for beautiful swimming pools, Iris Meder also suffered disappointments: When she wanted to visit Bad Luhatschowitz, a free outdoor swimming pool and in full air from Czechoslovakia, she found herself in front of a barricaded ground.
The bathroom designed by architect Dušan Jurkovic in 1902 was closed.
As she looked out through the New Art Building window in red-white-jaune, she noticed the expansion of the bad grasses between the squares.
She observed an opposite effect in a charming swimming pool in the Black Forest: Bad Wildbad thermal palace.
This building has already survived three phases; it can be discovered not only of the neo-Roman elements that have emerged since its design in 1844, but also of the Alhambra style room that was added to it in 1900.
Since its careful modernization in 1995, the thermal palace remains the favorite pool expert Iris Meder - and not just because it is from Schwarzwald.
"It's already a good performance to melt construction styles so different into such a huge unit," says Meder.
With such a palace, diving in the thermal pool is apparently only a minor matter.
Agricultural speculation
The German bank examines in detail speculation on raw materials
De Christian Teevs
Does the German bank abandon its speculation on raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to look for the consequences of speculation for the world's poor.
In January, the group leader then wanted to bring about consequences.
Hamburg -
For the citizens of the Federal Republic, it is clear: According to one study, 84% of Germans find it unacceptable that banks speculate on raw materials such as corn and wheat.
Two thirds of the respondents even require that the German bank and other credit institutions withhold this business avenue because it increases the problems of the poorest in the world.
This is the result of a Force investigation into the order of the Foodwatch consumer organization.
The study is based on a report submitted by Foodwatch in mid-October.
Author Harald Schumann points out in this article that the speculation of the Stock Exchanges on global raw materials moves prices upwards and that banks share a complicity with global hunger.
The consumer protection campaign is directed specifically against the head of Deutsche-Bank, Josef Ackermann, even though large banks such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley act in the same way.
Speculation on raw materials was initially introduced to protect traders from price fluctuations.
However, the majority of experts share the view that the partners have withdrawn from the offers and demand - and benefit from the costs of the very poor.
Ackermann responded to the criticism of different American competitors: He promised to investigate the complaints and said, "No case is worth putting into practice the good reputation of Deutsche Bank."
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently examining the Foodwatch-Report charges.
The review must be completed by the end of the year, then the results of the Deutsche Bank Board of Directors must be presented - with a recommendation, habitually.
At the end of January, the head of the Bank will indicate the consequences to be drawn.
This could lead to a reduction in the market for raw materials, or even a complete abandonment.
Ackermann builds image
The head of Foodwatch Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time confirmed his criticism of the financial sector: "Speculation on the rise in food prices shows in a particularly dramatic way, to what extent today's banks are harming the general interest."
Ackermann is the first bank lobby to be particularly required today.
"The Deutsche Bank must delete all investments in its portfolio, for which money has been invested on food speculation," Bode said.
"That doesn't matter, Mr. Ackermann, whether it's hungry people or whether Deutsche Bank's reputation is at stake."
Ackermann's awareness may appear to be surprising at first sight, but it is clear that the group's PDG wants to present a perfect image a few months before leaving its functions.
The Deutsche Bank announced on Monday that the President of the Board of Directors would not change anything within the Board of Directors.
It could improve its brand image with an abandonment of controversial agricultural speculation.
And with regard to possible losses, he has little to worry about - his successor will worry about it.
One in two would resolve the investments on raw materials.
Foodwatch is trying to maintain a strong pressure on the Manager.
So far, more than 30,000 netizens have already participated in the organization's campaign.
Bode published the Mardi survey, with which, on 7 and 8 November, the Forsa Institute conducted questionnaires with 1001 people.
Just eleven percent have found it legitimate that Deutsche Bank offers investments for which food price bets are made.
Many bank clients would also draw personal consequences if they learned that their bank was involved in such operations: one in two would resolve all investments for which money is injected into raw materials speculation.
43 per cent would advise such a bank around them, 49 per cent replied that they would consider clearing their accounts to change banking.
21st house in Vienna
The Pavilion That Moved
D'Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with highs, lows and Happy End: the Austrian flag for the Brussels World Exhibitions in 1958 won prizes, was a museum in Vienna, remained empty and fell into ruin.
It is now reopened and is being held as an exhibition house.
If we are excited about a modern post-war architecture, its clear forms, its glass hangars, its lively and bold allures and its new construction materials that are typical of the belief in technical progress, then the Austrian architect's pavilion Karl Schwanzer for the universal exhibition in Brussels in 1958 is a good and famous example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion received the "Grand Prix d'Architecture" for its construction in steel and glass, light and suspended.
Construction is considered to be an important step in contemporary architecture to our day.
He made the architects so famous, that he also built the Pavilion for the following Austrian universal exhibition.
With its legendary four-cylinder BMW house and its adjacent ball-shaped construction in Munich, it finally became famous at the international level in 1973.
His Pavilion project as a temporary construction had been exposed after the universal exhibition in the Swiss Garden at the South Vienna station, was transformed, and in 1962 a museum of the 20th century opened -
But the building was neither physically nor technically suitable for a museum - not walls to hang art works, so not a good environment.
However, it has been used for as long as"the contemporary art received a new building in Vienna.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and has become more and more loose.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has transformed the Pavilion, he now bears the name "Maison of the 21st Century" and will in future be used as a museum for contemporary art.
On Tuesday evening the Belvedère museum opened, to which the house belongs, the first exhibition - a chance at all points of view.
The new departure was carried out by Agnes Husslein-Arco, who became the new director in 2007 of the Austrian Belvedère Gallery.
Husslein-Arco, promoted an art historian to a considerable career, among other things in his youth as an artist skater, then at Sotheby's, at the Guggenheim Museum and as the founder director of the Museum of Modern Art in Salzburg, she carried out in particular the work of transformation with political men and the protection of monuments, obtained public funds and private sponsorship and established its exploitation.
With the exception of contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba whose foundation bears the same name were exposed there, a coffee and a library are there, and an office must be built there.
Strict monitoring, small budget
For the realization of Krischanitz was therefore the perfect interpreter.
Not only because he had transformed and sensibly expanded the secession of Joseph Olbracht and had won the competition, but because he had studied at the Technical University of Vienna and for him the pavilion was "an extremely important place" where he had seen the exhibitions "almost every weekend".
He knew the original project, and he knew the problems of the building, which was lost in generosity and lightness as a result of his move to Vienna and his change of use.
During the current transformations, there were major problems: "the building was "an energy divider", says Krischanitz.
The profile of the glass facades windows was changed, the insulating glass reinforced in glass fibers was placed and the roof was replaced by a special safety glass.
Thermal bridges were reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled coatings were rehabilitated.
Two floors have made the place for the new operation, a light panel between the house and the road ensures lighting, a bridge led to the entrance - it's almost a new construction, but always the light Pavilon Schwanzer.
The outer doors of origin are left, the house is painted in a thin protection against the red-brown.
And the cinema room is exactly the same as it used to be.
And all this under close supervision of the competent authorities for monuments and with a small budget.
"Often materials that are good and low-priced should be found, and that also enjoy the office of monumental protection," says Krischanitz, and he draws attention to a raw soil in the basement.
Despite all the constraints, problems and transformations, the building remained flexible and light.
This would have been difficult with the Pavilion, "who came from Brussels," Krischanitz recently said, a typical story of "Drop-in-the-City".
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and still wants to "awaken the good conscience".
But in this case the House of the 21st century is not in the wrong place, because it is a chance of urban construction: around the Garden Switzerland just stands the "central station district" all newly planned, with offices and apartments.
And another chance may happen: the 21st century House could benefit from the strengthening of another Krischanitz construction, because collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the Berlin temporary art centre, and as it is said, it is already negotiating with the city to obtain a site in the vicinity of the Swiss Garden.
Rail plans a typical winter crisis in millions.
The railway company has developed a crisis plan to avoid train accidents in winter.
The number of employees should double.
That cost millions.
In the fight against train accidents related to the winter season and delays, the railway company "Deutsche Bahn" will spend more than 70 million additional this year in this regard.
The "Bild"-Zeitung daily reported to the predecessor by calling for an internal crisis plan for the group that investments of around EUR 300 million would be planned until 2015.
This should also allow for better availability of vehicles and the rail network in the event of extreme weather.
The number of internal and external employees for the decommissioning of railway installations, which should, among other things, double and increase to 16,000.
The aim is to clear the snow and ice queues until the start of the service phase and 90 per cent of the road equipment required for the service within four to five hours.
Two months ago, the Rüdiger Grube station manager warned the government and industry at a conference at the top of the train accidents that occurred this winter.
Last winter the railway company has had enormous problems for the transport of users, because it lacks, among other things, reservations in the event of difficult weather conditions.
This is why many new regional trains have been waiting for years to be authorized by the Ministry of Railways.
In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway company has been doing what for years, since it has had to check the axles of the ICE trains much more frequently at the workshop, after a break of the axles took place on an ICE in the central station of Cologne.
The German bank "Deutsche Bank" pays millions of penalties in the United States.
After the case of Chief Josef Ackermann there is again in the United States: the German bank "Deutsche Bank" has to pay a fine amounting to millions.
As if the problems of the Deutsche Bank were not already enough, the past of this sector hits the US: the Frankfurt Institute pays $145 million (€106 million) to settle a dispute because of the failure of five large cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It's about selling mortgage documents.
The regulator of the NCUA financial markets carries out a series of charges to large banks, which would have encouraged cooperative banks to make false promises about the purchase of financial products; they would have minimized risks.
These documents have lost tremendous value during the financial crisis and have led the banks down.
"We are pleased to have been able to find a solution on this subject, without the parties even having a trial in the court," said an interlocutor from Deutsche Bank in New York.
The Bank did not recognise any errors in comparison.
This is also true for the Citigroup, which committed itself to a payment of $20.5 million.
NCUA President Debbie Matz welcomed the concessions of the two banking institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the co-operative banks of the United States and is involved in bankruptcy in order to protect customer deposits.
NCUA is trying to repair the damage caused by several billion dollars.
The comparisons now concluded are the first in their kind.
The regulator also took other large banks aside and in summer he was assigned to the JP Morgan Chase Court, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
As regards the issue of mortgage documents, it is "Mortgage-backed Securities".
Credit houses are at the base.
When the U.S. real estate bubble broke up in 2007, this was fatal for a large number of banking companies.
In September 2008, at the top of the financial crisis, the US Investment Bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Even though the events have been dating for a few years now, it is now blowing a storm wind on American banks.
Investors and supervisory authorities have sought numerous remedies for repair or for sanctioning deficiencies.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) launched the largest wave of complaints.
She accuses 18 major international banks, the two financiers of American real estate Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac of having benefited in kind in mortgages of about $200 billion.
The Deutsche Bank also has to file a complaint with FHFA, which involves several operations of a total amount of $14.2 billion for the years 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authorities ask that Frankfurter respond to "substantial losses", but without mentioning a specific amount.
The Deutsche Bank had rejected the requests as unjustified and stated that it wanted to defend itself.
WARN Buffet increase of 10 billion in IBM
Buffet, the financier, invests enormous amounts in IBM's IT company.
Since March, he has purchased shares for a value of more than ten billion dollars.
Until then, American major investor Warren Buffet explains constantly not to invest in IT computer companies, since long-term developments in companies only show bad forecasts.
However, he read the IBM reports and changed his opinion on investment in this sector.
It was already much earlier to understand that IBM offers mainly services and IT systems for other companies' IT sectors.
An investment by Warren Buffet is considered to be an attack on the world of finance.
As a result, IBM's IT activity is granted the right to now call yourself "Monsieur IBM".
Because Buffet has today revealed at the CNBC economic issue, which he has purchased since March IBM shares worth $10.7 billion.
His investment holding company Berkshire Hathaway thus became a large shareholder of IBM with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said that IBM never had anything to do with this commitment so far.
He welcomed the leadership, which even during the economic crisis had provided reasonable benefits.
"You've done a great job," Buffett said strategically.
IBM has for some time been on IT profit services as "exploitation of accounting centres.
The computer pioneer, over 100 years of age, offers both software and consultation as well as highly-performance business computers.
Buffet had so far avoided technology companies.
He says that he invests only in companies that he understands.
On the contrary, Buffet is attacked by railway ferries, lubricant manufacturers or machines.
Her holding Berkshire Hathaway has nearly 80 subsidiaries and shares with a whole range of large groups such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Munich Re.
This 81-year-old octogene had taken over in the 1960s" the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway and had raised it in the rank of one of the most prestigious world companies, thanks to smart investments.
However, his lifestyle is modest.
That is why it is a cult figure for many investors around the world.
His almost infallible sense of money earned him the nickname "Omaha Oracle".
After the announcement of Buffett's investment, IBM's shares increased by one percent to the stock exchange.
"Big Blue", as is also called IBM, has a stock exchange value of more than $220 billion and counts with Apple and Microsoft among the most valuable technology companies in the world.
At Microsoft's, Buffett says, he doesn't want to participate.
The founder Bill Gates would be a very good friend.
The threat is palpable
After the discovery of Zwickauer's "cell", Turkish media doubt the state of German law.
A newspaper even speaks of a "blooding ideology", which would be reborn at the moment.
The murders of eight Turkish nationals and a small Greek company in the years 2000 to 2006 had an extremist context.
Following this news, Turkey and the German-Turkish population react with fear and concern.
Because for many German-Turkishs the spectrum believed to be dead for a long time reappeared: since the fire attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there was no longer any violence comparable to this extremist right-wing context against the Turks.
Although there is a xenophobia in Germany, it has never been a question.
However, the extremist right-wing network that has been detected reveals the proportions whose size is far from predictable.
"Is this a return to bloody ideology," "This was the title of the online edition of the Turkish daily "Haberturk".
On the other hand, the newspaper "Sabah" points out that one of the authors would have been a v-man of the Protection of the Constitution, and is concerned that the German authorities could be involved in the extreme right-wing bubble.
It is reasonable that the Turkish community in Germany reacted: this weekend it called for a silent commemoration of the victims of racial violence at the door of Brandenburg.
It was only two weeks earlier that the Turkish community in Berlin and the German and Turkish politicians had considered a ceremony of the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
It is with gay colors that the co-habitation had been staged, symbolizing a success story.
The reports of some Turkish media have an effect on a giffel: "Germany's gift for the fiftieth anniversary" such is the title of an article in the Turkish platform - "Haber X", which refers to the context of the murder series.
Thus, the German layout of the "Hürriyet" does not prevent itself from drawing on unique conditions.
"It begins at dawn," This is the title of Ahmet Külahci's chronicle.
He stressed that people would have been murdered, paid taxes and, by their work, would have made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany.
The action of the police was very critical of the German-Turkish forums and had subsequently discussed the success of their research.
Why has it not been much earlier in the minds of the German authorities to do research in certain areas suspected of extreme right, the authors are amazed.
More than one proves to be ready for at least drastic rhetorical means: "If the case continues to be settled, there will be nothing left to migrants but self-defense and arms."
"it'll be the best self-defense."
"Internal peace in Germany depends heavily on the quality of information and the relevance of the punishment of the entire network," says "Selena".
What this means is that if domestic peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks by Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s have well explained.
The photo of the ruins after Solingen's fire is deeply anchored in the German and Turkish memory.
Because no other event has made it clear to the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat, and to the Germans, what mistrust and distance from acts of violence could lead to.
However, the attacks have sharpened our feelings in the Turkish community.
Never repeat past errors
On the other hand, it is mainly the failure of the German policy after the attacks which the Turkish press complained about: Helmut Kohl refused to visit Mölln's survivors.
After the fire of Solingen he sent a telegram of condolences to the Chief of the Turkish State, representing himself at the funerals in Cologne by his Minister of Foreign Affairs Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel at the time in his speech, how many taxes the local Turkish population produced.
As if the value of a man could be assessed on the amount of his tax charges.
The current report by the Turkish media shows once again how much mistrust of many Germano-Turkishs has been deeply about the state of local law since that date.
In addition to the efforts to further clarify and re-evaluate extreme-right terrorism in Germany, a clear message is needed this time.
The scandal bank of Lake Zurich
The most adventurous bank in Europe is located not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS has almost failed in the financial crisis and suffers from one crisis to another.
He's a German who has to lead now.
That is certainly not what Axel Weber had imagined.
After its spectacular departure from the head of the Bundesbank, it was known in July that in 2013 it would occupy an almost as spectacular position: President of the Governing Council of the Swiss Grand Bank UBS - a major step towards an unexpected and lucrative career.
Axel Weber was publicly pleased, welcomed; Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its recent solidity and made some kind comments about future colleagues.
"The UBS has succeeded in the Turnround."
"I am pleased to work with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
And yet, from September it was clear that everything was going to change.
A UBS securities dealer in London had turned all the Bank's security systems away and had flamed around EUR 1.7 billion.
The head of the board of directors of UBS Oswald Grubel, a well-known banker not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
The President of the Board of Directors of the UBS is considered to be suffering - and everyone asks: When does Axel Weber finally come back?
We have already learned that Weber can be advised by the bank from February 2012.
And he will resume the administration presidency already in May - not in 2013, as reported by the bank on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber this is getting tough.
He is not a banker, much more professor of economy and president of the bank, and he would certainly have needed an adjustment period.
Once again, he assumed responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just proved once again that it has long deserved the title of "the largest bank in Europe scandal".
In fact, the UBS is on the one hand huge - until recently, it was the largest asset manager in the world, and on the other, it has suffered for years from one scandal to another.
Nothing seems to save her so proud Swiss bank.
This started during the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the Swiss asset manager, silent and solid, but also Russian, combined it with ambitious objectives: she also wanted to become, in the area of banking investment, a very large bank.
So UBS managed on one side in 2007 with $1.6 billion more money coming from an easy clientele than any other bank in the world.
On the other hand, it had advanced as an investment bank in the league of the largest banks in the world.
That made an impression.
Former banker Hans Geiger and later bank professor for years in Zurich reported: "I have always taken the UBS as a model of good bank in front of my students."
"In the current perspective, we ask ourselves: how could I have just been fooled at this point?"
He was deeply mistaken.
In 2007 it appeared that for the first time anything was not going round at the UBS.
In the middle of the year, President Peter Wuffli withdrew surprisingly, which he had so far been regarded as a high intellectual and a great banker.
A few months later, we were told why he had left.
The bank division had burned with sub-precious documents and had to cross billions.
To support this, the UBS announced an increase in capital of 13 billion francs and made a cross over.
For this, it has actually found investors, but who, just a little while before, would have broken the loops: a non-transparent Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund, which had been silenced, to the point that we have never even learned its name.
That was only the first time, though.
In April 2008, it got worse.
The bank was to announce again the losses of billions, the president of the board of directors Marcel Ospel, who was still the second board of directors in 2006 the best payout in Switzerland, will retire.
In October 2008, the disaster follows: UBS was in the financial crisis before bankruptcy and had to be saved by the State in view of its investment errors.
The National Bank has purchased tens of billions of trouble securities from the UBS, and the Swiss Confederation has given six billion francs for convertible debt obligations for which it could become co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland has been shackled - because it has noted how dramatic this can be for a small country, to cover so large banks.
Finally, the total of the 2007 UBS was more than five times Switzerland's economic performance (see chart).
"We couldn't save the UBS again," says bank researcher Geiger.
After the first disaster, he followed the second.
A few months ago, UBS had capitalized on a tax dispute with America and had declared itself ready to publish the data from the easy clientele, who had probably cheated on the tax with the help of the Bank.
In addition, it accepted a payment of $780 million - in repayment of unjustified benefits from these operations with an increased fine.
The UBS thus published more or less that it had helped tax fraud.
At the same time, she lost something that has always been her capital in competition with rich customers: the prestige of discretion.
After the scandal, the Swiss bank secret was no longer the same.
This was followed by the withdrawal of the Chief of the Board of Directors and the Chairman of the Board of Directors.
And the exodus of customers' money.
Thus the bank had lost its credibility in the two main sectors of business in a few months: bank investment due to bad speculation and asset management due to tax fraud.
And, as there was a slight return to calm, and as we thought, the UBS was going to get out of it, it followed this unfortunate story of title-marketers: one brand name-plated merchant $1.7 billion, before the bank realized that something was going on.
And it is published: with risk management in an investment bank, this still does not seem to work.
"With the Adoboli case, it was found that the control of risks was too little," says Martin Jansen, economist and financial professor at the University of Zurich's Banking Institute.
The financial director of a large German bank is also sure of this: "The UBS problem is that it does not control risks by hand."
However, this was exactly the idea of caution, with which the Swiss bankers had long assumed their role, that of becoming a guardian of the world's great fortune: not too high a risk, but security for money - and the world could well sink beyond the Alpine Republic.
The treasures of the Swiss banks had become a symbol of unbreakable reliability such as Lindt and Sprüngli are for a particularly noble chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich is still going to pair with the strong private Swiss bank cliché - it's just a little bigger.
The situation is already classic.
The Bank has its seat at the Zurich Central Station, which leads directly from the Central Station to the Zurich Lake, which itself is surrounded by the snowy summits of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings are prestigious here, the shops' rentals are among the highest in Europe.
Jewelry such as Tiffany's is found here among Swiss traditional stores as well as those of the Sprüngli Confectionery.
For centuries the Swiss bankers have lived here: from the national bank through the palace of the Swiss Credit to elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
We reach the UBS entrance hall through a heavy door.
Inside, the walls are covered with marble, in front of thick leather chairs, and next to the bank logo, a large label for "safe".
The UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank has one day or another market gap - or betrayed the two major Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Switzerland, as the head of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He would rather not read his name in the newspaper, finally like all Swiss bankers he does business with both major banks.
The UBS would have become too large, is it - especially in banking investment, where Anglo-Saxons would also spread.
The Swiss would no longer have anything to say.
"And yet, they have long adapted to the Anglo-Saxons."
This was indeed the Anglo-Saxon investment bank that changed the UBS, it benefited greatly and then broke down: no European financial institution has lost as much money in the sub-prime jungle as the large Swiss bank.
The disaster became apparent on October 15, 2008.
"This Wednesday the government coalition of the small country to the seven million inhabitants has undertaken the largest rescue operation in their nation's history," writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "The UBS Crash".
With up to 68 billion francs, or 45 billion euros, political men have agreed to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
How could that happen?
If we talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem especially at the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks joined together in an enormous group.
A bank has been created, which was already too big for small Switzerland - and has continuously recorded an increase.
What has helped is that the two banks different from the UBS have completed: a rich bank, but in lethargy with a strong point of asset management in Zurich and a poorer but certainly more internationalized.
All of a sudden, international investment banks have had favorable access to a lot of money, with which they have been able to turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with the rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 Head of the UBS Group, and Marcel Ospel, former Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team," said bank researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the great modest intellectual, who is very familiar with models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive, who has broken a path to the top with the learning of the bank."
But Ospel would be proud to the end of Wuffli.
And wuffli would probably have made a decisive mistake at the end: "He thought his models were the reality," says Geiger.
"It's a tragic fall."
Tragic, maybe.
One thing is clear: Exuberance has arrived before the fall.
The staff of the UBS clearly remembers the meetings of the leaders during which the leader of the Wuffli group still spoke the same word of order: destroy Goldman Sachs.
The U.S. Bank was the world's most powerful investment bank.
She ordered the "League Tables" rankings, which at that time documented the success of the banks.
After all, the UBS wanted to climb everything.
Some steps have already succeeded him.
In the case of foreign exchange and securities transactions, it has played a very important role.
Business advisers, who were responsible for this, however, stressed a weakness: in international operations of interest, in the fixed income banker, there would be a huge difference between the largest banks.
UBS would have gaps in U.S. mortgage products.
To fill this gap, the UBS launched itself into an adventure, which almost cost him his life.
Astounded with growth, it is also the bank itself and a management fund created before it in U.S. sub-prime investments that have invested.
It turned into a massive machine that packed and passed valuable documents based on American mortgage loans - but that also kept risks.
Even when other banks have been looking for a long time to come down.
"In the summer of 2007, while the US real estate market was on fire, UBS bought it there," said Geiger, the bank expert.
The greater the euphoria the greater the fall is brutal.
One manager after the other had to leave, when putting an end to the attempts it was harder than we thought.
Posts at UBS have become ejectable and so far are banks.
The one who runs the big bank has an almost impossible task.
It must find a strategy for a bank, for which all proposed business models have disappeared.
The bank researcher Geiger already has an idea: put an end to the investment bank, concentration on property management, return to the Swiss roots.
But the bank doesn't want to go so far.
However, the investment bank must atrophy vigorously, as far as this is clear so far.
Next Thursday the bank leader Sergio Ermotti wants to present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Italian-Switzerland was only supposed to be transitional when the bank separated with the surprise of its predecessor Grübel.
Meanwhile, it was imposed: it must carry out the affairs of the UBS on a sustainable basis, reported the Zurich Bank on Tuesday.
Ermoti wants to bring the investment bank back to the mid-1990s.
It cancels 3500 jobs.
But that's not enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to earn money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber must have already asked.
He said publicly until now that he was only looking for an apartment with his wife in Zurich.
Next year.

Europe will not soon be able to recover from recession, and there are other signs of weakness coming from banks.
The legendary investor, Warren Buffett, has only confirmed this caution: "It is not yet clear whether Europe would be strong enough to do something to end the crisis," he said in an interview with CNBC.
As a result, it was too early to invest in obligations coming from European states and banks.

Smart corneas are spreading in cities
In many places, frogs are considered "bird problem"° But experts claim that these very intelligent animals have long since been hunted down by cities.
Some people like them, some others want to get rid of them as soon as possible. The corneas have belonged to the city for centuries, but in many communities the complaints of residents have increased due to the dirt and noise of animals.
An antidote to the "bird problem" is not yet in sight.
At the first ostfriesisch symposium on corneas, experts said it is no longer possible to hunt the fries of the cities.
Experts from all over Germany have decided on possible solutions.
They're looking for alternatives in cities
The protectionists of nature were based on the problems of cities also on the exodus of specially protected strawberries: The use of chemicals in agriculture is increasingly destroying traditional living spaces.
The hunting, construction and slaughter of typical shelling trees made life difficult for birds.
The corneas are protected by nature.
There are large colonies with more than 600 coves in the Westfälische Soest, in the north-west including Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen as well as in Leer.
In 2005, a controversial project had received negative publicity due to the corneal massacre in the region.
Critics have found the capture of birds in traps and their slaughter with particularly brutal gords.
"The normal eviction, the eviction, is useless," said the city planner and the Leer landscape, Werner Klöver.
The destruction of the nests by water under pressure or the fall of trees, often with adverse consequences, has been said by environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr to Bade-Wurtemberg.
"The animals move away, the large colonies divide and spread elsewhere."
In exceptional cases such as in hospitals, retirement homes or schools, it is only possible to imagine.
"We are forced to live with them, we can no longer exterminate them."
The problem is not resolved in cities without including the periphery, according to Major Wolfgang Kellner of Leer.
Conceivable is a combination of animal survival to adverse conditions and hanging offers, so that they can be relocated elsewhere.
Psychologist and ethnologist, Uta Maria Jürgens was looking for "information panels at the site of trombones" in order to establish completely different relationships with them: "We can finally better bear a button on the face with a dose of self-confidence."
Jürgens co-founded the Ascheberger-walking-education of the Corbels in Schleswig-Holstein, road panels that inform about the life of these very intelligent frogs.
Meanwhile, this project was adopted by tourists.
Jürgen gave his own opinion on the criticism of the noise caused by birds: "This is a lot of communication, these birds have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of animals are legendary: Frogs not only use work tools to reach a rule but they themselves make their own tools as work tools.
Ethologists at Cambridge University recently tested four frescoes, to what extent bird intelligence reaches.
In an experience, birds quickly learned that they had to make a scaffolding with stones to reach a larvae.
Without much training, they firmly recognized that a stone had to have some thickness and shape to make the platform collapse.
In a second test, the wise horns then had to solve a more complicated problem.
In a cylindrical located vertically, the researchers had placed a small seine with a larvae.
The birds could not reach their nest with their beak.
However, researchers had made iron wire pieces available to them.
All four animals formed a crochet with the help of which they fished the small tube.
Three of the four branches were succeeded even from the beginning.
Christian Ronaldo takes Portugal to the European Championship 2012
The hopes of the Bosniaks and the Turks at one time remained unsuccessful.
Portugal, Croatia, Czech Republic and Ireland will participate in the European Championship 2012.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland bought the latest tickets to the European Championship 2012 in Poland and suddenly Ukraine.
Drived by the Superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53th), Portugal has won against Bosnia-Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made its fifth participation in the European Championship after 0:0th of the match.
The Czechs reached the elimination return match by Montenegro 1:0 (0:0), while the first handle (2:0) had already been an obvious thing.
Nothing has been more burning in the zero 0:0 match between Turkey against Croatia, Ireland has taken a 1:1 break (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24), Helder Postiga (72e, 82e) and Miguel Veloso (80e) scored the other shots for Portugal.
The former player of the Bundesliga Wolfsburg, Zvezdan Misimovic, with an 11-meter penalty played by hand (41st) and Captain Emir Spahic (65th) made twice a shortcut for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic was confronted by a yellow-red card (54e).
Bosnia had already failed at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa in Portugal.
At the Stadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal had a well-measured departure.
Ronaldo sent a 30-metre free blow to the front in the mail.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed her remote shooting qualities and fired at a distance of 25 meters to do 2:0.
The Bosnians, who in the first half of an hour did nothing, had their first clear chance thanks to the attacker Edin Dzeko.
The former Wolfsburger, the leader of the Manchester City English Championship, launched a headball headed down the crossbar, and the balloon did not cross the target line (33e).
Jiracek has set a goal for the Czech Republic
Finally, Arbitrary Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding at the center of all attention.
After an attack on Helder Postiga during Bosnia's penalization, Stark decided for Schwalbe and showed the yellow map in Portugal (36th).
On the other hand, Stark granted a penalty of 11 metres played by the controversial hand after an action by Fabio Coentrao which Misimovic probably divided.
But after the break, the 2004 European Vice-Champion succeeded four times and everything became clear.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek also completed the last doubts during the 81st minute.
Thus, the 1976 European Championship will go to EM for a fifth time.
Coach Michal Bilek's team with legionnaires Michael Kadec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1 FC Nuremberg), also had the chance and had to survive a moment of shock in the initial phase.
Target Garden Petr Cech has prevented with a reflection a last-minute goal by potential Tomas Sivok (9).
Montenegro had its greatest potential when duo Steven Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in operation.
Damjanovic scored at the 40th minute of rotation on the surface of repair right next to the Chech shot.
After the break, the crossing had to come to the aid of the world-class guard of the Czechs had already been beaten again, the attacker of the FC Seoul had been replaced (50th).
The goal was finally clarified shortly before the end.
Turkey was concerned about Zagreb's football miracle during this time.
Four days after 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb could not go beyond 0:0.
While national coach Guus Hiddink also had to leave his seat on the EM-Third Bank in 2002, the Croats were able to enjoy their fourth round at the end of the European Championship.
In the presence of 31,000 spectators at the Maksimir stage, the Turks had almost caught up with a dream.
Selcuk Inan scored at the seventh minute with a long shot with only the pole, attacker Kazim Kazim couldn't even bury the balloon in the target.
After the moment of fear, Croatia has increasingly gained control.
Even after the break, the Croats didn't let anything burn.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic of the VfL Wolfsburg, which was replaced by Ivan Perisic of Dortmund in the 62nd Minute, the legions of the Bundesliga Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Intracht Frankfurt) remained on the ground.
Trapattoni participates in the EM
In Dublin, the Irish celebrate their first participation in the EM since 1988 in Germany.

Konstantin Vassiljev (57e) has evened for visitors.
Ireland pushed at the higher speed from the beginning, but had to wait until the 23rd minute before Robbie Keane from Los Angeles Galaxy got the first good chance.
Only at the last moment that Estonia's defence was able to prevent a possible target of the first butcher.
In the 32nd minute, it happened.
After a fruitless defense of the goalkeeper Pavel London, Ward was hand-held and will close the balloon on the line for 1:0.

SAP wants to double the number of employees in China
The largest software company in Europe, SAP, intends to invest billions in China in the coming years and will double the number of employees in the country.
By 2015, approximately $2 billion (€1.5 billion) will be allocated, the Dax Group said on Tuesday.
"We will create additional research facilities and development centres and hire employees accordingly," PDG Bill McDermott announced to its clients on a fair basis in Beijing.
The staff will increase from about 2,500 to 4,500 employees.
The number of branches of the world leader of business software will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP has a presence in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
Some 4000 of the 176,000 global customers of SAP are located in this country in full expansion.
The growth plans in China are also an important element of the Dax Group's 2015 Strategy.

"Now, we want to expand our activities (...)," McDermott said.
"Our goal is to promote sustainable growth in China, supported by comprehensive information."
Personal mass slaughter
The new book by Peter Englund offers depth and generosity. It begins with a long list of characters that close your heart.The new book entitled "The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War" (The Beauty and the Grief: An intimate story of the First World War).
A tip to start: carefully remove this page and make it your brand page.
In this novel story by Peter Englund, this list of characters will be your GPS, a milestone during these few moments when, like one of his men or women, you will be disturbed and desperate in the noises of war.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which delivers the Nobel Prize for Literature.
He wrote here a book outside the municipality which he accurately described as "an anti-history book."
It contains some known names, important treaties or famous battles; there is almost no ambassador or discussion on strategies and equipment.
It's not so much a book about what happened, he explains, that a "book describing what it might look like" is found in the "senses, impressions, experiences and emotions."
"Beauty and grief" summarizes the experiences during wartime of 20 more or less ordinary men and women, on both sides of the war, from young schoolchildren and botanists to climbers, passing through doctors, ambulances and sellers.
Some will become heroes.
Other prisoners of war. Some will lose members, become fools or lose their lives.
Their lives here vacillate like the castles of a church: while some get out, new ones come in.
Peter Englund's book deviates from traditional history books.
It is a reflection of the idea that the First World War is only summed up by the terrible war of the Western Front.
"The beauty and sorrow" describes dressedly other theatres of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the eastern front, the Mesopotamia and East Africa.
The soldiers present in this book are under the rubble; a Christmas pass in Egypt under the pyramids; the T-shirts are an intrudeable problem.
This book is moving from the first page.
The war invades the lives of these people such as a natural disaster, such as a Hurricane Katrina that can corroborate her.
When gunshots stay away, and you're a mother at home, will you stay or run away?
Who will come anyway?
Almost no one can understand what happened, not even the reasons for this war.
According to Peter Englund, "the lack of facts has been exacerbated by assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"The beauty and sorrow" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English food in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor of the German high seas fleet.
Their stories are mainly drawn from already published memories, letters and other documents.
The versions of their lives can be scary or passionate, but they are most preserved thanks to the accumulation of small moments and isolated details.
Most people are dealing with deprivation and the ability to get out of it.
In telling the story of a German school, Peter Englund wrote: "Ersat, everywhere ersat."
"Replacement coffee, false aluminum, imitation rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
It continues on the replacement food in Germany.
It describes the "meat made of rice broken into the fat of sheep (and ends with a false bone of wood); tobacco made with dry roots and dry skin of potatoes; seeds of wooden shoes."
He states that "837 authorized meat substitutes are registered in the production of sausages. 511 substitute coffees are also found."
Some stories address honor and courage.
An American recognizes his own pulsation towards the savagery and declares about the war: "You feel that after all, it is what men were destined to do, instead of sitting in a comfortable chair, a cigarette and a whiskey by hand, reading a newspaper or a best-selling, and rather than claiming that such a painting is synonymous with civilization, and that there is no barbarism behind your pressed and closed shirt.
On the contrary, a British soldier realizes that he is at great risk of death, and that no one will notice or pay attention to it.
"When we are renouncing ourselves, we hope to have a public" he wrote.
Unfortunately, it is rather comparable to "a man convicted secretly."
Other observations concern the decline of an old Europe and new types of terror.
"The conflict is becoming increasingly a history of economic competition," writes Peter Englund, "a war between factories."
He captures the arrival of what he calls "a new species within the animalry of the beginning of the century: the murder of well-jointed and ideologically convinced mass, in well-cut clothes, who executes his butcherry while sitting behind a counter."
People act unexpectedly; there are both basic behaviors and heroism.
Peter Englund speaks of soldiers who have tried to catch a venereal disease in prostitutes at any price in order to avoid service at the front.
"We find the most grotesque expression in the trade of most because of gonorrhea, that soldiers buy and "stand on the genital organs in the hope of ending up in the hospital," he writes.
"The most desperate apply it to the eyes, which translates into a blindness to life."
In this Swedish translation by Peter Graves, Peter Englund's process is flexible but not ostentatious, perfectly adapted to his human task.
In dozens of short scenes, he seized the way in which the war "started exclusively uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, a social revolution, an aberration for religion."
People are beginning to wonder why their leaders are making war on them.
The best works dealing with the First World War are often indirect, such as "Great War and Modern Memory" by Paul Fussel, or "In the West Nothing Again", by Erich Maria Remark, rather than complete.
Peter Englund's work is a little conventional pantheon.
The end of the book is the most exciting I have read in a non-fictional work.
I won't reveal it.
But it's like he came up from his book, grabs your hands on this page where he appears the list of people and burned with a lamp.
After a first step, a minutely planned operation
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some with anti-emetic helmets.
The night of Monday to Tuesday was chosen because the Zuccotti Park would be the most empty.
The operation was kept secret from all but a few senior officers, as well as others informed from the beginning that they were to carry out an exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the heart of the operation, his presence highlighting the risks and challenges for the Police Department.
There could be no repeats of episodes in recent weeks, such as the use of pepper gas against demonstrators, who went against departmental regulation and created a storm of public solidarity for demonstrators.
The operation to clean the Zukotti Park of its demonstrators was deployed after two weeks of planning and training.
Police officers had been preparing to observe the occupations in other cities.
A capital exercise was organized on Randall Island for the operation at Zuccotti Park.
Police officers are better trained against riots - anti-terrorist measures to move a large number of police officers quickly - to focus on the Lower Manhattan neighbourhood.
The last training session took place on Monday evening, on the east bank of Manhattan.
The orders given to move in the park were reached "at the last minute", said a common, referring to the operation as "a simple exercise".
"The few policemen I know who were called didn't know they were going to Zukotti Park," said the person under anonymity.
"The only ones who know they're going to go to the top of the hierarchy of the Department of Police."
The city has been able to hold a lesson, from where the secret of the operation.
On 14 October, police officers wanted to clear the park but were dismissed by hundreds of demonstrators informed of the plans.
The Tuesday operation involved officers from various police units, including operational forces from all over the district - dozens of officers who were used to the particularly criminal districts.
Mr. Kelly said that many people went and came to the park during the day, like migrants, so an hour in the morning was a good time.
"It was necessary to proceed when the park had at least one person" he said.
Emergency services vehicles equipped with slots and speakers gathered on Pipe Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before intervention.
The lights and messages recorded holding speakers seemed to intimidate protesters.
While community affairs officers entered the park equipped with their clear blue winds, many demonstrators simply gathered their affairs and left.
No tent was touched before 1:45 p.m., the police said, which left the occupants time to collect their cases.
Other police teams have been seen on the perimeter, ready to intervene if arrests were necessary.
Journalists inside the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Browne, the spokesperson for the Chief of Police, said that this measure had been taken only safely.
But according to many journalists, the police would have prevented them from observing the intervention inside the park, which was strictly retained by the officers.
Mr. Browne said that television camera trucks on Church Street, along the west side of the park, were able to capture images.
While the police were moving westward through the vast business holes of the protesters, including luggage, plastic lawn and paper bags filled with clothes, teams of the Department of Sanitation followed, cleaning everything the occupants left behind.
A few demonstrators who refused to leave were trained. The images were broadcast on the Internet shortly after.
The main group of protesters took place near the camp kitchen, not far from the center of the park.
Some have formed a barrier that the Police have moved to stop methodically.
A dozen people at the camp center joined together.
Finally, two people fell into trees, Mr. Kelly said.
Emergency services were called to cut the chains.
No arrest took place in the park before 330, Mr. Kelly said.
According to the Police, the cleaning operation ended about an hour and a half later.
According to Mr. Browne, nearly 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most for "public order disorder and rebellion".
Joseph J. Esposito, head of the Police Department, is the most qualified officer to be found on the scene.
Phil T. Pulaski, the head of the detective department, was also present.
Mr. Kelly, although present, "did not lead the operations", said Mr. Browne.
A second group of policemen were suffering along the east side of the park, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, if necessary.
Barricades have been placed on Cortland Street, a cottage in the north of the park, as well as on Pine Street, in the south.
There's seen the Police widening the perimeter right beyond the Zuccotti Park.
Several officers, most of them equipped with lockers, would have even been seen pushing people away.
Nearly 28 people were on the north side.
One of the most lively events of the night took place in the south of the park.
About 5:00 p.m., south of Pine Street, a protestor jumped over the top of a police car. Others were seen breaking down the tires of a police truck.
At one point, an overcrowded end came up flying from the crowd.
Finally, a police officer and a protestant were hospitalized.
The School Aid Union continues the city for Licensing
The union, which represents hundreds of school aids that have lost their jobs last month, intends to try a trial in the city on Wednesday for unnecessary and discriminatory dismissals. The impact is disproportionate on schools that host disadvantaged schools.
The prosecutions are probably the last weapon of the union, Council of the 37th District, to try to cancel the dismissals.
Six hundred and sixty-two school aids, parents' and other employees' coordinators, who were among the least well-paid in the city, lost their jobs on 7 October. Trade union leaders compared them to political revenge for not allowing the city to access a health care fund run by groups of workers, which would have closed the budget gap in the last spring.
The municipal authorities categorically denied this charge.
At a hearing of the Municipal Council last month, Chancellor Dennis Mr. Walcott said that the discharges were part of the closed budget in June.
One member of the Council replied, stating that the school grants were not specified in the budget at all.
The officers of the 37th District Council stated that they would complete a notice of complaint, warning the education department that it would continue; a press conference would be held on Wednesday to officially announce the prosecutions to the Supreme Court of State of Manhattan.
Dennis Mr. Walcott and the city's education department will be the defence party. The complainants will be represented by eight licensed workers, all black or Latin American origins, such as most of the school aid they have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, spokesperson for the City's Legal Department, said that the municipality had not yet been able to see the reasons for the trial and could therefore not comment on the allegations.
According to a statement of complaints received by the New York Times, the union would focus on the number of dismissals in schools in the city's most disadvantaged neighborhoods to support its complaint against unfair treatment, stating that the poorest schools would lose the most aid due to regular sub-financing.
While there is no leave on Staten Island, and a few in the Upper East Side or TriBeCa establishments, 17 school grants lost their employment in the 23rd District of Brownsville, and 46 in the 8th and 9th Districts of the South Bronx districts.
Noting the loss of five schools out of eight employed at the 36th public school in Harlem, where 68% of schoolchildren live in poverty, the press continues that "It is not a quarter of easy parents who can bring funds to fill the budget deficit."
The public school budget 36 was reduced by 3.26% this year. Fundings were also lost when the city changed its calculation of additional funding for each underprivileged student registration.
The union also claims that the school directors could have been misled by certain terms in a memorandum authorizing the licensing of parents' coordinators.
The memo used the term "exceeding" to describe the action, even though "exceeding" describes more generally the action of moving a school teacher to a group of available workers whose salaries are paid by the central office.
According to the draft complaint, "sixty-six parents' coordinators have been licensed", and "not only because of overcoming".
Mission completed: Congress finds agreement on the issue of Libya
Finally, it would appear that the Republicans and Democrats have reached agreement in the Chapter on the issue of uprising in Libya.
A successful uprising, the capture and death of the long-standing dictator Muammar Kadhafi, as well as the American involvement, would have taken place.
The Senate's Foreign Relations Committee will have to take a decision next Tuesday, supported by President John Kerry (Democratic - Massachusetts), with Senators John McCain (Republican - Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent - Connecticut), applauding the Libyan people for their rebellion and American troops for their "courage".
"This resolution is to honour the courage of the Libyans as they begin to rebuild their country," said John Kerry.
"It is a bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations."
The language may be harmless, but the debate on Libya has never been simple so far.
This summer, legislators of the two parties, together with the White House, came into conflict on the formulation of several resolutions to approve or not the military role of the United States in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution to authorize the limited use of American military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated by a large bipartisan margin and was never voted on in the Senate.
But on the very day of the bill's failure, the House of Deputies also rejected a measure aimed at reducing the financing of American operations in Libya.
The American mission therefore remained in a form of legislative purgatory - Congress against enough to criticize the management of the mission by Obama, but not enough to cut the grass under its feet.
The indecision of Congress was exceeded by the events.
Tripoli fell under the insurgents in August and Kadhafi was killed on 20 October.
NATO's mission officially ended on 31 October.
The Senate can now act.
The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Relations "blessed the Libyan people for their courage and extraordinary determination for freedom" and "blessed the men and women of the American armed forces and their partners in the coalition engaged in military operations to protect the Libyan people, for their fantastic courage and professionalism."
The resolution also states "the national interest of the United States in achieving an irreversible and successful transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new measure receive all the support of the Senate's Foreign Affairs Commission or will it divide the legislators as in last June?
The Senator and Chairman of the Commission Richard D. Lugar (Independent) objected to the latest version.
His spokesperson said last Monday that Richard D. Lugar had not yet read the latest version of the new project.
Within the Capitol, the House must vote this week on an amendment to the Constitution to obtain a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all the Republicans of Congress, and some Democrats.
The measure, supported by Republican Bob Goodlate (Virigin), will constitute the first constitutional amendment on the budget, or any other matter, to obtain a vote to the House or the Senate.
Other legislators have so far failed to approve their amendments, but this is not without trying.
The Goodlate amendment is part of the 68 constitutional amendments that have been tabled at Congress on a wide range of subjects.
Some are recurrent - the same bill proposed both in the House and in the Senate - and others are slight variations of a previous one.
There are at least 15 versions in the House only of the amendment for a balanced budget, and another finger that would "control federal expenditures".
Some of these bills are identical, but give their support - especially the new Republicans who want to hurt their CV - the chance to boast of being "the author" of such a measure.
The Budget Control Act approved last August called for the vote of the House and the Senate on the amendment of a balanced budget.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, several members wish to limit the number of terms of office during which members of Congress may serve, while José E. Serrano (Democratic New York) wishes to remove the two terms of office for Presidents.
Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat - Illinois) proposed a number of amendments guaranteeing the right to quality education and health care, among others.
An amendment which prohibits marriage between individuals of the same sex is always proposed, as is the amendment that prohibits profanity of the flag.
Some legislators also wish to authorize the repeal of federal laws if the two thirds of States oppose them.
They are not as fast as they have done in the past.
At the 111th Congress, the legislators proposed 77 amendments, and introduced 66 at 110th.
Cadence slowed down compared to the early 1990s, when members generally proposed more than 150 amendments every two years, according to the figures provided by the Senate library.
But these amendments were not much more successful than they are today.
The last amendment to have been added - on 27th - was ratified in 1992 but proposed to Congress in 1789.
"Massacree but not beaten" said Gabrielle Giffords during his first televised interview since the shooting
Ten months after an armed man shot him at the top of Tucson, the representative Gabrielle Giffords (Democrate - Arizona) appeared on Monday night in a television show, sang "The Sun Will Come Out of Tomorrow" from Broadway and said he wanted to get back to Congress first.
When he appeared in the TV newspaper "20/20" on the ABC channel, next to Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords struggled to form phrases and needed help to walk.
The show approached its difficult return after the ball that broke its skull and pierced the left side of the brain, crossing the head.
Three months ago, she had made a surprising return to the House of Representatives to vote on the debt ceiling text.
During his first television interview since the shooting in January, which killed six people and injured thirteen others, Gabrielle Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and described his restoration as "hard".
After Diane Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gabrielle Giffords, aged 41, replied "not well."
The interview with Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, took place during a special edition of an hour of "20/20", broadcast the watch of the release of the new book of the couple entitled "Gabby: a story of courage and hope".
The special show has traced the restoration of Gabrielle Giffords since the shooting on January 8th.
In the videos filmed by Mark Kelly during the first few weeks, he is seen on his hospital bed, his shaven head and a wide scar on the front.
She can only use one or two fingers, with the encouragement of her husband.
A few months later, Gabrielle Giffords sat in a wheelchair while doctors taught him to perform simple actions.
A sign of the head.
A movement of lips.
And finally, his first word, "What."
A few days later, Gabrielle Giffords gave a different word ("Toast") to ask to change the menu of her little lunch.
The videos released by ABC show the important role of music in the restoration of Gabrielle Giffords: do you see the Representative singing with doctors the air of Cyndi Lauper "Girls Wana Have Fun" and Tom Petty "Free Fallin"?
During the interview with Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords, who spends two hours each day with doctors, said not to remember the shooting.
According to her husband, she was reading an article on the March 12 shooting when she stopped and asked for information about the six people killed during the incident for the first time.
The armed man, Jared Lee Loughner, is detained in a prison in Missouri and is actively treated pending trial.
"There's been a lot of deaths," Gabrielle Giffords told Diane Sawyer.
"Dur, hard, hard."
When she was restored, Mark Kelly said to Diane Sawyer, she said, "I was beaten."
"So I'd say, "Gaby, you weren't beaten," said Mark Kelly.
You just got killed.
And you're gonna get out of it, get back and get back stronger than ever.
More mercy than respect for troops
The event: a gala at Wall Street to collect millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad on impotence, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and Marines around him.
The crowd in costume-crawate stood up to its feet to greet it.
"Militaries, men and women, are considered heroes," said David Saltzman, the organizer of the spring fund collection.
A high-level military officer present at the gala, who was also involved in the role of the troops in a different way by Admiral Mike Mullen, Chief of Staff of the United States Armed Forces.
"They were presented as some kind of orphan," wrote the military high-level in an electronic mail.
I'm sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know.
But it wasn't respect, just mercy.
The absolutely contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relations that have been established between the military and a passionate but often distant American public.
Praises are given to the troops for their sacrifices.
But they have a certain price, they say a few soldiers.
The public is increasingly acting as if it were sorry for men and women in uniform.
"We are not all the victims," said General Brigadier Sean B. MacFarland, who led the troops in Iraq and will soon leave for Afghanistan.
"But it would seem as if the only way to support us is to entrap us in the role of evil spirits."
This is a very sensitive subject for military leaders, who do not want to appear unrecognizable or disagree with the public they serve.
They also realize that the wrath of the coming troops of the Vietnam war has been much worse.
Thus, most of the discussions on mercy take place in all privacy among the veterans.
After his two sons returned from the battle with the Marines, the retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that the public would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with respect because they were confronted with insurgents and traveled to distant contradictions.
Others would wonder if "an angry and violent veteran is hiding under the surface " said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and came back to work in the Government in Washington.
When he was looking for a job, he said he felt that some people who made him pass the interviews were subtly asking if he would be able to stay under the stress of a job requiring Washington immediately after his return to the fight.
"When you discuss the subject of the service, you are confronted with negative impressions," recalls Colonel Cancian when he speaks to his sons.
The difficulties of the military arise, in part, from the American indifference to wars.
The victories are rarely welcomed by a country as small as the army and which sees little direct benefits from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"As a nation, we no longer value heroism in the same way as for the Second World War," says Lieutenant General David Barno, who led the troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the congratulations of political men and people are largely focused on the depth of the suffering of a military.
The troops are recognized for the number of sustained service periods, the number of lost friends or the extent of injuries.
The army faces the increasing pressure to resort to violence
This week, a capital hearing will decide whether 28 men and women will be prosecuted against the army for alleged inaction with rape.
Where appropriate, hundreds of complainants will prepare the next one.
The 1st class soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and pregnant 11 weeks the night she said she had been raped by a soldier.
It was in October 2008. She went back to her casino at Miramar Air Station, in the north of San Diego, after having dinner with a friend, when she met a colleague carrying a package of beer.
He asked if he could join her in his room to drink a glass.
"C" was an alarm signal," Elizabeth Lyman says.
But Texane's been sidetracked by her concern.
I thought: No, he's 19 years old.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I should have followed my intuition."
A few minutes after entering Elizabeth Lyman's room, the man grabbed her from the back, thrown her to the ground and raped her, claiming.
This week, 18 November, Elizabeth Lyman and 27 other soldiers, some still in service and others not, will look forward to a judicial decision during a historic trial that will take place in Arlington, Virginia, and which will decide whether a trial against former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld will take place.
The latter are accused of not having stopped the generalization of rape within the army, thus opposing the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
According to a Washington lawyer named Susan Burke, the trial involved 17 complainants. This number rose to 28 months - 25 women and 3 men, all claiming to have been raped or sexually abused by military colleagues. They also claim that the army did not investigate, prosecute or provide adequate justice after the alleged attacks.
Susan Burke says to take over the gallon soldiers, because the problem begins with them.
"The army is a vertical structure," she said.
"What are the individuals in position to eradicate the culture of revenge? The leaders."
The lawyer also states that since February, she has been contacted by almost 400 other survivors, most of whom may be part of future judicial proceedings.
His strategy: instead of gathering all the complainants in this case - putting all his eggs in the same basket - she will try several processes, if necessary, to maintain the pressure.
The Defence Team, for the Department of Defence, led by American lawyer Neil MacBride, filed a motion to reject the case.
The judicial documents obtained by Newsweek detail the defence strategy, and mainly the fact that the army cannot be prosecuted by soldiers in service or not for injuries caused by the armed forces.
According to a 1950 Supreme Court decision, known as the Doctrine Feres, the Federal Government is not responsible for injuries suffered by active personnel.
" The alleged evil is inherent in the military service of the complainants " , the documents indicate.
The Department of Defence refused to comment.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women still do not have the official right to fight, this distinction is recorded only on paper: the front lines of recent wars are rarely only males.
In Iraq and Afghanistan, women ' s troops play an increasingly important role, including in contact with local women.
As a result, about 150 women soldiers lost their lives in battle.
It's time for the army to modernise, says Susan Burke.
She is not alone in this fight: three other trials are under way.
At Yale's Law School, the Veterans Legal Services Centre prepares a case against the four main military academies to promote a mesogyn environment.
On the other hand, the non-profit foundation Vietnam Veterans of America prepares a trial against the army, focusing on the diagnostics of " personality disorders " attributed to victims of rape in order to give them leave - a relatively regular fact, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwaru of the Service Women's Action Network (the military women's network), a group for human rights.
His group attempted a trial in December at the Veterans Administration, accusing them of discriminatory practices in dealing with claims of benefits for those who claimed to have been victims of sexual assault in the service.
Nine independent bills were presented to Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing various solutions.
In 2010, 3,158 sexual assaults were recorded by the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office of the Department of Defence.
But it is well known that the number of sexual assaults is underestimated. Indeed, according to the Pentagon's own estimate, this figure represents about 13.5% of the 19,000 incidents that occurred this year.
The report published in March also examines the percentage of prosecutions: in 2010, 20% of cases registered in the army were the subject of a trial - half of the percentage of the civilian judicial system.
The complainants in Susan Burke's case describe their aggression as the first of a series of traumas.
In Lyman's case, she informed the Military Police of the rape less than an hour after the facts.
That night, she said, she was asked to tell 11 times in detail her rape to various policemen, doctors and commanders.
She went up a "rape kit" (literally a rape kit), and the blood of her attacker - due to a cut in her arm - was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Elizabeth Lyman sat before a judge, in a trial in which she was questioned about her sexual relations with her little friend earlier on the day of her aggression.
Six people testified as moral witnesses for the author of the crime, who ended up being executed.
"I remember the day the verdict was made," Elizabeth Lyman said.
"I thought I was going to start having contracts.
"I was placed in a psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remembered saying to my commander, "It wasn't his trial, it was mine."
Elizabeth Lyman was forced to consult a military psychiatrist, who ended up diagnosed with a personality disorder, making her unfit for service.
In January 2010, it was sent back under less than honorable terms, preventing it from receiving any advantage.
Whether the Lyman case and other complainants will advance or not, it is a long story, says John Turley, professor of law at the Faculty of Law of the University of Washington.
However, does he point out, "In my opinion, they should be able to move forward."
Only this doctrine that has been criticized since its introduction is between them and a verdict.
I've always criticized Doc Feres.
The army is decades behind because it does not have the same benefits and means of deterrence imposed by responsibility.
"The chances are heavy against them... but it's important that they try," he adds.
These things only change when the good are willing to fight.
If the trial does not turn out for them, Susan Burke, the complainant's lawyer, will gather his hundreds of other complainants for other trials.
"We will continue to fight the army on this issue as long as there is no reform," she said.
Until we died, one or the other of the two options.
The walls have eyes: the researchers are studying you on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the extreme right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was a simple man who shared his views on online immigration.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted having been taken from a murder in Norway in July leaving 77 victims, was confronted with his first trial.
While Breivik acted alone, he was far from being on cyberspace: he had spent much of his time attacking his computer, to discuss with some of the millions of nationalists who support extreme right-wing groups on social network sites.
After this summer's tragedy, researchers want to know more about these people.
But how do you find them?
Easy... Connect to Facebook.
"We realized that it was not so hard to find them," says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a report recently published by the DEMOS reflection group on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook reports so much personal information, says Jamie Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the website's advertising tool to find the people they are looking for with scientific precision - the way marketers have been doing it for years.
Jamie Bartlett's team found that half a million members were fans of extreme right groups in Europe. It targeted them with ads, but instead of linking them to a new group or product, ads invited users to respond to an investigation. The questions raised were their level of education, their attitudes towards violence and their optimism about their own future.
By contacting these people on Facebook, Jamie Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview 10,000 participants from 14 extreme right parties in 11 European countries - without leaving the office.
"It's a new way to do research," says Jamie Bartlett.
Some results are not surprising: online participants in right groups are, rather, men, young people and against immigration.
But surprisingly, "those who associate online and offline activity are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who remain behind their computer screen."
The DEMOS study is just an example of how Facebook has become the new inconclusive tool between scientists' hands.
Meditation groups, medical researchers and polytologists use the site to study all topics that affect health issues such as social trends, thanks to "I love", wall publications and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three content per day, the "supernova of data" generates an explosion in research, increasing the number of research work the site name appears in almost 800% compared to the last five years.
For some researchers, the advantage of Facebook is that it allows you to study people you could not approach in the street.
"Before, when you tried to investigate the people of the British national party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You should go to the party, but they would never have let you in," says Jamie Bartlett.
"Facebook avoids all this - you have direct access to their information."
Others say that the site could offer a way to identify and address health and social problems.
According to a recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and his colleagues, young students who talked on Facebook about their drunken exploits were far more likely to be alcoholic than discreet students.
Megan Moreno suggests that students' colleagues, such as counselors, could monitor the site and intervene to possibly assist a student whose status would be too often about alcohol.
"You can't deal with a problem if you don't diagnose it," Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Megan Moreno and director of the Center for Health, Behavior and Development of Children at the Research Institute for Children located in Seattle, says Washington Post.
"We know how to identify children who are at risk, and who would not otherwise be recognized."
Facebook also constantly accesses information from its users.
The website team that deals with data has studied statistics on the loving situation and the day of Valentine's Day, the rate of participation in the mid-term 2010 elections and a national happiness index (with only available information - digital freedom champions have long maintained that the site could make its data cache available to other people for research purposes).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not - in exchange for being able to play at Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, the site is allowed to access your information.
But what happens when Facebook users are part of an investigation that they have not even heard of?
While researchers have well defined instructions on how to collect information other than via the Internet, there is something else online.
"I don't think a large number of users have already thought that a researcher could study their profile," says Neil Selwyn, sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, according to a 2006 study he conducted by observing the Facebook walls of his students.
"As they know, the exchange was only seen by their friends."
Then comes the question of methodology.
Even without going through the Internet, there is no guarantee that the subject of a study is entirely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know the degree of truth of a profile or the wall of a user.
"What you say on Facebook and what you actually do are two completely different things," says Neil Selwyn.
That is why, despite his experience as a technological researcher, Neil Selwyn thinks that a block-note and a style remain the best tools we can use.
"Nothing can replace the real world and contact with people," he said.
"Social studies are supposed to look at the social aspect - and the social aspect, it's not in front of a computer."
"Froid and Inhuman" : first appearance of Anders Behring Breivik
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who admitted to having organized the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a fighter "of resistance" during his first appearance at the trial in Oslo.
"I am a military commander of the Norwegian Resistance Movement and the Norwegian Temples," he explains in front of a hearing room filled with 500 people.
"As far as the jurisdiction of the court is concerned, I reject it, because you hold your mandate of organizations that support hate ideology and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I know the facts, but I don't complain guilty."
Judge Torkel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because he "did not want to leave him the opportunity to use this process to express his views."
For the same reason, he refused to let Breivik, who brought a talk on paper with him, speak to the parents of the victims at the end of the hearing.
Judge Nesheim also asked the Police to keep Breivik in custody for more than 12 weeks, banned him from talking to the media for four weeks, and warned him that the authorities would monitor almost every visit and correspondence for eight weeks.
Thirty surviving parents and victims were present at the hearing.
Some have come in the hope of looking Breivik in the eye, others to be sure it would be placed behind bars.
All participated in the hearing in order to see the end of the trial.
"I found it cold and inhuman" said a survivor of Utoya at the Norwegian TV channel NRK.
"I wasn't comfortable, but I personally made some progress after seeing and hearing the suspect."
Wounded with a dark suit and a blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the trial. He looked at journalists and survivors in the eyes as they entered and went out of court.
Despite the strange idea that Breivik belongs to a vast "resistance" movement, the judge determined that he was not crazy. He also stated that there was no evidence that he acted with accomplices.
The attacks of 22 July therefore seem to be the work of an extremist rather than of an entire group of radicals, which may bring some comfort.
But this does not reduce the sorrow or confusion felt by the whole nation.
"I'd rather he'd look like a monster, but that's not the case," said a victim's parents.
"That would have been much easier."
7 lessons from Steve Jobs' lost interview at the cinema this week
After Steve Jobs died on October 5, some compared it to Henry Ford - distinguished by the technical genius and inventor of modern computer science.
But what Apple fans can find more revealing in a recently found Steve Jobs interview that will be broadcast this week in the first part of a movie on the main markets is how much this creative spirit has understood the processes and workflows of the products.
He was no doubt a creator and a dreamer. He identified himself as a hippie but was also very methic and organized, as well as an organigram enhancer - a man who believed that many business leaders were suffering from a "disease to think that a brilliant idea makes 90% of the work... [but] a considerable amount of manual work separates a brilliant idea from an exception product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the television series "Triumph of the Nerds". This series retraced the birth of the computer, and sat for more than an hour with Steve Jobs for a long and rare conversation.
At that time, it took about 10 years for Steve Jobs to leave Apple. He was already working hard on his new NeXT computer company, aiming at popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of the maintenance with Cringely is used in Nerds, he states that the main copies have disappeared in the transport.
It's only after Steve Jobs' death that a complete video is found in the director's garage.
This slightly refurbished video is the basis of a 68-minute film entitled Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which will be broadcast to the film on Wednesday and Thursday next.
For someone known to hate in-depth interviews, Steve Jobs seems here to be surprisingly enthusiastic about exposing technological philosophies and his commercial strategies.
An incredibly careful one.
On four different points during the interview, the answers come a long time after the questions - between 10 and 15 seconds of reflection, during which Steve Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts, in order to provide a precise answer.
There are also times when Steve Jobs' perfectionism rises, where he seems to be reluctant to listen to Cringely's questions, giving him a shot to speed him up and move him to more important questions or subjects.
Filmed before the age of Pixar, the iPod or the iPhone, we find a very interesting aspect on Lost Interview. Steve Jobs assesses what he considers good or bad in other companies and shares his own vision of the future of computer technology.
It's something to read the posthumous evaluations of Steve Jobs' career, but there's something gross and inspiring about the man we see here, the anxious dream of the watch.
He has a vision of how things can and should be.
He then explains the implementation of them immediately.
Here is a quick summary of seven remarkable sequences of Lost Interview:
In the way he learned how to run a company:
"During all these years, I have always asked, 'Why do you do things?" and the answers are constantly the same: 'oh, just because you have to do them."'
No one knows why, no one thinks deeply about things in a business.
That's what I found out.
Steve Jobs continues by giving details of his efforts to simplify Apple's accounting.
Perplexe as to how the costs were recorded - often started with a "standard cost" evaluated for nose, then adjusted with a "variation" - it developed an automated plant that ensured the precise calculation of the commercial costs.
On the opportunity to play a tour of the Pope:
Steve Jobs reports the anecdote of the "Blue Box" he created with Steve Wozniak - a device that used to hack phone networks and phone for free in long distance.
The device was the subject of many writings in advance, but Steve Jobs' euphoria here in his description of the Blue Box as an act of ownership is contagious.
He describes how he and Wozniak tested the box by using a public phone, then calling and connecting from an AT&T network to another while bypassing as many satellites as possible.
"We wrapped up the ball of different things a half a dozen times and yelled in the public phone, and that would happen a minute later on to the public phone on the other side," explains Jobs laughing.
"We were young and thanks to this Blue Box, we learned that we could create something that could control billions of infrastructure worldwide."
We don't know much about both of them, but we've invented a little thing that can control big things. It was an incredible lesson, and I don't think Apple would ever have existed without it.
Steve Jobs continues by telling a wonderful tour that he and Wozniak have developed: he telephoned the Vatican with the Blue Box in the beautiful middle of the night by passing by to Henry Kissinger and asked to speak to the Pope.
While several members of the Catholic hierarchy are summoned in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, the two accomplices go crazy laughing just before the Pope himself wakes up.
On his love of technology (and Bill Hewlett's launch):
At the age of 12, at the time of hunting for spare parts to produce a frequency meter, he searches for Bill Hewlett's number in the directory and passes a thread to him.
Shortly after their 20-minute conversation, Steve Jobs gets a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"It had a remarkable influence on me. It was the only company I had seen at that age and it formed my definition of a company and the way employees are treated."
Steve Jobs then became one of the HP employees to visit the company's research laboratories, located in Palo Alto, where he discovered the "first office computer ever designed."
He was as big as a suitcase, he had a little cathode tube.
Adolescent I was back at HP and started writing programs for this machine.
On the improvisation of innovation:
At several times in the interview, Steve Jobs is talking about inventing new products at a head start.
At the beginning of his career, while he is set up to sell some printed circuit cards, a client asks him to assemble a complete computer.
Working for only 30 days of credit, he should take care of the assembly as well as the delivery of finished equipment.
Later, in Apple, he remembers the difficulties encountered in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember major disputes... I was raised over claiming that it would take me five years [to make a mouse that would cost $300]. I had enough, I went out and went to see a designer."
Forty-ten days later, we had a mouse that we could make for $15, which would have been incredibly reliable.
Of the major companies that are in the process of:
Even before he made Apple come back, Steve Jobs had anticipated the way many industrial leaders were going to cheat and lose control of their market.
"Let's admit that you work at IBM or Xerox, you make a better copy or a better printer, and then?"
You have the monopoly of the market, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing can make it evolve, so [these are] people who end up leading companies and specialized personnel in the product are excluded from decision-making.
The product engineering that led to this monopoly position is completely corrupted by people who cannot imagine designing a good product compared to a bad product - the manual work required.
That's what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have held the entire IT industry.
It could have done ten times its current size. Xerox would have been Microsoft in the 1990s...
They have drawn the defeat to victory.
On innovation as an artistic form:
"An enormous part of manual work separates a great idea from an exceptional product... as you develop this idea, it changes and grows."
You learn enormously about its subtleties.
There are some compromises to make... some things you can't do, the electrons can do it, the glass, the robots, the factories too.
You have to keep thousands of things in mind (these concepts) by bringing them together.
Finally, decisions are made by personal taste. This is to try to expose you to the best products created by men, and to try to bring these things to the product you create.
Picasso said one day that good artists copy and that great artists want.
We are always ashamed to steal excellent ideas.
This is partly what makes Macintosh exceptional. The people who worked on it were musicians, poets, zoologists, historians, who simply became the best computer scientists in the world.
If it wasn't for computer science, they would have done extraordinary things in another field.
Scalia and Thomas have dinner with opponents of the right to health while the court meets
The day the Supreme Court met in private to discuss the issue of political dispute, namely whether the opposition to President Obama's health law will be heard, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were observed at a dinner sponsored by the law firm who will defend the case before the High Court.
The event took place last Thursday, when the nine judges met for a conference to discuss requests for consideration.
One of the cases in question concerned an attempted trial by 26 States contesting the reform of the ambitious health care voted by Congress last year, a law that was a focal point for conservative militants at the national level.
The judges agreed to hear the complaint, in fact, a monumental argument of 530 is expected in March, and the result will probably be of a nature to facilitate the destabilization of the 2012 presidential race, which will be in full swing at the time the court's decision will be delivered.
The lawyer who will stand before the court and argue on the rejection of the law will probably be Paul Clement, who served as United States general candidate during the administration of George W. Bush.
The legal cabinet of Clément, PLLC Bancroft, was part of the two dozen cabinets that helped to sponsor the Federalist Society (Federalist Society) annual dinner, a long-standing group dedicated to defending conservative legal principles.
Another cabinet that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, is one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another promoter was the Pfizer Inc pharmaceutical giant, who presented a huge financial challenge in the outcome of the dispute.
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel a few hours after the court conference on the case.
There was, among other things, Mitch McConnell, a Republican top of the Senate and a declared adversary of the Health Act.
The guests see the dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is not new: the two judges were present at the events of the Federalist Society for years.
And there's nothing going against the rules of ethics.
In fact, judges are exempt from code of conduct governing the actions of federal judges.
If they were, they would undoubtedly argue by the Canon 4C code, which states: "A judge may attend collections of funds from law-related organizations and others that the judge may not be an intervener, a guest of honor, or on the program of such an event."
However, the simple presence of Scalia and Thomas near two of the law firms in the case, as well as a company with a massive financial interest, is enough to alert government ethics activists.
"This violation of ethics and wonderful indifference to the code contradicts the statements of several judges that the Court complies with the same rules applicable to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of Common Cause.
"The judges were drinking and eating and collecting gala funds with lawyers who had court cases."
Their presence and their participation in the collection of funds for this event will remove any claim of impartiality, and it is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas showed little respect for critics saying they mix the court's affairs too easily with the group agenda such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife, Ginni, is a high profile conservative.
In addition, the Conservatives claim that Judge Elena Kagan has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was a general candidate for Obama's administration when the first opposition to the law was brought to the level of the Court of First Instance.
His critics pressured Kagan to refuse to hear the case, saying that she had invested too much in the defense of the law to be impartial.
Kagan gave no indication that she would.
Boeing records a record order of $18 billion for online aircraft
The air carrier Emirates orders 50 Boeing 777, bi-coloured aircraft, with the possibility to buy 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, a market estimated to be over $1 billion.
There is nothing extraordinary about a company receiving a order containing 50 of its products.
On the other hand, this is a case where the company in question is the manufacturer of Boeing aircraft and the amount of these 50 aircraft reaches the record of $18 billion.
It is equally incredible that Boeing received this command: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In the forecasts published on Monday, the company in Chicago estimates that the air carriers in the Middle East will need $2,520 aircraft of a total value of $450 billion in the next 20 years.
During the weekend, Boeing reported on the most expensive commercial aircraft order in its history - 50 Boeing 777 bi-colours.
It is the air carrier Emirates based in Dubai that passed this Pharaohic command.
Boeing announced at Dubai Airport in 2011 that the airline is also able to buy 20 more aircraft, which would raise the total amount of the order to $26 billion.
On the other hand, Boeing indicated on Monday that the company Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8, named Dreamliners, a model that boasts important fuel savings and conveniences for passengers.
The amount of these six devices amounts to more than $1 billion.
"It's clearly very positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, an analyst at Morningstar.
"These customers in particular have great value."
In the Middle East, oil-producing countries have many of their airlines.
So not only do they have the means to pay these planes, but they have an increase in the fuel price - which is harmful to airlines because it represents their most important costs - would not be so harmful to them as the country would earn money with the increase in the oil price.
This is an important point because these companies will be less likely than others to cancel or defer their aircraft orders when the oil price increases, Dihora reported.
"They have a natural risk coverage," he said.
The Command of Emirates reinforces Boeing's predominance on the wholesaler aircraft market and helps to halt the attempt to impose the Airbus competitor on its A350 aircraft.
Boeing's victory at the Aeronautics Hall is four months after the Airbus announcement to report the beginnings of the largest version of the A350, which competes directly with Boeing 777-300ER.
Airbus rejects its beginnings to increase its momentum at the request of its customers to increase its capacity of charge and autonomy.
Boeing's shares increased by 1.5 per cent to $67.94.
Mexican President's sister manifestly beat at the Michoacán elections
Luisa Maria Calderon states that drug traffickers have helped her opponent Fausto Vallejo of the PRI in the race at the governor's office.
President Felipe Calderon's sister seems to have lost her attempt to gain access to the positions of Governor of Michoacán during violent elections, and she said on Monday that drug traffickers have favored one of her opponents.
The first results indicated that Fausto Vallejo of the Industrial Revolutionary Party, or PRI, was in charge of the race at the position of Governor of this Western State.
"The intervention of the crime organized throughout the voting process and in particular yesterday is an alarming fact, not only for the Michoacán but for the whole country," Luisa Maria Calderon said on the radio during an interview on Monday after the elections.
"They threatened our candidates, our election officers... they took away urns, installed road barriers... and forced people to vote" for the PRI.
The PRI has ruled Mexico for sixty-ten years to lose its presidency in 2000.
But he organizes his return, and a victory in Michoacán is an important step in this effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have noticed just a little of Calderon, who was in charge of the polls before the day of the elections.
Calderon, a candidate for the Conservative Party of his brother, the National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as a winner.
Silvano Aureoles, a left-wing candidate from the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, who currently serves as governor, has become a third, a painful defeat before the 2012 presidents for this divided and unfortunate left.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the first results.
Vallejo, the former mayor of Morelia, the capital of the State, has denounced all links with drug traffickers and strongly advised other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specialized in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine trafficking.
It is the State of origin of President Calderon, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military offensive against traffickers in December 2006.
Yet, violence has persisted.
A week before the elections, a PAN mayor was murdered while campaigning for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates gave up the campaign with fear.
However, for the PRI, as corrupt as the Michoacán elections have air, a victory will help the party in its wake.
The man expected to represent the PRI in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, congratulated Vallejo since Washington and said, "I think this victory is very encouraging for next year."
BASD strongly encourages Asia to come in aid to the euro area
The Asian Development Bank has asked India and China to prepare to help the euro area out of the sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term decline that would prevent the development of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, Director General of the BASD based in Manila, said that the two economic powers to the fastest growth in the world had to "do everything in their power" to accelerate the recovery of the monetary area through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He advised the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, China) to look at Europe's difficulties with an "indifferent eye" and said that Asian financial support by Europe's leaders and resources would avoid a long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We're all in this crisis together."
"Therefore, anyone who can help Europe out of the crisis is useful," he told the Financial Times during an interview during the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
"Asia can be protected up to a certain point, but she's not at the door."
"So if China and India can help, nothing will stop them."
In recent months, the euro area has been seriously damaged by a sovereign debt crisis.
Recently, the cost of the Italian loan is dangerously high and the Prime Ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The booming crisis of sovereign debt in Europe has sparked the fear that the global economy will not return to recession, and has led to the call for major emerging economies to meet to help the euro area find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that the IMF would extend any Asian aid, but he also stated that this bilateral assistance - such as purchasing the obligations of the United States' financial rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Fund - would provide greater negotiating power for the Asian partners in Europe.
Anand Sharma, the Minister of Trade and Industry of India, said that "India will do everything it can" to help the euro area as its own economy now suffers from a decrease in exports and a slowdown in the arrival of foreign capital.
"No one wants the euro area to remain unstable and agitated," he said.
"We have monumental challenges to face and we must maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not a choice, it's an imperative, because where would we find work for the tens of millions of our young men and women?"
Others argue that developing economies such as India should not help European rich people while facing their own important economic challenges.
Ashtosh Varshney, professor at Brown University in the United States, stated that it would be politically difficult to accept assistance to Europe at 1.2 billion Indians, at least 800 000 of whom live with $2 a day, or less.
"One day, they will find out that the Greeks are retired at 50 years of age and that they are going on vacation in the sun and will have trouble hitting it," he said.
Lee Howell, president of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India's reserves should be used to maintain many well-paid Greek officials in poorly managed jobs that generate losses, as in the railway sector.
Mr Nag said that the crisis in the euro area could lead to "significant impacts" across Asia.
The BASD forecasts of economic growth of 7.5% in Asia in 2011/2012 are now facing "risks of loss" due to the European threat.
He noted that vulnerable emerging markets needed to "develop relief plans" to protect themselves from economic returns and significant capital leakages.
Severe warnings from the Pentagon on potential defence reductions
The Secretary of Defence, Leon Panetta, put pressure on Congress on Monday, warning that the imminent automatic budget compressions would know national security, and triggered a financial response from the Pentagon's corridors to Afghanistan's battlefields through civilian gatherings.
The Pentagon is already spending $450 billion in reductions for the next decade, but now I fear that an additional $600 or more of compressions will be imminent if Congress does not reach an agreement on expenditures.
"The impact of these reductions would be devastating for the department," Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, R-Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina.
He stated that Congress' failure to reach a budgetary agreement resulting from what is called kidnapping would result in 23% reductions as well as the freezing of many new projects.
"A reduction so important, applied without discernment, would make most of our ships and our non-executive construction projects - you cannot buy three quarters of a ship or building - and seriously harm other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We would also be forced to separate ourselves from a number of our civilian personnel and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, we should almost certainly send civilians on leave without wages in order to achieve the goal."
"These changes would undermine the faith of those who support our soldiers and seriously harm our preparation."
Reductions would possibly affect fighting troops, Panetta continues.
"Although the financing of foreign contingent accounts during wartime is not directly affected by kidnapping, war efforts would be adversely affected by serious disturbances in the core budgets," Panetta warned.
"The contract staff would be reduced, resulting in delays in contracts and the supervision of contracts that support the war."
"The staff managing salaries would be reduced, resulting in delays in payment to war-supply suppliers, and legal and political support would be disrupted."
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days earlier, requesting details on the potential impact of automatic compressions on the Ministry of Defence.
"The consequence of a kidnapping on the Department of Defence would have triggered a rapid decline in the United States as the world's leader, indisputable from the military."
"We are very opposed to this draconian action," the senators said in a joint communiqué Monday afternoon when Panetta's letter was published.
"This is not a consequence that we can live with, and it is certainly not what we should impose."
"Sequestration is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and it should not happen."
That the letter from Panetta and the senators' recent warnings increase the pressure for a budgetary compromise or an appeal to exempt the Pentagon from reductions, remains to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly virulent about possible compressions, even though he himself has reached the highest level of the Pentagon's accumulated years of budget expertise in Congress and the White House and knows that he was faced with difficult choices.
At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defence painted a dark picture of what might happen - a soldier with a shell, but not a nude.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a ballless brigade."
"It's a hunting plane, not enough trained pilots."
"It is a tiger in paper, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs that do not have enough trained soldiers to carry out the mission," Panetta said in her preliminary remarks at the Pentagon.
"It is a depressed, ill-prepared and unable to face potential opponents."
"In fact, she invites aggression."
In an addendum to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta specifically stated how new reductions could "produce significant operational risks: time to respond to crises, conflicts and disasters; severe limits to our ability to deploy and engage in the world; and risk assumed unacceptable in future combat operations".
And Panetta stated that some of the largest defence projects could be cut off, including those already tested and some just at the early stages of planning.
This list included the Fighter F35 Joint Strike, a new planned bomber, the ballistic submarine of a new generation, the new coastal combat ship and the new ground vehicle, which would replace the Humvee of the Army and the Navy.
Ending the development and testing of the F35 could generate $80 billion of savings over 10 years, but its participants say it is an essential step in improving and responding to China's potential threats and other rivers.
How to Find a Lie
A look at the recent stains indicates the extent to which deception and lying are omnipresent in everyday life.
The Republican candidate to President Herman Cain is busy exchanging allegations of sexual harassment with several women, each accusing the other of lying.
Penn State administrators have been accused of parjuring for allegedly covering reports that a retired football coach has sexually assaulted boys.
Last week French President Nicolas Sarkozy was taken by an open phone claiming US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
The lie has destroyed careers and convulsed countries.
The member of the New York Congress and the celebrity of the Internet Anthony Weiner, has been turned into an idiot by quickly issuing the dissertations contradicted by irrefutable evidence.
The former presidential candidate John Edwards has been charged with violations of the financing of campaigns related to the coverage of an extra-marriage link.
And then, none of those who lived the story will ever forget the media circus that President Bill Clinton launched by lying during his second term of office about his sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky.
The story of cheating on school and university tests is legion.
There have been cases where teachers have given student test answers in order to show themselves well on their performance assessments.
Mentors who should teach otherwise send the message that lies and lies are acceptable.
How much fraud do we meet?
On a given day, studies show that you can hear from 10 to 200 lies.
In fact, many of these are pious lies.
Another study showed that foreigners lie three times in the first 10 minutes of their meeting.
To detect or detect lies is an essential competence that everyone must acquire for both personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a game of society similar to, say, charades, where the goal is to write: "I had you," the detection of fraud is a serious knowledge-based branch of scientific data collected in the last six decades in prestigious universities that have conducted a deep research of such projects, especially in psychology and physiology.
One of the research results is that the oldest myths about the lie have been demystified.
The liars are looking into your eyes.
They don't cry, they don't cry, they don't always get upset.
Do not conclude that liars are difficult to detect and difficult to unmask.
A qualified liar can discover the truth by examining the structure of the statement, facial micro-expressions, the formation of the question and the time of response.
I spent several years examining scientific results in the vast body and always emerging from knowledge about fraud, and it is clear that the detection of fraud is a modern competence that is easy to learn and useful to navigate in our complex world - especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring, interviewing, negotiating or managing.
Good mentors are able to read to others, by putting them at ease, by managing their own emotions and by intuitively detecting how others perceive them.
We know from research that strangers lie more than introverts, that men say more lies "centred on them" while women say more lies "centred on others" - usually to protect the feelings of someone - that married people often lie to their partners than unmarried people (but the lies they tell tend to be huge).
We also know that if you are perceived as a liar, others will feel less guilty to lying to you.
How can you tell if someone's lying?
First of all, observe the normal behavior of your subject.
That's what we call "setting reference data."
This helps to provide a reference point to measure subsequent changes.
Observe the posture of your subject, laughter, voice quality.
You need to know if someone normally removes his feet permanently in order not to make unfair accusations when you see him remove his feet in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for indexes of misleading speech and not speech.
Consider these indices as red flags, not evidence of fraud.
The trumpeters can immobilize the top of the body when they try to remember their story, they can point their feet to the door, think about an exit, change posture significantly, or present a relief of "post-interview" - an excessive blow of relief, a change of posture when all difficult questions have passed.
Questionnaires often falsely indicate that the maintenance is just finished to try to trigger the post-interview response.
So pay attention to the vocabulary of your subject.
The famous Scott Peterson came by using the past while claiming that his murdered wife was alive, launching a national search to find her again.
The cheaters can also use a remote language: "I didn't have sexual relations with this woman... Ms. Lewinsky" or repeat a completely difficult question.
The most common oral indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "wood language" when answering a difficult question: "Well... to tell the truth... if I remember well... to my knowledge."
This makes the conceptual response rather than factual and is often a red flag.
There is no magic formula for the detection of lies, but the development of skills to recognize fraud is possible.
These skills will improve anyone's chances of avoiding victimization by drug addicts in their professional and personal lives.
The controversial oil pipeline plan will be launched after the US late approval threat
A few days after Obama's administration threatened to delay the approval of a pipeline project between Canada and the Gulf of Mexico - triggering the anger of trade unions while calming environmentalists - the company seeking to build the pipeline said it was ready to redirect the project to return it to the railways.
TransCanada said on Monday evening that it will move the projected pipeline outside the environmentally sensitive area of the dunes of Nebraska, and is confident that the project will still win its approval.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the capital of Nebraska.
TransCanada Officer Alex Purbax says the company remains confident that it will end up obtaining the approval of a pipeline, but with a different route.
This follows the announcement by the Department of State last week that it would delay its decision to grant a federal permit for the project until it received new studies on potential routes to avoid areas of the Nebraska dunes and the Ogallala Aquifer, large underground water sources.
"It's a real way forward," says Lee Terry, a Republican of Nebraska in Fox News.
The new environmental review commissioned by the Department of State would have probably rejected any decision until 2013, after the next year's elections, although officials deny the involvement of the policy in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the decision of the Department of State, and expressed his support.
The 2,735 km pipeline would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
He would transport 700,000 barrels a day from the province of Alberta to the Texas refineries.
To do this, he would have to cross six states.
It is hated by environmentalists, but liked by working groups, who put on the 20,000 estimated oil pipeline jobs.
But Nebraska legislators opposed this plan are under pressure that a law to force the removal of the Sand Hills region and Ogallala Aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current environmental impact study of the Department of State found that the project would have only limited negative environmental impacts, but the energy industry said that the Department's Inspector General ordered a separate investigation of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is that a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a campaign adviser to Hillary Clinton in 2008, would represent a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is whether a company that was hired to conduct the initial study was an inappropriate choice from its relationship with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle prosecutes for allegedly causing a young child to vomit out of fear
A New York family claims that the diva Disco Patti LaBelle, launched in a violent detachment in their manhattan building hall, terrified their little girl to the point that she was afraid of it.
The "Lady Marmalade" singer's tug of "Lady Marmalade" detonated little Geneviève Monk aged 18 months old, to the point that she suffered "from personality changes, sleep disorders" and "the increased fear of foreigners", said her family during the proceedings of the Supreme Court of Manhattan.
It was November 10 of last year while the screenwriter Kevin Monk, his wife's teacher of children's garden, Rosana, and Geneviève were preparing to leave on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was looking for the car, Rosana Monk went down to the hall of their Riverside Boulevard building with their luggage, carrying Geneviève in his arms.
Rosana Monk said she had stopped at the door and had laid her daughter for a moment.
"Who came behind me and said to me, 'Do you know what your daughter is doing?' I said "Yes," and I went looking for her," she said.
LaBelle warned the pregnant woman with anger.
"She told me about an aggressive tone: "You shouldn't leave your daughter near the door," said Rosana Monk.
"I said to him, "what you say or think I don't care."
She became angry and began to use oaths - the word "" and the word "" of a strong voice...
She had a bottle of water and started to wipe me out of the bottle.
She said that at this point, Geneviève became hysterical.
"I told this woman, "Look what you did to my daughter," says the mother of the child.
LaBelle threw herself on her mother - who always held Geneviève in her arms - and had to be held by her surrounding who took her to a car waiting for them, says Rosana Monk.
The little girl would cry so hard that she got to vomit, add.
Later, the family sent a note apologizing to LaBelle, but received no answer.
The lawyer and the representatives of LaBelle did not return our calls to comment.
The complaint claims unspecified damage, but family lawyer Sam Davis said that he took the case free of charge and that the family plans to make a donation of all the money received to charity against cancer for children.
"The aim is to hold Patti LaBelle responsible for his conduct," said Mr. Davis.
"This kind of behavior is totally unacceptable, especially to a maternal teacher with an 18-month-old child."
Climate adversity has slowed the economy
During the first management year of Mario López Valdez, unemployment and informality in Sinaloa increased, foreign investment decreased and the economy contracted
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, which is the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdez, self-proclaimed for change, which has generated great expectations regarding economic advances, but given the climateal adversity of the beginning of the year, the increase is not observed, in exchange there is a deterioration in the main indicators of economic development.
The low temperatures of February, apart from the loss of billions for the agricultural sector, limited the possibilities of the State economy for growth, caused a contraction of economic activity in general by 3.6 per cent in the first half of the year, mainly due to the decline of 31.16 per cent in agriculture, which affected the dynamics of other economic sectors.
According to the report of ice-flakes from the Mexican Rural Development Council on Sustainable Development, there were damage of 582 million 835 hectares cultivated, of which 78.03 per cent suffered total damage and the rest of 21.07 per cent suffered partial damage, the main affected crops were vegetables, corn and chic fish.
The decline in economic activity has generated, until November, a steady increase in unemployment in the State, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, the rate of unemployment of the State during the first three quarters of the year has been accelerated, as from January to March 55 thousand 053 were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 per cent of the Active Economic Population, in the second quarter the rate has become 5.28 per cent and from July to September the average rate has continued to rise to 6.19 per cent, a rate representing more than 74 thousand unemployed people, an increase compared to the first half of 18 thousand 969 people.
Less liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, according to economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the increase in unemployment can be explained indirectly by actions carried out by public policy.
"What is observed is an increase in unemployment due to various factors, including the loss of liquidity on the market due to a restriction of resources by the legislation approved in Congress to combat money-laundering, because it is not easy for people who earn dollars in an illegal way to earn them, invest them and use them in something," he said.
Detained migration
López Cervantes reported that the increase in unemployment is also due to a demographic factor.
"The number of people leaving the State to work abroad has been limited to the United States, firstly because of the difficulties of entry and secondly because they already have a lot of difficulties in finding work, these people stay here and ask for work sources, which makes unemployment rising," he said.
No Serious Lack
The analysis of the labour market is compounded by the high level of serious lack that prevails among the working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 per cent of the population employed in this state work without contributions from any social insurance institution.
Apart from unemployment and serious deprivation, another reason for the state's dismissal is low wages, the entity has lower salaries in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Institute of Social Insurance and the Labour Secretariat and Social Forecast.
The average monthly income of workers in Sinaloa was, until September, 5 thousand 352 pesos, much lower than the national average, which is 7 thousand 375 pesos.
IED contract
Apart from the decline in economic activity and the increase in unemployment, the highest reduction in foreign direct investment in the past 10 years was recorded in 2011, according to the Department of Economics from January to June the State IED reached $630 thousand 697, representing a decrease of 87.74 per cent compared with the $5 million 143 thousand 312 recorded in the same period of the previous year.
In turn, the Economic Development Secretariat of the Government of the State accounts for a total investment of 17,280 billion per year, mainly recorded by companies in the third sector.
Let's do this.
In view of the economic contract scenario, in July the Government of the State requested the approval of a 3 billion peso credit for investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, with a view to reactivate the economy, the approval of the State Congress was 2,600 billion pesos and until November no profit was observed in any sector of the State economy.
Reactions
For representatives of the patron sector, the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdés shows a lack of government management capacity.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chamber of the Transformation Industry, said that in 2011 there was no harmonization of the wills of the various sectors, including the Government of the State.
"The performance of Sinaloa's economy during this year has been really very poor, we have to work hard to recover the land that we lost this year, in 2012 we have to double our efforts, we have to align the effort of all and, above all, the well-synchronized course of this new government team, we hope that next year will be much better," he said.
Economie
Loredo López said that events such as early-year ice creams have kept the economy of the state and have reduced its performance and growth.
"The low economic flow is produced from several events, including ice creams, one of the main effects was a slow economy that didn't turn fast enough to generate an economic dynamic that allows for an acceptable level of flow in the processes, products and services, and therefore, at the end of the year, we will close a lot below what we expected," he said.
Redefine the vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Mexican Confederation of Sinaloa, stated that the state is being channelled towards more dynamic productive activities.
"In general terms we have observed that work has been done, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term programme that redefines the vocation and economic direction of the State, because it is important to detach all the potential of the material and human resources of Sinaloa," he said.
Much to be done
The President of Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision for the future that better channels Government's efforts.
"In general terms, I would say that the Government has made efforts to deliver good results in various areas, but there is some progress in economic development, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown progress in the way in which public policy is managed.
"There are elements that allow us to say that the Government is more inclusive, what I can say is that much work has been done and the Government is aware that there is still much to be done," he said.
Condemned for 8 kilos of marijuana
A person living in Novolato was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days of fine for holding eight kilos of marijuana.
The General Parquet of the Republic reported that the convicted small trader is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for a crime against health, in its version of marijuana possession for sale.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by agents of the Mexican Army on 7 June 2010 during a surveillance operation on Cipriano Valdez Street, in front of number 80 at El Castillo, Navolato.
The small trafficker ran in a pick-up truck, white, in which he carried a black bag in the vehicle's trunk and on the co-pilot's seat a small back bag where the soldiers found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the confiscated elements have been made available to the Second District Judge and the convicted person is still in the Centre for the Enforcement of Legal Consequences of Offenders.
Loans to contributions to books
Social literature in programs such as Habitat, Space Rescue and 3x1 para migrants may not be finished where there are serious delays due to lack of economic resources, Miguel Ángel López Miranda reported.
The Director of Social Development indicated that even though construction programmes have so far progressed, they are in a risk situation, as the Government of the State has not fulfilled its obligations to provide contributions exceeding 11 million pounds in the three programmes.
He noted that, in total, the investment of these three programmes is approximately 50 million pesos, of which the State must provide 25 per cent and only the Federation and the municipality have so far provided resources for the works, so there is a possibility of a delay in their completion.
"They must make a contribution of 12 million, and despite the fact that the year will soon end, they have given us nothing, even though since July they had to give us a share of it," he says, "and we, in order not to record any delays, started the works and we made a lot of progress, but we need money."
He mentioned that last year, during the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the State had not paid the corresponding contributions, so at the beginning of the administration the Municipality had to apply for a credit to cover the 7 million that the administration of the State had not provided on that occasion.
"We had already experienced this in the previous six-year period because the state had not had the economic capacity to participate and the programs continued to operate and this year, in order to have access to these programs, we had to obtain resources to cover what the state had not paid," he said.
Although there was a commitment by the State authorities to provide these resources, he stated that they had requested the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villareal, to activate the management so that the corresponding percentages could be reached as soon as possible.
"They must provide almost 12 million, and despite the fact that the year is about to end, they have given us nothing."
The valid court "the analogue cut" in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of analog signals by digitalists is one of the most important changes the world has ever experienced in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) has raised the constitutional controversy that the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies have voiced against the presidential decree that goes on from 2021 to 2015, because the eight votes required for the invalidity were not gathered.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his duties when he issued the decree detailing the actions to be taken to implement the transition to terrestrial digital television.
As a result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic was established for failing to reach the qualified majority by eight votes in order for the Court to decide on the constitutionality or non-constitutionality of the decree, and this continues to be in force.
The draft judgment, drawn up by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed the declaration of the decree as non-constitutional because the regulation on radio and television is a statutory assignment to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in violation of the principles of hierarchical subordination and reservations.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted in favour of the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the House of Deputies have promoted two constitutional disputes to challenge the decree and, by admitting the complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions envisaged by it for the digital transition.
The plenary meeting of Ministers also resolved to initiate the complaint made by the House of Deputies, without discussing the project to which Minister Sánchez Cordero is also responsible.
In his speech, the President said that he did not agree with the project's arguments, in the sense that the Federal Executive could not structure by general standards the measures for the public administration to prepare for it.
"I also consider that it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body," and he recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is the responsibility of the Federal Executive, who has for constitutional mandate the government's direction.
The replacement of analog signals by digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has experienced in recent years and this has resulted in better operation of the radio spectrum, better signal quality and more chains.
Adjourning the change, he said, would be adjourning the benefits of digitalisation which involves a decision of public interest which is not only of a technical dimension, "because it also includes economic, social, political and national security issues".
These issues, he stressed, "requires the operation of a system established in accordance with the principle of economic direction of the State, encompassing a group of tasks conferred by the Constitution on the Executive of the State".
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world had already completed the digital transition and had done so through the Executive, despite the fact that they had highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, by issuing the contested decree, has in one way invaded the sphere of competence of Congress, because in the administrative sphere it ensures compliance with the laws issued by the Legislative Act.
An analysis of the possibility of a "vote by vote" count in Michoacán
According to PREP, the difference between the first and second seats of the governor's election is only 27 per cent, even without counting the votes of 879 out of the 6 thousand 74 total verbatim records.
The option of "vote by vote" is a reality with regard to the electoral process this year in Michoacán, where according to the data highlighted by the Preliminary Electoral Results (PREP) Program, the difference between the first and second seats of the governor's election is only 27 per cent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 out of the 6 thousand 74 total votes.
In this regard, the President of the General Council of the Michoacán Electoral Institute (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llandral Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, last November 9, the electoral body approved a series of guidelines to harmonise local standards to federal electoral reform.
It will be recalled that Michoacán has not approved either his Constitution or his Electoral Code of State or his Electoral Justice Act, at the same time that the Congress of State approved the reforms shortly before the end of the legal period so that this electoral process can enter into force and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel has failed to publish it within the time limits provided for by the Law of the Official Journal of the State, with the argument that he had some objections.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional dispute promoted by the Local Legislative Power and qualified as "invalid and illegal" the vote of the State Representative for Constitutional Reforms, because he did not have the right to "sanction or challenge them".
Interviewed on the possibility of "vote by vote", María de los Ángeles Llenderal said that through the approval of the relevant guidelines by the General Council of the EMI, partial and total counting of votes by the local electoral body would be possible.
Thus, the partial counting of votes, of one or more electoral packages, may be that: the results of verbatim records do not coincide; there is no record of vote and there is no record of vote in the urn file at the chairman of the poll; or there are obvious errors or alterations in verbatim records.
In addition, the total deduction of votes received in all polling stations may be made when there is an indication that the difference between the alleged candidate in the respective election and the candidate in the second ballot is equal to or below a percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the session there is an express petition by the party representative and/or coalition who submitted the second of the candidates reported.
The total counting of the vote may also be made if at the end of the common counting it follows that the difference between the candidate alleged to be winning and that of the second place is equal to or less than a percentage point, provided that there is an express request from the representative of the political party to which the candidate is issued, in which case the electoral packages which have been the subject of the partial counting shall be excluded.
It should be noted that this is the situation of Morelia's election, where according to the PEP, the difference between the first and second seats is only 0.16 per cent, even without counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total verbatim records.
His Last Will
His ashes will be scattered in the Serra of Zapalinamé, as confirmed by the family.
The rest of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés will arrive at Saltillo, his hometown, this Sunday night, and on Monday people will present their tributes and there will be a rest.
According to his family, the last will of the Lieutenant-Colonel was to spread his ashes in the Serra of Zapalinamé.
After receiving the honors of the other people to die in the accident, the family of Bacio Cortés returned to the capital of Coahuila on board an aircraft from the Mexican Air Force, the closest attended the ceremony at Campo Marte.
In the afternoon, Lieutenant-Colonel's ashes arrived at the watchroom of the Nazario Ortiz Garza Boulevard, where the family and friends went.
At 17:30 a.m., he was honoured at the Saltillo Institute of Technology organized by his former technological baccalaureate colleagues and the American football team, part of which was Felipe Bacio, when he was preparing for the baccalaureate.
"He would like to go back to Saltillo and spread his ashes in the Serra of Zapalinamé, he has always said this to his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, sister of the pilot.
For her, the Lieutenant-Colonel had realized all his dreams, she felt that he was in the fullness of his life, "he had success, he was a father and son, extraordinary, a loving brother and cared for a lot of his family".
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the city of Saltillo very young to register at the Air College in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some couldn't believe it, because they said he even had a bad truck; but he always followed his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Davila Bacio remembers that he was a very good person, "when he was in Saltillo the whole family wanted to greet him, as it was the occasion when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo".
The young man even remembers that when he was 7 years old he traveled to Zapopán for his parents' graduation, so he knows that his uncle is dead by doing what he loved most in life: flying an airplane.
Last time I said goodbye
It was with honour that the Governor Jorge Torres López, presented by the people and the Government of the State, the Mexican Army, through the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force, the directors and students of the Saltillo Institute of Technology, was honored by the Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force. He studied in 1985 and was distinguished in both studies and sports.
Bacio Cortés died recently when the helicopter he was flying broke up alongside the Secretary of Government, José Francisco Blake Mora and six others, all officials of this service.
The rest of the pilot Bacio Cortés born in Saltillo arrived (incinerated) at 18:05 to be handed over by the funeral to the members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, on the group's schedule, where he was expected by his family, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, his brothers and other parents, students and teachers.
Three abandoned bodies, located in the property of Cadereyta NL
A few hours before being found, the military authority had presented to the media eleven persons who had been arrested in the same municipality for organized crime crimes.
Three men were found to be killed at gunshots fired in different parts of the body and with the beating of grace, in an abandoned property of the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The discovery took place at the 1.5 km road from Caderyta to Santiago, in the community known as El Castillo.
Some people who went through this place noticed that in the property, the closure of the beige color and coffee the portal was wide open.
By looking inside, at approximately three meters, they located the bodies of three persons, which is why they immediately informed the corresponding authorities.
One of the individuals wore a yellow T-shirt with dark jeans, without shoes; on his side there was another one with a white T-shirt, with bracelets.
At one metre away there was the body of another individual with a red T-shirt and blue color jeans.
The three were spread over the abdomen.
According to in situ data, the three persons had been murdered elsewhere, as no pain was found in situ.
In the closure of the property there were legends addressed by a group of organized crime to each other, except for some dance watches in this one and the portal.
11 captured in Cadereyta
The Secretary of National Defence introduced 11 persons, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group operating primarily in the municipality of Cadereyta and who were considered to have relations with kidnappings, murders, "halconeo" (monitoring) and clandestine inhumations.
According to the information published, eight persons were arrested in the Los Alveros colony in the first place on 11 November and one was rescued from imprisonment.
They were confiscated three buildings and a cell phone; they claimed they were part of the criminal group called "Los Zetas".
Another fact that took place on 12 November at 06:00, military personnel took a surveillance course in Rancho Viejo, Cadereyta, by detecting a car without a registration plate with two subjects on board.
By stopping them and carrying out an inspection, the soldiers found a long weapon, a charger and 18 cartridges.
Later and after these statements, on 13 November at 2 p.m. one of his accomplices was arrested in La Frauda, when he tried to escape by seeing the soldiers.
They are attributed to clandestine inhalations in the municipalities of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday
The Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put this country on board the economic disaster.
The Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy on Wednesday to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on board the economic disaster and has put the whole of the euro area at risk.
A communiqué from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, would meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he could form the Government.
It is expected that he will present a cabinet composed in his majority by technocrats, even if it is not clear when the new executive will take up his position.
Monti said he was going to present to the president the result of his talks with the political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," said the former European Commissioner to journalists.
Monti did not explicitly say that he could form a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles had been overcome.
The "frame is now well drawn", he added.
Monti completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, in a shorter time than usual, while Italy was fighting a political and financial crisis that has led to the cost of its debt at impossible levels to support.
The new administration led by former European Commissioner Monti must approve a strong austerity package required by European leaders to regain the trust in Italy that had been affected.
Stressing the pressure on Monti to accelerate, the instability of the markets to place the performance of the Italian BTP obligations to over 10 years above 7 per cent, the level at which Greece and Ireland had to be saved.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the Italian patronate Confindustria, told the media after her meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government very much."
We believe that this Government is the last opportunity for Italy to get out of this emergency situation.
Monti's success prospects were greatly stimulated by the support of Silvio Berlusconi's PDL party, which forced the crisis to resign last Saturday.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts will have a good result," Angelino Alfano, the secretary of the centre-right party, told the press.
The support of PDL, the largest Italian party, is significant because so far many of its members have opposed the Government of a technological majority that Monti forms.
Parliamentary support
The new government of Monti must have strong parliamentary support to implement what is likely to be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blockade or delay in its efforts could lead to a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks added to the pressure by observing that Monti's failure would be a disaster.
Monti started consultations with political parties, trade unions and employers' groups and youth and women's organizations on Monday.
He will finish his round of meetings Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed by Napolitano on Sunday, which allowed an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief review at the end of last week, when it was clear that Berlusconi was going to resign, the costs of Italian debt have now come to critical levels between the uncertainty about the success of the new prime minister.
Saving Italy, with a public debt of EUR 1.9 billion, would be too much for the current financial defences of the Eurozone.
Monti said that his Government should continue until the upcoming elections, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians would only give him time to implement the reforms before the elections are advanced.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist that he should be trained only by specialists, an indication of their objections to a process forced by financial pressure.
Political sources have reported that mutual mistrust and disagreements between the parties complicate the attempt to include political figures.
The Spanish experience is higher than that of the Costa Ricans
Of the 22 footballers called from Spain, ten participated in more than 50 international games.
On the part of Costa Rica, only one in 22 assembled attended 50 meetings.
An enormous contrast to Costa Rica's, if you compare the 22 called by the two countries for today's amicale at 3:05 p.m. at the San José National Stadium.
While national and European champions, the number one of FIFA's monthly rankings, account for a wide record of Class A inter-selective games, the Tricolore has only Michael Humana as the only defender to have the 50 international matches.
This figure was reached on Friday in the match against Panama (0-2) on Rommel Fernández.
Spanish footballers who play in the League of Stars and in the powerful clubs of the First League of England maintain an intense year-long activity in national league and cutting championships and European matches such as the Champions League.
To this end, experience with Furia Espanola must be added during the complex eliminations of the European Cup and the World Football.
Costa Rican footballers, on the other hand, have limited international experience in an area, such as Concacaf, which is considered to be a lower level in FIFA.
We see that the largest record of the Spanish Selection is that of the goal guard Iker Casillas, who last Saturday against England (defence 0-1 in London) compared the record of the former goal guard Andoni Zubizarreta with 126 international meetings.
Casillas will play against the Tricolor today and they will impose a new record for Spain, of 120 international games.
Xavi Hernández, Barcelona's brain robot, at 106.
Casillas and Xavi were even recognized last week by UEFA next to the other hundreds of the Iberian team, Zubizarreta mentioned above with 126 and the pre-centre of Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
The centenary loan is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
It is followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Inesta, with 62; Cesc Fabregas, with 61 and David Silva, with 53.
On the Costa Rican side, and close to Michael Umana are the left side of Junior Díaz, with 48 presences and the Bryan Ruiz butter, with 45.
After that, only five games exceeded 30: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The least.
With more than 30 presentations in Spain there are Gerard Pique (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Alvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 presences, Roy Miller appears with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest doesn't even reach 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson do not begin yet.
The historic Butter of Spain is David Villa, with 50 flies, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one who records the most, with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto included the country in its tour to celebrate two decades of trekking
"Going to Costa Rica is a dream that has become a reality"
In the exclusive interview with Viva, Bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam said the group is ready to offer one of its best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
They have been waiting for more than 20 years, but the group assures them that it will also become a dream for them to happen in that country.
It is that the bassist and founder member Jeff Ament assured, speaking exclusively with Viva, from Brazil, last week.
The group is located in the South American wing of its two-decade celebration tour and Sunday 20 will make its only stage in Central America.
This day will be presented at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 a.m., next to the Los Angeles The X group and the Las Robertas Nationals.
This is an extract from the conversation, whose full transcription is located in La Naziono on the Internet.
For his Costa Rican fans, the fact that Pearl Jam will happen in Costa Rica is a dream that has become a reality. Are you aware of what your fans are living?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream that has become a reality for us too.
This is our second time in South and Central America and has so far been great.
I spent only once vacations in Costa Rica; it's such a beautiful country and I think we can spend a few days there.
So we're so excited to bring our music there.
I ask you, because there is a kind of devotion to the group, fans live with intensity the previous days.
What is your message for your more fierce fans?
Thank you for staying with us all these years.
It took 21 years to get to Costa Rica; thank you for waiting so long and we're sorry that so much time had to pass up this concert.
Some people already say that his concert is the biggest show of the year.
Does this add some pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we have offered over the past 21 years have taken place in the last two weeks.
We offered two giant shows in Sao Paolo and we hope this has shaped us for this concert in Costa Rica.
We are really very eager to produce it.
We love this country, we love surfing and jungle; for both things, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you find Costa Rica and its surf waves?
We have a lot of surfing friends and I have a very good friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves are incredible there.
My friends always went surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, next to Mexico, are great places to surf; that's how we learned it, through people who love surfing.
When you saw the tour, you offered huge shows, with many songs.
What did you plan to do for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we have never been produced there, we have no restriction on what we can do.
We will try to do the best possible show, with a wide variety of songs; we will try to interpret two songs from each album and offer our fans a good and diverse directory.
You never repeat the directory.
What's that got to do with?
I think it's partly because we have nine discs and we can interpret more than 120 songs and each loves different songs, that's why it's very difficult to choose which songs to interpret every evening.
When we have two or three songs in the directory that we have not interpreted for a long time, it helps us to stay focused and surprise us because it reminds us of the reasons why we love these songs and that we may have forgotten them.
This makes the show more interesting for us and therefore I think it becomes more interesting for people as well.
With this tour, you will celebrate 20 years of trekking.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything you've done?
Yes, absolutely.
First of all, I think none of us had imagined that we were going to form a large rock group, and the fact that we did it for more than 20 years made it seem like a dream.
We continue to tell of our blessings and the fact that we can continue to make music together makes us very excited.
We love and love to create music.
We're lucky to go to places in the world we've always wanted to go to.
Things couldn't go any better for us.
What does it mean for you to have been a fundamental element in the creation of the crane?
It has always been an honor for us to be part of this large group.
We are very friendly with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It's surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends and is not common.
From time to time, a group emerges from a city, but it is much more strange when five or ten groups come out at the same time from the same city.
We are proud and it is an honor for us to be part of the Seattle Group.
We're still playing with some of them from time to time.
Last year we participated in a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw in Soundgarden in their tour, so we're lucky to be still friends with them and it's an honor for us to be part of this sound from Seattle that came up.
It's as strange as a group like yours stays united and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us were together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, and only this is much more time than many groups normally last.
First of all, I believe that we are all able to be alive and, secondly, we are all concerned about others.
We are all close friends and thanks to this there are musical boulevards that give everyone the freedom to experience.
We have confidence in each other with each other's music and that could not go any better.
Your relationship with the word celebrity has not been easy; however, thanks to your success, you have been able to do what you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we grew up, it was easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure that we don't spend too much time on tour because it's easy to fall into this game of great crowds and people who love your music.
If we do not forget that people are here for music, this helps us not to forget that we have to respect music and what it has brought, without taking into account the fact that we are famous and a rock star, which does not really interest any of us.
How do you remember your other project, Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote good songs and at the beginning it was great.
We were a group for almost three years and we didn't publish a record before Andrew Woods died.
There were many frustrations because it lasted so little and most importantly is that we are still very friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started in the group with us and when I hear a song or I see a photo I think of the incredible person Andy was and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to work, laugh, talk about music, football and many other things with him.
He was a surprising human being and we missed him.
The Las Robertas National Group will open the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know his work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose him for the opening?
Yes, production sent us videos with various proposals and that was the group we loved the most, so we are eager to see what Las Robertas can offer online and that must be very distracting.
Why do you always change the words of Yello Ledbetter online?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He's the one who sings and I think he does it with the first words he imagines.
As a bassist, what are his influences?
There's been a lot of...
Among the first ones I remember there is Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many influences that I could talk all afternoon about the bassists I love.
How has Pearl Jam been able to keep it under control despite the fact that he is no longer in fashion?
I think we all feel a little disconnected from the grunge word.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the groups that I have just mentioned, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all those that have emerged at the same time and, if this is relevant now, I think it's wonderful because it's a music that is worth listening to and the groups like Mudhoney are now doing the best music than ever.
At first, his music had a darker content and now it has become more positive.
What is the result of this change?
It's interesting, because I think there are songs in the new album that seem lighter, but there are also songs, such as The End or Just Breathe that are described as very obscure songs, even though they may sound a little positive.
With both of them, when Ed played them for me, I cried when I listened to them and these are deeply obscure songs.
I think if you're older and there's a traumatism in your life and you lose a parent or a friend, these things start to affect your art and your music and these songs certainly represent this for me.
I also think that we can also be happy and even as we can make music dark.
Peru:
Fujimori hospitalized again for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized in a public hospital on Tuesday to be evaluated for the loss of muscle strength he presents in his feet, informed his family doctor.
Fujimori, 72 years old, who is serving 25 years in prison for human rights violations committed during his government (1990-2000), suffers from various conditions, including language cancer for which he has been operated four times and is under control.
Congressor Alejandro Aguinaga, his personal physician, told Canal N of television that Fujimori would be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the cause of pain and loss of strength in its lower members.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate for the benefit of the sentence for humanitarian reasons, he no doubt said that he did not want it because he felt innocent.
It was operated four times by language cancer, it has a weight loss of 18 kg, and other pathologies, such as severe erosive gastritis, a pancreas cyst, kidney calculations, arterial hypertension and foot traffic problems, have listed the doctor.
Fujimori has since September 2007 entered the National Police Special Operations Directorate.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 persons due to a squadron of the army that had operated clandestinely during the first years of his government.
Mujica travel to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official court, headed by the Uruguayan President José Mujica, and formed by various ministers and employers, will launch a visit to Mexico this Tuesday to expand trade between the two nations and address the political themes of the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with her Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, the highest point of a long agenda of meetings with the political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the community of Uruguayan residents in Mexico, according to the agenda issued by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents in Guadalajara will be "proposal for the exchange of information in political affairs between the two nations", according to the information published by the Presidency of the South American country on its website.
According to local media, Mujica seeks to convince Calderón to support Uruguay in the incident with France, which took place when French ambassador Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country on the list of tax havens, at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community the countries that continue to be tax havens, a statement that triggered Uruguay's rejection and the call for consultations of its ambassador from this European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November, a group of the world's stronger emerging and developed countries, and has been in force with the South American country since January this year a convention to exchange tax information to avoid double taxation.
In recent years, the Government of Uruguay has tried to speed up the implementation of tax exchange agreements to get out of the "grey list" of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), integrated by countries that do not implement all international tax cooperation standards.
On a commercial level, Mexico and Uruguay have since 2004 entered into a Free Trade Treaty (TLC), which has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The moustachu lead passes to the three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario struggled, tireless, for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the grips of wicked Bowser, but he had never done it in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he would fight for the love of the young in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which comes this month to shops around the world, was designed from the beginning to exploit the features of the Nintendo 3DS mobile console, which allows you to play in three dimensions without using glasses.
"Mario is the character that must say how stereoscopy should work without glasses," said Nintendo's press officer in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Alvarez indicated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first video game of Nintendo originally designed for this support", because so far success such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" was adaptations of existing titles.
Nintendo's spokesman argued that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "accessible" video game that allows a fast and fluid part.
Álvarez said "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to hook the least skilled users.
Once it's over, the most experts will be able to make a "second round" at the game levels, which this time are more difficult.
In addition, users will be able to choose in real time between an "aggressive" D or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it would be necessary to play in three dimensions in order to overcome the different challenges and "success to optical illusions".
This Super Mario incursion into the three dimensions also implies the return of the character to a mobile console, which has not happened since 2005.
In these video games Nintendo makes an eyeliner for saga fans and repeats the formula of success of previous games, which consists in the fact that the Moustachou plumber has to go through mined platforms to free Princess Peach.
Even though I find novelties in movements, environments, customs and enemies and also in Luigi's "playable" cases.
Colom's downgrading the extradition of Portillo to the United States
President Alvaro Colom announced last Tuesday that he had ordered the extradition of former governor Alfonso Portillo to respond to the United States for a 70 million US-dollar conspiracy.
Thus, the process for Guatemala to respond to the request of the northern country that demanded Portillo to judge it is over.
In a press conference, Colom stated that his decision was independent of the judiciary and executive authority, taking into account the fact that a court of first instance had already ordered his extradition.
He stated that during his mandate "he had not helped" in any judicial resolution and he had taught all the extraditions he had known.
Apart from Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will also be extradited for murder and serious injuries, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes will be extradited for drug trafficking.
What Colom did was an executive step after he had exhausted all the judicial and constitutional bodies to judge the former term of office in the 2004-2004 period.
According to the resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Tribunal and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo should be extradited after having resolved his legal situation in Guatemala and having guaranteed his human rights.
Portillo was absolute for misappropriation of Q120 million funds in the Ministry of Defence when he was president, which was the trial that preceded extradition, but the Ministry of Public Appeal appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove helped 6,000 young people at risk
The entity was born to avoid the marginalization of young people without training
The review of the first 25 years of life of the Trinijove social support entity is important: 6,000 youth at risk of exclusion received help to overcome a difficult situation during this quarter of the century.
This is added to the long one-hundred jobs currently obtained by this social group.
The anniversary was used yesterday to balance in an act celebrated in a former industrial complex of Fabra i Coats, where more than 300 people attended.
Trinijove was born in the District of Trinidad Vella in 1986 with the aim of helping people who were not trained, without work, with problems of addiction or marginalization.
Yesterday's celebration in Sant Andreu has concentrated a large number of managers of entities and institutions who have worked with the association over the past 25 years.
The variety of political representation, in the full electoral season, showed the unitary nature of the work carried out by Trinijove.
In addition to the president of the Catalan Regional Government (Generalitat), Arthur Mas and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, the former Minister of Social Education, Ernest Maragall and former Deputy Mayor and current municipal councillor Richard Goma were present.
We are also attended in the grand hall of Fabra i Coats, the current Minister of Social and Family Welfare, Josep Lluís Cleries and the General Charity Director of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas said that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and the current one is the same, but he added that the work done so far "is a good base".
The President gave Trinijove an example of how to fight bad circumstances and hope for people in difficulty.
"The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work it does," he said.
Property evacuated by sprinklers for micro-fests, evacuated
The invaders were suitable for 11 of the 13 apartments in Balmes, 51
The 12 inhabitants left the property at noon yesterday without any resistance
It seems to indicate that the nightmare that the residents of Rue Balmes 51 lived was over.
Twelve people voluntarily left the building they were illegally occupied at noon, where they organized micro parties that would disappoint neighbors, by judicial order and without the need for police intervention.
At the end of the operation, the lock of the door was changed to prevent the situation from being repeated.
"From that day on there will be a control of access," said the administrator.
Squatters, who had invaded 11 of the 13 apartments in the building - the rest were inhabited - took up the electrical installation and part of the water, besides painting the walls and leaving waste of any kind, especially of alcoholic beverages.
The first three apartments were the scene of mass parties, which lasted up to two days and disappointed tenants.
Next to the building there is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which was also affected.
His owner, Maria Pantinat explained to Europa Press that after the building was occupied, his business dropped by 80%.
The owner of the discotheque mentioned that the invaders of the property made him of disloyal jurisdiction, because they sold the glasses to three euros, while in the discotheque they were worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the place of entertainment had to respond to the complaints of the neighbors about the noise, while according to this, the concerns were not caused by the discotheque customers, but by the residents of the occupied house and especially the participants in the parties organized there, which were more frequent and intense during the last weeks, according to the angry neighbors of the area.
The director of the discotheque explained that the nuisances were so great that she even entered into an agreement with the owner of the building and that it was nine months ago that he "forgives" the rent.
The Urban Guard (municipal police) has also confirmed that in recent weeks they have received more complaints from their neighbors about the situation.
The president of the municipal group of the mayor, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had asked last week "the immediate evacuation of the building to end the problems of life in common and civil life that it caused to residents and the degradation of the area".
The popular leader explained that only one floor of the building was occupied before summer, but in recent months the Scouts had occupied all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments and that there were also flights in some apartments.
It is in this sense that he added that "it must be done with impunity and be irreplaceable against the anti-social behaviour generated in property".
Yesterday, Mossos (the local Catalan police) evacuated a building in Nou Barris.
At 3.30 p.m., the police moved to Rue Mont-ral 35, after receiving the call from a neighbor who had noticed that four people were accessing the building.
The four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
Architects coincident on the opportunity of summoning beyond the debate on fees
The municipal competition on the 16 doors reopens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
Towards the mid-80s, in full view of the already extensive Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this Administration has printed a series of promotion posters from Collserola.
The brochure defined the mountain as the major park of the metropolitan Barcelona.
In addition, it also included a comparison, in figures, with the New York Central Park.
With the death of the CMB in 1987, the park became again, in the imagination of many people, the upper limit of Barcelona, the Catalan capital being the only one not oriented on the north-south axis, otherwise high (mountain) - low (mar).
The qualification of Collserola as a natural park is at the advantage of this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with bloodthirsty in the Yogi bear's role.
This was the situation until, in September, the mayor convened a mega-competence consisting of 16 competitions for all the doors of access to Collserola.
A door goes back to the idea of park, no doubt.
That's it, or someone wants to put doors in the field.
The question appeared alone: Collserola: park or mountain?
The competition, both with regard to his organization and with regard to the reflection on the city, is a topic of conversation of all Barcelona architects.
It is almost a recurring theme of which two members of this former caste speak when they recognize themselves in an elevator.
And this is just one of the few opinions that coincided with three architects from Barcelona, university professors, who presented themselves.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the competition is appropriate.
For Roldán, after considering the coastal front "it is necessary" to discuss "the front of the mountain" because the speech of Ildefons Cerda, that of the pies of green houses has not been completed.
"It must start from the base that Barcelona's widest park is the beach.
Among other things, for its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex," the architect gave the verdict for which the title of "Callserola doors" includes a "lexical trap": it should not be thought of these "as access to a park, but the delimitation of certain areas in which action must be taken".
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urban world, describes the proposal as "intellectual challenge" with "some dangers".
Dangers arising from "the uncertainty of the projection of the public space" after the experience experienced in the 1980s and that had been in the Forum area "song song".
The first fear is the very delimitation of the borders on which one can build.
"Limiting something means already establishing the next step," that is, its overstep.
"There is a need to think about new urban planning instruments, because the current [reference to the General Metropolitan Plan (GMP)] can cause real disasters."
By focusing more on the issue, Modol believes that by simplifying the El Valles de Collserola region "can be heard as a park, Barcelona's one, no."
Modol recalls that there is already a work done by the Collserola patronate that "should not be lost", thanking for the opportunity that the mayor offers his corporation to intervene in this project "from the very beginning".
In addition, he understands that the proximity of the mountain with the city is the only conduct that allows architects to enter into the debate, but "question" if this technical profile should lead the multidisciplinary teams ("all a success", he says) that we must create: "We architects should only be an instrument."
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that gives the title of this piece is complex, because the basis of the contest is missing a global view of Collserola: "We have convened 16 cross-sectional contests - it says - in the mountain-sea sense, but there is no longitudinal reading that leads and understands the area as a whole."
At least in this case, he chose to participate in the 16 competitions.
In another way, a project so that one of the doors can shock the program and define with that of the architect of the neighboring door.
In his opinion, yes, the mayor should ensure that the band is immediately superior to Ronda de Dalt's, in all its extension, to provide an area of equipment that makes a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonas Larrazábal and this one will be released
After 72 days of provisional arrest, the legal authority of the Casino Red granted forgiveness to the mayor of Monterrey for the trial initiated against him for alleged blackmails
After 72 years of arrest, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the founding of the legal authority of the Casino Red gives him forgiveness before the Second Criminal Court of the District, which follows a blackmail trial against the mayor's brother of Monterrey.
After the attack on the Royale Casino, the owner of the Red Casino, Sergio Gil García, published a series of photos and videos in which Manuel Jonás allegedly demanded payment of an economic quota so that the Mayor of Monterrey would allow the clandestine operation of the game house.
After the public denunciation, the Parquet opened a criminal trial against Major PANIST's brother, and on September 2, he was arrested and held in temporary detention for 30 days.
After four hours in front of the Department of Civil Liberties, he was transferred to the Detention Centre 1, located in the former Quarter of the capital of the State.
He remained there for the next 49 days when he was given a second detention order after the Department's agent had stopped the crimes of corruption and organized crime.
On October 19 he was transferred to the Cadereyta Penal Center, supposedly for having had the owners of the Red Casino sing with a million and a half pounds; but he spent only a few hours in the middle-security detention centre because there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to continue the trial in the municipal cells of San Nicolas de los Garza.
On 25 October, a warrant was issued by the Registrar of the Second Criminal Tribunal of the District, Jorge Yánez, who said that after almost two months of investigation, there was sufficient evidence to determine Jonah's guilt, such as that concerning the loss of 1.5 million pounds of the representatives of the game house in exchange for his operation.
On Monday, the foundation of the legal authority of the Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, was presented by Judge José Luis Pecina to seek forgiveness for the brother of the mayor of the region; therefore he could regain his freedom within the following hours.
During the legal proceedings, the Public Service agent attached to the Tribunal, Ramiro Arias, questioned García Gómez whether the damage had been recovered and who had been associated with the game house the one who had granted the pardon, but the lawyer tried not to communicate the name.
According to Case 197/2011, the legal pardon was granted to Jonas Larrazábal and no claim regarding the proceedings sought against him will be filed and no damages and no penalty will be sought.
After hearing the foundation of the legal power of the game house, at 3:50 p.m., the immediate freedom of Larrazabal Bretón was ordered.
The Registrar of the Tribunal, Jorge Yánez, moved to the prison of the municipality of San Nicolas de los Garza to communicate to Jonas that he had been legally forgiven and his file would be classified.
He shall also communicate to him the order of immediate liberty issued by the judge.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details of the air accident in which the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake and seven others lost their lives
The Communications and Transport Secretariat (SCT) reported that the results reported on the accident in which the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake Mora and seven others lost their lives, indicate that the helicopter hit the ground directly in complete structural integrity, without the pilot being able to try a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that prior to the take-off of the aircraft, the pilot found that the weather conditions were adequate to fly.
"The elements that seem to indicate that the unit had several contacts with the ground, the palate had contact with the trees at 25 meters where the unit had lost the firing."
It also informed that the unit was designed for 19 persons, so it met the requirements for the transport of personnel.
In addition, he said that research in the impact area did not report the appearance of parts on the ground.
"In a research it has been reported that there are no parts or components of the aircraft in another location, the impact has been structurally presented.
"The helicopter had been designed for 19 passengers and met the requirements to transport them.
The ground had a slope of seven to 30 degrees.
For the time being, the secretary has ensured that a priority is to have the results as soon as possible; but the investigation may take a few months, it may even take a year.
In turn, Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Auxiliary Airports and Services, ensured that the moment of impact, the helicopter of the Major Presidential State was operating at a speed of crossing and this happened on a rising ground.
"This information supports the assumption of normal operation crossing at the time of impact," he said.
During the press conference, the owner of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, listed six important elements in the investigation:
_Visibility unit:
According to aeronautical regulations, the flight was carried out according to visual flight rules, which implies that the crew must have visibility during flight and on the ground.
Meteorological conditions:
The reports in the IACM referred to adequate conditions for take-off, and as the aircraft moved to the border area between DF and the State of Mexico, there were low-height nebulosity layers.
Selected paths:
It is likely that because of the conditions of nebulosity, the crew has sought a lower and more visible area to the Cuernavaca valley.
Impact location.
The impact coordinates and the last recording of the aircraft on the radar coincidently, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or alteration of the flight path.
Dispersion of aircraft residues in a reduced area:
The information available so far suggests that the impact has occurred on a straight and lateral route.
The dispersal model of the rest of the aircraft assumes that the helicopter crashed against the ground under conditions of structural integrity.
No signs of fire or explosion were detected:
At the site of the disaster, there is always no trace in the rest of the aircraft of an explosion or fire.
The latest findings of the investigation indicate that the aircraft had had multiple contacts with the ground.
During the field work, aircraft parts were found at a height of 9 thousand 200 feet above the average sea level, and the ground had a slope ranging from seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which he possibly disarticled during his journey.
The information provides elements that appear to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts with the ground.
After a detailed research in a wider area than the surrounding area, there were no dispersal parts of the aircraft, bearing the presumption that the impact had taken place under conditions of structural integrity.
MSS announces protocol to find the gene of obesity
Social insurance conducts an investigation to discover the gene of obesity in children and young people; this is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute for Social Insurance (IMSS) has announced that it is conducting an investigation to discover the gene of obesity in children and young people, called the "Genetic Protocol on Child and Teen Obsessiveness", which will allow you to have markers associated with overweight.
In a communiqué, the head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry of the Specialities Hospital of the National Medical Centre of the 20th century, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team of physicians, nurses, nutritionists and social assistants had been formed.
This team is supported by third-cycle specialists and students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Advanced Research and Studies Centre (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
In the investigation, it is called upon to participate in the population with or without the right to participate in the IMSS participating sports units in Valle de México, where evidence is provided to minors every Saturday from 8:00 a.m.
He stressed that the protocol began in the Cuauthémoc Sports Unit (Estado de México Poniente) and that from 8 October, the activity took place in the Sports Unit of Nezahualcoyolt (Estado de México Oriente).
After reaching the goal of gathering 500 or 600 minors, the study will continue in the Sports Unit Independent (South of Federal District) and finally in the Sports Unit Morelos (North of Federal District).
He explained that the purpose of this research and the purpose of this research was to identify the components and importance of genetics in terms of the development of obesity and to identify risk factors for children and young Mexicans to prevent chronic degenerative diseases.
As World Diabetes Day will be held on 14 November, he mentioned that the goal is to bring together three thousand children and young people between six and 14 years of age, with the consent and under the supervision of their parents, for the application of specific food-related questionnaires.
They will also be asked about their physical activity and family history of their disease, to avoid risk factors that trigger diseases such as diabetes or renal insufficiency.
It detailed that on Saturday all participants in anthropometric measurements (weight, size, circumference of the size), blood pressure, determination of glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin and genetics (it is sought to identify people associated with child obesity).
Cruz López noted that this investigation is the result of health professionals' concern about the alarming weighting in the case of minors.
'The 1999 and 2006 health surveys indicated that in just six years there was a 77 per cent increase in obesity in boys and in girls of 47 per cent; there was also a dramatic increase in overweight,' said IMSS specialist.
He indicated that the justification for the search for markers was based on the fact that the population of the country was different from others in its genetic history.
He reported that on average, Mexicans have 65 per cent of Indo-American heritage, 30 per cent European and 5 per cent African, and this condition is reflected in people associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that, in general, the genetics of obesity translate into the inability to burn the excess energy consumed (calories), which is deposited in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for participants is the full assessment of children, which enables them to detect whether they are overweight or obese.
It even says that the presence of more dark colors (acanthosis) on the neck and front arms indicates the probability of suffering metabolic and even pre-diabetic changes.
The information is managed in a confidential manner, the doctors return it in writing to parents, to whom each of the measures and changes in the lifestyle they have to make to prevent diseases.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic conditions: sedentaryism, which is the lack of daily physical activity, remain the majority of the day sitting in front of the TV and use means of transport instead of walking on short distances.
Another cause is the high caloric input, i.e. the largest consumption of sugar drinks, carbohydrates of carbon (tamales - meat paste to maize flour wrapped in corn leaves - bread, pizza, burgers, etc.) with a high content of fats and proteins and the genetics analyzed in this protocol.
UNAM's asphalt would avoid cassis
Rafael Herrera, a researcher at the UNAM Chemicals Faculty, develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with better performance, regardless of environmental and temperature conditions
If the signals that the pave were resolved, it would no longer be necessary to repair about 200 thousand cases each rainy season in the Metropolitan Zone of the Valley of Mexico, warned Rafael Herrera Nájera, a researcher at the UNAM Faculty of Chemistry (FQ), who ensured that if the process of construction and maintenance of the bituminous pave is adequate, the cassis could be reduced or even eliminated completely.
During his conference A technological opinion on cassis, organized within the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that his laboratory is responsible for developing modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance, both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera estimated that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, such as some cities in the north, to improve performance, and therefore the formation of cassis.
He explained that the asphalt, the heavier part of the oil, is a set of hydrocarbons molecules, molecules with a heavier molecular weight, called asphaltenes, and molecules with a low molecular weight, called maltenes, which together give the spider its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behaviour of the asphalt is that at high temperatures, near 180 degrees, it behaves as a liquid, at 120 degrees C its viscosity is very large and at 50 degrees C it presents an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes breaking, it adds.
This means that in the streets the resistance of the asphalt is not uniform and changes during the day according to environmental and temperature conditions, the chemical engineering specialist warns.
The FQ researcher observed that the streets of Ciudad de México in most of them were covered by a flexible paving consisting of six layers of materials, the last three of which involve asphalt.
Among the more superficial layers is the asphalt layer, consisting of small stones bathed in asphalt and later compacted.
Each of the small stones that form the layer, it signals, is bathed an asphalt.
When vehicles pass through it by generating efforts, it allows the forces to spread very well in the paving.
If there was a modified asphalt, these would be better spread, i.e. the chemical engineer.
On the asphalt layer, he says, we put a last layer called the asphalt layer, made of fine stone, that is, sand which is also bathed in asphalt.
As this layer is in contact with the wheels of the vehicles, it must have more mechanical strength than the asphalt layer and provide adhesion in the street.
Being the part of the paving that receives and distributes the effort, the working layer also requires that it has adequate thickness and the material it is made must be treated.
The climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, is also a very important factor to consider, especially water, because they significantly affect the performance of the asphalt layer.
When the soil wets, the water spreads within the layer it is difficult for it to be so, which is how it melts all layers of the paving and therefore causes cassis.
In the process of training a case, he says, the first to fail is the motion film and only later the asphalt layer is affected, but the damage did not take place immediately, but it is a process that must be treated to the first signals with adequate maintenance programs.
The member of the National System of Researchers explained that the load of vehicles is another important factor for the training of caseis and therefore the thickness of each layer of the paving must always be linked to the load of vehicles and ensure its satisfaction, in order to avoid frequent training of caseis.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still much to investigate and work on asphalt, for example bitumen emulsions, which in other countries already exist on the market and allow for the repair of cases easily and without having to use high temperatures.
What did Valle's candidate miss to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that made Melina Ramírez Serna not get the crown of Miss Colombia.
Valle receives her title number 14 of the princess.
Once again Valle del Cauca remained with the desire to win Miss Colombia's crown.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to be content with being on the winner's podium, wearing the crown of silver and the band that accredited him as a new princess of Colombia.
With the result of yesterday evening in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico is mounted with the crown and the sceptre, the department already has 14 titles of Princess and Melina joins a legion of women from Valle del Cauca who are near the crown but have been proclaimed princesses, including Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellina Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blance (1988), Monica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
Today the great question that many people ask is:
What was missing? Because the result is the failure of a great favor that in each presentation showed that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, because she had not been elected in vain Queen of the Police and Best Visage Jolie de Vogue, the titles obtained by Queens Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who took the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor considered key in the decision made by the jury to design the First Princess is that she did not convince you with her answer to the question "?What was the book that marked you and why? asked by Martín Murillo Gómez of the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
Here's the answer from Valle's candidate to this question:
"I read a lot, I think enough in literature, I think it's a form of culturalizing, I definitely think that the book that marked my childhood is "The Little Prince", it's a pretty deep book.
Now I read "Crime and Punishment", it's a universal literature book that we should all read; and now I read the book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a very beautiful book called "The Burning of Blood".
This answer was not pleased at first because of the term "culturalize" and secondly because it did not specifically explain how each book had marked it.
But at the end of the Melina ceremony she said she felt calm and happy with the result "the universe and wisdom, it happens what must happen.
And for everyone, please read a little, "The Little Prince" is a great book"
Among the assumptions launched there is the one that Valle was destroyed by favoriteism.
A journalist from Bogota said that being the favorite, the ovation and the candidate who received all the preliminary prizes (Oster gastronomy challenge, the public's vote for the best craft costume, and Queen Mother), "it aroused the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen and for that she did not shine on the stage".
And this was noted in his first performance in a bathrobe on the Hilton beach and his two performances from the Crown Guard.
Although she was sure of herself at the two shows, it was noted that she did not have the strength and energy of Magdalena and Atlántico representatives.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist at the program "Como en casa" (As at home), of the Canal RCN said that the fact that Melina was appointed princess "confirms that the candidate who receives most of the prizes during the contest does not receive the crown queen".
In addition, Valle avoided the press at the end, and that was a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury of its interest in social initiatives, which is in fact the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
That is why two days before the election, the international jury Lucy Doughty said that they were looking for a woman engaged in the social needs of her country.
"Only beauty is not enough in a Miss Colombia, we need to look beyond the physics and focus on its social sensitivity, that before the competition starts, they are already involved in projects," she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle has sinned by his faults in his back and fibrosis that was observed in his abdomen, but this is contradictory, because precisely the jury has chosen him as the candidate 'Natural Beauty' with the healthier body, good food and responsible physical work.
Queens' preparer Jorge Hernán Orozco acknowledged that Melina did not have the best body, that there was better, "but her problem of fibrosis on the abdomen, which was actually not too familiar to me, left her points the last day."
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of the Cromos magazine considers that the error of the Valle candidate was the surgical interventions she had taken.
"The surgeons are good, but Valle couldn't do them.
His body was never his asset and she lost it because of this aspect."
For this price, which the National Beauty Competition gives for the first time, after the parade in the bathrobe came up a cruel prediction that took place last night, it was said that it was a small gift that Raymundo made to Melina so as not to give him the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that Melina today begins a year of reign, not as a sovereign, but as a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions by appointment of the National Competition.
However, she will pass through history as one of the queens who, despite her bluffing passage through Cartagena, did not get the crown.
So was the work of Cali's person who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A touchyloscopist from Cali was passed on to history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano'.
The work of these officials is crucial.
Last November 4 a Dactyloscope of the Cali ITC passed to history as the person who confirmed the identity of the Supreme Chief of Farc: "Alfonso Cano", confronting his digital prints.
Seven dactyloscopes working in the local ITC offices this week were the "availability" tour of Eliaszar González, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working for 21 years in the field of judicial investigation.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in the municipalities of Chocó, where he often had to spend more than five days in the forest to get to the place where the bodies were to be identified.
In 2000 he moved to Valle's capital and after having attended appropriate courses, he specialized in dactyloscope, which is the study of friction skin, i.e. paupes and feet.
During the week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano, Eleazar was warned to take clothes with him for at least three days.
Something really big was waiting for him.
On Friday night he left for Cauca in a Palmira helicopter.
He knew that he had to identify two bodies and that one of them was suspected of being the man who led the oldest guerrilla in the world, so he was asked to take the map with the ten digital prints of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
But when he arrived with the investigation team at the place of the body, he did not recognize it by his physical appearance, because it was very different from what he had seen in the media.
He had no beard, he was dressed as a farmer in the area, with no glasses and much more thinner.
But the prints don't lie.
Accompanied by a Galtonian wolf, an encre, a kidnapper and a lantern, Eliezer compared the digital prints of the body to those of the map.
His eye did not deceive him; it was "Alfonso Cano".
That very night, the man from Puerto Tejada was responsible for confirming to the Minister of Defence, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that yes, he was the Supreme Chief of the Farc.
Looking for the print
For a touchyloscopist from Sijín de Cali, the recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos gave to Eliasar González at a press conference for the operation against "Cano" is very significant.
A lot of people didn't know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an accurate science, without mistake, which can be crucial in the crime resolution.
Apart from identifying the bodies, the dactyloscopes support investigations for crimes such as theft and murder and confirm the identity of the captured persons.
When captured, many offenders have false identity cards or no documents.
We take their digital prints and search the database.
The researcher found that in a case of flight he had to remove a part of a wall from a house, because in this place the thief had supported his hand to make out a chest full of jewelry and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not adequate surfaces to print a digital print, but in this case we were able to get the whole handprint and identify the offender who had participated in various flights," he recalls.
Prints may also remove or confirm suspects in cases of murder.
We recently found a dead man with drinking bottles around him.
Through the investigation, it was determined that a parent could be suspected of the crime and indeed a print on the bottle coincided.
Even if it doesn't guarantee that he's the killer, it puts him on the scene of the crime.
A ITC dactyloscope explained that "digital prints of objects with chemical or physical reactives" were extracted.
When they appear, a picker or a band is used to pick them up.
Later, the prints are sent to Asif, the trigger database, or to the National Civil Registry.
"The problem is that there are still a lot of paperless Colombians," said the ITC expert.
He explained that everything is not how it is shown in the CSI TV program.
As everything that shines isn't gold, everything we touch doesn't necessarily become a print.
However, it can be used if the necessary confrontation is achieved.
The "indigested" challenge the authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters were fighting in front of Zuccotti Square to camp there.
A large number of people have entered the evacuation order and moved to a nearby park.
The members of the Occupe Wall Street movement challenged the New York authorities this Tuesday by trying to re-enter, through a judicial order, in place of Manhattan, where they were evacuated in the open and when they tried to occupy another park of the Great Pompey.
Hundreds of protesters marched in front of Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to access a judicial order that allowed the 'innign' to camp again in this place, while the other part of the movement responded to the evacuation by occupying a park further north of the city, where there were new arrests.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp again in the place, we will settle in another place and we will continue the legal struggle to return to Zukotti, and through sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations," says one of the spokespersons of the movement "Obtain Wall Street", Mark Bray.
Bray explained that the response of the "insidious" to the evacuation of their camp, personally dictated by the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, came to the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting forced evacuation of the camp and allowed protesters to stay in the camp.
In addition, the 'indignant' occupied a new park located at the confluence of the Canal Street and the Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Dutch tunnel, which is owned by the Trinity Church Paris.
For at least an hour they managed to occupy the place, but after the police moved there and arrested some demonstrators, even though Bray was unable to confirm the specific figure, ensuring Ef Ef because he had seen some journalists who had also been killed.
The organization ensures that there are hundreds of people who have settled in that place, where a delegation of religious leaders has moved in support of the members of the movement and has tried to intervene in their behalf before the Police.
Meanwhile, the Zukotti place - which is a private property facility - remains closed pending the celebration of a judicial hearing scheduled this Tuesday during which the legality of the evacuation of this morning must be analysed.
Some demonstrators so far carried and distributed copies of this court order at that time and even delivered it to the officers who were monitoring the scene, which caused 'some small confrontations', said Bray, who denounced the fact that some officials had hit the demonstrators.
The judicial order prohibits the authorities from evacuating the members of Occupe Wall Street or from applying 'laws published after the beginning of the occupation or from prohibiting demonstrators from re-entry into the park with tents or other properties they used before'.
Major Bloomberg pointed out to the press that, because of this judicial order, the city had suspended the reopening of space to the public and protesters, but he warned them that local laws did not allow them to settle with tents and sleeping bags.
The City Councillor has personally defended the evacuation of the Abbe at Zucotti, an operation during which 200 persons were arrested and which was decided because the protesters 'violated the law'.
Bloomberg explained that he had ordered to evacuate the place because it became "a place where people came not to protest, but to violate the laws and in some cases to harm others" because "some shops had received threats" and residents were afraid "for their quality of life".
"The evacuation of this morning at dawn has been disgusting and shows that the Bloomberg fund is more interested in defending the financial interests than those of American workers," added the motion spokesperson, who accuses the mayor of "not respecting freedom of expression".
The leaders of "occupe Wall Street" also indicated that they do not intend to organize "great actions" for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and trade unions to commemorate the two months of protests, which began on 17 September.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas TV program
Next to Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, she will join the television program "It's Russell Peters Christmas" next December
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", rescuer in "Baywatch", lapin in "Playboy", wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a special program of Canadian television Christmas.
The private TV channel CTV today announced that Anderson, in addition to the "croner" (baladin) Michael Bubble and other famous Canadians, will be released into the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" next December, interpreting a very special Virgin Mary.
CTV has today distributed images of the television program in which Anderson, also known for the wide Internet circulation of a private porn video in which she appeared with her husband at that time, the drummer of "Mötley Crue", Tommy Lee, appeared dressed as the Virgin Mary by supporting a doll representing Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a famous Indian comedian who recently presented a part of Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth", appeared as Joseph.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, the special program of Noel de CTV also presents the Canadian singer Bublé, who at the end of March married the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires, which is not far from the controversy itself.
Bublé recently called American Kim Kardashian during one of his concerts in New York.
Japan resumed after the earthquake
GDP increases by 1.5% due to domestic consumption and ends the spiral of decline from the beginning of March
Since March, Japan's economy has been paralyzed, still ravaged after the devastating earthquake of the nuclear crisis, the worst disaster in the country since World War II.
The initial estimates of the Government of Tokyo have estimated material losses of $300 billion, which, despite the difficult global context, seems to have been reduced.
After three consecutive trimesters of falls, data from the Gross Domestic Product between July and September have been used to finally turn the page: GDP has increased 1.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter and 6 per cent at annual rates.
The registered second quarter - for the Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - assumes, in addition, the largest rate of increase since January to March 2010.
Recovery is partly due to the resumption of equipment acquisitions to restore the areas devastated by the earthquake and later tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investment by 1.1 per cent compared to the decrease of 0.9 per cent of the capital expenditure observed from January to March, the first decline after six months of uninterrupted growth.
However, the real stimulus of the Japanese economy is not based solely on the Keynesian impulse that invites you to benefit from the crisis to consolidate - or rebuild - infrastructures, to use deficiencies to grow zero.
Japan has woken up mainly because of the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable has increased by 1%, driven by increased expenditure on vehicles, travel and entertainment activities.
The emblem of the yen
Tokyo has entered the internal market when the Japanese currency - the yen - has become one of the "refugees" elected by the investors who have fled the debt crisis in the euro area and the unforeseeable forecasts of the United States, a privilege that weighs as a share in the accounts of the exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, products are more expensive abroad, a serious reverse for a country whose economic fleet line is determined by the health of large technological groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, were responsible for their weak results between July and September.
While the markets continue to sit in the EU's peripheral countries, the Yoshihiko Noda Government does not lose sight.
"The risks that persist, such as the deterioration of certain foreign economies, the impact of Thailand's floods and the rapid appreciation of the yen, must be monitored," said the State Secretary for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa, yesterday.
And indeed, the prospects are not entirely encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) noted that the majority of member countries had reported clear signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator that anticipates the global economy's inflation points has highlighted that the main powers are suspended.
Because he dropped four decimal places to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 in the fall.
The eurozone was even below the average, which is at level 100, falling from eight decimal places to 99.13 points.
Athens again feeds on doubts
Papadimos says the adjustments will be approved, but the conservators will not sign any written commitments
With the triggered peripheral risk premiums and the uncertainty re-installed in the parks, Greece continues to join the labyrinth which leads to the outcome of the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "consensus" of the new Hellenian Transitional Government is imposed by the requirements of Brussels rather than by a genuine conviction of the political forces begins to be confirmed by the facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, yesterday, said that there was no alternative to structural reforms and that the period of one hundred days established in his appointment could be short to apply, the leader of the Conservative Party of New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, would ensure that he was not going to support the new austerity measures in any case and reiterated his requirement for new elections for the scheduled date of February 19.
"The main task of this Government is to implement the decisions of the October 26th summit," Papadimos said when he opened yesterday a parliamentary debate that will end tomorrow with a vote of confidence for the new Executive.
A package of 24 programmes to stimulate employment, reform of the disciplinary code of officials and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, Samaras's message does not cast doubt on its position: "We are committed to helping the Transitional Government, but we are committed to nothing more."
The conservative leader went a little further into his chickens than the EU and the IMF, the agencies that need to unlock the 8,000 million Athens urgently needed, and clearly said that he would not approve any letter of commitment to implementing the adjustments.
But the European Commission, still upset by the impact of the entire Papandreou referendum, reiterated yesterday that its requirement is firm: it will not unlock the aid if the new government and leaders of the main Greek parties do not sign "a written commitment without ambiguity as soon as possible".
The spokesperson for Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that Troika inspectors would return to Athens "very quickly" to discuss with the new Government "the elements required to pay the sixth instalment" of 8,000 million, even if there was no final date.
The Greeks still have a lot to do.
Queen Sofia: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen underlines Spain's "preponderant" place in this type of finance
Spain "has reached a leading global place in the role of microfinance".
Queen Sofia recalled that in the last two decades the country has become the world's second donor in terms of this instrument of cooperation whose " essence" resides in the fact that it is "an instrument for social progress, justice and hope in a better future for all mankind, based on trust in human beings".
The Queen opened yesterday the V. Global Microcredit Summit in Valladolid with the assurance that "there is no doubt" that such operations are "absolutely indispensable" to achieve the United Nations Millennium Goals for 2015 and, "very particularly, in the one that aims to reduce to half the volume of people living with incomes under a dollar per day, to which the "poverty threshold" is fixed."
Spain "continues to work" to expand the network of beneficiaries "in all corners of the planet, and assumes this task with "responsibility", said Queen Sofia, who hoped that initiatives and contributions from the Summit, which will extend until Thursday, "will ensure the creation of new capacities and opportunities for the poorest and especially for women", the main beneficiaries of these loans.
We have "a lot of goals" and "we face many challenges".
The Microcredit Summit is considered not only as a forum for debate, but also as the platform from which "two basic goals" must be promoted.
Thus, His Majesty explained that the goal is that by the end of 2015 there are 175 million poor families who have access to these financial services and that 100 million of these families are out of the poverty line where they now live.
The impulse in the design of microcredit in Spain and the rest of the world "followed the path initiated a few years ago in a pioneer way" by Muhammad Yunus, highlighted Queen Sofia as a "act of justice and recognition due".
And she described the father of this instrument as "adorable idealist in the universal cause of the struggle against poverty", the work she had known 15 years ago when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to know her lending policy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "at each meeting I was able to see a continuous evolution," explained His Majesty, whose relationship with this project brought him yesterday the qualifying "family head" meeting in Valladolid on the part of "banking the poor".
Finally, Queen Sofia ended her speech by encouraging people present to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
"Ethic imperative"
The Foreign Minister, Trinidad Jiménez, warned that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for any democratic state.
In this regard, she pointed out that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to times of economic prosperity, since it is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez considered microcredit to be "a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to the eradication of poverty", and now "more than ever" the Governments of developed countries must work under solidarity criteria and not allow it to be the victim of compressions.
For Spain, microcredit is "one of the main lines of cooperation for development".
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, welcomed the "success" of giving "trust" to those "exclusive to whom everyone closes the door"; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed the people present in a city that "opens its contaminated doors with the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect the European President to universal suffrage
The first day of the Congress of the Christian-Democrat Union (CDU) on Monday, 14 November, in Leipzig, took place without real difficulty for Angela Merkel, chancellor but also president of the Christian-Democrat Party.
Europe's future was not initially planned for the programme, but was forced in the fall, particularly to satisfy militants who judge the government's policy too laxist towards the Greeks today and perhaps the Italians tomorrow.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the Management Board, was adopted in almost unanimous terms.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained.
The standing ovation of several minutes at which they were entitled, following their interventions, Angela Merkel then, a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, the very Europhile Minister of Finance, did not give way to doubt.
The idea of chancellery - and motion - lies in a slogan: the response to the crisis "is not less than Europe but more than Europe".
Not only because Europe is peace, but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
For the chancellor, "time has come from a passage in Europe".
This could result from amendments to the Treaty of Lisbon to strengthen the European Union's control over the budgetary policies of the euro area countries, but this could also result in the election of the President of the European Commission to universal suffrage "to give a face to Europe".
In any event, this is one of the motions adopted by the Congress, whose inspiration is obviously Wolfgang Schäuble.
Of course, it is unlikely that the Twenty-Septs agree quickly on this revolution: Britain is hostile to it and CDU leaders believe Nicolas Sarkozy is also hostile to it.
But the jalon is set.
Similarly, delegates rejected a tremendous majority of the proposal to weigh each country's weight to the European Central Bank's head according to the weight of each economy, which was, of course, again strengthening the weight of Germany.
The chancellor has increased the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but she has not sought to win her congress on the back of the "small" European countries or countries in difficulty to criticise the arrogant Germany.
If the motion on Europe dedicates a paragraph to the importance of "French-German friendship", Angela Merkel did not mention France.
Except for the creux.
Recalling that two centuries ago, Leipzig had been at the heart of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonian army.
What is the fraud of disease arrests?
After allocations, the UMP and the government launch the offensive on disease arrests.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday, 15 November to visit a family allowance box, and give a speech on the subject - they have been repeating since 2007 - of the fight against social fraud and assistance.
And to accompany this offensive, which is part of a willingness to make savings in a harsh context, but is not less adverting of an axis of the presidential campaign to the right, the majority wants to focus on disease arrests.
First of all, for the purpose of budgetary savings: the government intends to impose a fourth day of shortage on private employees prior to taking care of a job arrest.
Clearly, without a specific business agreement, a sick employee would lose four days' wages, so at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that could provoke anger, but that would make it possible to report EUR 280 million, according to Les Echoes.
And which would be accompanied by another measure, more symbolic: to impose a non-remunised day of absence on employees in the event of a termination of work (they do not have a period of absence up to three days in the private sector).
While these issues are under discussion, the majority are also relaunching the issue of fraud, this time targeting abuses related to labour arrests.
"The controls will be much more important and, in addition, if you are taken, you will be refunded," Xavier Bertrand warned at the RTL micro, Sunday 13 November.
As in other cases, the effects of advertising seem somewhat disproportionate with the reality of job arrest fraud.
This has been the subject of constant follow-up and political offensives since 2002, most often bearing fruit.
The French are not more sick than elsewhere in Europe.
Let's wait for the national figures first.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than €237 million of daily allowances were issued in 2006.
According to the Institute for Research and Documentation in the Health Economy, daily allowances accounted for 5% of health expenditure in 2008 with EUR 11.3 billion.
Of this amount, 46% concerned maternity leave and accidents at work, and 54% related to disease arrests, which amounted to €6.2 billion.
And so 2.5% of health expenditure.
In 2010, the French met on average 14.5 working days, compared with 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
An average that hides some differences: another survey, published in 2007 by Monster.com's career management site, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees interviewed said they had not taken any days of disease arrest.
Another study, this time of the Disease Insurance, specifies that in 2010, 37% of the disease arrests were less than 8 days long, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to one month, 15% from one to three months and 11% above.
When compared with their European neighbours, the French employees are not more inclined than they are to stop work.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two NRS researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001, the overall absence rate (for health reasons or not) was between 10% and 11% in France, compared with 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
The fraud of disease arrests represents very little in the face of the work in the dark.
As far as fraud is concerned, it is only a small amount.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has led to systematic controls on disease arrests for more than 45 days.
In 2008, over 1.5 million controls, UNAM found that 13 per cent of the 285,000 made for short-term arrests were "unjustified or too long", or 37,050 cases.
In the case of arrests of more than 45 days, systematically controlled, 11% of cases were "unadapted or unjustified" of 1.2 million, or 132 000.
In total, 169,000 "unjustified" cases were reported on several million employees who had stopped the disease.
A figure that represents very little in front, for example, of work in the dark.
According to UMP Dominique Tian, the author of a report on the issue in June, he would represent 9 to 15 billion euros of tax revenue a year, more than the total cost of daily allowances, and therefore more than fraud to the latter.
Papadémos: Greece will have to implement a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment programme to re-establish its economy.
That is what Prime Minister Lucas Papadémos told Parliament on Monday, 14 November, adding that the hundreds of days given to his union government would not be sufficient to carry out this task.
"To continue our economic recovery efforts, we need the support of our European partners and a new programme of budgetary adjustment," said the head of government, who gave his first public speech at the opening of the debate on the vote of confidence in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of decisions taken at the eurozone summit on 27 October will be the "principal task" of the new government, as the country's participation in the euro area "is in play", he added.
As a result, Mr. Papadémos predicted that the country's public deficit would be reduced "to around 9%" of GDP by the end of the year, after being 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right to refuse new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the leader of the right, supported the measures already approved to try to get out of the debt crisis on Monday, but prevented his party from engaging in an additional austerity.
"We will not vote for new measures," he said at a meeting with his party's Members, New Democracy.
It agreed with the deficit and debt reduction objectives and the fight against waste management but hostile to any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
In Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who has prevented the IMF and the EU from unlocking the necessary EUR 8 billion loan without a written guarantee from all the parties that they would support the planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his speech was sufficient and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
We need to legalize euthanasia and assisted suicide, says a committee of experts
Canadians live in the disgrace of death, according to Canada's Royal Society's report
In the field of palliative care, the Committee calls for Governments, health care institutions, and doctors to work together to ensure better palliative care, and that is beyond cancer.
Canadian society lives in the disgrace of death.
Only 9% of Canadians agree to talk to their doctor about the conditions under which they want to die and make arrangements to do so.
This is one of the conclusions of an imposing report by the Royal Society of Canada, which involved six experts in various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
The Committee recommends that the Government amend the Criminal Code in order to allow suicide and euthanasia to be assisted, when the choice is made, with a patient deemed competent to make such a decision.
From the start of the game, experts cite a recent survey by the United Intelligence Economist, who compared the quality of death in 40 countries on the planet.
If Canada is ranked 10th, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has produced a culture in which people are afraid to address the subject of death".
Medicalization or not, 77 per cent of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, reports the experts mandated by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the desire of most Canadians to die at home, 68.6% of them end up dying at the hospital.
Overall, in Quebec, this rate is the highest, with 86% of the deaths occurring in the hospital.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that are contrary to the position of the federal government, which has already said nothing to change the Criminal Code on euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to experts, who have also reviewed all countries where these approaches are legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that such decriminalization leads to abuses in the application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or suicide on persons who are not competent or who are not consenting.
On the contrary, Jocelyn Downie, co-sponsor of the report, said yesterday in teleconference, would find more cases of these flooding precisely in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized.
"The euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"The assisted suicide is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal," explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians in favour of euthanasia
Let us remember that 85% of Canadians have already spoken in favour of euthanasia because they believe it would enable people to alleviate their suffering in order to live, according to an Angus Reid survey conducted in 2010.
And 66% believe that the legalization of euthanasia will not have the effect of sending the message that the life of the elderly or the disabled is less valuable.
As for persons who have practiced the assisted suicide, it is estimated that 41 per cent of those surveyed should not be prosecuted.
With regard to the maintenance or cessation of care in a patient, the situation is less clear, the report's authors say.
Thus, in the list of their recommendations, they suggest that it is indicated in the Criminal Code that the withdrawal of care for which there was a legally valid refusal is not a criminal.
The Committee of Experts also requests that health professionals be trained to respect a refusal of care in the end-of-life, without fear of criminal prosecution.
In the field of palliative care, the Committee calls for Governments, health care institutions, and doctors to work together to ensure better palliative care, and that is beyond cancer.
Finally, in the case of palliative or terminal sedation, which has already been widely used in Canadian health institutions, the Committee requests that it be considered when it is not used to reduce physical pain, such as euthanasia, and that it be subject to the same procedures.
Reserves of other experts
Some health law experts have already issued reservations regarding the conclusions of the Royal Society of Canada's expert report.
Me Pierre Deshamps, a health specialist, described as "extremely" the position of the signatory experts in the report, among other things because it does not limit the practice of euthanasia to terminally ills.
"It opens the door to a situation where anyone who would be tired of life and who would have been over 18 years of age could ask for help in suicide," says Me Deshamps, who had consulted a summary of the report yesterday.
I also stress that the authors of the report seem to place the individual's autonomy above all the other values involved in the social fabric of society.
But, "in society, he says, there are gaps and constraints."
The health law specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed "a strong opposition" to the conclusions of the report, which she described as "a pro-Euthanasia manifesto".
Margaret Somerville, who is a member of the Royal Society of Canada, in particular contests data from the report on the absence of abuse in certain countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, both in the Netherlands and Oregon.

Bachhar al-Assad's supporters protested yesterday in front of the Foreign Affairs Department premises.
The diplomatic pressures intensified yesterday on the Syria of Bakhar al-Assad, which, with the support of Russia, resisted them and denounced a "combat" against the country.
Two days after Syria was suspended by the Arab League, the European Union strengthened its sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, neighbours of Syria, took a stand in favour of a departure from President Assad.
King Abdullah II of Jordan was yesterday the first Arab leader to call President Bachar al-Assad to "take power" in Syria where a quarter of the regime's forces and civilians were still killed.
"If Bachar was in the heart of his country's interest, he should resign, but he should also create the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life," said the king of Jordan, a neighbouring country of Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
For his part, Turkish diplomacy chief Ahmet Davutoglu regretted that Turkish mediation efforts since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime had failed.
"Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their peoples and cannot satisfy them will leave," he said, alluding to Syria, a neighbouring country in respect of which Turkey adopts an ever-increasing line.
The United States welcomed the "enhancement of the consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime", following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League, of countries such as Turkey are adopting an ever-increasing tone" in the face of repression in Syria, Mark Toner, a spokesperson for the Department of State observed.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime's forces lost their lives in the region of Deraa, in southern Syria, announced the Syrian Observatory on Human Rights (OSDH).
Two other civilians died "on shooting and shooting at heavy machine guns in Jobar" in Homs, according to this NGO.
At a press conference, however, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Moualem felt that the country was "directing towards the end of the crisis".
He also strongly responded to the Arab League's decision to suspend Damascus from its work, which he considered to be "a non-hazardous".
Syria "doesn't get fired", he added, ensuring that "ordious plots against Syria will fail".
Following its decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is now studying a "civil protection mechanism" and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers to the country.
French Minister for Foreign Affairs Alain Juppe has also expressed his support for sending United Nations observers to help protect civilians from the regime's repression that he believes is embedded in the "paranoia".
A new special meeting of the League is scheduled to be held tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the crisis exit plan decided on 2 November, including the withdrawal of the armed forces from the city in the wake of the protest and release of the arrested demonstrators.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov found the Arab League's decision to be "inaccurate" yesterday, while China urged Syria to implement the crisis exit plan, while continuing to support possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti demands time on Italian markets and sacrifices
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has called for some time on the market to form his team and implement a program, which will contain "sacrifices", in order to regain the credibility lost in the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner was in discussion with the political parties yesterday before meeting today the trade unions and the sponsorship.
It should establish a relatively limited office composed of external technocrats in Parliament.
"Monti spoke about an important program with many sacrifices," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many small parliamentary groups involved in the interviews, after meeting the President of the appointed Council.
The President of the House of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, said that he expected Mario Monti to ask for a vote of confidence in Parliament by Friday to ensure that the new government had sufficient support.
The consultations will end with Mr. Monti's presentation of a limited list, without a doubt a dozen ministers, to the head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr. Monti commented on the nervousness of stock exchange and bond markets yesterday, demanding them from time.
In "democracy, there are precise times" to prepare a government and its programme, he stressed, saying, "some markets will be patient and will understand."
His appointment by the president had been initially welcomed by the markets, but the concern was repeated especially after an unexpected fall in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The appointed prime minister should be a team consisting mainly of technocrats, although he stressed that he would like to include "politics".
The new government must last until 2013, the date of the next legislation, it estimated.
According to the President of the House of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will receive Parliament's confidence by Friday.
Mr Monti has committed himself once he has entered into office to work in the urgency and in order for Italy to "become a protagonist" in Europe.
A spokesperson for European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change".
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its budgetary balance objective in 2013, despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, has, in particular, called for new measures of rigour.
The Italian "pattern" Emma Marcegaglia, who will see her on Tuesday, also stressed the need to relaunch the economy, "because a country that has no growth cannot meet the deficit parameters".
Mr. Monti, known for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "time change" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism", the "teacher" symbolizing "the serious challenge" and another "Italy", according to editors.
The great unknown will be the longevity of his team.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections, as Italy must place EUR 200 billion of state bonds by April 2012.
A Russian scientist helped the Iranian nuclear program
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, helped Iran develop a usable detonator with a nuclear weapon, said on Monday an American NGO specialized in atomic risk.
The Institute for International Science and Security (ISIS) is based on the recent report of the International Atomic Security Agency (IAEA) and other documents from this United Nations agency to identify this researcher.
The IAEA reported last week on its "serious concerns" about a "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to ISIS, which was widely available in IAEA documents, Mr. Danilenko, born in 1934, would have worked for three decades from the 1960s in a Soviet nuclear centre in Cheliabinsk (Ural), and would have been involved in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he would have left the centre to establish a company producing "nano diamonds" in Kiev.
His company's economic difficulties would have led him to contact the Embassy of Iran in Ukraine in 1995.
He would then have cooperated with the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its last report, the IAEA cites "strong indications that the development by Iran" of a nuclear detonation system "was assisted by the work of a foreign expert who not only knew this technique well but who, as a Member State informed the Agency, worked during the core of his career on this technology in the military nuclear programme of his country of origin".
Anti-Muslim crimes and crimes increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes against Muslims increased from almost 50% from 2009 to 2010, while at the same time other racial and religious violence decreased slightly or slightly, according to the FBI's statistics made public on Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of violence against Muslims rose from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, that is 49 per cent increase, against a 13 per cent increase in the violence against Catholics, a 4 per cent decrease in crimes against Jews and a total increase of 14 per cent in anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number of "hate crimes" has increased very slightly to 6,628 cases, 47.3% of which are motivated by racial differences and 20% by religious differences, according to the FBI.
"After a decline in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and crimes increase again," said the Human Rights Organization Human Rights First, "the increase in anti-Muslim violence is particularly significant," the organization added in a communiqué.
"Human Rights First has long stressed that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, must be regarded as a serious violation of human rights," adds one of the organization's leaders, Paul Legendre.
"The U.S. government can and must do more to address these abuses," he added, assuming that this could lead to an improvement in police reports on "hate crimes".
The "hate crime" in U.S. federal law is a legacy of the time of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation had been adopted after Martin Luther King's death to punish racial violence, skin color, religion, origin and now sexual affiliation.
Twitter changes its platform and looks more like Facebook
The micro-blogging Twitter site introduced changes to its platform on Monday, allowing users to observe the activities of those they follow, which makes it a little more like Facebook.
A new "activity" and another "name" tab allow you to follow more legibly, directly the activity of the other "Twittos", the netizens whose messages are followed ("tweets") and those who follow you.
This lets you know if they follow messages, if they subscribe to new accounts, if they have favorite messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested "on a small percentage of users in August" before being broadcast throughout the network on Monday, AFP indicated Twitter's spokesperson, Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, which was known for its little instinctive operation, with slightly esoteric terms (RT to rediscover a message from someone else, #followfriday to recommend following another user) making people happy, opens up to a wider audience with a more comparable handling than that of big public networks Facebook and Google+.
On the network, users were suddenly discussing "tweets" about the interest of this innovation.
"It's useless, invading, and it looks too much like Facebook," wrote @jemb123.
"Activity will help me better follow some elements of my Twitter stream," @dannykronstrom said.
Austria
entry of a "gold rule" in the constitution
The Government of the Great Social-Democrat/Christian Coalition to the Power of Austria decided on Tuesday to include in the constitution a "gold rule" of the budget in order to reduce public deficits and thus to avoid possible degradation by the notation agencies of the sovereign note of Austria (triple A).
It is the Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann who even announced this decision after a Council of Ministers, while the Austrian public debt is 74.6%, far above the 60% criterion laid down by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly below the country's debt such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If the solvency of Austria was reduced only from one branch, from AAA to AA+, we should pay three billion euros of interest every year," said Deputy Chancellor and Christian Minister for Foreign Affairs Michael Spindelegter.
Austria therefore submitted a request for the summit in Brussels of the euro area member countries of the last 26 October: the Heads of State and Government had then claimed the registration by the end of 2012 of the reduction of public deficits and a return to the balance of public accounts in the constitution or in a law of equal value.
The provision adopted by the Austrian government draws closer to the "German model", Germany having been the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
By 2017, the structural public deficit will have to decrease annually by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) and, from 2017 onwards, the federal state's structural public deficit will not exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while the regional states and the municipalities will have to present budgets at a balanced level.
The aim is to make public debt transfer to Horizon 2020/21 under the 60% criterion laid down by the Maastricht Treaty.
Strong One
Noda threatens a new intervention on the market for change
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda said on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would again intervene on the exchange market if the yen should continue to mount.
"We will intervene as we did last time if we detect excessive volatility" in the yen exchange rate, Mr. Noda explained in the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen rose not far from the historical levels that prompted the Japanese authorities to intervene on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo sold massively fines against dollars to lower the value of the Nippon currency that had just established a new record of force since 1945 against the green card.
But the yen has been regularly repaired since, as it has been sold by investors who consider it a "future value" at this time of uncertain global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar was transferred on Tuesday under the 77 yen and the euro went down under the symbol bar of the 105 yen, close to the levels that triggered the last intervention.
Prior to the financial crisis in 2008-2009, the dollar was about 120 yen and the euro was over 160 yen.
This flame of the Nippon currency is a night of exports from the archipelago, as it can cost the products Made in Japan and reduces the value of foreign revenues from Japanese firms when they convert them into national currencies.
"Japan is fighting to rebuild itself" since the earthquake and tsunami of March 11 that devastated the Tohoku region (north-east), Mr. Noda, who is afraid that this reincarnation of the yen does not kill in the egg the fragile recovery.
The third world economic power has resumed with the growth in the third quarter -1.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter - for the first time in one year, thanks to an abundance of exports and consumption of households that have been hit by the disaster.
But the Prime Minister felt that the cost of the yen did not reflect Japan's "fundamental economics".
The Minister of Finance, Jun Azumi, called for the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting on Tuesday of its monetary policy council, to take all possible steps to weaken the yen.
But the institution's Deputy Governor Hirohide Yamaguchi had already predicted that BoJ had already taken "the appropriate measures", implying that no additional monetary relief was to be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the Emission Institute increased its Treasury assets purchases to 55,000 billion yen (519 billion yen) to the ceiling of its amounts for the purchase of various financial instruments to drown the liquidity market.
Euro area:
rates fluctuating, exchange rate fluctuating
The risk of contagion of the debt crisis is always the European index.
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and better growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of weakened countries continue to rise.
Still concerned about the stability of the euro area, the European Stock Exchanges are sinking a little more into negative territory on Tuesday, 15 November.
At 10 a.m., the CAC lost 40 per cent to 3,064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt amounts to 0.4% and London 0.1%.
" With the new tensions on the performance of euro area States' borrowings in difficulty, the global stock markets continue to make some of their recent gains."
"The investors, nervous, are only too aware of the risk of infection," explains Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by the agency Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed down by 0.7%, with renewed fear of market players about Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis.
" Japan, like the rest of the world, has eyes on Europe and exchanges will continue in a narrow variation corridor as long as investors have no evidence that the situation is stabilised," says Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This renewed concern about the future of the euro area penalises the single currency, which continues its decline on Tuesday.
The euro has evolved to its lowest level for a month and a half.
At around 10 a.m., the European currency is $1.3570, representing 0.4%.
According to the courtiers, she withdrew after the party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, the CDU, gathered at Monday's congress, adopted a motion which included the possibility for a country in difficulty to leave the euro area without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates well above 6%
Italy and Spain's loan rates remain at very worrying levels.
This morning, the performance of Italian obligations at 10 years of age is 6.85%, the performance of the same degree of Spanish titles 6.2%.
These tensions on the interest rates of the countries of the south, but also in France, continue to fuel the fears of stakeholders.
The head of the future Italian government Mario Monti has claimed time to the markets to restore the situation in Italy, threatened by asphyxiation by the weight of his debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos said that the implementation of decisions taken at the euro area summit on 27 October would be the " main task" of his government.
Spain is on the market watch line, while the country's legislative elections take place on Sunday.
The gap between 10-year-old and 10-year-old German and Spanish obligations has reached a new higher historical level.
Waiting for euro area growth figures
On the statistical side, France has recorded an economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, slightly better than the expected 0.3% of households.
However, the Insee revised the number of the second quarter, with a decrease of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
And it's really the fourth one that worries the most economists.
Germany, on the other hand, has recorded a 0.5% increase over the same period.
A first estimate for the euro area as a whole is expected at 11 a.m., while the European Commission has just warned against the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
the facts must be carried on the dogmas
If it is a subject that cannot be dealt with from short-term considerations or when it comes to emotion, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and the competitiveness of companies.
It is healthy for an election meeting to be an opportunity to reflect on such issues and on the place where the nuclear is held.
The debate will be fruitful only if it explores the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
While we are 7 billion human beings on the planet, demographic evolution will double the demand for electricity by 2050, unless we deprive an enormous part of the world's population of a vital element.
At the same time, it will be necessary to slow down the reduction of fossil resources in order to continue to produce electricity in a permanent manner, without forgetting the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change, a lost subject of environmental debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains isolated in its decision to give up nuclear power.
It is neither the case nor the case of Belgium, which is subject to the need to be able to find a source of replacement that is able to replace itself, nor of Switzerland, which is just about to build only last-generation power plants.
On the contrary, Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to quote, continue their projects with determination.
The United States, they, after Fukushima, decided to add a unit to their park by renewing the construction of a power plant interrupted after the accident of Three Mile Island.
If the German model, based on renewable energy, is sometimes presented as an example, the reality contradicts the speech.
Berlin's choice will result in a rise in the price of electricity, an energy dependency compounded by the increased use of imported gas, in particular from Russia, a bond of CO2 emissions caused by the construction of gas and coal plants.
Within a few months, all these false effects are already felt.
Denmark's case is to be meditated.
Europe's wind champion, with 30% of its electricity, is also one of the largest users of coal and gas due to wind interference; according to which its CO2 emissions and its electricity prices are 65% and 50% higher than the European average respectively.
On the contrary, thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbours are paying an electricity bill of more than 40% than that of the French households.
While in a globalised economy the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a gap in the maintenance of the industrial tool on national territory, French companies benefit from the least expensive electricity in Europe.
As a result, any significant reduction on the nuclear side would result in a strong increase in the price of electricity, which would make the beautiful declarations on the re-industrialization of our country and the defence of the purchasing power.
A price that a large majority of French people refuse to pay, since they do not show any opposition to this energy, surveys show it.
We recall that our country's energy policy has made it possible to build an industrial branch of 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 in-house jobs.
Strongly exportable, it leads to a galaxy of specialized SMEs on international markets and makes them very creative of non-localised jobs.
If France had just decided to leave the nuclear plant, it would have sacrificed many of these SMEs by reducing the 6 billion euros per year of French exports of nuclear equipment and services as a source of grief.
Which electrician would command an EPR designed to operate for sixty years while its manufacturer's decline would be programmed?
To solve the energy equation, we must admit that there is no source of miraculous electricity production, no more than there is no devil.
The development by Areva of low-emission CO2, nuclear and renewable solutions demonstrates the complementarity of energy sources.
For nuclear fuel, maintaining the highest level of safety is an absolute imperative.
In France, we have a Security Authority that has an intransigent and transparent control over existing power plants as well as the Flamenville station.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, are obsessed with the same obsession of security.
In the mid-century, the nuclear industry suffered three serious accidents.
One, Three Mile Island, was involved in normal operating conditions; it remained without human or environmental consequences.
In Chernobyl, the design of the reactor and unforgivable human faults caused the drama.
In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident is the result of two natural disasters of an unprecedented magnitude that caused the death of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn from this accident, as it did for both of the previous.
This approach and cooperation between the security authorities, French and German operators and manufacturers, the EPR presents a concept that makes it possible to withstand such phenomena.
While it is considered by all the electricians who wish to build a power plant, the stop of its construction in Flamanville would be a wonderful gift offered to the competitors of Areva and EDF by leaving them free to take the lead in the irreversible development of the nuclear plant.
It is essential and legitimate to look for the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let the emotions, dogmas and practices of the partisan people dominate a debate that is also crucial to our country's economic, social and financial situation.
Is immigration a burden or a chance for the economy?
The immigration policy carried out under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticised in various angles - the instigation of police, judicial and administrative services subject to the figure policy, the compatibility of this policy with the self-declared status of the French "country of human rights".
More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students who have done the current job, the Minister of the Interior (read Release of May 23) proclaiming in the passage that France "does not need foreign talents, masonry and restaurant servers".
But it is only rarely analyzed under the economic angle.
There is quite a broad consensus between the left and the right on this issue.
On the right, the tone was given by Jacques Chirac, who would declare in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed people should not be a problem in a country with nearly 2 million immigrant workers", and on the left, by Michel Rocard explaining that France "could not welcome all the misery of the world" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, the fear of the invasion of the national territory by Polish lead hordes was shared to the left as well as to the right.
For both sides, immigrants are regarded as a burden for the French economy and society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity that will be granted to immigrants.
In his programme, François Hollande is entitled to banality, indicating that the development of code development will solve our "migration problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may be selectively paid; but it is economically very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron recall in a recent paper summarizing the most recent knowledge about immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among experts on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries receiving immigrants.
Restricting anaemic immigration growth and employment night.
Concerns about the impact of migrants are based on the idea that they may be replaced by national workers, especially those with limited qualifications, who are under pressure to lower their wages.
However, experience shows that immigrants are actually much more complementary than national employees, who are mainly engaged in jobs in poorer sectors.
Small-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract national employees, and the most skilled in dynamic sectors where training does not follow the offer of jobs.
A positive effect on wages
Similarly, as a surgeon will have trouble working in a country where there is a shortage of anesthetists, these complementations between national and migrants have a positive effect on the salaries and employment of immigrants.
Giovanni Peri thus calculated that an increase of 1% of migration flows resulted in an increase between 0.6 and 0.9% of real long-term wages.
And without taking into account the fact that the diversity of immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (a large proportion of immigrants naturalized among the American Nobel Prizes; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems, on average up to 1% of the total budget in European countries.
For example, the World Labour Organization estimates that, in Germany, a 30-year-old immigrant will make a net (less-cost) contribution of EUR 150,000 to the average public budgets over his entire life.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted, at the beginning of his term of office, to look for missing growth points "with teeth".
The teeth in question, using to deter immigrants, had the exact opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, still thinking European democracy
Democracy is a precious asset; it is also a fragile asset.
The European continent should be able to remember it, which, for its invention in Athens over two thousand years ago, has experienced during the 20th century the tragedies of the Great War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonists in Greece.
Some have believed that it would be sufficient, so that democracy would finally triumph over its enemies, to exercise the vote, and to exercise it as directly as possible.
It is known from Napoleon that "the Little" was an ease of thought.
Universal suffrage, in order to be the necessary condition for democracy, is not the necessary condition and may even become an "oppressive instrument" as was once said by the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot.
No, democracy requires much more: public space, public spirit, values, organization, separation and control of powers, education, Light, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis in Europe we live in is an economic crisis, but it is, first and foremost, a crisis in politics and democracy.
The palinody of the true Greek referendum would have had in this regard double value: that of the need for a powerful return of politics, but also that of the feeling disturbed by its impossibility, its incongruity.
This ambivalentity must be thought to be exceeded.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have moved today, and for many of them, Republican soldiers are no longer in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain from requiring a succession of national referendums, organized to the extent of needs and dispersed.
A white-seen at the absolute European monarchy or a jump at foot in the void of the nationalist revolt: what a choice for the citizen!
No, we do not want cooperation but a common exercise, full right, serene and continuous, of choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - there are no more places to stop the census - because there is only one crisis, and it is in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe that adheres to the dictations of the markets and rating agencies, which are due to its impeccability and its lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that is humiliated on the international stage.
We are concerned about transfers of sovereignty to Europe - but it is the whole of Europe that slowly loses its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
The urgency is to restore popular sovereignty to the piloting of the European project.
As a whole, Europeans will be able to reduce their debt burden, free up their markets and prepare for the future by investing.
The outcome of the crisis will involve decisions at European level that cannot be taken without total democratic legitimacy, except of course to lead us to disaster.
After a long struggle with this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone today demands the European Economic Government.
Come on.
But thinking about it without a stronger political and democratic integration, and living as such by citizens, would be a new madness and a new impasse.
We must take a new step towards European construction.
In order to make the Republic of France, it was necessary to "make" Republicans.
The Revolution in the Interests could not be sufficient.
This lesson remains valid.
We must build a more integrated Europe economically.
This can only be done by building a more democratic Europe politically, a true European popular sovereignty.
To make Europe, let's make Europeans.
The "without contact" chip cards are common
The world hall of the poppy map opens on Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, in an optimistic climate.
The year 2011 is expected to end with an increase of 11% of global sales of microprocessor cards (bank card, SIM card phone...), more than 6 billion units, according to the Eurosmart cabinet.
The most portable segment is that of wireless technology that allows you to pay transportation in common or to manage your purchases by simply approaching a reader's card.
This year, 460 million card cards without contact should be sold worldwide, compared to 320 million a year earlier!
Their share is expected to continue to grow in 2012 (580 million units expected) and represent nearly 10% of the global card market (6,925 million cards).
For a long time in the Asia-Pacific region, Europe earns the land for payment without contact.
Some 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this functionality and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 cards without contact Visa have been deployed.
But the big surfaces put double holes.
Carrefour thus issued 2.5 million Pass MasterCard cards this year without contact.
In order to move to higher speed, banks now need to equip their customers.
"Two large French institutions have undertaken to systematically disseminate to their clients in the future from bank cards equipped for the homeless," says Gérard Nébouy, Director General of Visa Europe France.
Banks test the payment by mobile
But this is only a first step towards the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
Few devices are now equipped with NFC (Near Field Communication) technology necessary to perform transactions.
"They're late."
"But they should finally know a real Essor next year."
"We sell 80 to 120 million units in 2012 worldwide," explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks take the front.
The Agricultural Credit announced yesterday the launch of a test from December to June next to Caen.
The iPhones of about 200 clients and employees will be equipped with a case allowing the payment without contact.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the General Society, too, said yesterday to prepare the market for an offer allowing its customers to pay without contact with their mobile.
From the Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front is expanding
Paris is concerned about the links between al-Qaida to the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
Long-term suspects, the links between the al-Qaida terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian Boko Haram are confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs Abdelkader Messahel even stated that Algiers now "acquires certainty".
"The way both organizations operate and the reports of information services show that there is good cooperation," he explained without further clarification.
Paris seems to be doing a similar analysis.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger last January would have updated the passageways.
Kidnappings in a Niamey restaurant by near Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the following day as many of their fans during an operation launched by the French special forces.
In the December of the intervention, French and Nigerian investigators had to find several telephone holes belonging to terrorists.
Terrorist Axis
The analysis of past calls focuses on several stakeholders based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers are of particular interest to the investigators: one leads to a Nigerian who has lived long in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, Boko Haram Berceau and the other to a man who is called Aqmi and the sect.
"It is an advance, but there must certainly be more formal evidence before speaking of operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"We have known for years that the sect has benefited from external financial and intellectual support and that it is becoming increasingly active," said Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months these "supports" have been increasingly evident in the evolution and speech of Boko Haram or in its operating modes, which now involve the use of more complex Kamikazes or explosive devices and the same invoice as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, beginning with Washington, therefore pressured Abuja to take into account the problems raised by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have long regarded the group as a community of low-interest lighting.
A Quick Success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, school, and fundamentalist iman Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which means in haoussa "Western education is a sin" - presupposes the establishment of an Islamic emirate in northern Muslim Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association is rapidly successful.
It politicizes and demands strict respect for the charria while its militants engage in the fight against the evil central government.
The latter are primarily aimed at churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram's militants were particularly active, increasing attacks on the commissioners.
Abuja's reaction is, as usual, no nuances.
The army invests in the city, we count 800 dead.
Mohammed Joseph, arrested alive, was killed in prison.
From then on, the sect will radicalize itself and leave its pillars from the north.
In last Christmas, she claimed an attack that killed 80 in Jos, and then another in Abuja.
In June, it was still in Abuja that Boko Haram took it to the security QG of the police during a suicide attack, his first.
In August, the United Nations local headquarters will be its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa that would sail from Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria now concerns all security specialists.
While Aqmi has invested Mali and Niger, the Somalis of al-Chebab operate in Kenya, Boko Haram appears as a new threat at the heart of the continent.
Last week, during an interview in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppe warned against Boko Haram and said he was ready to share all the information.
The World According to Republican Candidates to the Presidency
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry compete for simplicity and ignorance.
Can an America weakened by the crisis manage a complex world with simple, even simple ideas?
To listen to the Republican presidential candidates, voters might believe that.
For a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others have multiplied the tone of statements and shorts in foreign policy, traditionally a strong republican point.
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, the slogans - often non-stated - were.
Mitt Romney, the best in the race for the appointment of the "Grand Old Party", threatened to drag the Chinese into front of the WTO and challenge them "for the manipulation of their currency", a theme bearer in a America experienced by the migration of pancakes from its industry to Asia.
As far as this must involve the launch of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former Chinese ambassador to Obama and only candidate for a sophisticated foreign policy vision, has failed to stand up to an attitude that "flashes" emotions.
He called for a muscle but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current position of Obama).
But Huntsman, who stands in the depths of the polls, remains unheard of.
To the image of Reagan
Romney has also promised military attacks on Iran if sanctions fail to stop its nuclear programme.
"If I'm elected, I'll stop Iran, he's fancied."
"If Obama is re-elected, they will have the bomb."
He also promised to increase military assistance to Israel, accusing Obama of failing to meet his obligations to this partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second best-placed candidate, shows him a embarrassing ignorance of the files.
Recently, he called against the Chinese military threat because Beijing "trys to develop a nuclear capacity" - apparently ignoring the fact that China has held the military atom since 1964!
Texan Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to hit Iran, says he is ready to engage the American army in Mexico against drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists, prohibited by Obama in 2009, is also recommended by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
We are far from the 2008 Republican candidate John McCain, a heavy weight in foreign policy.
The current president's opponents say Reagan also had simple ideas and he won the cold war.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to put water into his anti-terrorism wine.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naïve dialogue with Iran, the too hasty departure of Iraq's "boys" on its turbulences in Libya, thus labeling him as weak.
But the attack isn't that easy.
The population is more positive about Obama's national security budget, which eliminated Ben Laden.
Since Iraq, she has been mistrusting military interventions that lead to the eviction.
And by arguing that America must be economically rebuilt to revive its leadership, Obama strikes more just.
North Stream, new Russian gas entry door in Europe
The North Stream pipeline, directly linking Western Europe to Russia by crossing the bottom of the Baltic Sea, has entered into service.
It must provide gas for an equivalent of 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with lightning.
More than 500 guests, including four Heads of State and Government, took part on the Baltic coast last Tuesday between the orchestra and the final buffet, at the inauguration of the North Stream, the new pipeline that directly connects Russia to Germany.
Symbolically, the German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his counterpart from the Netherlands, Mark Rutte, turned together the steering wheel of the valve leading the entry of the Russian gas into the Western European network.
With this new pipeline, 27.5 billion cubic metres of additional Russian gas will arrive every year in Western Europe with a first tube of 1,224 km connecting the Saint Petersburg region to the Land of Mecklenburg-Poméranie.
A second tube has to be completed at the end of 2012, allowing to deliver a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, the equivalent of all French consumption.
And we are already talking about the possibility of building a third on the same path.
For Gazprom, the completion in time and time of this huge building has victory air.
The project had been strongly challenged by Poland and the Baltic countries.
The North Stream will be able to deliver gas directly to Germany, avoiding any land passage through a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
Suddenly, these two countries lose some of their power: it becomes more difficult for them to weigh on Russia by threatening to close its access to Western European markets.
As far as the debate is concerned, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare the North Stream to a "new German-Soviet pact", in reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That is whether the subject is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, by supporting this Russian project, has gained greater security of supply.
But it is at the price of a weakening Europe of energy, as the project has created a gap between Eastern and Western Europeans.
Russia knew, in five years' time, that it would triumph over its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich western countries, heavily gas-consumers, and whose settlements are in decline.
"This pipeline is part of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us organically," said François Fillon, inaugurating this pipeline, demonstrating the extent to which major gas contracts are both political and economic.
All this explains the broad smiles shown by the leaders of Gazprom, present in number in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical operation.
The submarine tube is made of concrete steel to protect it from the anchors of the ships.
It is based on the bottom of the sea, 200 m on average.
To build it, it had to be avoided from land mines dating from the Second World War.
"A hundred had to be removed or destroyed, with caution," says Jens Müller, spokesperson for North Stream.
There was also a need to multiply measures to protect wildlife and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake, heavy as 242 Eiffel towers, which nothing interrupts all its length: neither valve nor maintenance station.
A control platform was planned across Sweden, but the project was abandoned by the Swedish authorities while they were reluctant to see a Russian state company permanently set up across their coasts.
"In case of emergency, we stop the gas pass in less than a minute," says Jens Müller.
In the event of a leak, the gas contained in the gas pipeline escapes into the air.
But this case is considered unlikely by the builders who planned the sourties to know a escape every 100,000 years.
The monitoring of the state of the pipeline is ensured by a submarine robot, trained by a ship, for external observation, as well as by a device circulating inside the pipeline.
In the form of a cigarette, it is inserted inside the tube, with a diameter of one metre, and it is pushed by the gas.
On arrival, after three complete days of travel at a speed of 3 metres, he provides precise information on possible metal deformations.
The gas pipeline was designed to operate for 50 years without having to make the least repair.
Gas circulation is simply covered by pressure.
It is 200 bars away, and 100 at arrival.
Five companies have joined forces to implement this project.
The leader remains Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
There were Germans E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as Dutch Gasunie and French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have created a joint venture, called Nord Stream, to build and operate the pipeline.
It has its seat in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then rented this company, for 20 renewable years, the total capacity of gas transport.
" Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, whatever the amount of gas actually transported," says Jens Müller.
Funding for the construction of the pipeline was provided to 30% by shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of the work should be EUR 7.4 billion for both pipes.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment rose to 240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure to get back to their expense, since only Gazprom takes the risk.
The gas pipeline emerges from the Baltic in Lubmin, on a sandy shoreline planted with pine trees.
Valves, heights of 4.5 meters, form the gas output door.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specificities of the gas that arrives before it is transferred to the German gas pipelines.
Since Tuesday, this terminal has received a million cubic metres of Russian gas every hour.
With full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and in 2012, 6 million.
Moleskine, a stamp.
Founded 15 years ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to rekindle the taste of writing.
It has a perfume of adventures, hours spent writing in the light of a madness.
The Moleskine book is easily recognizable, with its black rectangular cover, its elastic, its leaves of a broken white, as old by time.
However, the Moleskine book as we know it today was born... in 1997.
The Italian company Mode Modo, based in Milan, decided at the time to launch a book of design notes but distinguished.
Maria Sebregondi, then consultant for the company, is responsible for launching the new product.
The book is inspired by an old production technique, the skin soft (tub skin) that denotes a paint cotton used to cover banquets, for example.
This type of book was very taken by writers and travellers.
" Moleskine gave to the taste of the day an old and forgotten object, which was an icon of the avant-garde artists, until the 20th century," says Maria Sebregondi, who became the brand's manager at Modo Modo.
Success is here.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% to 12.7 million shelled pieces.
We are far from the confidential production of the first years, where only 3,000 books were designed.
Moleskine crosses the Italian borders and exports to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It's difficult to establish a buyer's robot portrait, because the notebook also seduces both the businessman and the student and the professionals.
In Moleskine's image, its consumers are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cultivated.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees at its beginnings, now accounts for almost 100 today and has two offices since 2008; one in Milan and the other in New York.
She distributes her books in the libraries, from Fnac to small downtown stores and has managed to impose her identity.
" We have followed the weather and this need for new writing, despite the e-mail e-mails," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature is accompanied by Moleskine's development: recently, the brand launched an exhibition " Detour " where architects or artists expose their own book.
In August, she also launched a leopard cover at the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and cultural aura, Moleskine has managed to diversify its products: bags, calendars, styles, computer housings...
A success that led to the search: in the fall of 2006, Momodo was bought by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, today Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in Moleskine's history.
Why is the unemployment rate of disabled workers so high?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for a job.
The 15th week for the employment of persons with disabilities is open today.
Despite a voluntary public policy in 2005, the unemployment rate of persons with disabilities is twice as high as the average: 19%, compared to 9% for the entire population.
Discouragement?
“No,” said Eric Blanchet, Director General of Adapt, “the association that organizes the week for the employment of persons with disabilities.”
" The progress made for 15 years has been considerable. "
"At the time, the unemployment rate was not two but three times higher."
"It's still huge to do. "
It must be said that for the disabled, obstacles remain many before access to employment.
Rather, they are older: 37% are over 50 years of age (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% do not have the pool and of the 2.3 million higher education students, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very widespread: 53% for persons with disabilities, compared to 38% on average.
In short, so many criteria that particularly complicate the return to employment, and that "are the core of the problem", according to Christian Grapin, Director General of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help businesses recruit people with disabilities.
That's for the target brakes.
It remains the non-dit, the mentality that evolves, certainly, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Entrepreneur Association for the City indicated that the managers questioned had " a low level of knowledge of disability " , with " overrepresentation of wheelchairs, mental or intellectual disabilities " .
As a result, private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from reaching the employment target of 6% of disabled workers, set out in a... 1987 Act.
The last known figures, dating from 2008, show a ratio of 2.6%.
"We are now around 3%," says Pierre Blanc, Director General of Agefiph, the organization responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not comply with this law.
Evidence: the number of " taxed " institutions, as well as the amounts paid, decreased between 2007 and 2011, from 59 000 to 46,000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
" The 2005 Act, which increased contributions, created a strong pressure on businesses," explains Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also translates a real awareness, especially in the major groups."
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59 per cent of 20 to 49 employees work with disabled workers, compared with 82 per cent of 100 to 199 employees.
Gambling: "What happiness"
Before facing the Blues Tuesday night (20h45) Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure of getting them this friendly match.
We won't even write that there was a connection between them, but the image is symbolic.
Side by side on the street of the auditorium of the Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have made great and good peace.
Five months after the humour gesture of his attacker against Turkey, the Belgian electorate only has praise for him.
"I am very pleased with Eden, with his progress and his being Belgian."
"I want to go ahead," says Lillois.
As for the contrast between his performance at the club and his selection, "it's a whole, if he's justified."
"A Lille, I'm there all year, which is not the case with Belgium."
"I must take my marks."
Manned against Romania Friday night for this match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to finally "bright".
Not to be overlooked, however, the notion of "please."
The Blues, he has encouraged them since the age of 7 and the successful campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been supportive," he says.
This will necessarily contribute to further strengthening the "participative" character of this meeting.
As in front, "there is Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami)," he recalls.
"We crossed all the time."
"To play against them is only happiness!"
With bonhomie, Leekens has for his part the "firty".
"Fierte" of the disputer "a game of gala".
"Fererite" also to note - as "neighbourly" - that France "becomes a very high-level team" a little more than a year after Knysna's trauma.
"Laurent Blanc did a toner job," he was excited.
While Belgium will miss the next Euro, the technician would well share the plane with the Blues management... Brazil in 2014.
"Our little Belgians are getting big," he said.
"We're building something, the players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You're going to report it to the next match." The one against France included.
Portugal is very confident
Paulo Bento's Portugal begins with a lot of optimist its barrier back to Bosnia (22h00), Tuesday in Lisbon.
On the way, the two teams lacked realism.
" At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already here in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no shadow of a doubt, the Selectçao, which has been in the hands since September 2010, will qualify for the Euro 2012.
Portugal is actually only 90 minutes away from happiness.
But there's a game to play, and an opponent, Bosnia, to play.
In view of the match to go (0-0), Friday in the Hell of Zenica, it appeared clearly that the games are not done.
Portugal has dominated the party for more than an hour, but it has been unable to mark this goal so precious, which would have relieved it.
"It's a good result, however, which presents a certain risk because we haven't marked a target outside."
But at home, in their bright Light Stadium in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to pass, in front of a public who should be there as fussy, even though the party obviously announces "very closed," said an optimistic but lucid Bento.
"We expect a very close match, but we are absolutely convinced that we can take it up," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We continue to have 50% chance of being in the Euro 2012," however relativized Carlos Queiroz's successor.
The new report on Friday in Bosnia obliges the Portuguese to mark and win.
A zero can be enough for the Bosnians, who also need to mark.
"It's a good result, however, which presents a certain risk because we haven't marked a target outside," says Bento.
"We're going to play against a team that has a lot of technical qualities and has players with a lot of individual qualities," he added.
Like Zenica, the Portuguese will intend to put maximum pressure on the Bosnians so as not to "give them time to think."
A good idea, provided it turns out to be realistic this time.
