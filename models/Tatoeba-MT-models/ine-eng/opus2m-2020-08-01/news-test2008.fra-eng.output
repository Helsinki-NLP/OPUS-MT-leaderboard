Inflation, in Europe, has fallen on food
Accelerated inflation, measured in the euro area, is mainly due to the rapid increase in food prices.
In November, the increase in prices in the 13 euro area countries was more important than forecast, after an inflation rate of 2.6 per cent in October, an annual inflation of 3.1 per cent was recorded, reported the Statistical Office of the European Community located in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts indicated only 3 percent, Bloomberg reported.
Unlike the U.S., British and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not reduced the lead interest rate by saying that lower interest rates, with rising raw materials prices and lower unemployment rates, would lead to the generation of an inflationary spiral.
The ECB would like to maintain the inflation rate below but close to two percent.
According to one analyst, it is the Catch 22 for the ECB: "inflation must be deterred" so as not to have any further intervention on this subject.
In Germany, the rate of inflation of 3.3 per cent is a record in the last 12 years and in Spain, it is restored from 3.6 to 4.1.
Inflation in the euro area has declined due to the rapid increase in food and energy prices.
The market share of cereals has increased by 88% and soybeans have also reached their highest value since 1973.
The price of food oil and dairy products also increased considerably in 2007.
This year, the world oil price rose by 52 per cent and last month a black gold barrel cost nearly $100.
According to the ECB, in 2008, the inflation rate will go from 2.1 this year to 2.5 per cent, but in 2009 it will fall to 1.9.
According to the analysts, the inflation rate of 12 months remains around 3 per cent, however, the average annual rate will be 2.1 per cent over the next 3-4 months.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to reduce the lead rate twice in 2008.
Gallup indicates a government crisis
After a long stagnation, the number of participants in Fidesz (Youth Democrats' Alliance) has increased significantly since the beginning of December. Thus since 2002, it currently has the largest number of participants, while Gallup (Study Institute) has never before found such low socialist support, i.e. 13 percent.
For faithful voters, the difference would represent, due to the greatest determination of opposition voters, more than two thirds (71 per cent) of support against the support of a fifth (20 per cent) for MSZP (Hungarian Socialist Party).
According to the survey, the MDF (Hungarian Democrat Forum) and the SZDSZ (Free Democrats Alliance) are below the parliamentary threshold: their support is two percent in the entire population.
Of the faithful voters some will vote, the number of participants in the two parties increased by 1 per cent.
The economic climate has continued to deteriorate from the lowest point of view, the proportion of those who thought that the country's economic situation was particularly serious has never been as high, it rose to 41 per cent and, according to 46 per cent more, the situation is quite serious.
In view of the more optimistic prospects of spring and summer, families are again more pessimistic about their financial situation.
For the next year, the majority of the population is forecasting aggravation and only a tenth is expected to improve the situation.
Last December, 71 per cent of the surveyed, i.e. a majority never seen in Gallup's previous surveys, thought that the prime minister was doing his job rather than his job well.
13% of the polls have confidence or confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány, while 38% support Viktor Orbán.
54 per cent do not fully trust the Prime Minister and 27 per cent trust the President of Fidesz.
One indicator of change in the political situation is the proportion of society thinking that discontent towards the Prime Minister can be treated without government change.
While 35 per cent of the polls wanted the government and the Prime Minister to remain in office after the October summit, the rate is now only 20 per cent. The relative majority (33 per cent) believes that the holding of new elections would be the solution to this situation.
On the question of the intention to vote, 60 per cent of the polls replied that they would certainly vote and the 20 per cent additional said that they would probably vote.
To compare, for a "legislative election to be held next Sunday", only 55 percent of the polls would certainly participate and 15 percent would probably participate. Following the current intentions, the outcome of the referendum would have no doubt.
74 per cent of people would say no to enrollment rights in higher education, 79 per cent would say no to consultation costs and 84 per cent would say no to hospital stay costs.
When we look at only the same proportions among those who have expressed their intention to vote in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 per cent of voters would, respectively, reject the introduction of registration rights, consultation fees and hospital stay costs.
Auchan is the most expensive, Tesco has increased its prices by almost twenty percent
The hypermarkets in the trade triangle of Budaörs maintained the average price increase of 16 per cent last year compared to the rate of VAT that this year did not increase.
Article of Napi Šjság ( Daily Economy)
This year, in the trade triangle of Budaörs, the usual Christmas basket also increased by 16 per cent on average, a significantly higher value increase than a thousand stands in all supermarkets.
The prices, "which had already flown" in large food stores last December, have no longer increased brutally compared to the previous high base.
However, consumers are obviously shocked to see that the items purchased significantly below nine thousand forts last year now cost more than ten thousand forts.
The daily Cart in the surveyed hypermarkets exceeded 91 forints at least the psychological threshold of ten thousand forints.
And the highest value of the basket was 10,573 forints.
(In 2003, this value was 6,800 forints.)
The prices of the Unicum and the living fish remained almost at the level of last year, but the prices of the dinner, nail and peacock yarn have increased greatly.
In stores, the price of flour and bread followed KSH (Central Institute of Statistics) data, but at Auchan bread was found only one kilo to 139 forints.
Competition did not lower the price of the product below 200 forints.
It was surprising to see, also in this hypermarket, that the price of the two-litre bottle of Coca-Cola was below 200 forts, so it only cost 257 forts the bottle included.
It only prevents this year, after Daily Cart, Auchan was the most expensive and Cora was the least expensive.
According to our calculations, Cora increased the price of her Daily Cart by 15 percent while Tesco and Auchan increased them by about 18 percent and 18 percent respectively.
By comparing the most expensive basket of last year and the least expensive basket of this year, we find a 12 percent difference, while the difference between the least expensive of last year and the most expensive of this year is 21 percent.
Prices increased by 1,480 forints on average.
Last year, prices increased by 1,206 forts on average, while knowing that the impact of the increase in VAT rates had already been seen in last year's Christmas prices.
This process has made trade perplexed, hypermarkets could not clearly determine the margin to be applied to products as long as they were unable to predict the impact of price change on consumption.
(If a trader miscalculates the rotation of a product, he may lose a significant profit on the margin adapted to the intensity of the trade.)
As a result of a change in VAT rate, the price increase in the Daily Cart has changed so excessively that the most expensive cart was more than 1,720 forts than the value of 2006 whereas the difference between the least expensive carts was only 844 forts.
This year, the difference was not so excessive as the value of the most expensive basket was higher than 1,630 forges in the last year and prices at least increased by 1,284 forges.
By approaching the two Christmas seasons, we have seen a catastrophic increase in prices, in less than 20 months the prices of daily consumer goods have increased by more than 30 percent in hypermarkets.
(This does not necessarily confirm KSH data: for some first-time foods, the Institute of Statistics has found an increase in prices of more than 30 per cent in 12 months.
This is the case, for example, of flour and eggs.)
According to the Daily Cart of the latter, this seems almost absurd because the price level of this product, already expensive last year, has increased by almost 10 percent compared to the base.
According to the indicators, flour suppliers occupy a stronger position than egg suppliers because they have been able to accept the brutal increase in prices also by multinationals.
In the commercial gold triangle, the hypermarkets don't complain, they keep registering for good years.
According to our experience, the majority of customers no longer look at prices in the three hypermarketed visits.
They buy everything, they take long-lasting food with pallets.
On Wednesday morning, important cassettes were formed by the three hypermarkets as the number of customers increased abruptly.
However, according to our information, the number of business is less important in the province, many multinationals complain to polling companies that they do not even reach the planned number of business, not only for food but also for sustainable consumption.
Many hospitals save on disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand infections, caused mainly by the wrong use of antibiotics, were recorded in hospitals.
Hospital health conditions, insufficient number of beds, overcrowding of medical personnel do not help prevent infections, says the doctor at the National Epidemiology Centre.
Many hospitals also save on disinfectants
A MRSA infection has not long been diagnosed at the János hospital's traumaology service.
The antibiotic-resistant bacteria were detected on a hospitalized man following a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year, a similar infection occurred in the same place.
The injury of a serious car accident came out of the hospital but soon after it had to return because of a MRSA infection and, since then, doctors have not been able to perform an important operation because of the bacteria in his body.
Until 10 December this year, 1,094 hospital infections caused by a multi-resistant pathogen were reported to the National Nosocomial Monitoring System, Karolina Böröcz, a doctor at the National Epidemiology Centre, said.
To know that it is the number of infections caused by a multi-resistant pathogen that has actually been registered in hospitals and for the rest we have no information.
About two thirds of the infections (683 infections) were caused by MRSAs, in other words Staphylococcus aureus resistant to methyl oxyline.
One third of the people are carriers of Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria in their noses without developing a disease.
The infections caused by the SAs (such as angina, amygdalitis, skin infections, traumatic infections) respond well to antibiotics, they are easily curable.
However, if antibiotics are used excessively or inappropriately, the bacteria, which reacts well to antibiotics, will develop a highly resistant bacteria to antibiotics that will spread rapidly under poor hospital conditions.
In the event of temporary or prolonged immunosuppression, this bacteria may cause serious hospital infections, such as traumatic infection or septicaemia, on the elderly, with small weights or with a weak body.
According to hospital director János, there is nothing special about MRSA infections, these infections are part of the daily hospital.
It is not necessary to confuse the infection with the epidemic, but we do not find MRSA just the one or we do not find them," said Tibor Nyulasi.
The SAs are resistant to antibiotics.
"These patients are isolated, the nursing staff put rubber gloves and protective masks and we have suitable antibiotics to treat them," said Tibor Nyulasi.
In priority, hospitalized patients are examined if they are carriers of MRSA, but infection cannot always be avoided.
Sample sampling is not in mode
The vast majority of MRSA infections could be prevented, but the current conditions and circumstances are not favourable in Hungarian hospitals to prevent the development and proliferation of multi-resistant pathogens, says Karolina Böröcz.
As this infection occurs especially in hospitals and residences for elderly people, hospitals should control hospitalized patients and immediately isolate MRSA patients.
However, microbiological sampling is not fashionable in Hungarian hospitals.
It should be noted that the National Social Security Fund does not finance these examinations.
Most cases see only if MRSA infection is detectable on the patient, the physician at the head of the epidemiological center said.
The European Union has strong recommendations on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also Hungarian guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and syndromes.
Efforts should be made to target antibiotics, in other words microbiological tests should be carried out to prevent drug resistance, but hospitals are not always aware of this.
Microbiological sampling is even more rare in ambulatory and basic care, said Karolina Böröcz.
Many hospitals save on disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSAs spread from one patient to another most often through medical personnel.
It is therefore essential to wash your hands, put gloves and protective masks. However, important gaps are detected in hospitals in this area too.
MRSAs spread by infection transmitted by inhalation of drops and contact. However, due to conditions in Hungarian hospitals, the infected patient cannot always be isolated.
In addition, the rooms are often full, the beds are often too close to each other, while in the end of the epidemic, the patients should be removed from each other at least 1.5 metres.
Unfortunately, we also find that hospitals, in a difficult financial situation, make savings on disinfectants, they lack nurses, the sick are many, so the risk of contamination is even greater, said Karolina Böröcz.
According to Karolina Böröcz, in hospitals or preventive measures are respected, the number of infections is less demonstrable or then the proliferation of the pathogen agent can be blocked.
Government project against MRSA
The treatment of MRSA infection represents exorbitant costs for social security funds, which is why we are fighting this infection everywhere.
In England, for example, the government has established a programme to prevent or reduce the impact of MRSAs.
According to published data, this program is effective and MRSA infections show a decreasing trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has identified among its priorities the prevention of the incidence of multi-resistant pathogens (such as MRSAs) and the prevention of hospital infections caused by these pathogens.
The Commissioner, the author of a fatal accident, was not in a state of emergency
The official finding concerning the fatal accident caused by the Commissioner of the 22nd District was drawn up.
It may be excluded that the Commissioner of the 22nd District, who has been resigning from his post since, which has broken a pawn by causing his death on Tuesday, would have led to his death as an Ivorian or Etourdi, communicated on Friday Attila Morvai, spokesperson of the Ministry of Public Capital after the relative finding has been established.
The finding confirmed the first result of the investigation which had already found that the former commissioner had not consumed alcohol before taking a flight.
Last Tuesday, the former head of the 22nd circuit office broke down a 55-year-old man who was facing him when he turned, with his personal car, into the 22nd circuit Kossuth Lajos street.
(On the other hand, the fact that he was crossing the road outside the pedestrian pass is not an attenuating circumstance, according to the Road Code a car that starts a turn must let the pedestrian pass.)
The pedestrian died after being transported to the hospital.
As a result of this accident, the Commissioner resigned from his position and requested his retirement because, according to the police report, he was greatly disturbed by the accident.
The inquiry into this case is carried out by the Prosecutor in charge of the investigations in Budapest.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former commissioner had cooperated from the outset with the magistrates responsible for conducting the investigation.
EUR 400 million additional for infrastructure
János Veres, Hungarian Finance Minister, and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed three agreements in Budapest on Friday with a total value of EUR 400 million for a credit line to support education, transport and environmental infrastructure and energy.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) adopted a budget of EUR 300 million for the Hungarian budgetary financing of transport and environmental projects to be implemented from the Cohesion Fund, with a credit agreement of EUR 100 million already signed by the parties.
The EUR 150 million credit agreement also covers budgetary funding for education-related projects.
The EIB has approved a total amount of EUR 300 million for Hungary, and the remaining EUR 150 million will be used later, as a result of the extension of the credit agreement.
The parties have signed a 50 million-euro contract for innovation, the state budget will use this envelope primarily in the context of the research and development project to be carried out at the University of Debrecen.
During the negotiations, the project on line 4 of the subway was also addressed.
The parties agreed that they would rescind the possible modification of the initial contract when Hungary has completed the details of the financing of the metro with the EU.
According to János Veres, this could be done in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has granted a total of €8.4 billion to finance 113 projects in Hungary.
The EIB shall grant its appropriations according to the interest rate associated with EURIBOR, with a grace period of 8 years and without a commitment commission.
Bulgaria, EU real estate market paradise
The evolution of the Bulgarian real estate market is spectacular, the attention of the whole of Europe is turned to this little-quoted Balkan country in the past.
What, or who buys on this EU market that is always the least expensive but will quickly become expensive?
Analysis of the Bulgarian Re/Max division.
At present, in the real estate, Bulgaria is undoubtedly the most promising target in Eastern Europe with its ski apartments and houses on the edge of the good sea.
In the mountains, the most popular regions are Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa and, on the seashore, Albéna, the "Golden Sables", the "Sun Coast", the former Sozopol and Nessebar, but they are increasingly looking for an apartment in the Kavarna and Balcik region as well.
According to Re/Max Bulgaria analysts, sooner or later, the central region of the country, Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna, will also raise the interest of investors and they are also increasing to buy in the very low cost corner of Russia.
Sofia, the capital, also offers attractive opportunities, trade and office surfaces promise the highest rate of amortization.
Bulgaria is on the way to becoming one of Europe's most attractive golf courses and thus a priority destination, after the summer season and winter season, also in the other two seasons of the year.
More vigilant investors already buy a large number, for example in the Bansko corner.
According to analysts, people who buy a building in Bulgaria are at the same time trying to change their life, their lifestyle.
Most buyers are English but others arrive from France, Belgium, Spain and Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot investors are also present. On board the Black Sea and in the most famous ski resorts, we traditionally meet many Russian buyers.
Foreign buyers are divided into three groups, says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
People who want to install are buying renovated buildings, at a price ranging from EUR 50 to 100 thousand, or from old houses, at a price ranging from EUR 5 to EUR 15 thousand, which are then renovated.
The criteria are easy access and communication opportunities, the proximity of a large city, shops and, in general, that of the local doctor.
The second group includes secondary residence buyers (since last December, Bulgaria is mentioned among the first 10 holiday destinations in Germany).
The third group is composed of commercial investors who purchase in the hope of achieving a medium to long-term added value.
The price of capital buildings increases continuously as a result of increasing demand.
In the European Union, real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria. However, in the last five years, they have increased by 21% each year.
The increase in real estate prices is mainly higher than the increase in wages.
Fodor and six percent Hungarian
According to Gábor Fodor, Minister of Environment and Water, professional meetings will end on Tuesday, however, on Wednesday, after official opening, the Ministers' negotiations on the post-2012 international climate regime will continue.
Experts and political men from 192 countries around the world will discuss the proposed Bali Roadmap to define the efforts to be made after the emission reduction period defined by the Kyoto Protocol until 2012.
At this point, lively discussions are being held between developing countries and developed countries.
The United States also noted that, for the time being, they did not wish to discuss exact figures, but were ready to sign a reduction agreement by 2020 for greenhouse gas emissions of 25 to 40 per cent compared to 1990 levels.
Another important topic of the conference is whether developed countries commit themselves, without reducing emissions, to providing financial and technological assistance to countries that need it.
An agreement was also signed on aid to developing countries.
The aid fund defined by the Kyoto Protocol will be managed by a 16-member board of directors, probably within the framework of the United Nations Global Environment Facility (GEF), Piac es Profit (Marké et Profit).
The six per cent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Mr Gábor Fodor, Minister of Environment and Water, confirms the EU's ambition to retain its role as an admiral ship in global efforts to protect the climate and to encourage the signing of the new international agreement before 2009.
The Minister explained that the EU was committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 by 20% compared to the 1990 level, regardless of the success of the signing of the 2012 Agreement, and was willing to reduce them to 30% if the other major regions of the world and/or developing countries were also willing to make appropriate commitments to their responsibilities and capacities.
Gábor Fodor recalled that in 1997, the signatory countries of the Kyoto Protocol had a total reduction of 5.2 per cent and the total of 15 EU members at that time had made a commitment of 8 per cent less.
Hungary has undertaken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 per cent over the period between 1985 and 1987, our country will fulfil its commitment, recalls the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
The issue is large in Bali because the long-term international agreement on climate policy should be implemented within two years, otherwise the entry into force of the agreement would certainly be postponed after 2012. In this case, the commitments to reduce below the values set out in the Kyoto Protocol would not be followed immediately by a new international emission reduction system that has been highlighted in the new IPCC report, an international scientific body, which has obtained the Nobel Peace Prize, which is responsible for climate change.
The reduction in emissions would be delayed and the average temperature of Earth's more than 2 degrees Celsius could no longer be avoided which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irreversible consequences.
British Army Recruited on YouTube
The British Army's units provide video-sharing sites with recordings made during their operations in Iraq and Afghanistan in order to become popular.
First, it is the British Air Force (RAF) that has been passionate about YouTube: the special units involved in Afghanistan are reporting video sequences on Taliban operations since March 2006, the BBC announced.
These recordings, with the help of miniature cameras mounted on the helmet, are controlled at the air force operations headquarters in Kandahar and are then transferred to London or the compatriots charge them on the Internet.
The political message is unsurpassed
Air Force soldiers have already passed 139 sequences on the net through this route and their "chain" has been seen by more than 75 thousand people.
The Department of British Defence was registered as "defenceheadquarters" in the spring of 2007 and provides video on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the Commonwealth Office and the international peacekeeping forces in Iraq (MNFI) also have their own YouTube channels.
Mission in Afghanistan
According to the initial objective of the Air Force, the videos were broadcast online to recruit. According to the Ministry of Defence, they were also used to make public the real objectives of the presence of the army abroad.
The propaganda published by this route cost virtually nothing compared to the usual TV recruitment advertisements, as reported to BBC Gordon Mackenzie, consulting in defense. On the other hand, it also inevitably contains a political message, as it is specializing in justifying the well-founded military operations decided by the government.
The Americans have made a game
The army is emboldened because, in addition to carefully composed and censored videos, amateur videos are passed on the sharing site that also present soldiers' death: in "official" propaganda films, a few hypocrites, officers do not avoid talking about losses but they never present the bloody side of the battle.
In addition, many videos have already been posted on the network presenting operational areas in Iraq and Afghanistan that were carried out in a real mission, but the British army is only about to load these videos.
The Americans do the recruitment a little differently by using the American's Army rifle game for free. In this game, the player can directly replace the soldiers as part of a more or less real simulation.
Noël Tombola and Beans in the Ministries
Monika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, does not seem to be sentimental: instead of celebrating Christmas, she will hold an end-of-year meeting with her collaborators who will be able to say goodbye to the year 2007 by taking beigets and coffee.
Another department will organize a live music party, another will charm the officials with a tomboola and offer a glass to create a Christmas atmosphere.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffets, so enjoy the power.
The public authorities are also preparing Christmas.
This year, the largest Christmas party will be organized by the Ministry of Defence, but it is not the employees of the Ministry who will be invited.
In Christmas, the Orphans, children of fallen soldiers will receive gifts for the missionary Christmas, family members of soldiers currently serving in foreign missions are invited and a press reception will also take place.
The Department provides for a budget of 25 million forts to create the year-end environment.
Compared to other departments, the National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economic and Transport (GKM) will celebrate.
The GKM festival will be held in the House of the Future with a total budget of 4,320,000 forints and, of the six hundred large employees, three hundred and fifty were expected.
At this festival, the Christmas atmosphere will be harsh, there will be actors and also a tomboola.
The NFÜ Christmas cost 4,700,000 forints and was organized on Wednesday in the National Justice Council (ILO) building with concerts and dinner.
The room rental cost one million forints, the rest was spent for more than four hundred guests.
According to our information, a NFÜ service is invited to another Christmas party, which is organised with European money by the National Centre for Economic Development, company manager of tenders.
The building of the Theatre of the Gaíté has been rented for these purposes.
This information has not been confirmed by MAG Zrt because we have not been able to contact the person responsible.
The custom is not mandatory
The ILO building not only hosted the NFÜ but also the Ministry of Justice and Police who, instead of a Christmas party, held a ball at St. Luca's on December 7th.
The ILO has not caused them to pay for the use of its rooms.
The ball had five hundred people.
The festival began with the Minister's welcome words and dinner was followed by a dancing evening on live music.
Answer to the [origo] question: the evening party was not absolutely obligatory for this ball.
Departments of Health, Labour and Local Communities prepare a party.
The Ministry of Health will organize a show and a party to its employees, in its walls, for 400,000 forints.
On the other hand, Monika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, does not officially invite her employees to a Christmas party but to an end-of-year working meeting.
One hundred and twenty people are expected to be invited to take a coffee and eat beiges, have reported the press service, the party will not cost as well as 350,000 forints.
Gordon Bajnai, Minister of Local Communities, will simply invite his collaborators to take a glass in the Ministry of Local Communities and territorial planning.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will host a Christmas party in its large room where 436 employees are expected.
It spends 2,500 forts per guest including a buffet and a glass.
Since the arrival of János Veres, PM employees have celebrated Christmas every year in the same way.
No expected holiday environment, the official character is strengthened not only by the Minister's presentation but also by the time of the festival that took place in the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture will host a reception on January 20 to celebrate the new year, and the Christmas party will not take place.
The reception will be held at the Vajdahunyad Castle, located in the City Woods, and according to the department's communication, 1,000 forts per person are calculated for hundreds of guests.
According to the press service, this will be a very simple cocktail to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
These cocktails, organized every year, start with a few words of welcome from the Minister followed by a modest meal.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture are not celebrating Christmas, they have communicated to [origo] their respective press services.
The Press Service of the Ministry of the Environment did not know the price of the official Christmas party.
However, more than four hundred people were invited to the festival organized at the Museum of Decorative Art.
The forces of the grave mega gather
The League's trade unions and the National Association of Workers' Councils will be their strike committee on Friday, which will be responsible for coordinating the indefinite strike on Monday.
On Saturday, a general assembly of protests will be held and Monday, on the day of the final vote on the Health Box Act, the strike will begin.
This action will certainly lead to major loopholes in traffic as rail traffic will be halted almost completely and BKV employees (common transport company) will also make up to 1 p.m.
The League's Trade Unions will announce, on Friday afternoon, the details of their strike on Monday, organized with the National Association of Workers' Councils.
The LIGA - MOSZ strike committee will also be established, serving as coordinator of the Monday actions.
On Saturday, a general assembly of protests will be held and from Monday, organizations joining the strike will stop work for an indefinite period if they fail to reach agreement with the government.
This means that the date of the end of the strike, starting on the day of the vote in Parliament on the Health Box Act, is not defined.
If the National Assembly does not adopt the Health Box Act, the unions will immediately withdraw the appeal to strike.
On the other hand, if the law is passed, the strike commissions will meet and decide from time to time.
According to the order of Monday of the National Assembly, the vote on the Health Box Act is likely to take place only late at night or at night.
Due to the strike scheduled for Monday, important loops are planned in traffic: railways will stop work for an indefinite period and during the morning part of the public transport in Budapest and more than half of Volán companies may be stopped.
At the same time, at different points in the country, half of the road will also be blocked.
Many unions and civil organizations have joined the strike call, and the list of these is updated continuously on the League's website.
Some organizations report a strike for an indefinite period of time; others reported a temporary cessation of work.
Until Thursday afternoon the MÁV (Hungarian Railways) and the Free Roads Union (VDSZZSZ) have failed to reach agreement on the minimum services, gold, at the approach of Christmas parties, more and more are taking the train.
According to current communications, the public transport of Budapest will record the start of service until 1 p.m., the Budapest Airport between 7 and 9 p.m., the Industrial Energy and Electricity Unions of the League will record four hours, the Teachers' Union and the Teachers' Democratic Union have called to record for 2 hours and 2 hours to 8 hours respectively.
The National Association of Doctors will strike across the country in a different way, the Health and Social Employees Union (EDDSZ) attached to the SZEF will strike a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four claims, made by the League, requires that the Government withdraw its proposal on health reform and submit a new concept to the social debate.
The second claim requires the new method of calculating retirement to be introduced from next year to be introduced in several stages.
The third claim seeks a guarantee, in respect of retirement before the legal age, which would allow the functions that deserve it to be transferred into the system before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is the rejection by the Free Trade Union of Roads (VDSZSZZ), linked to the League's Trade Unions, the proposal by the Ministry of Economics and Transport concerning secondary railway lines and the expectation of another proposal.
Political Capital: The Hungarian Guard has increased the risk of countries
According to the Risk Analysis Division of Political Capital (Risk Analysis Division), the activities of the Hungarian Guard, formed last August, with the support of the Jobbik Magyarországért Mozgalom (Movement for a Better Hungary) increase, in several respects, the political risk of Hungary and the region.
In its "risk warning", the company notes that, in relation to the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the greatest political risk is already that "in the short term, aggressive ethnic confrontations can occur as a result of the exacerbation of the existing ethnic tension between the Tzigan and non-Tjigan population of Hungary".
The Research Institute added that the Hungarian Guard's political strategy to probably provoke this situation is the main reason.
As they say, this is explained by one of the main shortcomings of Hungarian political actors: "public actors have passed the public debate on Roma affairs to representatives of radical and extreme political groups that have based a political strategy on the dispute between the Tzigans and the Hungarians".
The problem is compounded, normal dialogue becomes impossible, extremists are strengthened, and the occurrence of aggressive conflicts is more likely, they say.
However, according to the research institute, under the increased attention of the Hungarian and international media, the activities of the Hungarian Guard "has significantly worsened Hungary's image abroad, in particular with regard to the country's confidence in stability and democratic maturity".
They recall that, following a greater publicity given to the reorganization of the Hungarian radical and extreme right groups since fall 2006, many associations have been formed in Hungary since summer 2007 and are called "the National Self-Defense Association".
"The common feature of these meetings is that they define themselves as a civil organization when they publicly declare the preparation of their adherents to defence missions (accidents, national defence, defence of order), armed if necessary, by referring to the inability of the police, the army, in other words of the state," they added.
They reported that everything was done according to the method, which, based on the resentment of the political society and the parties, seeks to deduce different political ambitions in a civil way.
The emphasis on the civil character and status of the association is therefore only to avoid legal traps from registering these associations in court, but they are also a political strategy.
The analysis indicates that the activities of the Hungarian Guard are a factor that also increases the risk of neighbourly relations.
"In recent months, many neighbouring countries have cited the Hungarian Guard as a potential source of risk and the ultra-nationalist political actors in certain border countries want to justify their anti-Hungarian policies by referring to the constitution of the Hungarian Guard.
This affects the political stability of the region," they added.
According to the research institute, the Constitution of the Hungarian Guard is not a unique phenomenon in Central Eastern Europe, political risks have increased throughout the region.
As they say, the functioning of the Hungarian Guard, for example, is similar to the activities of the Bulgarian National Guard whose constitution was declared by the Bulgarian National Union (BNU) in August 2007.
The many disturbances of the Roma that broke up in a district of Sofia (Krasna Poljana) are at the origin of the Bulgarian Guard.
By taking advantage of these events, UNB has decided to establish a security guard saying that the organization's objective is "national self-defence".
According to them, in the last 17 years, the gypsies have "terrorized" Bulgaria, but the state has remained inactive and neutral, recalls Political Capital.
They added that the initiative had sparked lively debates in Bulgarian public opinion.
As they say, the statement by some Bulgarian Roma organizations on the establishment of their own resistance guard indicates an increase in the risk of ethnic clashes.
The functioning of the Hungarian Guard showing similarities with that of the Bulgarian National Guard does not exclude the Hungarian Roma from responding to the same threat by organizing their own self-defence, can be read in the Warning of Political Capital Risk.
At the request of the telegraphic agency, Attila Juhász, Research Director of Political Capital, said: Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, their risk analysis was published every year and if events occurred that could have an impact on the change in risk, they informed the public opinion, as in the present case, by publishing a risk warning.
The party is not marked in red everywhere
In Hungary, the law precisely defines holidays and, around the holidays, it has become common to reorganize working days whose number will be reduced next year.
The parties are not uniform in the EU and the United States.
Hungarian legislation distinguishes national and state holidays as well as rest days.
Rest days are often associated with religious holidays or important historical events.
In Hungary, we celebrate the new year, the last day of the year that ends, and the first day of the new year are also days of rest, the new one more so that the wake-ups can rest quietly.
Moreover, in one year, we have all eleven parties marked in red.
March 15 is a national festival, commemorating the 1848 revolution, as well as October 23 which is the commemorative day of the 1956 revolution.
On August 20th, we celebrate the constitution of our state, on May 1st is the feast of work, and on November 1 and 2, we remember members of our family and friends who died.
In addition, we have two days in Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
The days of our state, national or religious holidays are rarely on a weekend, according to the calendar, it has become common to reorganize working days in cases or there is only one working day before or after the red-marked festival.
It is true that we pay the price of extended weekends by working or going to school on Saturday before the extended weekend.
For many years, the Minister of Labour has been in a special regulation on the days before or after the holidays.
The law extends to all employers and their employees, to employees and persons working in the public service.
However, it does not apply to service companies, institutions that are running without interruption and in service, by their vocation, and also to rest days.
This year, working days will only be changed around the end of the year: from 24 December, life stops almost all over the country because, according to experience, most people make extra hours or take vacations they have saved for these purposes to spend the days between Christmas and New Year's Day at home.
The next year many parties fall in the middle of the week or at the end of the week, so there will be less change in working days than this year.
The schedule will be reorganized for the first time around the work party to allow employees to stay at their home for four days.
Saturday 25 April will be a working day to have a rest day on Friday 2 May.
Another change is scheduled for 23 October: Saturday 18 October will be a working day replacing Friday 24.
On the other hand, next year, the end of the year is announced under the sign of the feasts because from December 24, everyone will take a non-stop break even if the New Year's day falls on a Wednesday.
Six stupid things that can make my colleagues feel terrible
E-mails that we forget to send, voice messages that we never get, innocent lies that touch us almost more: these are things that "pretend" the daily life of a workplace.
The question is whether we get used to these nuisances or we face the challenge and deliberately avoid the ambiguities, causing them to be boring to others.
Examples.
"Excuse me, I forgot to tell you that you were called the marketing service," said a colleague.
That you missed a date?
He is best sorry and tries to arrange things by calling the marketing service to tell them that he has forgotten to pass the message (this is the least common solution).
In most cases, the thing is arranged with excuses.
Before you have painful explanations, it is helpful to think about how you can cause unpleasant moments to your colleagues and try to avoid them.
Do you borrow anything that doesn't belong to you?
There's nothing more annoying than wanting to take a file, a desk tool or the phone and you don't find them anywhere.
Remember when you woke her up on the desk, but she disappeared the next morning?
You happen to find your style that you thought was lost on your colleague's office?
Don't take anything from your colleagues without asking them if they're right to be angry with you for having taken their goods.
It doesn't bring any envelopes, it's in your pocket because it can be embarrassing that there's no more envelopes and you need them right away.
Are you talking about the privacy of colleagues?
There's no good way to stop torrents that are spreading.
Who did what, with whom?
Or why?
Don't tell everyone about the privacy of your colleagues!
If a colleague shares his intimate secrets with you, don't underestimate his trust!
Please bury the information you have shared and do not discuss it with your colleagues in your absence, even if your colleagues are also aware of it.
You're saying you're sick for no reason?
When you call the office and you say you're sick because you feel bad or you think you need rest that day, think that your work, your urgent business, your final missions must be done by someone else in your place.
Don't make friends with your colleagues!
If you know in advance that the next day you're not going to work or that something might happen that would make you stay home, don't forget to prevent your boss and your colleagues from freaking out about your absence the next day.
Cooling, recuperating, telephone
You get involved in your work, but getting rid of your colleagues is getting you into a lot of trouble?
Did you become, without wishing, a witness to a phone conversation you'd better not listen to?
Do not disturb your colleagues with coldings, singings, loud discussions (which you lead above their heads), beatings of feet, loud words or dissatisfaction expressed in loud voices.
They may interfere even if your colleagues are not involved in a project (editing, design, organization).
You're accusing the others of a mistake?
If your work is not done for the fixed time, you forget to send an email or an important message, don't blame anyone for that!
Don't put it on account of any chaos in your office or your noisy colleagues!
Do you recognize him if you've made a mistake and if he's presented some inconveniences to others, fix the mistake!
Ask how you could fix your fault, fix your neglect!
You feel too much at your office?
Putting a jogging and shoes is comfortable at home but they don't fit in the office!
Don't put comfortable jogging even if your function allows it!
Don't be neglected, respect your colleagues and yourself by dressing properly, and if your function requires it by wearing beautiful and elegant clothes, to go to work!
If you want to respond to expectations, you're not interested anymore.
We move slowly in the usual morning hole.
Suddenly, a particular melody is heard on the radio: the voice of a violin to which electronic effects are associated.
I'm up to them.
The music changes rhythm and the bass arrives to accompany the tones all the time, then a female choral comes along as a real jewel.
Mr.2 spread the song Wings of Love from Zagar.
The Hungarian musical life has not been wasted for a long time with an electronic pop of good quality.
Now it seems that the hole becomes different if you listen to the new Zagar album.
The appearance of Yonderboi, the few interesting new productions born of the Hungarian digital underground are beginning to gradually change the overall image and, despite the new mode of the garage rock decoupling the guitar, the Hungarian electroup proves that there is new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer came from Pécs and he was playing himself in the Yonderboi group before he launched on his own path, perhaps because "there is no room for two feet in the same shoe".
His project (Zagar) and his music, an ally of jazz, electronic dancing and pop music, began to become known when he was entrusted with the composition of filmed soundtracks (e.g.
The Ferenc Trök season).
The training at the beginning of small clubs began to be known by a larger audience when the magazine wan2 quoted their first album in 2002 among the 50 most important discs of the Hungarian market and proclaimed Zagar, with Yonderboi, the almost only creators of the Hungarian trend that would be as competitive in the West.
Zagar and his whole became unquestionably "trendy", but no one asked them if they wanted to wear this label.
The group responded as needed, it released a new and better disc.
The album entitled Cannot Walk Fly Instead, recently released, can open new paths for them, although the title wants to represent continuity with past years in Pécs.
It was a line from the old group of Balázs Zságer Pécs.
We are well with the reference to the flight but next to the air music now appears, according to the spirit and trend of the time, the strongest guitar, impact of rock and roll.
György Ligeti, a singer currently working in England with The Puzzle group, showed his talent in these songs at the first album in the Millennium Park.
On the album, there is a real tube for radio, Mr.2 Petõfi, who has just been spreading popular music from morning to evening, began to introduce the music of Wings of Love recorded with six Hungarian singers ("underground Divas").
So everything is fine (?).
hvg.hu asked questions at Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new tube motivates me to ask a question: is your music well left a music aimed at a certain layer?
Zságer Balázs: The term music aimed at a certain layer doesn't tell me much.
For me there are two castes in light music; not mainstream or underground, not alternative or pop, but commercial music and sincere music.
Music itself saying alternative, underground can also be medieval and made only for sale and become commercial.
However, a good pop song can also be sincere.
The attitude of reception also works in this spirit regardless of language or borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference between the Hungarian and foreign public, is one or the other more open to your music?
Zs.B.: Abroad, especially in the west, light music has older traditions.
There, people go to concerts and not only the young people of a decade or twenty years but also the older ones.
They follow with much more attention the changes in light music because they think it is also part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the public in your work?
Are you interested in knowing who, or how many people listen to your music?
Zs.B.: I'm obviously glad to see people coming to our concerts more and more.
However, we have never made music for the market.
For us, music is not made to achieve a goal but for a precise reason.
The role of the public is more important to concerts or mutual influence already works, but it is only perceived in the inevitable changes of the moment.
But I noticed that if you wanted to respond to public expectations, you wouldn't be more interesting.
hvg.hu: Are you trying to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He works alone and has made a career in the west.
Zs.B.: We don't really follow his way even though sometimes some try to find traces in our music.
Instead, we are team players who have confidence in the musical presence of the other and let it take place.
At first, it was inevitable that our music would be compared to Yonderboi because we are several to leave his group and take another path.
hvg.hu: On Mr.2 Petõfi's palm, Wings of Love takes the first place.
Many have heard the name Zagar for the first time by the way of this song.
With this more popular style, have you deliberately opened to a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We did not plan to make a tube to sell the disk.
This song means more.
We wanted it for the end of the album to try to reduce the orgy of sounds and the most difficult themes discussed on the whole disk.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why were they - what was the guideline?
Zs.B.: The idea was to have a gospel-like choral.
We had the idea to compose this choral of good soloists from the Hungarian music scene.
The choir was composed of six members, namely Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Peterfy, Enikõ Hodasi [Neo], Juci Németh, who was then baptized Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Did you want this song like this or did the girls change it a little?
Zs.B.: This piece has been in an instrumental version for a long time and then when we composed the album, we thought that something was still missing from this song.
The following agreements attracted the voice of the song.
I sang the song the night the girls learned later.
I had it almost all at once and everything was terribly spontaneous.
I remember that this galvanized me at the time, but of course we needed the Divas.
With my voice, she wouldn't have had the same strength.
hvg.hu: On the disc and concert it also seemed to me that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo (with the exception of Judy Jay's short solo), they have no role alone, they all sing together and they don't sing louder than music, so music does only accompany their song.
They were back on the stage too.
Is that what you want?
Zs.B.: The fact that they were in the background is only technical problems.
On the other hand, what was voluntary was that we did not want to distribute soloist roles.
The song also says that we must forget our ego a little, forget which comes from where, who goes or, we just have to let these wings, wings of love, take us.
I also wanted others to feel this euphoric state that we felt when the song was born.
hvg.hu: Which songs made you work the most?
Zs.B.: Actually, none of the music creation processes, we had more difficult pieces during the mix.
For example, with Dorian Gray's Dilemma, or I'm playing a concert piano, or with Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, or the groove didn't want to work for long, and then, small and small, everything went into place like in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite about the new album?
Zs.B.: It changes all the time with the concerts and because I've already released this disc.
At this point, these are Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
The trading fiduciary risk of billions due to its inferiority complex
It's a dissimulant fraud.
This is how his former employee the French giant designates the General Society, owner of the Czech bank Komerczyn banka.
The bank lost nearly five billion euros because of it.
Instead, it seems that Kerviel is only a great player who wanted to equal his colleagues, and who, in addition, cannot be considered as incapable at all.
In contrast to all large banking houses, he recognized in time the crisis in the US mortgage market.
"He's fragile," they let his superiors hear him report to the police.
However, if this is the case in Kerviel's report by the French media, including Le Monde, this man's transactions have produced a profit of EUR 1.6 billion at the end of last year.
The crisis exceeds the United States
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he says in the statement.
Last summer, he managed to take advantage of the American crisis to earn half a billion euros.
In fact, he felt the opportunity from the beginning of the year.
Information began to emerge in February that the so-called "sub-prime" mortgages granted to low-income customers or to those who had encountered difficulties in the past would have problems.
But this crisis should not affect the economy as a whole.
Kerviel didn't believe it and he put it well.
Thus, at the end of the year, its benefits amounted to EUR 1.6 billion.
"As soon as I won my first half billion, I didn't know how to announce it," Kerviel confides and adds that he has, of course, nothing saved for himself."
Throughout the interrogation, he admitted to falsifying the reports so as not to be disappointed.
He managed to divest his superiors, although the Eurex Stock Exchange began to take an interest in his transactions.
There's nothing at all that's at stake.
Did he fear being discovered?
Not at all.
"I thought the simple thing about getting 1.6 billion for the bank was going to satisfy them."
Where did he come from to risk so much?
He only got to his position gradually.
He had started working at the General Society in 2000 just after finishing his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was about $51 thousand.
Two years later, he was already a trade assistant and in 2005, he became an independent trade with an annual salary of $90 thousand.
Yet he knew he would never win as much as the others.
"Since my first interview in 2005, I knew I was much less considered than the others.
In view of my university course and my professional and personal course," Kerviel said to investigators.
Soon after his entry into office, he won his first great success.
Thanks to Allianz's actions, he won half a billion euros by putting down this title during the London attacks.
And the mechanism was triggered - he wanted more.
As long as you win, we leave you alone.
"It was like a snowball effect," he told the police.
But the superiors were aware of everything, or rather, they doubted it.
"As long as I won, they seemed to close their eyes."
But that's when the start of the year starts.
He loses a billion euros in one day.
In mid-January, after the weekend, he decided to hide the sum.
Monday, when he gets to work, he's no longer a bank employee.
A few days later, the bank announced that it had lost EUR 5 billion because of it.
And how did we find out?
He became a suspect because of his leave.
"Last year, I took only 4 days off.
A trader who does not take vacations is a trader who does not want to leave his book to another," Kerviel concludes.
Czech Republic on the occasion of obtaining 365 billion
Yesterday, the Czech Government ministers signed nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, which could, in the coming years, bring EUR 14 billion (approximately EUR 365 billion of Czech crowns) to the Czech Republic.
This is almost half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
About 125 billion crowns from seven operational programmes will be for the Czech regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain approximately 100 billion crowns under the Enterprise and Innovation programme.
The transport sector will benefit most, up to 150 billion.
The Transport programme is the most important operational programme and represents up to 22% of the financial resources that the Czech Republic can obtain from these projects.
This will result in an increase in the budget of the National Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will manage a total of 90.8 billion crowns next year.
The Enterprise and Innovation programme, for SMEs and entrepreneurs, must provide financial means to encourage innovation within the company.
Businesses should have financial means for the introduction of new technologies, research in industry, but also for the introduction of new more efficient management methods.
To date, the Czech Republic has been one of the least successful beneficiaries of EU funds among the new members.
The Tribunal confirmed the 20-year prison sentence for the former President of Nicaragua
The Nicaraguan Court of Appeal confirmed on Thursday the 20-year prison sentence for the former president of the country Arnold Alemán, to which he was sentenced in 2003 for a fraud of $100 million (about 1.8 billion crowns).
However, later he was released and was assigned to live in his farm near the capital of Nicaragua.
If the former head of this Central American state, depending on 1997-2002, will or will not be re-incarcerated at the moment, according to the AP, it is not clear.
According to the President of the Ileana Perez Court of Appeal, everything will now depend on prison officials, or they will either let Germany finish his sentence at his home, or he will go back to prison.
4 years ago, the Tribunal proved that Germany regularly moved the government’s money to foreign companies’ accounts in Panama.
These were fictitious companies and accounts were actually owned by members of his family and his closest supporters.
Some of this money went to the funds that Germany had created to finance its electoral campaign in 2001.
Budget adopted
That's right.
The State budget was adopted.
In what is this budget exceptional?
This is the first budget designed by this government and accepted by the government majority without the support of the opposition.
This year he spent a year with the support of the Czech Socialist Party - ČSSD, as sobotka Minister had prepared it and ČSSD could not afford to refuse it.
In contrast to the debate that preceded the vote on the government's statement of opposition, nothing has been dramatic this time.
The House of Deputies has adopted this law without any problem, which, although the most influential, is usually neglected.
That's kind of a paradox.
Whether we want it or not, each chapter and every article is the beginning and the end of any government.
The budget is an integral part of the policy, although it is hidden behind the competition for opposing government and opposition.
The latter is more attractive media and is therefore given more attention in the media.
Political men’s disputes are much more interested in opinion than in abrupt figures.
The national budgets of past socialist governments suffered from three ills that the current budget is not capable of settling at the same time:
The first is the important part of the bill's mandate costs, consisting not only of pensions, but also of social charges, adopted last year by the silent "coalition" bringing together the ČSSD and KSČM parties.
The second is a deficit economy, as a result of the first evil.
The third obstacle is the lack of public finances, i.e. the lack of cities and municipalities.
However, this is not the deficit of the state budget which is the largest allea.
He is both public and under control.
The real delay bomb is the deficit of cities and municipalities.
Many mayors often issued obligations, disproportionately disbursing their municipalities, to obtain, apart from money from taxes, tax duties and bank credits, new sources of investment.
In the past years, they managed to repay these debts through the wholesale sale of shares of distribution systems, including those of energy generated by the State as part of privatisation.
Today, they no longer have this source.
If only official and verifiable facts are adhered to, it is found that:
Our economy has been going through for several years, like the rest of the world, a phase of growth and ČSSD is not missing to sell.
It was a unique opportunity for the successive governments of this party to regulate public finances.
But instead, they owed the state more and more.
Other countries, with a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania or Egypt, have managed their affairs in a much more reasonable way than our republic.
It is a monstrous shame that comes mainly from the previous governments.
We are among the countries that are at the global level the least threatened by poverty.
We therefore have no need for massive social programs that have been, just in recent years, unfortunately uselessly inflamed.
Although some of the absurd populist expenditures approved last year before the elections have been eliminated, if a breakdown of the age limit for retirement and a reform of the retirement system will not take place soon, then any policy will cease to exist in that country and whoever is in power will only administer it.
By exaggerating, it can be said that political men in power will become bureaucrats that mechanically distribute the majority of the money imposed between pensions and social benefits.
That is why the current budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the mechanism that makes regular costs responsible by the cost of mandates.
The deficit of 70 billion for 2008 would be absolutely unnecessary if the previous governments had not disbursed all the money they could.
If we really do not want it to happen that policies in power become simple bureaucrats, we need to be patient and give this fragile government coalition, aware that the State can only spend the equivalent of what it can collect in taxes and tax rights, the calm necessary for the preparation of new reform laws.
There are only those who will gradually reach a balanced state budget.

Banks want to resolve the crisis
The Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the British, Swiss and Canadian central banks have decided to fight together the financial market crisis.
More than a hundred billion dollars will thus be placed on monetary markets through auctions.
It will be for banks to sell, through a system of auctions, the interest rates at which they are willing to borrow money.
For example, the United States will send $40 billion to the auctions and will also provide $24 billion to the European and Swiss Central Banks.
This is the first time since the attacks of 11 September that the Central Banks of individual States have decided to take action at this concerted point to prevent or reduce the effects of the financial crisis.
"This approach tends to solve major economic problems, that is, the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend," wrote Bernard Baumohl's customer report to the Economic Advisory Company Outlook Group.
"The concerted action of the Central Banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the United States from 65 percent to about 50 percent," Baumohl adds in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion due to unpaid loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts are still waiting for other losses in billions.
"If the Central Banks have chosen this approach, they need to really understand what can still be learned," said the economist head of ABN Amro Kieran Davies.
"It seems the situation is really bad," he adds.
The Central Banks are afraid that if banks themselves have difficult access to loans, they will lend more to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and sink the American economy into a recession that could influence the economic growth of the world.
The Central Banks made this choice after failed to reduce London's interbank rate, called LIBOR, used to borrow on the interbank market.
This meant that banks were always afraid of mutual loans, although the U.S., Canadian and English Central Banks had repeatedly reduced their interest rates during the fall.
"It will have the same effect as a new decline in interest rates," Reuters Greg Salvaggio told Tempus Consulting.
Some analysts do not believe that the Central Bank approach will contribute to conjure up the crisis, since it does not solve the main problem that is the fall in the US real estate market.
President Klaus: The debate of environmentalists is incredible
Global climate change is considered to be particularly harmful to developing countries.
President Václav Klaus again spoke on the issue of global warming.
The criticism this time of the United Nations International Conference on Climate Change ended in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book The Blue Planet, not Green, he said that the debates of environmentalists were incredible.
According to Klaus, this is not only the structure of the conference, which consists of a curious mix of representatives of governments and non-governmental organizations, which is unacceptable, but also the fundamental difference between rhetoric and reality.
"The debate is not structured at all, it is just a burst of words, replacing solutions to current problems," Klaus said.
The Czech President stressed, at the presentation of his book, that his subject was of great importance to him and that is why he is so committed to this cause.
He also expressed his satisfaction with what his book also looked like in a German translation, as he said, "I often meet only the cartoon of my opinions."
Interested persons can now read their positions without being distorted.
Klaus recalled that although he was not a climate scientist, he had, in his opinion, enough provisions to write such a book.
He is indeed an academic able to monitor and appreciate scientific treaties, he has the practice of statistics and he is also an economist.
The main conclusions of the book are, according to him, the following theories: the constantly changing climate, its changes are normal, there is no opinion shared by all researchers on global warming, the effects of current changes are neither too important nor too serious, they therefore represent no danger and, finally, the efforts made to influence climate change are unnecessary, ineffective and unacceptable.
As far as the experience of a totalitarian regime is concerned, it considers it unacceptable to impose inaccurate opinions on others, which it feels as a dangerous attack on freedom.
In response to people's questions, he repeatedly explained that he was not against "reasonable protection of the environment, but against integrated environmentalism that does not take into account the relationship between the costs and the benefits they bring".
In Vienna, Klaus had already talked about this two months ago at Hayek Institute.
600 thousand people have failed to renew their driving license in time
Six hundred thousand drivers have allowed the deadline to expire and have failed to renew their old driving permit whose validity expires at the end of the year.
We are the last day in which people can still ask for renewal, so that the authorities are able to grant them a new permit before the end of the year.
However, the Department is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers without a valid permit will borrow the road.
According to the authorities, they did not renew their licence to drive, especially those who no longer wanted to drive.
While the municipalities report a fall in the number of licence renewal applications, the authorities in the capital are flooded with applications and the number of licence renewal applications has increased this week.
The Mairie satisfied about 2,000 customers per day.
There's a tail in half an hour.
In Prague, nearly 140.OOO drivers have not yet renewed their driving license.
The issue of a new permit takes 20 days.
But it is possible to request the release within a five-day period.
In this case, the driver pays an additional five hundred crowns.
Vehicle drivers who will not succeed in carrying out the mandatory renewal of the driving licence by the end of the year and will borrow the road without a valid permit will risk a fine as of January.
The guilty person will be forced to pay two thousand crowns at the maximum.
However, the police officer may also deal with the offence by using a friendly approach.
In the case of an administrative offence, the fine shall be reduced to 2500 crowns.
According to ancient information, even a person who was not going to circulate was liable to a fine.
This could be forced to pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Department had called for moderation and imposed fines not exceeding 1000 crowns.
According to the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka, no one is at risk of fines in tens of thousands.
The driver's license is, in his opinion, a document that people can decide whether or not they want it.
It's not like with the identity card that she must be valid without exceptions.
Persons who no longer want to drive should be allowed to drive.
It is sufficient to bring it or send it to the corresponding municipality.
Licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will cease to be valid at the end of the year.
However, drivers are also forced to gradually renew other types of driving licence.
Persons with documents from 1994 to 2000 have three more years to carry out the renewal.
The validity of driving licences issued between 2001 and 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, this is about 2.6 million other documents.
The Tribunal has reduced the sentences of detectives agreed with Berdych
Josef Opava and Petr Konňarík, former police officers accused of connivance with David Berdych's gang, will take thirteen and ten years in prison respectively.
The Supreme Court of Prague thus definitively condemned them by reducing their sentences of 1 year and 2 years respectively.
Initially, the Department's detectives for the fight against organized crime were punished by 14 and 12 years in prison.
It is no longer possible to appeal against the judgment delivered today, but only one appeal to the Supreme Court can be considered.
Although Berdych is also accused in this case, he expects for the moment only the verdict of the first instance.
However, he has already received in other trials of the sentences of which the amount exceeds 16 years in prison.
He can't get any more.
In January, the Departmental Tribunal found 19 persons guilty of participation in holding-ups, and today the Supreme Court was dealing with 16 appeals.
Most of the accused referred, since the beginning of the investigation, to the charge by claiming that it was a handled case.
According to the Central Bohéme Court of Justice, after an agreement with Berdych, police members transmitted information from police sources to criminals, covered the various hold-ups and helped gang members to avoid criminal liability.
The gang turned 30 percent of the larcine into Opava and Konňarík.
The charge is the criminal activity of the gang in the years 1999 to 2001.
In most cases, the victims of armed robbery have suffered a serious health attack, but also abuse of the authority of a public agent and of the prohibited weapon.
During domestic searches, the police have actually discovered illegally detained guns, oboes with a steel core, a laser direct shot viewer or a machine gun.
According to the charges, the gang has enriched itself with tens of millions of crowns.
Apart from about twenty men in this trial, the courts have already recognized guilty of other lifted-up Berdych flights and a whole series of others.
Other men from Berdych's neighborhood are still explaining themselves before the court in another case, some cases have not yet been brought before the court.
The main hearing has, for the time being, prevented Tomáš Póta and Maroš Šuljej who are currently in detention in Ireland, where they await the final decision on their extradition to the Czech Republic.
The Children's Replacement Price: 12 million
Igor Veleba's family lawyer wants to get a 12 million crown compensation from the Trebíč hospital.
Three million for each mother, two million for parents and one million for each child.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each of the parents.
That is why the lawyer at the Ondřej Dostál hospital absolutely disagrees with Veleba's proposal.
"We refuse such a claim, which is very high," said Dostal at the hearing.
"To be able to get an opinion on the counter-proposal, we need the expert report that the opposite party has ordered the drafting.
We're going to check if he has any explanatory value.
But we continue to believe that the total amount should not exceed hundreds of thousands," Dostál said.
According to him, the amount should be set between 100,000 and 200,000 Kč for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, Jablonov's family demanded a million crowns for each month where she could not raise her biological daughter.
Veleba used the expert report, written for him by the University Hospital Centre in Prague-Motol, as a supporting document for compensation negotiations.
According to psychologists and psychiatrists, parents suffered psychological damage and were subject to stress at different scales and depths.
The stress situation has been better endured by men, although they have been confronted with remorse that they have not been able to prevent the replacement of newborns.
Women, they remain less silent in the face of current trauma and in the face of what is happening right now, has summarized the content of the Veleba report.
Veronica and Nikola were replaced by nurses at the Trebíč hospital on 9 December.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola at the Chermák in Prijbyslavice and Veronica at Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová in Jabloňov.
The governor of the Vysočina Miloš Vystrčil region handed over 100 000 crowns to each of the families at the end of October for reimbursement of the expenses incurred by the mistake of the Trebíč hospital managed by the region.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are subject to civil liability insurance law.
In the event of a failure, they must be able in the reserve fund, except, they may request assistance from the manager.
So far, the courts have recognized relatively small damages, the amounts calculated according to the tables were in the order of hundreds of thousands, with the exception of millions.
Flour and meal of the Kingdom of Wales (by the Kingdom of Valaško)
Bolek Polívka has lost the litige au suspect de la marque Valašské kálovišk (Royaume de Valaško).
According to the judge of the Ostrava Regional Court, he was actually the one who used the title King of Valaško for the first time, but the project was set up by the team around Tomáš Harabiš, the former collaborator of the actor.
Polivka was not present at today's hearing.
But according to his lawyer, the case is probably not over and his client will call.
"The dispute concerns the fact that Mr. Harabiš and his team are parasitic to the popularity of Bolek Polívka," said Polívka's lawyer after the trial.
According to him, the words of the Kingdom of Valaško bring to everyone exactly this actor and comic.
Harabiš is of the same opinion.
"There's been a job behind us for almost ten years.
Looking for money and developing events," he said.
According to him, it's the money that's the cause of the dispute.
"After years, they realized that the project was successful and that they could benefit from it.
They want to parasitic on our work," he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court, it was Polívka who first used the title Valašký kral (King of Valaško) in his television show.
Actor Radoslav Brzobohatý crowned him king in 1993.
At the time, however, this had nothing to do with the project of establishing a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came with the idea of showing up passports from Valašské Královišk.
From a humorous action to its origin, it came out of a profitable business and business, followed by the creation, by Harabiš, of the company Valašské královjik.
In 1997 Polívka accepted that his name and signature were quoted in the passport and even proposed to the holders of the balance on the price of his farm visit and his theatre shows.
Who will sit on the throne?
Today, the judge also mentioned that Harabiš made only use of the naked idea, published by Polívka in the management issue, for commercial purposes.
"The popularity of Boleslav Polívka has certainly helped the Valašké kingdom project," the judge said.
She added, however, that the soul of the project was made up of Harabiš and his team that devoted themselves to the project in an intense way.
The collaboration between today's enemies continued until 2000 when Harabiš organized an official coronation for Polívka in Vsetín.
But from there, conflicts began to accumulate between Polívka and Harabiš, who culminated in the "King Boleslav 1st elected forever".
The leading role in the kingdom was then, under the inspiration of Harabiš, assumed by the singer Jarmila Šuláková as Queen Mother.
Then, in 2002, Polívka filed a complaint against Harabiš and his company, claiming that the court has today rejected.
What could make the case clear is the tournament planned for the throne and half of the princess.
He should come out of a new king.
He didn't want to betray the details and the date yet.
"We don't want to go fast.
It would be something like the parade of kings in Slovakia.
The king would be elected for a time.
Even Mr. Polívka can of course sign up," Harabiš added.
Test of Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: missing the prejudices
Actually, I've never been a big fan of Peugeot 206.
Its working qualities were nothing extraordinary, the quality of the change in speed, driving and also that of the manufacturing could, in many respects, be described as lower than the average.
However, there is currently on the market its successor Peugeot 207, which is much better.
As much as the truck named SW goes a little further, I just want to think more about it.
When I tested the classic hatchback of the Peugeot 207, I complained, for example, about the space for the head on the back seats.
As you finish the complaints there because the combi bodywork means that even the great devils will be at ease in this regard.
Let's see if we can make it quick.
I'm going to talk very quickly about the inside so I don't repeat myself.
This is an almost successful design, my only remark on the central tunnel that seems to me poor.
There, I would have liked a design a little more inventive, given that the car looks so elegant.
Seats are comfortable and the time when we could complain about seats or files too short is revolutionized.
The lateral guidance has also improved significantly compared to model 206.
As for space, the increase in body size is also noticeable here.
The van also sees the lack of space above the above-mentioned head.
A Box in the Box
The most important thing about this vehicle is its luggage base.
I need to assess this as very well accessible (also thanks to the back-glazing ice) and a rather easy landing.
Blind spaces are equipped with arrest elastics that constitute an ideal compromise.
It is not covered and can be extended while being able to hold heavy enough objects.
But let's stop at the volume.
This is done, according to the tables, 428 l in the base configuration, which is a rather average figure relative to competition.
Apart from Škoda Fabia Combi, the most sold vehicle of this category in Czech Republic.
If the 207 SW is compared to the new generation of the product of Mlada Boleslav, it is found that Peugeot remains very sensitively behind, the difference being 52 litres.
When it comes to going on vacation abroad or carrying a purse, this figure is almost critical.
But if I had to highlight the benefits, I would mention the bottom of the case left after the reverse of the rear seat files perfectly right, or a very low treadmill.
120 horses divided by four cylinders
The car we tested was equipped with a four-cylinder Otto engine with a volume of 1.6 l and a power of 88 kW.
And in fact, that's what should be like a 1.6 that makes a family hatchback walk.
It is quiet, it consumes little and, above all, it pushes well.
If I compare it to the equivalent produced by Škoda that often gives the impression of having a pot of escape closed by a snake, then I can only be enthusiastic.
Let's go through the tariffs.
The price of the vehicle is not accessible by all.
However, we must be aware that a well-equipped car has been tested, with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of a vehicle with an Otto 1.4 litre engine up to 329 900 Kč is still passable.
The vehicle that we have tested cost from 410 900 Kč, which is already enough.
Premium equipment, also tested, increases the price of 80,000 Kč.
However, we have also equipped airbags head, automatic air-conditioning, automatic ice-cream testing, automatic command of rear windows...
In fact, the vehicle costs at the end of the account 531 900 Kč.
That's a lot, but try to add the extra equipment at Fabia's price and you will get a very similar number.
So there's nothing left but to choose the brand.
The integration of Slovak students in British schools is wrong
The number of children from Eastern European countries in British schools is increasing, leading to concerns among remaining people about the evolution of local education.
The integration of the Eastern Europeans is currently facing a number of obstacles.
British schools even find cases where conflicts between immigrants and descendants of indigenous people turn into violence.
The case of Kent in the north, where the remaining and immigrant conflicts of Slovak origin are beginning to increase, well illustrates the problem of the integration of children from Eastern Europe.
Disputes, jokes and misunderstandings between students have been incorporated into the relationship between parents.
The situation went so far that the police arrested a Slovak woman in Chatham who was hitting a ten-year-old student with a iron bar.
The defendant defends himself by claiming that the boy had insulted him by racist speech.
The police also had to intervene as a result of the attack on a Slovak immigrant carried out by two adolescents.
The young girls had allegedly addressed this man with racist remarks and had thrown him out of the stones.
"When we went home, a young man climbed on the bus stop and started cracking at us.
When I told him to stop, he answered by apples and pears and then he discovered his cheeks," another unpleasant adventure described a mother of Slovak students.
Complaints are made by both parties.
One of the remaining people has gone to qualify for the conflicts with the immigrant struggle for survival.
The above-mentioned cases show that the atmosphere in British schools between natives and immigrants is beginning to develop.
70 thousand Slovaks who came to find work are registered in Great Britain.
And about 30,000 Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful Caribbean island
For visitors, it is really an island of freedom.
Anything you expect of your leave can happen if you make a good choice.
Gold and white beaches such as snow, waves or then a calm sea like a pond.
Palms and everything included with servers offering you on the beach a pizza, ice or both of liquefied cocktails.
The kitesurfing, the golf and the roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean Sea, you will not only find this list in its entirety, but richness.
But there is only one island on which you will find much more and it is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island of the Great Antilles.
By the time of the Spaniards, Cuba had been the base of their invasion of America.
Christophe Columbus qualified him as the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana has become the deposit and place of transfer of the treasures that the Spanish had stolen and transported to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The National Hotel was erected at the beginning of the 20s.
It was Lucky Luciano, one of the leaders of the American mafia, who built it, because everything that was a crime in the United States (especially under the ban) was admitted and supported in Cuba: drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his clients, there were, among other things,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, tall buildings have been pushed and cars, belonging to the cult symbols of the 50th century, flowed on large boulevards.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and, in Cojímar, he had his yacht.
The stars of the show business and the politicians of the whole America left their signatures on the walls of Bodeguita del Medio.
What about today?
You can leave your own autograph on the walls of the Havana Bodeguita.
At the National Hotel Bar, a luxury hotel, you will be mixed the cocktail of your choice.
And these sacred cars are still circulating in Havana, since the jigouli and the imported fiats have long been in such a salty and wet climate.
Although Havane, especially the oldest part, is significantly decoupled, nowhere else in the vicinity there are so many beautiful colonial monuments that there are precisely there.
Other places become more beautiful, such as Trinidad.
Since tourism brings money if necessary, its development has green light.
Over the past 15 years, new hotels have not only moved to Havana, but especially to Varader, on the coast of the Holguín province, as well as on small islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba also offers a fantasy that is unique in the world and will be especially appreciated by those who love small trains.
The cane had returned from the extended plantations in the sugarries on a narrow path through small steam and motor trains.
Their rolling stock has not been renewed for decades and this is how we can see small locomotives whose contemporary ones are not only in museums.
Where are you headed?
Most visitors do not miss the most well-known places.
So there's no need to write it long on Varadero or on Havana.
Otherwise, remember that in Hemingway's property, already mentioned, there is a museum and that the person who loves this writer should not miss the visit.
The valley of Vináles to the west of the island is one of Cuba's most picturesque corners.
An exuberant vegetation pushes on a limestone soil.
Mogots, limestone balloons and rocks rise in trade from the bottom of the valley, and, since the fertile land has been taken into their traps, even its porous rocks are covered with a very dense vegetation carpet.
The valley is where you probably grow Cuban tobacco of the best quality.
You can meet the final form of this product if you visit one of Havana's cigarette factories.
Someone might also find interesting that this is where Major Zeman's Chilean episode was turned.
Trinidad
Old town founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
It is the trade of slaves and the trade of sugar that has brought him glory and wealth.
The richness was incarnated into the beauty and character of this small city.
The colonial Spanish architecture, particularly influenced by later French settlers, has not changed much in four centuries.
Trinidad, situated between the sea and the mountain range Escambray, is a place so far away that in the 1950s last century, there was no road that would connect this region with the rest of the country.
This isolation allowed him to stay on the side.
We didn't build anything, and that's why we didn't demolish anything anymore, everyone was happy to have a roof over his head.
If you have more time than a afternoon in Trinidad, then it is worth going to see interesting places around, such as Playa Ancón Beach or the Sucreries Valley.
Then, in the evening, it is customary to go to the Casa de la Música which cheers after sunset and where music happens only in the morning.
Baracoa
Some designate this bourgeoisie located in the extreme east of Cuba as the most beautiful island.
This opinion is certainly already influenced by the way in which it leads.
The two roads from Guantanamo must cross high and uninhabited mountains and cross a landscape almost without marks of human activity.
UNESCO has entered the eastern coast of Cuba, thanks to its intact landscape, on the list of world heritage.
There is the best chocolate made, in the church, there is Christophe Colomb's cross (in fact, she saw the day almost a hundred years after the Columbus peripel) and since the hill where the old castle-fort and the current El Castillo hotel are held, several tables are seen, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
About the coffee, rum, cigarettes, the massive Sierra Maestra mountain range, the Bay of the Truies and the island of Pinos, the Tropicana cabaret, the sanctuary of the patron saint of Cuba Caridad del Cobre, the Santeria, African religions practiced by descendants of the former slaves, about all of this could be filled with a number of pages.
Only, as we say, it's better to see once.
In Afghanistan, allies are passive, Americans say
The lack of necessary soldiers and equipment affects, according to the United States, the conduct of the mission in Afghanistan.
According to Defence Minister Robert Gates, NATO should devise a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not going as it should, and in Edinburgh, Scotland, representatives of countries with troops in the southern part of the country agreed.
In addition to the growing challenge on the part of the Taliban movement, the eight States involved are also currently discussing future plans and coordination of allies.
While the United States called NATO troops to greater activity this week through the Minister of Defence Robert Gates, Britain sees as a priority the strengthening of Afghan government authority and the strengthening of development aid.
"The evolution in Afghanistan is noticeable, but military power can only form part of the solution.
The other is to allow the people themselves to begin a new development of the economy and security," British Defence Minister Des Browne told the BBC chain.
Ninety-ten percent
The activities of the Afghan insurgents are, according to US Army data, the most intense of the past five years.
The number of violent acts increased by 27 per cent over the past year, up to 60 per cent in Helmand Province, south of the country.
NATO countries have about 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, nearly a quarter of which are in the southern part.
However, according to the United States, the allies reached their absolute limit both in the organization and in the equipment of the troops.
Specifically, they ask for other helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan troops.
"We should think seriously about the concrete objectives for the coming period, as well as how to achieve them," Gates said.
NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop has today had similar talks.
"I am not happy with what we have on earth and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have almost 40 percent of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that's not enough," De Hoop told the Reuters agency at the end of the Japanese government talks in Tokyo that would last three days.
Who's passive
The last few months are also among the countries involved in the conflict on whether all the allies actually do their best in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany has been criticized for its liability.
"The Germans have a relatively large representation in Afghanistan.
But they are engaged in areas where violence is minimal, so the fighting requirements they are subject to are not as stringent as those in the South and East parts of the country where we operate," Gates said.
The British tabloid Sun qualified German soldiers for parsley this week.
"The Afghan children discovered: the Germans play while ours fight," Sun wrote in a document completed by German soldiers playing at the table tennis.
The German newspaper Bild passed to the counterattack by publishing the photo of a British troops during a rugby match in southern Afghanistan.
State debt will rise to a billion in 2009
The burden of a debt of the State exceeding 84,000 crowns is the responsibility of each Czech State.
The total debt is raised at 842.7 billion crowns at the end of September.
The government had planned to borrow $159.2 billion this year.
As a result of a change in the economy of the budget of the better than planned state, the Department has reduced the planned amount to SEK 152.8 billion.
The debt of the State of the Czech Republic is raised at the end of September to SEK 842.7 billion.
Thus, during the nine months of this year, it has increased by 40.2 billion crowns.
But as of June, it fell by 13.4 billion crowns.
Today, the Ministry of Finance has thus confirmed its debt data from the State at the beginning of October.
The charge of a debt exceeding 84,000 crowns is the responsibility of each Czech.
Over the past year, the state has indebted itself to more than 111 billion crowns.
"For now, it seems that, thanks to a less significant deficit planned for next year, one could exceed the limit of a billion crowns only in 2009.
Next year, the debt should be between 900 billion and a billion crowns," said Patria Finance analyst David Marek for the iHNed.cz server.
The forecast of Next Finance Finance Vladimir Pikor is similar: "We could exceed the billion in the course of 2009.
The specified date will depend on the next budget that is not yet known.
If it appeared that the political situation had changed, that policies were ready to save more, the date could be reversed by 2010.
But I don't expect this change," he said.
The debt increases
The debt of the State is constituted by the central government's debts and is mainly due to the accumulation of government budget deficits.
The debt of the State is financed by securities, interest securities, direct loans or, for example, by loans to the European Investment Bank.
The State's domestic debt increased this year from 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion crowns.
The State's external debt increased this year from 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion crowns.
The debt of the so-called negotiable State reached SEK 803.3 billion at the end of September and from June it decreased SEK 13.7 billion.
The average debt requirement of the State has risen to 6.5 years.
"The total debt has increased from the first to the third half of 13 percent annually, which is, given the current good health of the economy, a very high figure.
It is interesting that the increase is mainly generated by interest rates where it reaches 20 percent.
It is bad that debt grows, but on the other hand it indicates that there will be issues to be negotiated when retirement reform comes," Pikora commented.
Better Than What We Expected
It follows from the State debt financing and management strategy for 2007 that the government had planned to borrow $159.2 billion this year.
However, at the beginning of September, thanks to a change in the economy of the budget of the better than planned State, the Department has reduced the planned amount to SEK 152.8 billion.
The amount is mainly due to the government budget deficit, which is clearly going to reach up to 76 billion crowns this year, instead of the 91.3 billion originally planned crowns.
These are the maximum sources for the Czech Consolidation Agency, i.e. 13,3 billion crowns, the $10 billion reserve for pension payments, the financing of state-owned loans for 43 billion crowns and the repayment of the European Investment Bank's loans amounting to 1.8 billion crowns.
Today she compared a court in Khartoum to have named a bear in a fight
The British teacher who was tried in the Sudan for insulting Islam was sentenced to 15 days in prison by a court in Khartoum on Thursday night, and reported to his lawyer.
The British was accused of leaving students between 6 and 7 years of age to give the name of Mahomet to a bear in battle, while any representation of the prophet of Islam is illegal.
She was subject to a fine of beatings.
This 54-year-old British teacher at the University of Khartoum University in the Sudan was arrested on Sunday and accused of attacking Islam and sedentary under section 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, following several complaints from students' parents with the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
In fact, the story goes back to September, when this teacher asks his students, aged 6/7 years old, to choose a name for the bear in the class.
"Eight names come out of the children's mouth, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed," says the school principal Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a class vote, 20 out of 23 children chose Mohamed as their favorite nickname.
Muhammad is certainly the name of the Muslim prophet, but especially a very common name in the Sudan.
The children then produced a book for the class with the photo of the bear followed by the legend "My name is Mohamed".
The bear himself did not bear any label with that name, but the problem is simply the representation of the prophet considered an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons' Muslim colleagues, teaching at the same school in the Sudan, said that he knew her well and that she would never have done anything that might be offensive to a religious faith, "I just regret that she asked the children to vote for a name", he said, it was only an "innocent error".
Notice shared by many students of the institute who describe it as "very attentive to its students" and "who never talks about religion in class".
Let us remember that the surname Mohamed is also the second most known surname in Great Britain, it is written in English in 14 different ways.
This first name often chosen by Muslim families is a way of honoring the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this nickname?
Can we, for example, give it to a toy?
This is, of course, an interpretation issue.
They did not reach agreement on the future status of the province on Wednesday at the last negotiating meeting in Vienna.
In the end, I fail.
Kosovo Serbs and Albanians completed a sixth and final discussion meeting in Baden, Austria, on Wednesday morning without overcoming their differences in the future status of the separatist province.
"It is regrettable that the parties were unable to reach an agreement on the status," European Ombudsman Wolfgang Ischinger said at a press conference in Vienna.
Stressing that peace in the region was "in play", US counterpart Frank Wisner urged Belgrade and Pristina to comply with their commitments to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
"We do not plan violence immediately, but we will enter a very difficult period," he added, which includes "evident tensions".
End of mediation on 10 December
The troika mediators, which brings together the European Union, the United States and Russia, will visit Serbia and Kosovo one last Monday.
The future of the population of 90% of Albanians could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko refer their report to the United Nations Security Council by 10 December.
The discussions in Baden, near Vienna, constituted the sixth and last session of the negotiations since the troika was entrusted with a new mediation by the United Nations in August.
Americans and Europeans consider their mediation to be over on 10 December.
The Russians, who have already blocked the independence of Kosovo from the Security Council, insist on continuing negotiations beyond that future date.
"Russia was and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," Botsane-Khartchenko said.
Declaration of unilateral independence?
After eight years of unsuspecting Kosovo administration, the West considers independence under EU supervision to be the only viable solution.
Pristina stands ready to declare it unilaterally if the Security Council does not take sides in its favour.
Belgrade insists on increased autonomy.
“Unfortunately, no agreement has been found,” announced the President of Kosovo’s autonomous authority Fatmir Sejdiu at the Baden Hotel, where these “last chance negotiations have been taking place since Monday.”
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo Rebellion and future Prime Minister of the province, expressed his regret.
But he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade "was part of a past that led to murders and deportations".
‘Domino effect’
Serbian President Boris Tadic felt that a compromise was always feasible, warning the Albanian majority of Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral proclamation of the province's independence.
In particular, Belgrade says to redeploy a "domino effect" in a region still weakened by the 1990s' independence wars.
"For Serbia, he said, this does not mean that a compromise is impossible."
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had insisted that any decision be returned only to the Security Council, where its Russian ally had a veto right.
'The Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word'
"Only one solution within the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia," said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
"These negotiations lasted two years.
They must end as they began: in the Security Council."
To journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu replied that "the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word on the status," adding that any unilateral declaration of independence on the part of Albanians would be "in consultation" with the West.
Bush draws an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
President George Bush announced, at the opening of the International Peace Conference, held in Annapolis on Tuesday, Maryland, that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint statement.
He said that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to engage immediately in negotiations to find a final settlement of the 60-year-old content among their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them conclude a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians must dismantle "terrorist infrastructures" and Israel must end its colonization activities," Bush said, recalling their obligations under the "roadmap" for the peace they accepted in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would "be aimed at concluding a peace treaty that resolves all outstanding issues, without exception, including central issues".
This call covers the three thorny problems at the heart of the happy Israelis and Palestinians: the future frontiers of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees chased from their homes in what is today the State of Israel during the 1948 conflict.
Speaking after the U.S. President, Abbas insisted that future negotiations be "global and in-depth" and cover all aspects of a regulation, citing "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among others".
On his way to the court, Olmert undertook to make future talks "direct and continuous" and to make "an effort to close them in the course of 2008".
By the end of 2008, Bush set the deadline for implementing its "two-State vision" Palestinian and Israeli co-existence.
Saudi Arabia has revealed that it had made a commitment to Bush in this regard before deciding to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is at the origin of a plan, worn out by all Arab countries, which offers Israel peace in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks "a framework in the history of the Middle East, especially because it attacks the root causes of the conflict and its central aspects", says Prince Saudi in his interview with the Arab daily Saudi capital.
The prosecutor is not responsible for the police.
What exactly happened, Sunday?
As with each other in this kind of fact, official versions and rumors are opposed.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the National Police Inspectorate's Survey (IGPN), a police car went on Sunday, shortly after 5 p.m., Louise-Michel Street, Villiers-le-Bel.
"It was not in intervention but in patrol, and it was 40-50 km/h, without gyrophare," explains a police source.
A green bike from the Kawazaki brand, "not approved, therefore not allowed to circulate on the public road" (read below) and driven by two young people without helmets, circulated "very well lived".
"She stabbed the police car on her left, after a refusal of priority to the right," says one police officer.
The alcohol control applied to the occupants of the vehicle has proved to be negative.
The condition of the car (before drowning, starry parachute, rooted parashocks) testifies to the violence of the shock.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérère de Givry, announced that he had commissioned an investigation into "involuntary murder and non-assistance to persons in danger" at the IGPN, co-sponsored with the Departmental Directorate of Public Security of the Oise.
In the afternoon, at a press conference, the prosecutor stated that the IGPN's investigation at this stage was depriving police officers of responsibility.
According to the judge, three witnesses of the accident, heard on Sunday night, confirmed "the version of the policemen, namely that this mini-moto arrived relatively quickly on their left".
Yesterday, a sort of reindeer, undoubtedly caused by the cracking of the roads on the ground, showed that both vehicles were stuck in a hurry when the police car stopped.
Vehicles have been seized and will be subject to technical expertise.
The bodies of the two victims were autopsied yesterday.
What happened just after?
Yesterday, a rumor quickly circulated in Villiers-le-Bel, according to which policemen would have quickly left their seats, thus not giving aid to the two young people.
IGPN, while being cautious, would also avoid “all serious mistakes” regarding this point.
"It is a more difficult aspect of the investigation, which requires more investigations, which must be very careful," said a police source.
Liberation has met an eyewitness of these few moments that have followed the accident.
One of his windows giving exactly on the scene.
"We immediately went down, with my cousin who is nursed to the hospital, to try to get rid of them, tells this witness.
There was nothing to do."
He then saw "a full-fledged police officer, who was fighting.
Two others tried to reanimate one of the young, the fourth spoke on the phone."
In the face of the tension that quickly surrounded the scene, and it seems to have been certain that there were people present in the unexpected situation of young people, policemen were taken in by colleagues who arrived at the scene.
According to this witness, the relief arrived "about twenty minutes after the departure of the policemen".
They also practiced heart massages in vain.
"I will not let you say that police services did not assist young people.
These young people have been helped.
The firefighters have arrived immediately.
Everything was done to try to save them," the prosecutor pointed out.
The tension rises in Pakistan
Pakistani police repressed the first demonstrations Monday since the establishment of the state of emergency two days earlier by General Musharraf.
In the city of Lahore, east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers who protested against the emergency measures were injured by the lacremogenic grenades used by the order forces, according to witnesses.
The latter responded by throwing stones, hurting policemen.
At least 350 lawyers were interviewed.
Similar scenarios like Karachi and Rawalpindi, or policemen have charged and injured lawyers.
Several would have been questioned.
In Islamabad, lawyers from the Supreme Court bar called for a general strike and announced demonstrations following a wave of some 500 arrests during the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
Streets giving access to the Supreme Court were blocked on Monday morning to prevent the assembly.
Other events would have taken place in Multan (centre) and Peshawar (north-west).
The lawyer movement gathered on Monday the support of the religious parties gathered in the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance, whose president urged the population to send flowers to the judges who had pronounced themselves against the state of emergency and to destroy those who had sworn in front of Musharraf.
"Musharraf's promise is no longer true"
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly addressed by the exception measure proclaimed Saturday night.
In the next few days, she had to decide on the legality of the re-election to the President, on 6 October, to indirect suffrage, of President Musharraf.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was defeated and replaced.
'All that we attend is illegal, anti-constitutional and contrary to the Supreme Court's rulings,' the magistrate said in The News.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to leave the army and become a "no longer" civilian president after the establishment of the state of emergency, the Deputy Minister of Information Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
Leaving his military uniform was expected by 15 November, at the end of his first presidential term.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
In addition, the Pakistani government has denounced the country's insistent rumors that President Musharraf would have been assigned to reside by his Deputy Chief of Armed Forces.
More than one third of pregnant women remain unplanned
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as unplanned or unforeseen births.
Today, more than one pregnancy of three (36%) is not planned, a study conducted by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined) reveals, forty years after the vote of the Neuwirth Act, which liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as unplanned or unforeseen births.
The different methods of contraception such as the pill or sterile still present a 5% to 6% failure rate, the Ined estimates.
The liberalization of contraception has also allowed for better "fecency control", according to the Institute, which notes that the rate of use of the pill in women aged 20 to 44 has increased from 5 per cent in 1970 to 60 per cent today.
Finally, eight births in ten would be well planned today.
See calculated monthly for a couple of five and if possible in spring, considered the most pleasant season for having a child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
It will take more than seven hours of work in space for astronaut Scott Parazynski and his teammates at the International Space Station (ISS) to perform the spectacular repair of a tornado solar panel, essential for the continuation of the station's scientific activities.
A risky exit that has accumulated the records due to its duration, its removal from the habitable modules, the speed with which it was imagined, "bricoled" tools by astronauts to make the repair.
The problem arose Tuesday while astronauts had downloaded the Harmony module from the Discovery Navy, a large cylindrical room to welcome soon European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see box).
This module is a kind of scoreboard for the modules.
But we need to be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore to move a solar panel generation module of 17.5 tonnes already present on the ISS to post it on its final position.
After moving it, the crew began re-dispatching solar panels of the module with a width of 76 metres.
And that's where one of the panels, which spread like accordions, was damaged on nearly a meter by a wire that crashed.
The deployment was stopped to prevent further damage to the panel.
Astronauts, who originally had to carry out an exit control of the Discovery shuttle, then to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was defective, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged panel.
And it's Scott Parazynski who was chosen to drive at the end of the 30 meters length of the remote arm of the shuttle added to the station to make the repair.
It is one of the best "spacewalker" (space walker) of the NASA.
Large, resistant, very comfortable, he has the very developed torso and long arms.
At 46 years of age, therefore, this training doctor was charged with "operating" the "damaged" solar panel.
After carefully inspecting the damage, he sectioned the faulty cable and installed "acts" in the damaged area.
He was helped by a second "spacewalker" staying close to the saw and, from within, by the other astronauts, including Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, a mini-hockey channel surrounded by insulators to avoid electrocution on solar panels producing several hundred volts, was designed and "bricolled" by astronauts on board the station.
Once the operation was completed, Scott Parazynski expected the panel to be fully deployed before making the inventory of its tools and returning inside the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts enjoyed a half-day of relaxation before today, seven astronauts do not return to Discovery for a return to Earth scheduled Wednesday.
The title of the EADS sanctions in Borse
The EADS action is currently net at the Paris Stock Exchange, after the Air and Defence Group announced that it would have to spend between EUR 1.2 billion and 1.4 billion to address A400M delays.
EADS lost 4% to 21.96 euros currently at the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group was obliged to review its 2007 operational performance forecast due to delays due to the slow development of the engine development of the A400M, which condition the inaugural flight of the aircraft.
The cost of slowing down the delay in the delivery of the military aircraft, announced in October, is '€1.2 billion to €1.4 billion for Airbus', announced the European manufacturer's mother house EADS.
Due to these charges, EADS will be forced to announce new performance targets (EBITs) for 2007 when presenting its quarterly results on Thursday next, it adds no further figures.
The group also indicates that the estimate of new charges is consistent with the six-month delay.
As a reminder, the operational result of EADS fell by 86% in 2006, mainly due to delays in another program, the very large carrier A380.
Initially, the group planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The status quo selection
There will be no suspension, Sunday, at the exit of the urns: the Russians will opt massively for the party of President Putin, the United Russia.
Confirming their aspirations for stability, even for authoritarianism, after a very closed campaign.
At three days of the legislative elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin today sends voters a television message on public channels, already registered but the content of which is kept secret.
He does this as the head of the united Russia list, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory is declared to be breaking.
Yesterday, the President left nothing to be seen by receiving foreign ambassadors, happy to deliver a new charge against the accused West of interference - his theme of pre-election during the campaign.
"We know the price of real democracy and we want the fairest, most transparent and most open elections," he added.
In the view of the opposition, we are far from the account.
She's denouncing a press campaign.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziuganov says that there was "never been such a salt election, even at the time of Eltsine".
After the repression of the last weekend's demonstrations, the ex-champion of the world of chess Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstrations, remains forbidden to visit according to his lawyer.
"The Russians have kept the mind of the Soviet Homo"
Behind these unrestricted legislation are two more open issues:
- Who's gonna happen to Putin at the presidency?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the first presidential round on March 2, 2008 and the candidates have until December 23rd.
In 2000, and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot serve a third consecutive term.
But there's no successor coming out.
- What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Head of the parliamentary majority and all-powerful united Russian party who would elect the government and its president?
Whatever the case may be, the legislative and presidential powers will triumph.
It's a tradition.
"The Russians have kept the mind of the Soviet Homo, they do not feel master of their destiny," says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent centre of Levada.
The historian Nikolai Kokossov, of St. Petersburg State University, goes further: civil society has been late in this Christian country five centuries after Europe; the famous community spirit has delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Putin has renewed with the model of a paternist state, perfectly accepted by the population so much more that this new paternism has not been followed by terror, but by some economic relief," says Maria Lipman, of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians "with full gratitude for personal responsibility" which they had briefly demonstrated after the collapse of the USSR.
"What's the good idea?"
The phenomenon affects all social layers, including the business world.
And the administrative elite intends to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (over 85 heads of Russian regions) run the local lists of the United Russia.
New freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
The opinion prefers stability.
On behalf of which the Russians will no longer vote for the extremists.
The conclusion of 54 - year - old Professor Tamara Tcherednitchenko: “What good thinking?
Those in power are not too bad, why change them?"
A Heavy Memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which depict the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitlerian regime, are free access.
The 47 million archived documents, stored 27 km from the line in Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were still only "humanitarian", i.e. individually and nominally, at the request of an old victim or his right holders.
The eleven States in charge of their management - including Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them to researchers and historians.
The process of ratification of this agreement by all States has been completed, and the opening has been effective since yesterday.
Sensitive information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow research "particularly on the movement of prisoners, the population of camps and the health of forced workers", explains Reto Meistern, the director of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several States, including Germany, opposed the opening of these nominations to the public because of the sensitive nature of certain information.
Like the alleged homosexuality or mental disability of some victims of deportation.
The registers of concentration camps or arrest warrants established by the Gestapo had been collected after war for a practical purpose: to find deported civilians or subject to compulsory work and, where appropriate, to provide proof of their detention in order to open the way for compensation.
Today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees deal with tens of thousands of individual applications.
However, for a part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
"There is nothing fundamentally new to wait for these documents," said Pr Wolfgang Benz, director of the Centre for Anti-Semitism Research at the Technische Universität de Berlin in 2006.
The EU and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008
At present, the Indo-European bilateral trade has already reached nearly EUR 60 billion per year.
The EU is India's first trading partner and represents 18% of its external trade.
The European Union and India hoped to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, told European Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart Kamal Nath.
EU Foreign Ministers gave their green light last April to the European Commission to engage in negotiations to sign free trade agreements (ALEs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean).
The EU is India's first trading partner and represents 18% of its external trade.
LUE is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the 9th EU trading partner, according to the European Commission figures.
"A free trade pact is a huge deal for both economies" and "India would improve its access to a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans," said Peter Mandelson.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the first ten products exported by India, said the European Commissioner. Asian and European giants trade annually for '47 billion euros of goods' and for 'ten billion euros of services', said Daniele Smadja, head of the European Commission delegation to New Delhi, regretting that bilateral trade has not yet reached its potential. The EU and India meet for their eighth diplomatic summit in New Delhi in the presence of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and European Commission President José Manuel Durao Barroso on Friday.

The Bank of England takes note of concerns by offering 10 billion books over five weeks
The Bank of England said it was an interesting Thursday to ease the current return of concerns on credit conditions, and announced an offer of ten billion books at the base rate of 5.75% over five weeks, an offer of unusual duration.
"In order to alleviate the concerns that the conditions of the financial market will be particularly closed at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty in the way in which they will organise their liquidity positions over that period, the Bank intends to offer a significant proportion of its provision of reserves during the maintenance period beginning on 6 December in the form of an open market operation for five weeks," it states in a communication.
The Bank states that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be placed on the market on 6 December at 12h15 GMT, at the base rate and until 10 January.
This is the first time that the BoE seems to place liquidity on the market for five weeks in an open market operation.
These usually take place in a week.
The BoE adds in its communication that it "is prepared to take other measures to maintain the rates" of interbank loans on a daily basis with its basic rate.
The interbank rate per day was 5.829 per cent on Wednesday.
The rate of three months was 6.6%, a higher since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the financial crisis in summer, the sums placed on the market by the Bank of England have been subject to an important penalty rate that has deterred banks from resorting to them.
According to some rumors, corroborated by the evolution of the book's course compared to the euro, many have preferred to subscribe to the amounts placed on the market by the European Central Bank at more favourable rates and with more assured discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to review PS proposals on purchasing power
The UMP and New Centre groups refused Thursday to discuss articles of the proposed socialist law on purchasing power, which was equivalent to a rejection of the text.
Included in a socialist "niche" (meeting at the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text declined a dozen measures taken by the National PS Office on Tuesday, including the 50% increase in the premium for employment, the restoration of the floating TIPP, a check-transport or the rental framework.
Having voted against the consideration of the articles (180 votes to 115), the meeting was convened at the end of the general discussion that led to exchanges, sometimes lively, between majority and opposition at a few hours of Nicolas Sarkozy's televised intervention on purchasing power.
The leader of the PS MPs Jean-Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent the fullness of his proposals in the form of amendments to the draft amending financial law that was discussed by the Assembly next week.
A new festival sees the day
Following many rumors about the creation by C3 Presents of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in partnership with the United Kingdom producer Festival Melvin Benn.
"For our company, it is an honor to work with a person who has, no less than, inspired the current movement of festivals in America," Charlie Jones from C3 entrusted to Billboard.com.
C3 produced the Lollapalooza festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for the campsite.
The festival should be held from 8 to 10 August on a private farm of 500 acres about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
On the other hand, known as Mean Fiddler, the director of Festival Republic, Melvin Benn, is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989, he took the bar of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts about 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to its portfolio and in 2006, Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival of Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, as co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organizational tasks of the Glasstonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Qualifying the "most inspiring event" he had ever attended, Charlie Jones of C3 said his company and Melvin Benn were working in parallel to give the region a European-style event.
"We chose Philadelphia as a market and worked closely with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in the city centre of Philadelphia," says Charlie Jones.
"We were talking to the city and the Commission was motivated and excited about this project.
Unfortunately, we are in politics because of the current administration, followed by Charlie Jones.
"Happyly, we have been able to discuss with Melvin Benn and we learn to create a wonderful festival on an exceptional site that will ultimately serve the population of Philadelphia."
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 at Grant Park in Chicago, after being highlighted in the festival landscape in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded gross revenues of $9.8M and $11.3M in 2007.
These two festivals are held in the middle of the city.
"The European model of Melvin Benn is a champetre festival, while ours are located in urban green spaces," says Charlie Jones.
The aim is to merge, in one way or another, the two formulas to give both an impression of the European and American field festival."
Vineland is close to halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“The Vineland community, including the mayor, wholeheartedly supports the holding of this event,” says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to reveal the terms of the agreement, but says "they are interesting enough to allow you to invest in such an event and host a festival that, hopefully, will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says that the hospitality capacity of this festival is "very great", like that of 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He said that invitations had been launched to the groups, but that nothing could be confirmed at the time of press release.
"Vineland will taste rock, but the music will vary, in the hope of attracting all sorts of spectators," says Charlie Jones.
Its C3 partners, who received the Top Independent Promotion Award from the last Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal faces the Terminator
It's not easy to attract Hollywood film boards in Montreal when no one else than Terminator opposes it...
This seduction mission is part of the delegation.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces the "runaway productions".
Is it difficult to play in the "Governator" pacts?
"Be careful, it's the industry that decides where it goes.
If she finds that the conditions in Montréal are favourable, she will go there.
Our role is to offer those who will judge the best," he said.
The race to the festivals
At the moment, however, Denis Turcott's priority is the promotion of the film here.
The Oscars race has begun.
It will be from all the festivals of the West Coast, whether that of Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, a question of presenting the Quebec films, highlighting them and ensuring that the directors conduct interviews.
The Age of Darkness had a beautiful window at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival, a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is on display in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four long and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be a year-end rally in the stock exchange? The experts divided by the crisis of the subprime.
Within five weeks of the end of the year, investors are already shaking their hands by waiting for the arrival of the traditional year-end rally.
This year, however, experts are not sure what will happen.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, the month of December in the stock exchange generally has positive behaviour.
However, statistical-based forecasts should not be made solely, given the current context, uncertainty is at least short-term. "
Although they are not participators for the final weeks of the year, these experts point out that "the stock market is fed by liquidity, willing to invest in the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially fixed income, affected by the effect of fleeing to quality values both in long periods and in short periods".
For this, they believe that the stock exchange will have a rather lateral behaviour, not exempt from volatility "especially because we do not know the impact of the likely decline in the rate of the Fed, given the high level of gross and the danger of stimulating inflationary tensions"
Javier Barrio, responsible for BPI sales in Spain, agrees that this is not the right time to say that there will be a rally.
"That's not the best thing," says the expert.
Ibex, the Spanish stock exchange index, has lost nearly 4% since 8 November when the index ended at 15.945.7 points.
However, not all experts have this negative vision.
Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, believes that Ibex 35 could close the year at 16,000 points thanks to the reorganization of portfolios and traditional contributions to pension schemes that occur every year during these dates.
However, the expert's nuance that things will be a little different this year because he believes that the rally will take place from the second week of December, after the end of the constitutional feast (December 6th).
The analyst does not consider that volatility will affect the market trend.
For his part, Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banco, assesses that we are close to technical levels and "that is why we could observe a rebound of the index that could be caused by information coming from the European Union regarding the consequences of the credit market crisis".
The analyst hopes that these will be positive.
Analysts agree to choose the values that will be responsible for leading Ibex to new maximum costs.
Solana, from Intermoney, says that "this year's great values are coming back for him."
The expert would include in the portfolio the two major banks and some builders "because when the date comes, the electricity sector will be very expensive".
While, Federico Olucha, of Inversis Banco, ensures that the increases will be from the bank to the industrial sector.
Constructors will also be able to benefit from this rally, if they do.
"The ACS has been recovering from positions for several months and we hope that other manufacturers such as Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path," the expert explains.
cyclical consumption will be a major factor in the last part of the year due to increased sales in the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technological companies will do so as well, although there is not much representation in the Spanish market in this case.
Five times for seven years
For the last seven years, only two occasions in December was a low month.
The actual year-end rally took place in 2003, during which the stock markets emerged from the crisis caused by the penetration of the technology bubble.
This year, during which Ibex 35 recovered 28.17 per cent, the month of December recorded an increase of 6.68 per cent.
It will be necessary to see if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of earnings (for the time being Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and if it succeeds on its final year rally.
The Popular Bank will open 200 open offices 12 noon from Monday to Saturday
The People's Bank decided to renew a large part of its offices.
In total 200 banks are located in Spain's most commercial areas.
These branches, which will operate under the Max popular brand, represent a big change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish organizations, as it is the first group that has decided to start betting on the uninterrupted opening of its agencies by 8:30 p.m., and to open Saturday from 10:00 p.m. to 20:30 p.m.
Another group has also repeated several times that it would like to expand the schedules of its branches, BBVA, even though it has not yet decided to take the first step.
It is about to conclude an agreement with trade unions to close 75% of its agencies on Saturday instead of opening a afternoon, but not to the public.
The results of the experience of the People's Bank will be decisive for other organizations to join this initiative that coincides with the trading schedules.
That is exactly what the People's Bank is looking for.
To attract autonomous customers who circulate in these areas to make their purchases in SMEs and the street trades they choose to open.
The bank wants to open these 200 agencies located throughout Spain in about 18 months, as this is not the opening of new agencies but a renewal of existing ones.
For this purpose, the organization will modernise its branches already in the business areas, adapting them to the customer profile of the different streets.
In this way, the amplification of schedules is accompanied by a different design of the interior of the branch and a new, more current design with brighter colors.
The bank manager, Ángel Rivera, ensures that this renewal does not involve large investments, but hires staff, as the number of employees will increase from six to eight or nine per agency.
Agencies, which will also have room for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
The People's Bank has already tested its initiative in three Madrid agencies.
And the experience has been positive, as explained by Angel Rivero.
The branches of Murillo Brave, O'Donnell and Gran Via de Madrid streets are the streets that have been selected, and with apparent success, according to Rivero.
The People's Bank currently has 2,500 branches.
And 60 others who operate under the brand Mundocredit, specializing in the case of immigrants, also with very large schedules, which open even Sundays and holidays.
In these PopularMax agencies they will not copy the BBVA model, where several of its agencies have a wide range of non-financial products for sale.
'We do not want to compete with our customers', notes Rivero.
For the time being, they reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobile phones, with an outside staff at the bank.
Double Telecinco for the first time the value in Exchange of its rival Antena 3
We're here.
With this phrase Paolo Vasile, a delegate adviser from Telecinco, expressed his satisfaction yesterday at the closing of the stock market, when he found that the chain he led doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
One aspect of his joy was: 'what hurts me is not the fact that we have increased more but that we have fallen less', he said.
However, he stressed the fact that on a low market, 'we have fallen less.'
Telecinco finished yesterday day with a 2.54 per cent increase.
This gain has stabilised its loss to 15.66% for a year.
The value in Stock Exchange of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and announced by Vocento (13% plus) is thus EUR 4,488.88 million, according to Bloomberg data.
Its rival Antena 3, which gave up 1.52% yesterday and accumulated a 40.5% decline since January, costs half, 2.193.46 million.
The value of the other communications companies listed in Borse amounts to 3,571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2,518.53 million in the case of Prisa (the editor of Cinco Días) and 1,779 million in the case of Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antenne 3 is due to the fact that we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is what we are able to do, on the same market, at what price and how we can afford it in terms of hearing.'
Telecinco announced last week that he intended to become the first television channel this year to exceed the 1,000 million gross advertising revenues, as reported by Giuseppe Tringali, the delegate adviser of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the subsidiary who manages the group's advertising.
In order for this information to be real, the television channel should record an increase of 3.6 per cent for the current fiscal year in its billing for advertising compared to the 2006 fiscal year 965.4 million.
For its part, Antenne 3's net billing increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the year (up to 734.4 million) while net TV revenues increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts point to for the best relative evolution of Telecinco in Borse is the important payout that he has kept so far: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarría distributed 100% of the profits among its shareholders.
Vasile ensures that, although it is early to make a decision, this ratio may vary after the purchase of 33% of Endemol and in association with Mediaset.
' We have the official commitment to give at least 50 per cent, although we have always said much more.
This year, I hope that we will be able to make our shareholders happy, those to whom we have already given titles with 33% of Endemol'.
According to analysts, the market now gives signs of fatigue.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its profits estimates on Telecinco in 2008 to 4% and in 2009, to 7%.
This is due, as they explain, to the projected growth of income from 10.5 per cent to 8.4 per cent in 2008 and from 5.5 per cent to 5.1 per cent in 2009.
The same company decreased Antenne’s profit forecast from 3 to 4.5% in 2008 and to 7.5% in 2009.
3 opinions
1.
Ibersecurities recommends that both values be purchased on the basis of its important dividend profitability and its long-term sustainable potential.
2.
Caja Madrid sees Telecinco (accumulate) better than Antenne 3 (maintenance) for multiple attractions and business growth.
3.
JPMorgan: recommends that both cases be considered as there were similar threats ' (a saturated market and a bad economic climate).
Congress approves the transposition of the Mifid, which entered into force on 1 November
At the same time as its parliamentary formality, which ended today with the vote of Congress on the amendments incorporated into the draft in the Senate, the Government submitted to a public hearing the regulation that would develop the new law, with the aim of its entry into force before the year ended.
Representatives of the various groups agreed to highlight the efforts made by Members and Senators to negotiate and allow for the best regulation capable of ensuring investor protection and to regulate in detail the activities of agencies for the efficient functioning of the markets.
The Mifid, which amends the Value Market Act, involves the modernisation of financial markets, as it strengthens investor protection, enhances the powers of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promotes cooperation between the various European Union leaders.
The new regulation will provide financial consulting services for both specialized social and legal persons and create a new type of financial services (ESIS), financial consulting companies (AFI), which combine value companies, value agencies and portfolio management companies.
In addition, it increases the number of systems for the execution of operations on financial instruments, so that it is possible to add to regulated secondary markets multilateral trading systems and order internationalization systems, which compete with current stock exchange managers.
The Act also obliges investment services undertakings to disclose on the market information on the key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and risk management forms and obliges them to keep a register of all operations they carry out to facilitate the control of the NCMV.
By the Congress Economic Commission, several amendments have been added, one of which points out that titled debt will be considered as a "complex" financial instrument given its high risk to the investor, which has been demonstrated by what happened with the US high-risk mortgage debt (suppression).
In addition, they benefited from the transposition of the Board of Directors have benefited from the legal delimitation of the functions that graduates in Economics may have 30 years after the approval of the Royal Decree, which delimits the professional functions reserved for economists in 1977.
For its part, the Senate has incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as that of the mediator, who will work on behalf of a company, who will not require the authorisation of the CNMV and who will be able to provide its product marketing and attractiveness services to different investment firms at the same time.
The price index for harmonised consumption increases by five tenths in November to 4.1%
This indicator, which is used after Eurostat to incorporate it into the European Union's inflation rate calculation, provides a balance on price developments in Spain during the month of November.
Its publication responds to Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) policy by providing comparable data in time and quality to those produced in the United States.
The advanced indicator is calculated using the same process as that used for the Harmonised Consumer Price Index, but using various statistical modelling methods to estimate information that is not yet available for publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the advanced indicator is only indicative, because it does not necessarily coincide with the final data that will be revealed on the next 14 December.
"The IPC will continue at relatively high levels"
The second Vice-President and Minister of Economics Pedro Solbes said that the increase in GDP by 4.1% in November was a "temporary figure", but at the same time he predicted that the price index would continue at "relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes stated in Congress corridors that "even though the figure is not good" Spain's inflation differential on monetary union continues to be "more or less" the same as in recent years.
He also explained that in November "there was less surprise" than in the previous month, when the Government did not face such a high increase.
"We were expecting a figure of around 4%," the Minister of Economy acknowledged in relation to the data announced today.
Virgin's plan to recover with Northern Rock 42,000 million euros over three years
The Northern Rock deposits have fallen by more than 50% to 12,000 million pounds (16,800 million euros) since it entered into crisis in mid-September and had to use an emergency credit with the Bank of England.
At that time, he collected a few records of more than 25,000 million books, a figure that was gradually dropped in two and a half months due to the lack of trust of his clients and despite the 100% guarantee that the Government had provided and that it would maintain until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, who would rename the organization with her financial brand Virgin Money, needs to capture around a quarter of the British bank's income that will be deposited in the next three years to obtain these 18 000 million remaining books to reach the goal of 30,000 million.
The Richard Branson magnet group, known for its advertising campaigns in the United Kingdom, intends to spend 50 million pounds (about 70 million euros) per year in advertising and marketing to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock appointed this week the offer of the Virgin Association, to which three other companies participate, including its favorite to save it from the bank.
The Mayor of Totana was arrested for alleged urban corruption
The Civil Guard arrested today early in the morning the current mayor of the Muslim municipality of Totana (the People's Party) because of his alleged relationship with the urban corruption plot discovered this week.
In addition, one of the secretarys of the municipal council and the chief of the municipal police were also arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced me last May with Juan Morales, the current member of the right, and until then the municipal councillor of the mayor, who, according to the sources of the investigation consulted by the SER Chain, could be the 'minor' of this plot.
Officers continue to search the municipal premises and those of the Urban Board, and the possibility of new arrests is not missed in the next few hours.
In addition, Juan Morales' lawyer, chief suspect of the urban corruption plot, discovered at the beginning of this week, was charged.
As indicated yesterday by the SER Chain to the lawyer of the 'popular Party' MP Juan Morales, he was arrested from the home of Morales with important documentation in his possession regarding the plot.
In addition, according to the sources of the investigation, the investigation is the alleged acquisition of Morales commissions in exchange for facilitating the signing of a urban agreement with a Galician construction company to re-qualify 200 hectares of land.
For the time being, there are eight persons in custody.
Bono agrees to be at the head of the Spanish Socialist Party's candidacy for Toledo and to preside over Congress if they win the elections
The former Minister of Defence José Bono accepted the offer of the President of the Government and Secretary-General of Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to be the head of the list of the Spanish Socialist Party for Toledo for the next general elections and to be the President of Congress in case the Socialists win the general elections.
Thus, the Spanish Socialist Party's secretary José Blanco and Bono even announced it during a press conference after the meeting that took place this afternoon at the federal headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The Chief of Executive justified the offer made to the former Minister because "it is important to count on the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best".
He also stressed that "yes it seems" that the political man of La Manche will be the candidate of the Socialist Group who will preside over Congress if the Socialists win the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as President of Congress, who published his decision last November not to present himself to the next general elections and abandon his political career to focus on combating climate change within the university framework.
The former Minister acknowledged that the President of the Government had not stopped insisting on his return to the political front-guard since he had abandoned him two years ago.
He also noted that, although citizens already know who will be the Vice-President of the economy if the Spanish socialist party wins the elections, his party wanted to announce the President of Congress in a "transparency act".
If he reaches the position, Bono hopes to turn the House into "a house of respect and not of insult or cry" and make it "more and more like citizens".
"Sometimes it seems regrettable that the only place in Madrid where we cannot speak peacefully and calmly is Congress, the President of the Government in the Senate has been interrupted on some occasions 26 times."
Similarly, he had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Marín and "his knowledge to do" and he did not want to act as if he had already taken his position to avoid falling, as he had pointed out, into what his opponents might consider to be "a domination".
A Climate Propaganda
Since the climate change movement is subject to unhappily persecution, both the skepticism of its predictions and those that give priority to other political and social battles, it must demonstrate iron consistency.
It is so much more the case for a leader of the movement who is the president of the Government as Zapatero and who believes that this fight is more important than that of Islamic terrorism and who even proposes to sign a "new contract for the planet".
This approach obliges him to explain why the action or inaction of his Government has made a decisive contribution to Spain's being the head of the European Union in the non-implementation of the Kyoto Protocols.
Those responsible for non-implementation, in which areas has it occurred and why its Government, the contract with the planet, has not avoided it.
In addition, it must clearly explain to the Spanish what measures it will take to curb climate change.
What companies will be affected, what habits of citizens will have to be changed, what individual and collective energy savings will be forced on us to do, what economic consequences this will bring.
That is, who will sacrifice himself and who will pay to save the planet.
But there was and there will be no explanation.
Just because it's about sacrificing and paying.
The measures against climate change, real measures, are unpopular.
Costless, uncomfortable and threatening for businesses and individuals.
Until one hundredth of the essence suggested by the Spanish socialist party seemed to Zapatero to be so dangerous that he was forced to deny it.
That is to say, it is about saving the planet with nothing, only with propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
With phrases that have implications, commissions, committees, protocols, new posts.
With these contracts with the planet, this man is so useful for electoral campaigns that he does not speak, that he does not complain and that he does not demand, that he embellishes meetings and inspires tenderness.
Provided that this is only limited to being a purely virtual Contracting Party and that we do not claim to be travelling by bicycle or refreshing ourselves with the range.
The mayor and chief of Totana's local police arrested for alleged urban corruption
The Spanish gendarmerie arrested the mayor of Totana's Murcian locality, the "popular" José Martínez Andreo, the chief of the local police, the secretary of the Mary and a suspicious hotel contractor for possible urban crimes, today reported the sources of the investigation.
The city councillor was arrested at his home and was taken to the city hotel, where many agents were gathered, who were also present at the City Councillor of Urbanism and at the municipal management company of Sol Industrial and Housing.
These three orders are added to the six orders made last Monday in the provinces of Galice, Murcie and Madrid, in an operation relating to the revalidation of more than 2 million hectares of agricultural land to urbanize them so that the Galician company Nuaria can build 4,000 dwellings, after the payment of illegal commissions during the last legislation.
In addition, two other persons have not been arrested but are charged in the judicial investigation, which the Court of First Instance instructs.
The first six prisoners are now handed over to a court order.
According to the sources, the previous city councillor of Totana and currently the autonomous parliament of the PP party, Juan Morales, is the subject of the investigation.
In addition, the ex-wife, the owner of a real estate agency currently registered in Totana, was charged, as well as the current fiancee of the former municipal councillor, who lives in Murcie.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and contractor of Vigo (Galice) Manuel N.A., were arrested in Nigran (Pontevedra), as well as Pablo José M.G., director of Suelo de Imonauar, the agency of the Nuaria Group, and through which the pots would have been made.
The investigation is under the responsibility of the Urban Crimes Group of the Central Operational Unit (UCO) of the gendarmerie whose officers, in addition to arrests, have carried out eleven inspections, the majority of the companies related to detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcie, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
Thus, one person was arrested in Totana, in total, the owner of a very well-known avian product company in the region, which could have played an intermediary role.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for the development of the largest residential complex in Totana's town of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 homes, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company acquired in Totana 2.2 million square metres of land that had been requalified and its project would involve doubling the population of the municipality, which currently has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group is composed of companies such as Autesa and Inomonar, which deal with real estate promotion; Conycase, which manages Vigo's parking in Coruña, Venezuela and Fernando el Católica streets; Hogartel, which deals with direct marketing; Preconiza, which focuses on the promotion, sale and installation of building elements.

Our Finnish correspondent provides us with yesterday's comment in Finland's most important newspaper (certain PISA information heads above the educational level in the world), Helsingin Sanomat, who refers to what they published on 18 November, the same day that he appeared there, curiously, the criticism of the book Blackburn:
"The content of the course of philosophy has challenged public opinion as a result of the tragedy of the Yokela school.
The guilty of the dead, a baccalaureate student, quoted in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
The Philosophy Education Adviser, Pekka Elo, demanded that teachers adopt a critical attitude towards Plato on what is written in the pages of the daily Helsingin Sanomat, and he stated that studying Nietzsche is not essential in philosophy's compulsory basic course in high school."

A colleague provides information on the introduction to the Penal Code of Offences on Internet Downloads:
A. Downloading a song would be a punishable offence from six months to one year.
On the other hand, the flight to a CD store for a value of less than EUR 400 is considered to be only a mistake (Article 623.1).
B. Flight to a store for a value of up to EUR 1,000 is already considered a crime, but the penalty is lower than that imposed for download (article 234 of the Penal Code).
C. If you fly a car and you pay it 40 hours later, the penalty is lower than that imposed for the download (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a luggage than to participate in the traffic of compact disks.
Participation in a tumultuous luggage involves a penalty of three months per year (article 154 of the Penal Code) and CD trafficking would involve a penalty of six months to two years
(Article 270 of the Penal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a film under section 184.2 of the Penal Code.
F. The distribution of copyright-protected and unauthorized films is more punishable than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (art. 186).
Finally, if my colleague is in the truth then someone is exaggerating.

My doctor talked to me about one of his foreign research articles entitled 'Money produces brain activity, especially if others receive less '.
In other words, the feelings generated by the monthly pay of workers depend on what colleagues earn.
The study was conducted through tomographic resonances at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the group responsible for neurocognitive images of the Life&Brain Institute in Germany: "The strongest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his partner failed".
The researchers observed that when the two people found that they received the same pay, the activation was moderate, but if one of them received the double, the activation was greater.
I don't know if this conclusion required so much science.
The Balkan Prosecutor
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly pursuing Balkan war criminals since the public ministry of the Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, which is located in The Hague for eight years.
His term ends at the end of the year, and Carla will go away with a bitter taste, because the main responsible for the murder of Srebrenica - in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims were killed - former General Ratko Mladic and former Serbian leader Radovan Karadzic are still at large.
Their names are in this list, with the documentary by Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach taking his title, ' Carl ' (2006, not designed exclusively in Spain), with the rhythm of a police thriller, who follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York, who continues the fugitive criminals and pressures the governments involved to withdraw the circle.
What kind of insurance do I need?
Car insurance, which covers the driver in the face of possible disasters, involves an important expenditure that will depend on various factors, such as age, sex, the age of driving licence, civil status, the type of vehicle to be insured or the actual use of the vehicle.
Having a car is the main thing.
And it is that, choosing the right car insurance is even harder than choosing the vehicle model.
And that is, choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the vehicle model.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insurer.
This commitment is materialised by an insurance contract, which establishes that the company receives the value of the premium granted and in exchange it becomes responsible for the obligation to pay the compensation in the event of a disaster.
The premium is the price of insurance, which is established by taking into account various factors such as age, sex, age of driving licence, civil status, type of vehicle to be insured or use, among other things.
Insurance companies set their prices according to statistics, so that the higher the probability of an accident, the higher the rate to be paid.
That is why people over 25 years of age and women have to pay lower premiums, as statistics show that these people have a lower rate of disaster than they do.
Similarly, using censuses, companies concluded that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use of the vehicle will affect the frequency, and therefore the probability of an accident.
By increasing frequency, the probability increases.
They are many variables that insurers take into account when setting the premium price.
For this reason, the driver must carefully examine the situation in order to choose the car insurance that best suits his profile.
We will present here the most significant variables when choosing one or the other type of insurance, so that it, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insurer, offers a reasonable price.
Young people under 25 years of age must face various disadvantages when passing an insurance contract at an affordable price, such as low driving experience and old driving licence.
Although the ideal to be secure is an insurance at any risk, other more economic options exist.
The most predictable drivers can opt for any risk-free insurance, so that they get the cover of an insurance at any risk but at a more affordable price.
This form of convention implies that the client pays part of the amount of the disaster.
"The part of the amount of the disaster that the customer spends will be determined according to the value of the premium, which will be higher the amount will be lower," says Luis Noguera, the head of First Europe, Online Insurance Mediator.
Another option is extended third party insurance, so that the customer ensures protection to deal with damage caused to third parties, but for those caused by his own car.
In addition, it would be covered against the flight, the fires and the loss of the vehicle.
A tip.
If you are a 25-year-old trying to be careful and avoid disasters as far as possible, this will affect the bonus, which may reduce the insurance price in the future.
A subsidy is a reduction in the basic rate owned by the company.
On the contrary, sanctions are an increase in the basic tariff.
"The benefits and penalties will depend on the company and its benefit.
If the company has had a good year, it may be able to increase the subsidies," Noguera said.
Over the past 25 years, this becomes easier for drivers at the time of passing an insurance contract, as the rate of disasters is reduced by the accumulated experience.
That is why it is preferable to choose any risk insurance with frankness.
"Youth normally cannot benefit from the experience gained after an accident," says the European company ' s director in Spain and adds that the majority of accidents occur during the second year of driving, once the fear of news has passed.
However, if the client is married but has not yet had children, it is preferable for him to negotiate insurance at any risk from the moment his economic situation allows him to.
Marriages with children are considered by insurers as people with the lowest rate of disaster, because the increases will be weaker.
In this case, the best insurance would be any risk-free insurance (may be EUR 300), or an extended third-party insurance from the third year of life of the vehicle when the insured has a high level of bonus.
"They have a more casual conduct and they have a greater purchasing power to afford luxury to assume a more important amount of franchises," judge Luis Noguera.
For pensioners, insurance at any risk with franchise is preferable (being EUR 150), or a third-party insurance extended when the insurer has a high level of bonus.
It must be said that car insurance is something of importance, not only because it covers the driver in the face of possible disasters, but also because it represents an important expense, that is why it is essential to properly study the insurance that is most suitable for us in our personal situation.
Celtic will try to win a point in Milan to reach the eighth final
Milan AC and Celtic Glasgow are next Tuesday to San Siro looking for the point they lack to reach their respective goals in the closing of the Champions League, as it serves Italians to be the first and Scottish to rank.
The Italians total ten points and already qualified during the fifth day through a zero match in Portugal, while Celtic Glasgow has nine points, but it still needs another point to make sure that Shakhtar Donetsk, who has six, and who receives Benfica who has four, does not pass on to him.
These two games of Group D will be played a week before the sixth day ends, as Milan AC has to compete with the semi-finals of the World Cup of Clubs in Japan on 13 this month looking for a place for the end of December 16.
Thus, this group will remain closed before the zero match at the Giuseppe Meazza stage seems to be the most expected result, although the two teams will try to get out victorious, as the Italians will not want to speculate at home and Celtic Glasgow knows that by winning it will remain first and ensure a better crossing in the eight finals.
A failure of Gordon Strachan's team might be sufficient to sort out if Shakhtar Donetsk doesn't win, but it won't only computer on this because with nine points the game goes back to Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but who won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
Thus, the Milanese tried to poison the Scottish evening, who hoped to rank themselves for the eighth final for the second time at the Champions League, after having been beaten during the last edition by a goal of Kaka during the extensions (1-0).
Waiting for the victory of the "Rosoneri" the triumph would return only to the Shakhtar, where the Celtic would be lost, to rank for the eighth final in order to continue the league of the UEFA champions.
And it is that Benfica, although it is the last and without the possibility of continuing European competition, could reach third place with a victory.
20,000 people attend Vancouver for the first concert of the Spice Girls tour
The Spice Girls began in Vancouver, Canada, in front of about 20,000 spectators, their first tour since the group dissolved in 2000.
' Posh Spice ' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) said shortly before starting their concert in the city of GM Place de Vancouver that the group meeting was "bright".
Around 20,000 people have exhausted the tickets to attend the concert, which was the subject of a video telling the story of the group that got angry at the end of the 1990s.
The meeting and the World Tour coincide with the launch of a new album that resumes their main success as well as two new songs, ' Heads ' and ' Voodoo ', which EMI publishes in Spain.
The five members of the Spice Girls are on stage showing the bracelets offered by the wife of 'Posh Spice', British footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was in the audience that filled GM Place, even though Victoria had banned him a few days earlier.
Before the start of the show, Victoria Beckham noted that the British footballer "did not see our costumes, so I'm nervous because I don't know what he'll think of the show."
' Sporty Spice ', which was part of the group in 1998 "because of differences between us" and which led to the dissolution of the group two years later, also expressed its nervousness during an interview with the press, two hours before the start of the show.
"I was scared.
I was nervous, but I saw that people's feelings changed, the feelings for the Spice Girls changed.
And I thought why not, I'm glad I made a decision," Chisholm said about the group meeting she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also noted that with time, "the things have been arranged and we appreciate it very much".
But many things have changed since the Spice Girl showed up for the last time in 1998.
To begin with, according to CTV, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special Virgin Airlines plane.
On their arrival at the airport, an army of babies was waiting for them.
They have five sons.
After the Vancouver concert, the group will be shown in California (USA), San José (December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5-7th).
They will be displayed in Madrid on 23 December.
The new gas business between Russia and Ukraine is alarming.
A dispute over the price of gas fermented between Ukraine and Russia, thus increasing the risk of the impact on the exports of fuel to Europe.
Most Russian gas exports to the European Union (U.E.) are sent by gas pipelines, and each pipeline is scrupulously monitored.
Kiev announced that if Russia increases the cost of fuel, it will increase transit taxes to Russia.
Last year, an altercation between the two had led to a decrease in supplies to the U.S. countries.
The last dispute between Kiev and Moscow occurs after the Ukrainian government and Gazprom, Russia's gas-supply-supply-supply-supply-supply-supply-supply-supply-supply-supply-supply-supply-supply-supply-supply-supply-supply-supply-supply-supply-supply-supply-supply-supply-supply-supply-supply-supply-supply-supply-supply-supply-supply-supply-supply-supply-supply-supply-supply-supply-supply-supply-supply-supply-sed-supply-supply-sed-supply-supply-supply-supply-sup-sup-s-sup-s-s-sup-sup-sup-sup-sup-s-sup-s-s-s-sup-s-sup-s-s-sup-s-s-s-s-s-sup-s-s-s-sup-sup-s-s-s-s-s-sup-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-
Gazprom stated that it would increase as planned, its prices in Ukraine as it agreed to pay for 2008, up to 50% more for gas supply from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts said that this would involve Ukraine, an increase of 40% of the costs of imports from Gazprom.
"It is essential for us to use all our arguments during the talks, recalling that we are a country through which most of the gas passes," said Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinkh to the Reuters press agency.
"The fluctuations in gas costs would undoubtedly be linked to our discussions on transit taxes (to Western Europe) via Ukraine"
The last major altercation between Moscow and Kiev caused in January 2006, the interruption of Gazprom's supplies to Ukraine.
This led to a drop in exports to Western Europe, thus increasing prices.
Russian gas represents a quarter of the European Union's supplies.
Russia has the largest gas stocks, although most of them are still under development.
As a result, Gazprom completes its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other nations of the former Soviet Union in Central Asia.
The Ministry of Health must 'control its foreign employees'.
The Scottish Ministry of Health must improve the checks to be carried out on its extra-Community employees to verify whether they have prior criminal records, the Monitoring Committee said.
The general auditor Robert Black's warning occurred after a foreign doctor working in Scotland was involved in the attack at Glasgow Airport in June.
Mr. Black also expressed concern that the Ministry of Health of Scotland had no specific data on the number of overseas persons employed.
Its report also highlighted other decisive controls, which were properly carried out on a sample of employees of five health authorities.
The auditor-general carried out checks on extra-Community personnel following the attack by Glasgow Airport.
Bilal Addullah, a 28-year-old Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra de Paisley hospital, was arrested at the airport after having sunk with his jeep in the main terminal doors.
He took advantage of the three doctors who were filmed in Old Bailey in October because they were suspected of being involved in various attempts to explode cars in the United Kingdom.
The Ministry of Health will have to carry out pre-employment checks on overseas personnel, to be certain of the validity of their qualifications, experiences and work permits for the United Kingdom.
Although the Scottish Ministry of Health uses Scotland's Dissolvement to carry out prior criminal checks, the Agency has no right to obtain such information outside of Great Britain.
Among the many warnings, the auditor-general's report now states that the committees are required to confront the Office of Criminal Precautionary Control, thus allowing employers to carry out controls over various countries.
"Although we have found that some information on staff has been well verified, this is not always done," the report announces.
Mr. Black said that the Scottish Ministry of Health carried out most of the pre-employment checks that he would carry out himself, but he added: "Our report highlights aspects where the system can be improved in order to ensure that adequate information on certain members of overseas staff is available to health services.
Mr. Peter Terry, President of BMA Scotland, said that it was "extremely unlikely" that pre-employment controls could identify employees who could commit future terrorist acts.
He said "the report suggests that pre-employment checks currently carried out work well in the Scottish health system and that it is not certain that these warnings can bring some added value."
The Scottish health authorities said that 1161 people were employed abroad, consisting mostly of doctors and nurses.
However, the auditor-general stressed that these figures must certainly be revised upwards, in part due to problems with the identification of staff members with indefinite contracts, who could choose to remain in our country or not.
The investigation showed that the current control procedures of the health authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian are entirely adequate.
These checks shall be carried out on passports, work permits and qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently revising its policy and system of pre-employment controls for staff outside the health service.
The Secretary of Health Nicola Sturgeon said: "I was excited to carry out this work as a result of the terrorist attack at Glasgow Airport."
She added that the Government of Scotland, which is allied to health committees, would carefully consider the warnings set out in the report that should be published next month, and would undertake to ensure better implementation of the recently updated pre-employment controls and valid for all employees, including those from abroad.
Joy Division dominates the Oscars.
Control, the bio pic on Joy Division's last singer, Ian Curts, picked up 5 prizes, including the best film, to the Oscars of the British Independent Film.

The black and white film whose musical band was produced by The Killers, David Bowie and New Order, was directed with a budget of nearly 3 million Sterling.
But the Dutch photographer, better known for his iconic coverage of the U2 Joshua Tree album, won two prizes, the first as the best stager and the second as the best stager starting.
The Rock has also been rewarded with the Best Documentary Award awarded to Julien Temple's film on the Clash singer, Joe Strummer.
The price of the best actor was given to Viggo Mortensen for his interpretation of the driver of a Russian mafia boss, in the thriller based in London by David Cronenberg, Easter Promises.
Ray Winston, known for his Korean character interpretations, won the Richard Harris award for his remarkable contribution to the British film.
The 50-year-old filmmaker, who has been filming films like Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the Indian Jones, The Kingdom of Crystal Crane.
Winston said that he was proud to receive this prize named in honor of Star Harris, protagonist in Camelot and Harry Potter, who died in 2002.
Richard Harris and Albert Finney have allowed people like me to have access to cinema," he said.
"I've been lucky enough to meet Richard Harris twice."
"I was admiring before this great actor, I was extremely honored"
The Oscars of the independent film, better known as "Bifas" are awarded by a jury composed of stagers, actors and festival organizers.
Among the fans and patrons of Bifa are Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom
Saudi Arabia Block 208 Terrifying Plots
Saudi Arabia reported yesterday that 208 militants were arrested in organized cells carrying an imminent attack on an oil site, as well as attacks on ecclesiasticals and armed forces.
The state-of-the-art TV of the world's largest oil exporter said it was one of the missile smugglers' cells.
Al Qaeda's supporters have launched a campaign against the United States monarchy since 2003, following Iraq's invasion.
A cell composed of eight militants, led by a foreign resident, planned an attack on an oil site in the Eastern Province, the TV newspaper said.
Saudi Arabia quickly formed a 35,000 military group to protect sites, following a failed attack by Al Qaeda in 2006, against the largest oil site in Abqaq.
The paper quoting a statement by the Minister of the Interior said that 18 arrested persons belong to a cell led by a "missile launch expert" who infiltrated the country.
It is said that the militants planned the eight-missile counterband in the kingdom.
22 persons in detention seem to have committed the murder of ecclesiastical and armed forces.
The government has asked the ecclesiasticals to do more against Saudis headed in Iraq, to join Al Qaeda militants fighting against the Allied Forces and the Muslim Shiite Government allied to the United States, considered heretics according to the hardline of the Sunny Saudis.
Al Qaeda militants believe that in Saudi Arabia many ecclesiasticals have worked with the authorities to support the policy of the royal family that dominates the government.
The militants, encouraged by calls against the Saudi government pro-Western, by Osama Bin Laden, leader of Al Qaeda of Saudi origin, targeted foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy supply sites.
Major efforts have been made by the armed forces during the last five... months," said the Minister of the Interior spokesperson on state television.
Among the detainees are 16 members of the Medine organized into a "mediatic cell" to promote "takfiri thought", the ideology of the Sunni Muslim radicals who support the use of violence against unfaithful and apostate Muslims.
Among the detainees, 32 persons are accused of subsidizing the militants.
The Venus climate could reveal the future of Earth.
Scientists said yesterday that Venus was certainly a pleasant planet to live on.
Data from the orbital European ship have shown that the planet is certainly twice as small as the Earth, contrary to what was previously thought.
Venus is the nearest planet to Earth.
These two worlds are practically the same size, with similar orbits, although Venus is closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that, billions of years ago, Venus could have had conditions similar to those of Earth, and could even have been habitable.
But the greenhouse effect due to carbon dioxide, atmospheric erosion due to solar radiation associated with a slower rotation has led Venus to all other kinds of evolution.
Today the planet is deprived of water, it is devastated by hurricanes and lightning storms and has a warm temperature surface enough to melt the lead.
The findings of Venus Express, the European Space Agency's survey, which has studied the planet for a year, offer a sad view of the potential future of Earth due to catastrophic climate change.
Professor of Physics at the University of Oxford, Fred Taylor, one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: "We begin to understand the reason why the Venus climate is so different from that of Earth, although the planets themselves are practically similar.
"Our new data enables us to establish a scenario that, billions of years ago, Venus would have been originally identical to Earth, could even be with a habitable surface."
From the rich uranium seized by the police.
A kilo of radioactive material, apparently uranium, was kidnapped by the Czechoslovak and Hungarian police yesterday.
One police officer said that three people had been arrested and that the equipment was currently being analyzed.
He did not confirm that it was good for uranium, but revealed that the merchandise would have a value of $1 million (£480,000).
Still open to all
Mitt Romney said not to be high as a candidate for the presidency, to answer the questions of a snowman.
Nevertheless, Republican candidates to the presidency finally agreed to participate in the debate on YouTube, during which many ordinary voters who had registered their questions submitted them to the candidates.
On Wednesday evening, 28 November, none of the questions raised were as ridiculous as the outcome of another debate on YouTube, when a snowman asked Democrats for their position in relation to global warming.
But this time, questions and answers have reflected much the conditions of the Republican Party, candidate for the next elections.
It is unknown what criteria CNN producers, who sponsored the debate, have chosen YouTube clips to show applicants.
But the first half hour of the debate, the longest one topic, focused on immigration.
The subject is one of the strong subjects for the Republicans.
CNN asked some voters to call when they heard funny things: The government raised approval when candidates expressed themselves grossly.
The most severe and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, leader of the national front, and Mr. Romney, who is in charge of the important upcoming elections of Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani tried to highlight the fact that he was comfortable with clandestine immigration during his mandate as mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts, of using clandestine immigrants in his home.
The two combatants became particularly fierce when they were asked if they would be prepared to promote an amnesia (offering the clandestine a regular status and the possibility of becoming a citizen).
Young candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a Californian congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, have been able to deepen this subject.
None of them have the option of being elected, but both of them remain in the race, can be due to the fact that they started fighting immigration before and more intensively than the others.
In general, candidates, at least with regard to immigration, have the same views: more stringent borders, and zero tolerance for illegal immigrants.
This issue, coupled with the concerns raised in particular by the case of toxic toys manufactured in China, or with other concerns about the outside world, encourages Republicans to forget, or minimize divisions between libertarians and Catholic conservatives.
But the debate became particularly embarrassing when other subjects were raised.
Mr. Giuliani asked why he had previously supported the arms control campaign.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether to put water in the nose should be considered torture.
One of the speakers asked if the candidates believed in the Bible as a whole.
This led Mr. Giuliani to dare to say that the Bible is his favorite book, even though he is not sure to believe in the history of Jonas and the whale.
Another speaker asked whether Jesus would have been in favor of the death penalty.
We did not expect to see Mike Huckabee, - in a position in Iowa during a recent election, thanks to his long-standing Christian conservativeism - to declare that the death penalty is painful though necessary.
When we insisted on whether Jesus would have been in favor, he laughed and said that Jesus was too dumb to present himself to the elections.
The human race remains unusually open to everything.
Mr. Huckabee's recovery in Iowa coincides with the recent prodigious research of grants carried out by libertarian Ron Paul, and the syllables during the debate on Wednesday.
These two are born from the infant, thanks to the fact that both party defenders fail to agree to decide who is the most well-known and more traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate united the party of good time and convincingly thanks to a successful message on the American size thus approaching the leaders.
This time, the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
The Pains of the Workers
Gordon Brown has discovered a new hole in which to shadow; even if he resigned, the situation would not change.
In view of the trend of British scandals, this is not particularly fair.
No decorations sold, no Parisian hotel invoices of politicians, no silky extra-swift toe.
But here's a revelation that a rich businessman would have been masked for four years, under false names, his contributions to the current Labour Party, equivalent to more than £650,000 ($1.3m), that the party would not have declared: A new battle with Gordon Brown would have happened.
Two months ago, the Prime Minister walked back on his election project, foolishly insulting the British intelligence, proclaiming that opinion polls did not influence his decision, and that he was hoping otherwise to offer a compact and effective government.
On the contrary, so much Vince Cable, the brilliant Liberal Democrat leader, said that the terrorist Mr. Brown turned from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The purchase of Northern Rock, a bank in difficulty on board the crack, showed a failure of the directives and a poor judgment in case of emergency.
Inadequate proposals to change the tax code have led to a coalition of industrial groups against the government.
The loss of 25 million personal data from tax authorities revealed an incredible administrative burden.
A trio of retired generals launched a rebellion among the Lords, protesting the reductions in military expenditures: they declared that being a minister of defence was for them, a part-time job.
At present, the suspicion of foolish donations by David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Secretary-General of Labourers (and his former head of oversight) made them resign.
None of this means that Mr. Brown is heading in unmistakably towards the exit.
However, governments can reach a point where it would be impossible to govern.
People don't like politicians, and they don't trust them, but generally leave their doubts aside when a new government comes to power.
It seems clear that a prime minister can't improve things, or even rule for a long time, when he is at risk of suspension: the public administration is no longer functioning; the cabinets of ministers are taking the lead; the press are looking for bad stories; and the government becomes defensive and no more objective.
In a sense, Mr Brown's position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders, he cannot boast of being a beginner.
Although he would like to repudiate Tony Blair, he was still his senior lieutenant.
The problems related to Northern Rock and tax data, for example, are related to Mr. Brown's decisions made when he was chancellor of the British treasure.
And even if it is not directly involved in Blair's misfortune, such a long investigation into the funds of the party "of money counting for the members of the House of Lords", voters might think otherwise.
But Mr Brown's difficult situation is not so tragic as it seems.
The gaffes are not as monstrous as the members of the Tories party believe it.
As in Mr. Bean, there's no victim or scroker.
And the remedy, although painful, could be to implement Mr. Brown's Stalinist tendencies at all times, in favour of a reliable and slightly brutal government.
The new political donation scandal is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, a very special character, who compared his donations to charity, said that he did not want any public recognition of his well-being.
He may have his opinion, but that's not his decision.
The laws against the anonymity of major grantors of politicians are clear, and they exist for a good reason: the public has the right to know which contributes to the success of those who will rule the country.
Mr. Watt, who said that he was aware of Mr. Abrahams' programmes, without knowing that it was illegal, should therefore be questioned, as well as Jon Mendlesohn, the head of the grant collections who had spoken of suspicious donations in October.
But until now, Mr Brown is not involved: Nothing makes him think that he has been aware of these actions, even though most of the payments made have been made as a result of his arrival to the government in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half of it.
He quickly condemned his party's legislative failure, but he failed to draw attention to the fact that the decision-making power is based on something he knows well, to appeal to a committee of inquiry on this subject composed of a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the lessons to be learned are not complicated.
And if the law has been suffocated, it's from the police.
In addition, there are many other things that Mr Brown must do, such as find a permanent chairman for the Independent Committee on Public Standards, without leading for six months, and prepare a good reform on the financing of political parties.
This would force the Labour Party, in a moment of weakness, to cooperate with the Tories, which could lead him to give up his special financial relationship with the confederations; in short, an amorous pill for a partisan such as Mr. Brown.
But he should face certain acts of partisanism.
The Conservative Party now has a good advantage for the elections; it has two years to reclaim voters, and the only way to win a victory is to demonstrate irrevocable integrity and strong skills.
You're breaking cards.
Would the mortgage crisis contaminate the US credit card market?
When there's blood in the water, it's normal to see waiters, snorkel around.
Now that the US real estate market is going through a critical phase, the predators aim at the US market for credit cards.
Goldman Sachs analysts believe that credit card losses could reach $99 billion if the account extends mortgages to other forms of consumer credit.
Stress signs are clearly visible.
There are increases in the rates of costs and insolvency, which measure the non-recovery balance sheets or are more than 30 days later.
HSBC announced last month that it took $1.4 billion in its credits to the consumer, partly because of the weakness of card holders.
It's just too early to panic.
Costs and insolvencys are still moderate.
According to Moody, a tax agency, the rate of insolvency of 3.89% in the third quarter is almost one point lower than its historical average.
The deterioration in rates is partly attributable to technical factors.
A change of laws in the United States in 2005 concerning the personal banking route caused a sudden fall in the banking records, which in turn caused serious losses for credit cards; the number of archives (and thus insolvency rates) could increase even if the loan conditions were to worsen.
The industry also announces fixed payment rates, which highlight the monthly debt amount that consumers have to settle.
and confidence in the security of credit card capital is strong enough despite the paralysis of other aspects of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research company, predicted that the volume of emissions for 2007 will be 25% higher than last year.
The direct link between the mortgage crisis and the credit card market is certain to exist: consumers may prefer to increase their income now that equitable real estate loans have disappeared.
But card issuers pay more attention to the flow of species rather than to the value of the heritage, so the fall in real estate prices did not necessarily lead to a change in the credibility of the borrowers.
They could even benefit credit issuers.
Consumer premiums for the payment of mortgages fall if the properties cost less than the value of the loan; therefore, credit card debt would become a priority to repay the whole.
Card issuers are able to respond much faster than mortgagers and with more flexibility to such crisis conditions because they can change interest rates or alter credit limits.
This should, in theory, reduce the risk of a rapid resumption of actions.
"We are not going to wake up one morning and re-evaluate all the loans," said Gary Perlin, Director of Capital One.
If a financial crisis in the credit card market is unlikely, there is a strong risk of a consequent decline.
If the lower real estate prices and a contract in the credit market lead America to recession, the industry will certainly have to face a macabre future.
Take good care of the dorsal swimmers.
British bankers blameable for the Enron case.
The three British bankers who had to testify to their role in relation to a fraud committed by the former financial director of Enron, Andrew Fastow, changed their statement, arguing guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were first declared innocent of the seven alleged fraud charges in 2000, committed by Fastow in a secret financial crash to enrich themselves despite their employees.
They should be brought before the court in January.
But during a hearing chaired by U.S. Judge Ewing Werlein Jr, they all claimed guilty of having committed a fraud.
The three former members of Greenwich NatWest, a subsidiary of the PLC Group of the Royal Bank of Scotland, have become famous everywhere in Britain due to extradition procedures that lasted for two years.
In the United States, their case remains a pending issue for this investigation launched following the fall of Enron in 2001.
The charges brought against them in 2002 made it clear to Fastow that he was the object of the government's investigation into Enron's debacle.
The charges against the bankers, named after the three Natwests, claimed to have come to Houston in 2000, to organize a fraudulent scenario with Fastow and his former right arm, Michael Kopper.
NatWest Greenwich invested in a branch of a Enron partner controlled by Fastow, who was the stager of many fraudulent scenarios, which helped him to call the banking procedures.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had considered its interest in the subsidiary null, but in fact the three British already know its value.
A company controlled by Kopper bought the interest of the branch bank for £1 million.
Bankers paid $250,000 to Kopper as an interest for this company.
According to the charge, Fastow would have wrongly announced to Enron that the energy company was willing to pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the branch.
But in fact, these $20 million went into the pockets of British bankers, Fastow and others.
According to the allegations, bankers would have earned $7.3 while Fastow, Kopper and others would have earned $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty for his active role in two conspiracy in Enron's debacle.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow has been incarcerated for six years in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is imprisoned for 3 years and a month in a prison in Texarkana.
The three British were released as a result of the payment of $1 million each, which obliges them to live in the United States during the trial.
Enron, before the seventh largest national company, in bankruptcy in December 2001, after years of accounting calls, could no longer hide his billions of debts or even offer his Bidon speculations as profitable.
The collapse has led to thousands of dismissals, more than $60 billion of market value loss and more than $2 billion of loss for retirement plans.
The founder of Enron, Kenneth Lay and former President General Jeffrey Schilling were sentenced last year for their involvement in the collapse of society.
Schilling was sentenced to more than 24 years in prison.
The charges against Lay for conspiracy, fraud and other crimes were found guilty of his death due to a heart crisis last year.
Not under, not outside of Moscow.
The cost of a G550 Golfstream aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and equipped with sufficient fuel autonomy to fly without a scale from Moscow to Los Angeles, is $54 million.
But this is just a small change for some Russians.
"He can transport up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a representative of Gulfstream.
"Even if no one really needs so much seats as it is more than a family-use aircraft or for the president of a company."
Mr. Firer was present at the Gulfstream stand, last Friday, at the Millionaires' Hall, a consumer-incentive for four days, which was held in a huge exhibition centre near the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other exhibitors were present with their stands, hoping to arouse the interest of the new Russian rich for their various products, ranging from yachts to diamonds-filled cars like those of 50 cents.
Mr. Firer was voting for a brilliant orange Porsche, exposed next to his stand.
"It's a nice car, but nothing comparable to our product" he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest private aircraft market."
"Thanks to a boom of oil, the Russian capital seems to be rolling in the black gold, such Dallas"
"We lived the same thing in the 1890s, when some Americans became so rich and landed in Europe where they were considered materialistic," said Marshall Goldman, a senior professor of Russian and Eurasian studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudis in the 1970s, Japanese in the 1990s, Russians emerge as the largest global spending.
The biggest luxury brands are looking for their place in Klondike.
This week, in another place in Moscow, a conference on the luxury industry allowed Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, president of LVMH, to exchange their ideas on the strategy to be followed for the sale of luxury goods in markets such as Russia.
(The conference was organized by the International Herald Tribune, which belongs to The New York Times.)
Russia has 53 billion worth of $282 billion, according to the Forbes list listing the richest.
In addition, two thirds of the wealth consists of 103,000 Russian million dollars, totaling $670 billion, according to a study on the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, carried out by economists at the Centre for Economic and Financial Research.
(The World Bank stated that 15.8% of Russians lived below the poverty line in 2005).
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow, that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, a representative of Davis Morris, a London jeweler.
She participated in the salon for the first time in the company of the Russian distributor, The Soho Jewellery Group.
"Women are all well prepared and men are worth a fortune."
Walking in the living room, Sunday night, the two real estate agents put on their 31st, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26 said to be like their clients, millionaires.
"I was looking at the cars and tried to choose between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said Melle Yumatova, who held her high-cost clothes as a red carpet veteran like Joan Rivers.
The salon seems to be primarily aimed at the new rich, the kind of Russian brand buyers willing to make the queue in the holes to come up to a huge warehouse where Cadillac Escalades are exposed to platinum cans, Mövenpick ice creams, custom billiard tables, apartments in Dubai and bears in Gund.
The public could buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
"The Russians are interested in defining the most expensive and the best brands," said Mr. Gijrath, who proudly sits at the Royal factory stand of Dutch porcelain manufacture Delf, in front of a wall painting by Raimbrant on blue squares, hands.
"it is certain that the Russians are more interested in bling bling"
In fact, the sellers stated here that Russians with old capitals (10 to 15 years old are too old according to Russian standards) have already moved from logos to a limited edition that could not be sold in the salon.
Even so, thousands of people, whether millionaires, millionaires or tourists, suffer daily exposure.
And some even buy.
During the first night of the exhibition, on Thursday last, Roman Ershow, King Koil's bed PDG, said he had sold two sets of silk mattresses, cashmere, and gold threaded cotton.
During the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, the sales director of the A1 motorcycle, a company that equips cars with latest alarm systems, also said he had sold to a Russian millionaire, the brilliant orange Porsche, for $170,000.
From Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, L.A. President of Connection, a company that personalises luxury cars, said he would sell three cars similar to braceletes, for Rolls-Royce Phantoms, at $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter, the wheel of a car designed for the owner of a Russian casino, who wanted her to be trapped with Swarovski crystals to look like a wheel wheel.
The four-cost set is $22,000.
"The Russian millionaire who wants the wheels made of murky leather, or a photograph of his wife made of cubic zirconium, will not necessarily drive with such tires," said Mr. Karapetian.
He will certainly keep it in his garage containing 30 or 40 vehicles »
Although many of its Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian said that the term "Russian millionaire" is not on the agenda, given the increase in real estate prices here.
"If you had bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you would already be millionaire, at least on paper, if it is not in cash," he said.
"more than you could think"
Those who are not millionaires can at least feel this emotion when they go to the stand of the Continental Alliance, a Russian heritage management company.
The company raised four stands representing British telephone booths, full of counterfeit dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing director, said his team had printed 500,000 fake tickets for the Millionaire Hall.
Passers stopped to launch a lot of tickets, asking their friends to take the photographers on their mobile, to the beautiful middle of this false wealth or to shut down a few million.
"You see, here in Moscow, everyone can feel millionaire," said Mr. Karyev.
Unapproved surgeon suspected of murder in New Jersey
It was the wake of Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked through the glass pool of the restaurant just a little Healthier and noticed an ambulance that just stopped at the White Cape Code doors on West Scott Avenue.
Then the police patrol arrives.
And then another one.
"Then I saw the medical vehicle stop" said Mr. Livingston, a restaurant manager, on Wednesday.
That's where I realized someone was dead.
The authorities would then learn that the deceased was a 41-year-old woman, Olga Arroyo, assistant director of the Newark Police Department.
Now the investigators are trying to determine whether the cause of his death is due to a gesture performed by an unapproved cosmetic surgeon, who has not yet been identified by the police, resident at 212 West Scott Avenue.
The authorities have not yet determined the causes of the death of Melle Arroyo, but they await confident, the results of the toxicological tests that will take time, but which should help resolve this mysterious death that has attracted the high ranks of the Newark police.
Melle Arroyo was the assistant police director, Garry F. Mc Carty, since September 2006, and his voice was well known in various departments.
She was loyal, great worker and tenacity," Mr. McCarthy said about Melle Arroyo in a phone interview on Wednesday."
"She was like a pit bull"
"She would have done everything to protect me"
Mr. McCarthy said that Melle Arroyo was married to Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who was working for the Alcohol Control Commission, and that she left two children aged 14 and 11, as well as a beautiful daughter.
Eileen Walsj, speaking from the Union's county prosecutor Theodore J. Romankow, said that the detectives were trying to determine whether Melle Arroyo was killed because of an unauthorized surgical operation.
"It's an opportunity to consider."
"the investigation is ongoing."
The authorities declared that they had arrived at her place at 3 p.m.
and found Melle Arroyo on the sofa.
She was declared deceased.
A little more than a week has passed since, and the authorities have not said much about the investigation or even about the owner of the house identified as Flor Margarita Castro.
Melle Walsh could not confirm whether Melle Castro was questioned by the authorities.
Investigators seek to understand whether a part of the house was used as a medical office.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door to Melle Castro's house where a fanned roser lay in the narrow cemetery front, and a Dalmatian lay on the back.
A blue bidon called "Ethyl Vanillin" used as a substitute for the vanilla in the kitchen and for perfumes, lay in a hangar, next to a door that leads to the ground.
Two bikes every field hanging on the sides.
McCarthy said that since his arrival in Newark 25 years ago, in the New York Police Department, Melle Arroyo has been extremely valuable, helping him navigate the new city and abandon his framed political culture.
"She said "you have to be careful about this" he said.
"She was there when I arrived, and still there when I left.
"It Was Boring"
Everyone hopes that the Federal Reserve will reduce the rates associated with the global stock exchange.
The shares are blown off both sides of the Atlantic yesterday, after the market hoped that the Federal Reserve would have tried to calm the credit conditions, subsequently reducing the interest rates promoted by the peaceful statements of the Vice-President of the US Central Bank.
Bursary markets explode in London, New York and throughout Europe after Donald Kohn, No. 2 after Ben Bernanke, President of the Federal Reserve, said that those who decide should be "flexible and pragmatic" in their actions in the affected financial markets.
In a clear effort to reassure irresponsible markets in view of these new credit-related tensions, Mr. Kohn said that the recent turbulence had partly "inversed some improvements in the functioning of the end-September and October market.
If this was to continue, this would increase the likelihood of further rigidity of financial conditions for owners and businesses, he said.
These comments appear to investors as a clear signal that the Federal Reserve is ready to inject new capital into American markets and that further decreases in interest rates could stabilise credit conditions.
These remarks also allowed Wall Street to calm down with even worse news on the American economy, such as the biggest drop in real estate sales for the month of October.
The impact of this financial turmoil was accentuated as a result of Bear Stearns's statement, an investment bank, announcing that it would license 650 people, i.e. 4% of its staff, to reduce costs to compensate for the heavy losses caused by the loss of real estate loans.
There are only 20 posts in London where the bank employs 1500 people.
In New York, the industrial average of Dow Jones increased by 331 points, or 2.55% to 13,289.40, while the largest index, S&P 500, was 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index took 165.5 points, or 2.7%, to 6306.2 adding more than 39£ to the value of British companies.
The German index Dax increased by 2.6% and the French CAC40 took 2.3%.
Previously, the reappearance of credit difficulties in the markets was highlighted by the strong demand for three-month stock purchases from the European Central Bank, which has cut these loans to European commercial banks at a heavy rate of 4.7%, the highest since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to monitor the EDF and the ECB and to invest additional funds in London's financial markets causing credit tensions caused British banks to raise their three-month lending rates to 6.59% since September.
England faces an appeal to judgment against the criticisms of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara.
We are facing two dilemmas, one as difficult as the other.
Who's gonna be the number6 drummer for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And even more important in a broader context than the first Sri Lanka test, who will make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the president of the electors who was exceptionally here to help Peter Moore, coach chief, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, make his decision, and because Hugh Morris, the president-general of England, began to fill out the application forms to become a national electorate, at least in part time.
The one who fails to win the N°6 file will be malicious, but life is often unfair and sport is also.
It's never easy to get a man to get to the top of his profession while someone else will never get to the lower level, sometimes by lack of chance more than by lack of ability.
There is only a cricket that the selection is difficult, because in the end the judgment remains subjective.
Is it a good time to make Bopara emerge?
Is it just about Shah?
The same could be proposed in another context, which would choose between John Edwards or Banerjee "tubby"?; both, new graduates, professionals, should be promised: but there is only room for one of them.
Who has the right to determine the level of a critic unless he is given at least one chance?
The figures are important in decisions, but also opportunities.
Within a team, a cricketer must capture the captain's eye, at the same time he must take the door and a drummer must be able to touch the cricketer one day.
But catching the eyes of the selectors is much more complicated.
Many have done better last season, for example, James Anderson, who seemed to play the first test, even though Stephen Harmison would declare himself in full form and continue to train in service.
Anderson took 32 first-class doors on 33 tours to win a place.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 on the same average, but both have already lived their moment of glory at the highest level and hope to offer yet.
If it's Shah or Bopara who's gonna play at Asgirya, it's just a matter of opinion.
This choice could drive or build a man's career, but it doesn't make a difference.
Four years ago, in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in each Test and was successful in the first, with five doors and 40 useful turns, but it was Paul Collingwood, who also struggled to emerge, who managed to become the main critic of the Test, and this, despite the fact that his double-cent mark against Australia in Australia could still be appreciated.
The probability is that Graveney, Vaughan, and Moores, following another discussion after today's session at Asgirya stage, will surely follow their conservative instincts and will promote Shah's greatest experience against the exuberance of young Bopara.
They both have good arguments.
In favour of Shah, his brilliant and considerable beginning at the innings of the 88 test in Bombay, 32 hundred first-class against six for Bopara, who is seven years younger at the age of 22, and his excellent ranking at the launch.
But Shah made only ten rounds during his two innings in May against the Caribbean during the Test in Lord, his Middlesex player city, and that, the immediate rejection by the voters when Vaughan again formed, claimed his place for the next match, seemed to have hurt his elans so obvious in Bombay.
Unlike him, the Essex player is full of joy to live.
Nothing scares him on a cricket field and he exaggerated when he recently captivated himself on a 4x4 at a Volkswagen presentation, sponsored by England.
He only reported slight injuries, was shocked, even though the first thing he did was to take his Vodafone (sponsor well on) and call Alastair Cook, his team who looked away, to ask him if "he had seen this?"
Bopara is far from the best drummer, its fiancee allure allows him to do services that go with him, and he fights with confidence and professionalism.
Choosing a just man is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Could it be the true art of the selection?
I'd be happy to give Bopara his chance, which doesn't mean that Shah shouldn't apply if, like the tea leaves suggest, it's him who's gonna play this weekend.
Buses bring people back to work, and fight against al Qaeda.
The first bus filled with Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, pouring these exiles without money or visa renewals, or others who hoped that the city had found normal.
Some have come to fight the militants who have driven them away from their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of 800 persons transported in dozens of official government bus convoys, the terminal was filled with refugees from Syria and Jordan who had come through them.
"I decided to go to Syria after they killed several doctors in Baghdad," said Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came back today because I saw on TV and read in the newspapers what happened in Baghdad and because the city is more sure now."
"They say that the Mahdi army is no longer committing crimes!" he said, referring to the Shia militia of the Moqtada al-Sadr ecclesiastical militant, who forced his men to withdraw for the time being.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shia teacher in the Amaryah area dominated by the Sunni, returned with his two children because he could no longer renew his Syrian visa and because the regime prevented the Iraqis from working.
His neighbors from Shia to Amariyah called on him to inform him that the United States-assisted militia was able to chase Al Qaeda west of the capital, and invited him back.
One of Jordan's new arrivals is the leader of a Sunni and Shia tribe who had to leave his home in northern Baghdad because of an attack on the grenade after he had urged citizens to rebel against Al-Qaeda.
But he had to come back to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me they had set up an anti-Qaeda militia in Sleikh, and they needed me and my boys."
"That's why I'm coming in today," said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62 years old.
Many say that they have been attracted by the growing accumulation of capital since the American troops arrived, and for the continuing training of well-armed "citizen groups" working with US soldiers to defend their neighbors.
But others say they have been forced to return because of the visa problem and the decadence of the capital of Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old father of three children, expressed the suspicion felt by all about the visas for exiles that Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, Shia, would have asked the Syrian government to restrict to force people to return to the country.
More than two and a half million people would have fled the country due to sectarian death squadrons.
"We had no problem until al-Maliki arrived in Syria and encouraged the government to give no more visas to the Iraqis, to force them to return to Iraq," Sunni said.
"I can't trust a government that supports criminals who burned my house when I left."
The decline in violence can be partly explained by the fact that the Sunnis have been chased out of Shia and vice versa, creating places where tensions are less.
It is feared that a sudden flow of refugees does not again increase sectoral tensions and cause fights.
Little Sarre, good training.
The smallest federal state conducts vocational training, and shines even through the international orientation of its higher schools.
It is only in one area that a deficit on the Sarrois, similar to that of the rest of the country.
"I explained yesterday for the 50th time to a non-Sarrois, that we are not French" - this is the slogan that the smallest federal state, by self-defence, displays for its 50th anniversary.
At this level, France and Luxembourg play a major role in the training system of Sarre, a system that is the fifth in the Training Monitor of the German Institute of Economics of Cologne.
Thus, by tradition, higher schools cooperate closely with neighbouring countries.
The university was founded in Sarrebruck in 1948 by the French.
To this day, students have the opportunity to complete their studies with a double or a triple degree.
This shows the high rate of 15.6 per cent of foreign students.
In addition, Sarre also leads the children of the country to higher schools higher than the average - many of them without a diploma from the Gymnasium.
"In Sarre, we benefit from the vocational training system," says Axel Plünnecke, an IW training expert.
More than one out of five students receive their degree in a vocational school, so Sarre is located at more than seven points above the national average.
The combination of vocational and academic training is thus relatively well developed.
In view of the number of inhabitants, the dual course panel is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical training and growing demand, however, the number of engineering graduates has decreased by one third in recent years.
That is why the Ministry of Sarrois Education has forced higher schools to have a marketing campaign in engineering sciences.
"After the first PISA studies, we have celebrated a large number of reforms in general schools," says a spokesperson of the Ministry of Education.
Thus, the government introduced comparison tests in all federal states.
In order for children to start learning earlier, the last year of crèche is free of law - a model that while other federal states are also copying.
Only future comparative studies will be able to demonstrate whether students' performance is improving in a sustainable way.
In PISA studies in 2003, the risk ratio decreased from 29% to 20%.
Overall, however, Sarre has not improved as much as other federal states.
The Bavarians get better off.
And despite the sarrois, knowledge in foreign languages is not measured by PISA studies - otherwise we could win points in this area.
Because the language of the neighbor is mandatory in high school - even if the sarcasm are not French.

In Venezuela, the watches will soon be ticking other than in the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chavez will have the clock back up for half an hour in the South American country.
Chavez becomes a caricature in Spain in the meantime.
As the official newspaper of Venezuela reported, due to a new law, watches will be regulated at least four and a half hours of universal time.
In this way, the South American country obtains a time zone that does not exist in any other state of the world.
Anti-American Chavez justified his position among others because the United States would have imposed on the world the separation of full-time slots.
In addition, Chávez announced on Wednesday (local time) the termination of relations with the neighbouring country, Colombia, due to a settlement case.
The nationalist on the left announced that as long as the Conservative Alvaro Uribe remained president of Colombia, he would not have relations with the head of state or with the Colombian government.
"I can't do it, just because of my dignity," Chavez said, who is looking forward to a constitutional reform on which citizens of the oil country will have to vote by Sunday's referendum.
With this reform, it would significantly strengthen its power in the country.
The starting point of this dispute was the decision by Uribe to withdraw from Chávez the mandate of negotiations on the release of hostages with Marxist rebels in Colombia.
Uribe would have "cracked the face" of Venezuela with this decision, had criticised Chavez on Sunday.
In Spain Chavez is also in all mouths.
A new mobile phone ringing in the country: "Why don't you call" is the phrase that already more than half a million people have downloaded on the Internet.
It was pronounced by the king of Spain Juan Carlos, who was most recently the Ibero-American summit, angry with the constant interpellations of the left populists and who told him to laugh.
A decline in wages threatens Germany in 2007.
Despite the strong economic situation, according to a forecast, a real lower value of wages threatens German employees this year.
Experts have cited all kinds of reasons to explain their pessimistic prognosis.
According to the Hans-Böckler Foundation, employees should expect a real reduction in their payroll compared to the previous year in 2007.
"The fault is due to the low wage development, to the increase in the added value tax and to the increase in food and energy prices," said Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Circumstance Research, in the newspaper "Bild".
New fees could also be involved in unemployment insurance for the employee.
The Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told the newspaper "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" that the expected fall in unemployment insurance of 3.3 per cent for the new year was certainly correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the National Employment Agency no longer has the right to be in a position to ask the Federation for appropriations or financial assistance, according to the SPD politician's words.
It was known on Tuesday that the explosion of food and hydrocarbon prices had increased the inflation rate at its highest level for 13 years.
In total, prices increased from 3.0 per cent per year to each other.
He came to be the Hellenistic twin of the Earth.
Despite its hostile atmosphere to life, Venus is more like Earth than we have ever thought: the European space probe "Venus Express" has discovered lights in the atmosphere and wind turbines at the poles, just like those appearing in winter on Earth.
For almost three decades, scientists have assumed that there are lights on Venus.
The European probe "Venus Express" today has given evidence of this - it has detected electromagnetic waves at the limit of the atmosphere: the lights on Venus shine at a height of about 56 kilometers of cloud clouds, reports Christopher Russell of the University of California in Los Angeles in the scientific magazine "Nature".
According to the famous theory of cyprine, the lights would have shown life on Earth: Orage would have stimulated reactions in the oceans that have led to the formation of amino acids, the cornerstone of life.
This is not the case on Venus: "If there was a life there, it must have been a very old date of history," says Sean Solomon of the "Carnegie Institution" in Washington.
Today there should be little living things on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is about one hundred times denser than on Earth, sometimes at temperatures of 500 degrees.
"It may be the hellish twin of the Earth, but it remains a twin," said Russell.
Why Venus, which is so much like Earth in mass and dimensions, has been hit by a different evolution, is the fundamental issue of the ASE mission.
The departure of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was an important step in Venice's research, as no more probes have been on the way to exploring this planet since the 1990s.
According to researchers, the most recent research results that have now been presented in several articles of "Nature" not only highlight the singularity of Venus in the solar system.
They also show that the common points with the Earth of our neighboring planet are more than expected at first.
So researchers found, in addition to wind turbines already known at the North Pole, a cloud turbine at the South Pole, which rotates even faster.
The phenomenon recalls air currents in the terrestrial hemispheres in winter, writes a team of researchers around Giuseppe Piccioni de l'Instituto di Astrophysica Spaciale e Physics Cosmica italien.
The second planet of the solar system has almost the same mass as the Earth and is, with a diameter of 12,100 kilometres, almost as large.
The star-qualified planet of night or morning revolves around the sun in just 225 days.
However, it turns much slower on itself: a venous day lasts 243 earthly days.
Although Venus, with temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, does not recall the Earth, scientists assume that the two planets were formed under similar conditions.
On both sides, the water accumulated and remained on Earth in the form of oceans, but was lost in the space on Venus.
And while carbon dioxide is fixed on Earth as carbonate, it is on Venus most of the atmosphere.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalaï Lama.
The President of the Federal Republic of Germany Köhler demands the end of the party's quarrel over the welcome of the Dalai Lama to the Chancellor.
In an indirect manner, he criticized the SPDs for attacks on the office after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany's appearance and is the largest chlorine coalition in terms of the Dalai Lama reception.
"We must not present a divided nation on this issue to the outside world," Köhler told Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler showed understanding for the welcome of Dalai Lama by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"Human rights have universal validity, even if I have respect for cultural differences," Köhler said.
Everyone knows that Germany should maintain a sensitive foreign policy balance, stressed the President of the Federal Republic, but defended Merkel against the allegations that she would organize a new China policy.
The German chancellor did not take his distance with the traditional policy of a single China.
"China also knows," Köhler said.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs Frank-Walter Steimeier (SPD) had indirectly expressed his discontent about the welcome of Dalai Lama and had been attacked for this outside the ranks of the CDU.
Steinmeier complained, in particular, about the "future policy" of the UCD in foreign policy.
Following the reception of the Dalai Lama at the Chancellerie, virulent irritations were felt in the German-Chinese reports.
Thus, not only did the Chinese government order German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but Spiegel reportedly also frozen the dialogue on the foreign ministers' strategy.
The head of the Chinese government Wen Jiabao now demands the German Chancellor Angela Merkel to recognize that the Dalai Lama's reception was a mistake.
China refuses European political men to receive the spiritual head of Tibet in his official functions, thus supporting Wen Jiabao's Chinese position.
The words and actions of the Dalai Lama would show that it tries to separate Tibet from China and other Tibetan regions, including other current provinces.
Schäuble warns against riots such as those of France.
Street fights with the police, shootings, fire cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against riots such as those of France.
Everything must be implemented so that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not erupt in the streets by violence, the German Minister of the Interior has demanded.
Barricades burning, fighters shooting at the police with hunting rifles: after the serious riots of young people in France, German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears similar developments in Germany.
We must make sure that a social explosive does not also come into our presence and decomposition in violence.
We must take this seriously," he said to the "New Press" in Hanover.
All young individuals would not be able to cope with the rapid transformations of social reality.
The Federation, the federation and the communities were already working hard to reduce problems, Schäuble said.
This would not only affect the integration of immigrants.
"From the summits of integration to the conferences on Islam, it already shows its first successes."
But it would be too soon for an end of alert.
Schäuble points out at the same time as in the German flags, there are no sociological problems, both from the point of view of urbanism and in France.
In the northern Parisian agglomerations, young people had suffered serious street fights with the police during the last night.
In Toulouse too, public cars and buildings burned.
Increased efforts to integrate the German government required the President of the Turkish communities in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In view of the riots in France, Kolat warned against "imitation effects".
The situation in Germany would certainly not be as explosive as in France.
But there would still be a need to act.
Kolat points out that the unemployment rate among young people under 25 years of age from immigration would be higher than the average.
More training places should be provided first and foremost.
Kolat insisted: "We must give young people a perspective."
However, the President of the Turkish communities added that social control in families was more taking place in Germany than in France.
Many young people from immigration also do not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat called out, "But we still have to be careful."
Young people should be "quickly given the opportunity to participate in work and training".
While waiting, in the Parisian Faubourg of Villiers-le-Bel, everything remained very calm during the night.
Police units were in place, a helicopter flew over the area with projectors.
The posted authorities reported three arrests, as well as some burned cars and pubs.
Since the conference, a deployment of approximately 1000 security forces has calmed down.
The police will intervene as long as is necessary, announced by Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie after a visit to Faubourg.
On Tuesday night, almost 80 policemen were injured during riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The following night, the disturbances came to Toulouse.
The riots erupted after a traffic accident in which two young people had lost their lives on Sunday.
According to the first elements of the Parquet, the police are not responsible for the death of young people.
In the realm of Angela Merkel.
The utopian entrance of the chancellor shows that the coalition has ended with the background - and there is nothing more to expect of it.
In what country does this chancellor live in justice?
After his deplorable intervention in the general debate of the German Parliament, which was chaotic and poor in content, it must be said that it is not here - not here in the country which should at the end be governed by it.
The reproach of focusing too much on politics was rebutted by Angela Merkel of a harsh and presumptive sentence.
It's provincial, she said, and she only showed by that that she doesn't want to understand what critics want.
In Parliament, she made it clear to everyone how accurate this reproach was.
There was no concrete interest or little feeling about the country's problems.
Instead, Angela presented herself as a cloud: a politician in the press, who ran into foreign politics and even remained there in the near future.
For example, climate protection: in this regard, she still congratulates herself on Heiligendam's agreements, but does not say how the climate goals should be achieved in our country.
Even, the praise itself - having too little modesty, the head of the CDU would have rejected it two years ago.
Now it is clinging to formulas all the time, that growth would touch people.
This is where she destroys her image of pragmatist, who solves the problems instead of embellishing the world.
But in the empire of the Angela cloud, domestic policy problems are a marginal phenomenon.
Poverty in children and the concerns of low-wage workers?
He's got a few phrases left for it.
In this regard, the number of times it makes loopholes when it comes to family allocation is revealing.
Here, Merkel needs three start-ups to pronounce a half-precise sentence.
She's been in the unknown field from the moment it becomes concrete.
The Attack Branch
In the debate on YouTube by the Republican presidential candidates, both Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney's favorites are delivering themselves to a tough offensive battle - and now they have to fear an outsider.
The tension of the candidates is already in the first place.
He would have made New York a "refuge for the clandestine," Mitt Romney reproached his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
On his side by heavy insults: "I would say that his own house was a haven for clandestines" Giuliani replied and accused the former governor of Massachusetts of having employed immigrants without papers.
The candidates go up to the attack: as the Republican base also has no official favour, the eight presidential candidates are talking about CNN first and foremost to discredit their opponents.
The 30-second amateur films that Internet users sent via Youtube are barely more than blowers.
"It is with this kind of isolationism that we have allowed Hitler to come to power," John McCain launches his candidate Ron Paul, who is the only one in the round to claim an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney also learns from Vietnam's veterans vigorously, when he refuses to condemn as a torture what is called the Waterboarding, a method of interrogation where the nude is simulated.
However, the fact that the main themes of the campaign are moving from time to time beyond the war in Iraq and the debate on torture is reflected in the reactions of the St. Petersburg Joint Room in Florida.
Whether conservation values are rented or future tax increases are refused, applause is absent in the auditorium.
That's where they show up once again where the weaknesses of the two favorites reside.
"I made a mistake at this time," explains Romney, contradicting and presenting his apologies to the base and the public on television for having still been a partisan of abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, goes into a fluffy knot when asked for his opinion on Scriptural interpretations of the Bible.
Musharraf reigns for the first time in civil.
One day after his withdrawal as army leader, the Pakistani power man Musharraf was invested as president.
So eight years of military domination are over.
Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf was invested on Thursday for a new five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live to the presidential palace of the capital of Islamabad.
Musharraf vowed to respect the Constitution and to act for the welfare of the Nation.
On Wednesday, he had handed over his army leader to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and was thus subjected to international pressure, including that of the United States.
Eight years after his taking power by a Putsch without bloodshed, the former general now reigns for the first time as head of civil status.
As a result of this withdrawal from the commander's position as commander of the armed forces, Musharraf met the main demand of the opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is the end of the state of emergency that Musharraf had decreed on 3 November.
Shortly after his investment, Musharraf will suspend the state of emergency, according to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayum, and will thus meet another West requirement.
The Supreme Court of the country, which Musharraf had occupied after the establishment of the state of emergency with lawyers of its ranks, had rejected all appeals last week against the controversial re-election of the head of state on 6 October.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed in the northern tribal region of Northern Waziristan in an attack on a military convoy, and four other wounded.
According to the military spokesman, a bomb exploded in a street near the Afghanistan border.
Krautrock's fathers are returning.
The German supergroups of the 1960s met: the three members of the Harmonia group again took their console in a concert in Berlin.
For their return there were records of their great success "Live 1974".
Already at that time, they were much more known abroad.
The expected sensation then takes place in the form of three ambassadors announced at the evening show.
Each one has his little box in front of him, his cable, and above all his buttons.
Dieter Moebius, 63 years old, sits in the middle in a white shirt like snow.
It is flanked to the left by Michael Rother, 57-year-old and has a portable computer and a guitar.
On the right, observed by the entire auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73 years old, bends on his console.
Everyone contributes to the noise, including a beat.
And sometimes this is accompanied by inadvertentness to a piece of traditional music.
This does not seem to disturb the Members themselves.
The fact that the Harmonia group is playing again assured you for a few weeks among Krautrock's lovers.
We have the right to disclose it here: targeted surveys reveal that, of course, the name is reasonable in the collective memory of the pop, but in no way so sustainable that this group has also been missing painfully for 32 years.
But why wouldn't Germany also have the right to celebrate its living legends in the 1960s?
More and more that what is called "Krautrock" is increasingly more in England and America than in the country of origin.
When the music industry in 2003 awarded the Echo Prize to the survivors of the Cologne Can Group for their work, the German pop faces were seen in the room questioning.
When the Red Hot Chile Peppers also thanked the groups La Düsseldorf and Neu! in the Panegyrian slogan, the surprise had no more limits.
Later, during the concerts, Michael Rother jumped on the Red Hot Chile Peppers scene as an old friend.
The problem of ignorance in itself and the transformation into the unknown is the only and unique.
The memory is of this fact already taken by Harmonia, because the trio existed only two years and that during this period, the impact power that felt was much lower than what was subsequently attributed to it by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had already played with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the very promising name of Cluster.
We played first in the caves below the Berlin stage.
Then in Düsseldorf, for a label subsidized by the church, for financial reasons.
Rother had briefly posted in Kraftwerk and had finally become a guitarist with Neu!, who was then perhaps the most radical German group.
About 1973, however, Rother followed the musicians of Cluster in exile in the Weserbergland forests.
There, in an old Weser farm, a 16th century ruin, they lived as members of communities fleeing the city.
Less ideological than in the community "Komune I", where Roedelius had the right to be tortured as a nurse.
Rather an artistic existence in the way of Spitzweg.
So there was a fan of the Hormonia Ottenstein choral and also a name for art.
Many keep Harmony away from that.
The first album was called "Music von Harmonia", and the next "De Luxe".
Because as serene and fashionable as music sounded, the group suffered from material poverty.
The harvest of the dead wood did not serve him alone in his search for himself.
The "Live 1974" CD, which has just appeared, was recorded at a concert in Griesem in front of a public record of almost 50 heads, as well as someone who thinks he can remember.
At that time, Rother issued the desire to force Harmonia to train from time to time.
It was an immoral requirement for Roedelius and Moebius.
The group announced its separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the spheres of esotericism and will ensure his existence with albums such as "Flamende Herzen" (flame hearts).
Cluster reanimates in the four-year-olds and has been more successful than Harmonia has ever had.
We owe the live album of Griesem to Herbert Grönemeyer.
Its label Grönland has been designed to maintain the Krautrock as a German contribution to contemporary music.
Neu! had already been destroyed on this occasion as the personal work of Roedelius.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place at the World Cultural House in Berlin.
Publicly funded under the Waldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is here, the British, former punk and author of the "Krautrock Sampler" pocket book.
There's also the inventor of Loveparade, Dr. Motte.
By which the entire margin of fluctuation of Krautrock's influence would be clear with respect to future pop music.
The space left empty by the group will be completed by Harmony.
Brian Eno's phrase plans in the room in the middle of the individual sounds: "The only true music, you listen to the future."
There are photos showing producers with Harmony in the farm room.
The projections of other black and white photos of cabled bassar tools serve to form the legend.
In front, the three veterans are again busy improvising.
But more by sticking microphones to the organ and battery, to pull the instruments from the innoutical sounds through the instruments that are built themselves.
Today, electronic music is similar to electronic music.
The three in large technical fignolers.
Even the choral of the house won't change anything.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, we sneeze and sneeze under the cloud of sounds, and we sing at a beautiful moment "Aaaaaaaah" with emphasis.
Krautrock has always been a very English concept.
It's never been rock.
The roots were less researched in the blues than in the music conservatories (Can), the Kraftwerk technologies (Kraftwerk) or in the escape from the artistic or social conventions (cluster).
He who calls "68" is not entirely wrong, and Harmonia is no longer angry with it now.
But what goes most of itself will be covered in detail on the scene.
Where does music start and where does it end?
It can tap on someone's nerves (?) or give away some moments of great joy.
Richard Gere is just not cynical enough.
With "The Hunting Party" and "Peace Killer", two films once again address the Balkan war.
But they don't convince each other.
Both the projects rely too much on the action and the exchange of foolish shots or on the contrary they are too tearful.
Here, even Richard Gere in "The Hunting Party" can't help.
The good news first: certain war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the Balkan mountains, but it is right there, in the most luxurious backdrop of the war in Bosnia, that actor Richard Gere was then found.
In the last place we had lost sight of the most beautiful man of the four-year-olds, because too many nice and ugly roles in films with feelings for women and too many press conferences on the theme of Buddhism delighted him to show himself.
Today Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to look at even "The Hunting Party" - when the hunter becomes the chaser (why do today's films have to be as long and confused as collective car drivers' conventions?)
He gives a wonderful representation full of eyelids: in the bottom, his character to bear of the war Simon Hunt is what Gere could have become, if the fate and the film industry were not as charitable: a man who has his best moments long after him, but who, even as a monument in ruin at his decline, has preserved visible remnants of his former charm.
But despite this asset, "The Hunting Party" continues together with the German production "Killing Peace", which also comes out this week, the endless follow-up of films that have been dropped on the Balkan war.
The trial can be carried out quickly: the film speaks of two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save a Serb from the Kosovo archers, in which one of the two remains soon to fall in love.
Although it is welcome that the Serbs are not presented here once as the only causes of all the evil, this film is as flat as a film is lost too quickly in action and the exchange of crazy shots.
This remains a sort of "Alert for Cobra 11" without highways but with a war in place.
On the contrary, we can look at the perfect example of "The Hunting Party", why there has never been a real good movie on the Balkan war in the background.
The story of the three U.S. war reporters, who are committed to punishing the top war criminal "the renard", could have become, with another director and other screenwriter (both Richard Shepard), at another time a new "Apocalypse Now".
Because stories are strikingly similar: two males go on a small team in the forest, to accomplish something that soldiers cannot do and for both males, it becomes a journey in madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that we simply do not let Simon Hunt be the cynical desert with a heart, as it is presented to us at the beginning.
No, the script must give him more than a romantic adventure with a Bosniak murdered afterwards.
Then "The Hunting Party" becomes definitely bad, when it is reported, in the last five minutes, by an accelerated process, that NATO, the CIA and all the world's prize hunters have failed in five years: arresting the war criminal and leaving him for just revenge on the Muslim Bosnians.
It is so bad that the International Court of the Hague of Crime should be arrested against cinematographic logic.
In this case, the film has too much human concern.
He wants to report that Karadzic and Mladic are still at large, and he suspects the Americans and the French (here they must be exceptionally agreed) not to drive the hunt in a sufficiently intense way due to secret political agreements.
But the intended good and the wicked are so similar this time that a famous poem from Brecht comes to our mind.
He speaks of a wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet's work table: "Compassionly, I see the veins of the swelling front, clearly: how tired it is to be evil."
Films such as "The Hunting Party" have exactly such fussy heads, but they indicate how tiring it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the kind of movies on the Balkans war.
Recently, it was reported in this newspaper that all Hollywood films on Iraq were big flops.
We can add: there have never been any good movies on South Africa.
This is true every time: when a star pulls on a house of crisis or on a field of mines, it then comes out something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "Jenseits gor Grenzen" with Angelina Jolie or "Blutdiamanten" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
It is possible that all these conflicts are just too close in time.
Whatever the case, decades have passed before Hollywood can play a good movie on the Holocaust with "The Schindler List".
Some films still have to mature - those who today have classic works on Vietnam "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" have never been celebrated alone at their time as work leaders.
But maybe we know today just too much about the world's conflicts, where every hecatombe comes live on two screens at the same time at home,
And this makes the writers happy with the lack of scruples they need to tell beautiful stories.
"Being or not to be" or "The dictator" have in fact become as good as because Lubtisch and Chaplin did not yet know the extent to which the Nazi regime really dominated.
Maybe you don't want to be good when you want to make good movies.
Maybe you should have a sarcastic artistic look away from the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallel between his historical novel "Diktionaire de Lemprière" and the Balkan War, he replied, "It only holds that certain things never change."
"The great cities will always be horribly dangerous, men will always be killed in a horrific way, and the war will always reign in Yugoslavia."
Von Beust is reaping the criticism of the cancellation of the Olympics.
The resignation of the mayor with Hamburg's application for the Summer Olympics met in the policy and economy of critical virulents.
Many want to keep fighting for the Games on the water.
But Von Beust calls for realism in the assessment of chances.
The chief director of the Chamber of Commerce of Hamburg, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, described an abandonment on Wednesday as "bad for the local economy".
In recent times, no other project had deployed as much motivational forces in the city as the idea of the Olympics.
"Without this objective, the political and sports elite could not have been kept in the same measure."
Schmidt-Trenz invites the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new longer-term starting point, "which takes as starting point another modified agenda".
Major Ole von Beust remained on Wednesday to his previous statements that the Olympic ambitions of Hamburg were unrealistic at least until 2028.
"This is not Hamburg that decides to apply for the Olympics, but the German Federation of Olympic Sports," said Von Beust to WELT ONLINE.
It refers to the expected decision of the Sports Federation in early December, regarding Munich's 2018 Winter Games application.
This preference means to us that, in the time frame that we had planned until 2028, we will have no chance."
However, the dream does not necessarily belong to the past, Von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regretted Beust's statements.
This would give the impression that Hamburg no longer wants to apply for the Olympics in the next 25 years.
"It's too early to get a chance, burying the projects now," said HSB President Günter Ploß on Wednesday.
A resignation of the application would be more in contradiction with the statements made by the head of the Senate on the occasion of the reception at the plenary assembly of the German Federation of Higher Schools of Sport.
There, Von Beust would have qualified Hamburg's application for the 2015 Universities as "no replacement" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The Federation of Sports High Schools had first in the past weeks appointed Hamburg as a candidate city.
The mayor's SPD party accused the Senate of not using this precious time in the construction of houses in Hamburg.
"The development of the Little Grassbrook was rejected by the Senate for years because it played the Olympic Map and excluded the construction of dwellings," said SPD delegates Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD has always claimed for the Little Grassbrook an integrated plan in the Olympics and a later use of housing, the CDU would have put only on the "Event Factor".
The application for the Summer Olympics in 2012 would have raised a great enthusiasm for its part in Hamburg.
Hamburg, however, had broken up against Leipzig.
It's not Warhols' cash.
He who connects Swedish concepts and falls into wood, thinks of Ikea, but not Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
At this point, wooden boxes made in Sweden cast shadows on the Warhol works list.
A large part of the twenty-ten Brillo-Boxes of "Type Stockholm" listed there are counterfeits.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" had questioned the authenticity of Andy Warhol's Brillo Boxes a few months ago in 1968, Andy Warhol's internal research at the Moderna Museum in Stockholm has today come to a dissertation: the six "Brillo Boxes", whose former director of the Pontius Hulten Museum donated in 1995 to the Moderna Museum, are copies - as well as a large part of the other hundreds of Brillo-Boxen of "Type Stockholm", which circulate on the international art market.
The old history is enthralled, a disunity of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964, Warhol created his first "Brillo-Boxes" in New York, which is based on the red-blue-white design of the "Brillo" powdered soap cartons.
An exhibition of his work at the Moderna Museum was presented in 1968 - with the Warhol agreement - of hundreds of Brillo carton boxes: these were not from Warhol (for financial reasons) but were delivered directly from the Brillo cardboard factory.
This was not about art works here, but rather their models, exhibition samples.
At the same time, Warhol had given permission in 1968 to produce some Brillo wooden boxes in Sweden, which were not exposed to Moderna Museum.
Witnesses of the time today speak of about fifteen wooden boxes that would at that time be legally entered into the history of art and auctions, as the original Brillo-Boxes of Andy Warhol authorized, with the title "Type Stockholm".
Some of them have reached more than $100,000 in sales.
The problem now is that the legendary director of the Pontus Hultén Museum claimed, in fact, that about one hundred wooden boxes had been produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, that Warhol would then have handed him over.
In fact, the 105 Hultén caisses were produced in Malmö only in 1990 for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By that time, Warhol had already been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, the head conservator of Moderna Museum, examined three other Swedish private collections alongside the six Brillo Boxes, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: their stratified panels were first printed and punched, then applied with a paint brush on white oil.
The text of the copies dated 1990 reveals, on the contrary, that the painting was directly applied without background layer on stratified panels, with the help of a painting roll - it is no longer an oil painting, but an acrylic.
"These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Brillo Boxes," says Moderna Museum, Lars Nittve, director: "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York doesn't make another decision, the Moderna Museum will rank the six boxes in its collection as copies/exhibitors."
Already in July, the Authentication Board has heard well that it would investigate the "heavy charges" that will be raised in the case of powdered soap cases.
But since we've been there for an inexorable silence.
Manille's rebel soldiers abandoning
In the Philippines, the rebel soldiers left, the same ones who had settled in a hotel in Manila, and who had demanded the withdrawal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Chief Antonio Trillanes, who criticized the President for corruption and electoral fraud, told reporters in the hotel that he could not respond to any bloodshed.
The faithful men of power had recently taken over the hotel with the help of lactating gas.
The two dozen soldiers had been dragged into the building for hours.
About half of them held Wednesday before the courts because of an attempt by Putsch in 2003 - among them Trillanes.
He benefited from the hearing to suddenly slip away with about 30 sympathetics.
Military policemen, who normally had to watch them, apparently had been deserted in his favor and joined in his mutiny.
They entered the Hotel Pennsylvania and demanded the withdrawal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
The loyal troops in power seal up the area around the respectable hotel.
The President convened an urgent meeting of the Security Office.
The National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemns the actions of the soldiers.
"People have enough," said Trillanes.
"We call people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, who was in charge of the Scout Rangers elite unit, said that other units of the army soon wanted to join the march.
Critics of the regime had called for a major demonstration against the President on Wednesday.
His government has been surrounded by corruption complaints for months.
The financial district of Manila was already the theatre since 2003 of the attempt to mutiny about 200 members of the army against Arroyo.
The insurrection broke almost 24 hours after the army refused to join it.
Since 1986 there have been at least seven attempts to putsch against governments elected democratically in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes a main shareholder of Versatel.
United Internet has ensured more than 20 percent of Versatel's telecommunications company.
The average price per action is 14.46 euros, as reported by the company on Wednesday.
Only 20.05 per cent of the social capital would be held.
We've already speculated on a robbery before.
The option would remain open to further increase participation in Versatel.
This does not seek to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL market, United Internet reported.
Just before, assumptions had already been made on Wednesday about an entry, after Berenberg had increased its participation in the Düsseldorf network operator from 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
The credit institution would only hold the money for a third party, which is reported on the market.
The guard, the United Internet had already acquired a nearly 10% share in the Drillisch mobile phone company.
As part of an increase in capital, Drillisch placed 17.4 million new shares in Stock Exchange worth €106.4 million.
United Internet has purchased 5.15 million for 31.1 million euros.
In addition, companies have opened negotiations on cooperation in the marketing of DSL products and mobile telephone.
"We strengthen our partnership," explained a United Internet spokesperson.
Both companies founded the company in SME participation in order to absorb the competitor Freenet.
For the time being, both companies want to be satisfied with their ten percent participation in Freenet, and do not use their right to burn 18.49 percent additional in Freenet, entrusted the United Internet on Thursday.
However, both companies would leave all options open, especially to increase participation in the Freenet SA, it was learned.
The negotiations between the United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership ended in mid-October.
The still difficult to predict poker on Freenet, which has lasted for months, is part of the consolidation of the German telecom market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million customers connected by a mobile phone contract and 1.25 million DSL clients and full subscriptions.
The Holding of United Internet and Drillisch so far held a direct participation in Freenet of 6.01 per cent.
It was now agreed that Drillisch would provide approximately four percent more.
The right to buy 18.49 per cent of the investment company Vatas had already been decided in August.
