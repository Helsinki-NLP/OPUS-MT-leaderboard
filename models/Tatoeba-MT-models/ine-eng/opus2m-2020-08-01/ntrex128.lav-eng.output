The members of the Assembly (Assembly Members – AM) are concerned about the possibility of being "adopted as an army"
The members of the assembly are concerned about the proposal to change their name to MWP.
Its reason is the plan to change the name of the assembly to "Welsh Parliament".
AM throughout the political spectrum is concerned that it can make them a funny object.
One of the Leborist Party AM explained that their group is concerned with "playing with the words Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: The Welsh word "twp" means "unique", but the word "pwp" means "cake".
The Plaid AM indicated that none of the groups were "unsatisfied" and recommended alternatives.
The representative of the Vels Conservative Party acknowledged that their group was ready to examine the change of name, but added that "MWP" is very similar to "Muppet", which means "merm".
In this context, it should be taken into account that the word "w" in English is similar to the word "u" in Yorkshire dialect.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drawing up to change the name of draft laws, informed: "The final decision on what terms will be used for the appointment of members of the Assembly is, of course, to be taken by the members of the Assembly."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 granted the Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation of the proposals, which received extensive support for the change of the name of the assembly to the Wales Parliament.
As regards the name AM, the Commission gave preference to Welsh Parliament Member (WMP), but MWP received the highest support in the public consultation.
The AM clearly recommends alternative options, but the struggle for an agreement can bring headache to the Speaker of the Assembly Elina Jones (Elin Jones), who is expected to submit a bill of amendment in the coming weeks.
The draft law on changes will also include other changes in the work of the assembly, including laws on the structure of AM’s disqualification and committee system.
The final vote on how they will be called will take place when they have discussed the legislation.
Macedonians go to vote in the referendum on the change of national name
Voters will vote on Sunday whether their country name will be changed to "The Republic of North Macedonia".
The nation's vote was organised to resolve a ten-year dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long argued that the name of the North Neighborhood is an impression of claims on its territory and has repeatedly opposed the request of Macedonia to be accepted by the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gorge Ivanov, one of the plebiscites, announced that he was ignoring the vote.
However, the supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zajev (Zoran Zaev), object that the change of name is simply a matter for the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's Divine Call hides the Church of Harlem fighting for existence.
"As the old people with whom I have spoken have been told, before every verse was by bar and god," says Mr. Adams.
"Now there's neither one nor the other."
He recognizes that the loss of bars is understandable.
"People are socializing in other ways today," he said.
"Just no longer in the living room that people visit regularly."
Speaking even to the gods, he is concerned that the money he receives by selling the property will end faster than the leaders hope, "and sooner or later they will return at the beginning".
God, he added, may be replaced by multi-dwelling buildings with apartments where people who will not help the rest of the temples around them will be washed away.
"Most of the people who will buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he explained, "and thus will come the day when these gods will turn to all times, because it is unlikely that most of the people who will gather in these apartments will become members of these congregations."
Both gods were raised by the white congregation, before Harlem became a black metropolis, in 1870 by Metropolis (Metropolitan), and 10 years later by St. Martin.
The early white Methodists ’ congregation was abandoned in the 20th century.
The building was taken over by a black congregation that had continued to worship God.
The Black Congregation of St. Martin’s Goddess took over his blessings during John Howard Johnson (John Howard Johnson). He led a boycott of the workers who had refused to work in black or to raise them in 125th Street, in Harlem.
In 1939, the fire broke down the building, but since Father Johnson’s congregation planned to rebuild the building, they ordered a call.
His blessing was David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor to the St. Martin's congregation, with pride called the call game "the calls of the poor".
The expert who played this call game in July used the following words: "Cultural treasure" and "inexhaustible historical instrument".
The expert Tiffany Ng (Tiffany Ng) from Michigan University added that it was the first call game in the world played by the black musician Dionisio A. Linds (Dionisio A. Lind), who moved 18 years ago to the largest call game in Riverside church.
Mr. Merrivesera (Merriweather) said that the St. Martin’s congregation did not replace him.
The events of the last few months around St. Martin’s goddess reflected the relationship between a group of architects and builders, some of whom had been engaged in the work of the temporal authority, and others — the diocese of the episcopal church.
In July, the Council of the Congregation, composed of the temporary leaders, addressed the diocese with concerns that the diocese "will try to transfer costs" to the Council, although the Council has not been involved in the settlement of the diocese architects and builders.
Some members of the congregation complained about a lack of transparency in the diet.
The shark injured 13-year-old teenager in the lobster fishing place
On Saturday, the shark attacked a 13-year-old boy in California who ran after the lobsters and injured him. It was the first day of the lobster season, the services tell.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m., near Beacon's Beach in the city of Encinita.
Chad Hammel (Chad Hammel) informed KSWB-TV Sandjego that he and his friends had a kidney for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy calling for help, and then the group rushed to him to help the boy pull out of the water.
Hammel explained that at first he had thought it was just a feeling about the wrapped lobster, but then he'd understand that the boy was crying 'I'm saying!
It's a sacoda to me!"
All his key bones were loose," Hammels said, who noticed it immediately when he had gone to the boy.
"I'm crying to leave everyone in the water: "There's a shark in the water!" Hammels added.
A boy with air transport was delivered to a children’s hospital in Reidia (Rady), Sandjego, where his condition was considered critical.
The species of the infected shark is unknown.
In a brief briefing by Captain Larry Giles, the rescuer reported that a few weeks earlier, sharks had been observed in this area, but it was recognized that it was not a dangerous species for humans.
Jails added that the victim was injured at the top of the rumpa.
For 48 hours, officials closed access to beaches from Pontho Beach in Casablanca to Swami (Swami's) Ensinitas (Encinitas).
Jails pointed out that there are more than 135 shark species in this area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sansbury's plans to impress the UK beauty market in the UK industry
"Sainsbury's" is being attacked by "Boots", "Superdrugs" and "Debenhams" with a universal-style beauty product for hair rows and trained sellers.
As part of a significant contribution to the UK’s largest beauty market of 2.8 billion, which continues to grow, while fashion goods and household items are being reduced, 11 shops will be tested in the country’s largest beauty products will be tested in a row, and, if everything is successful, the next year will be more.
In the beauty sector, funds are invested when supermarkets are looking for the possibility of using hair that had previously been given to televisions, microwave ovens and household goods.
Sainsbury's reported that it would double its offers in the area of beauty processing up to 3000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and, for the first time, Dr. PawPaw.
The existing lines from "L'Oreal", "Maybellline" and "Burt's Bees" will also receive more places with brand areas, such as those in the Boots stores.
The supermarket also repeatedly places on the market its boutique decorative cosmetic line, where most of the products will be vegan-friendly – which the younger buyers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, the fragrance wholesaler Fragrance Shop will try a concession in two Sansbury's shops, the first of which was opened last week in Croydon in southern London, but the second will be opened in Selly Oak in Birmingham, later this year.
Internet shopping and the transition to small food purchases in local shops every day means that large shops need to invest more to convince people to visit them.
The Managing Director of Sainsbury's Mike Coupe has said that the sales of goods will become more and more like universal stores, because the store chain is trying to fight the discount shops Aldi and Lidl, offering a wider range of services but without food.
"Saisbury's" has placed Argos trading venues in several hundred shops and has opened several "Habitats" since the purchase of both chains two years ago, which is claimed to have improved the disposal of goods and made it more profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to improve its beauty and pharmaceutical departments ended with a collapse.
Sainsbury's joint venture with Boots was tried in the early 2000s, but the Union came out after a dispute on how to divide revenues from pharmacies in supermarkets.
The new strategy develops after Sainsbury's sold 281 large pharmaceutical business to the owner of the chain company Celesio, Lloyds Pharmacy, for 125 million pounds 3 years ago.
According to this plan, Lloyds will be tasked with supplementing the range with a wide exclusive range of skin care products, including Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hiks (Paul Mills-Hicks), commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "In order to improve our customers' thinking environment, we transformed our beauty product's appearance and what it creates.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will always be ready to make a recommendation.
The range of our brands is designed to meet all needs, but the attractive environment with a comfortable location means that we are now a curious goal on the way to beauty, a goal that causes the arrivals of the past."
Peter Johns "full of vanity" after Holly Willubia's 11 million-pound deal.
"Dragons Den" star Peter Jones "takes over the niche" after the TV broadcaster Holly Willoughby (Holly Willoughby) turned down 11 million pounds of business with his lifestyle brand to pay full attention to his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willubia doesn't have time to dedicate her home clothes and accessories to the True brand.
A pair of business was compared to the Guinean Paltrow (Guyneth Paltrow) brand Goop.
"This Morning" 37-year-old broadcast manager used Instagram to announce that she was leaving.
Hollija Willubija has abandoned the "Dragons Den" star Peter Jones in anger because the last moment she got out of her profitable lifestyle brand business – to focus all on her new huge contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources of information claim that Jones was "full of vanity" when a TV gold girl was busy at a meeting on Tuesday at his business empire residence in Marlov (Marlow), Buckinghamshire (Buckinghamshire) announced that her new contracts, worth up to 1.5 million pounds, meant that she no longer had time to dedicate her home clothes and accessories to the True brand.
The company was compared to the Guinean Platrov brand Goop, and according to the house, it doubles the wealth of Willubia, which is estimated to reach 11 million pounds.
When Willubia (37) used Instagram to report leaving "Truly", Jones took away from the United Kingdom to one of his holiday homes.
As the source of information says: "Truly" was the main priority of Holly.
It was to become her long - term future that would be devoted to the decades to come.
Her decision to resign surprised all the participants who were not prepared.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday: everything was so close to the start.
The centre of Marlov is a warehouse for the full sale of ready-to-sale goods."
Experts believe that these Morning leaders, who are one of the most financially profitable stars, can pay millions to the company because a lot of money has been invested in various products — from paper and candles, to clothing and goods to the home, and will be even more late in placing them on the market.
And it can mean long friendships.
Three children’s mother, Willobia, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have had close relations with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willobia "Truly" together with Keppu was established in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined as president in March.
Both of them spent their holidays together, and Jones owns 40% of the shares in the company of Boldvina TV producers.
Willubia must become a brand M&S Messenger, and she will replace Entu Makpartlin (Ant McPartlin) as ITV's "I'm A Celebrity".
Jones near the source said yesterday, "We don't want to comment on his business."
A serious conversation "and then we fell in love"
He was concerned about the criticism received from news companies about a comment that some might consider "indecent to the President" and that he was so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has the President given up so much?
Tramps said in his image in the voice of "the dictator of news".
"I don't care how!"
He pointed out that Kim had shown interest in meeting again after Trump recognized his initial meeting in Singapore in June as a major step against North Korea's denuclearisation.
However, negotiations on denuclearisation have stopped.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, one of the main North Korean diplomats Ri Yongho (Ri Yong Ho) informed world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see a "response" towards the initial steps of North Korea in the direction of disarmament.
Instead, he pointed out that the US continues to impose sanctions aimed at maintaining tension.
Tramps was much more optimistic in his speech.
"We have a great relationship with North Korea," he said.
"We are preparing to fight North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have this great relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim had produced positive results — stopping rocket testing, helping to free the winners and returning home the remaining American soldiers.
And he defended his unusual approach when talking about the relationship with Kim.
"It's just to create the president's impression, but instead of standing out there 10,000 people trying to get into this close-lived territory, we have 200 here," Tramps said, pointing to the effort right in front of him.
Cunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroyed the island by killing hundreds of people
Following the Lomboka earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organisations were told that they did not need their assistance.
Although more than 10 per cent of the people of Lomboka were displaced, the state of the national disaster was not declared, but it is necessary to propose foreign aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that there is no international aid, so it is a known problem," said the Sombunga novelty.
Although "Save Children" collects groups to travel to Paul, it is still not clear whether foreign workers can work there.
The representative of the National Disasters Agency, Mr Sutopo, explained that the Indonesian officials are assessing the situation of Paul in order to see whether the international agencies will be able to make their contribution.
Given that earthquakes occur on a regular basis in Indonesia, the state is still extremely negative to natural habitats.
Although Aceh has been established in cases of asylum, these are rarely occurring along other shores.
Most likely, people were also affected by Paul’s failure to repeat the warning sirens about tsunami, although the warning was valid.
Even in the most favorable times, moving between many islands of Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A ship-sitting hospital in Lombo to treat earthquake victims is now going to Paul, but it will take at least three days to reach new postage victims.
President Joko Vidodo (Joko Widodo) had made the improvement of the broken infrastructure of Indonesia a central point of his election campaign and has allocated large sums to roads and railways.
However, the lack of funds has taught Mr Joko’s administration and is awaiting a re-election next year.
In addition, Mr Joko has to face the long-standing problem of tension between sections of Indonesia, where the majority of Muslims have adopted one of the conservative forms of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were wiped out of their homes while Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets using cats, bows, and bullets and other primitive weapons.
See: player "Liverpool" Daniel Starridge with a veil restores balance in the match against "Chelsea"
Daniel Sturridge rescued Liverpool from losing against Chelsea the Prime Minister, winning the doors in the 89th minute Saturday game at the Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
The striker received a message from Jordan Shaqiri (Xherdan Shaqiri), about 25 meters (30 yards) from the Chelsea gates when his team lost with 1:0.
He moved the bomb a little to the left of himself and then pushed the bomb towards the next gate.
In this attempt, the bomb flew high across the field, reaching the top of the net.
Finally, the bomb flew across the head of Kepa Arizabalaga (Kepa Arizabalaga) in the summer and landed on the network.
"I just tried to get their position to get to the bomb, and players like Shaq always played as far ahead as possible, so I just tried to get as much time as possible," the Starridge explained LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante (Kante) approaching, circling the ball, and, without much thought, the spear."
In the half-life of Chelsea, it was led by 1:0 after the Belgian star Eden Azard (Eden Hazard) was captured in the 25th minute.
The Blues attacker played the bomb back to Mateo Kovacic (Mateo Kovacic), before turning to the middle of the field and moving as fast as possible to the side of Liverpool.
Kovacičs quickly played and received the bomb back in the middle of the field.
Then he made a beautiful match between the players, allowing Azardam to enter the area.
Azard's speed performance protection and finished the combination, with the left foot of the seat on the remote pole network, along the Liverpool Elison Becker (Alison Becker).
At 3 p.m. "Stadio San Paolo" in Naples (Italy) will fight "Napoli".
Chelsea with Videoton will meet with the UEFA European League on Thursday at 3 p.m.
The number of victims in Indonesia reaches 832
Earthquakes and tsunamis have reached 832 people in Indonesia, early Sunday the national disaster agency announced.
It was reported that many people have been immersed in buildings’ caves after 7.5 magnitudes of the large earthquake that the state visited on Friday and caused up to 20 high waves (~6.0 m) and reportedly informed the agency’s representative Sutopo Purvo Nugroho (Sutopo Purwo Nugroho).
In the city of Palu, where more than 380,000 people live, the ruins of the fallen buildings were covered.
Police suspected of murder of a woman arrested by a 32-year-old man
The investigation of mortality was initiated after the founding of a woman's body in Birkenhead (Birkenhead), Merseyside (Messeyside) this morning.
The 44 - year - old victim with a sawmill was found at 7.55 p.m. in Grayson Mews Street, John, and suspected of murder, a 32 - year - old man was arrested.
The police have called for people in this neighborhood who have seen or heard something.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan reported: "The investigation has just begun, but I would like to invite us to contact everyone who was around John's street in Birkenhed and saw or heard something suspicious.
I also invite each, especially the taxi drivers, who might have fixed something in their car video recorders' material, to contact us, because they may have information that is important to our investigation."
The police representative confirmed that the woman whose body was found was the local resident of Birkenheda, and she was found in her property.
This afternoon, friends who think they know a woman have come to the crime scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation will continue and, as the police have reported, they are working on informing the nearest relatives of the victim.
The taxi driver who lives in Greisonmjuza tried to return to his apartment, but the police told him that no one should enter or leave the building.
He could not even say a word when he learned what had happened.
People are told that it will take hours to return.
It was heard that a policeman told a man that all around him was being taken as a crime scene.
At the crime scene, a woman showed up in tears.
She keeps saying, "It's so horrible!"
Two afternoons there were two police vans on the inside of the cordon, and another one was located right next to the outside.
Several policemen were stationed inside the Cordon and controlled the multi-dwelling house.
All who have information are asked to use DM @MerPolCC by 30 September, call 101 or contact "Crimestoppers anonymously" by phone 0800 555 111 by calling 247.
Kromvela Statute becomes the latest "historic rewriting" scandal in Parliament
It would be ethically justified in view of the activities similar to those of the Taliban, which resulted in so many monuments of English culture and religion from his fanatic Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society of Crick described Mr. Crick's proposal as "the stupidity" and "the attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Kromvell Society, said: "In view of the existing debate on the withdrawal of statues, it was inevitable that the goal would also be to become the figure of Oliver Kromvell outside the city of Westminster.
Cromwell himself ordered neither to do nor to carry out the celebration during the wars of English citizens.
It is possible that the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed because of the actions of his forefather, Thomas, centuries earlier.
The beautiful image of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft shows the view of Sir William Hemo Sorneicroft in the 19th century and is part of the story of a person who, many believe, is still worthy of honor.
Mr. Goldsmith reported "Sunday Telegraph": "Many of the Cromwells – perhaps by the end of the 19th century it was more than today — were considered to be Parliament's defender against external pressure, which, of course, in his case was the monarchy.
There will be further historical discussions on whether this is really a completely accurate picture of the topic.
Clearly, the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has determined the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognized person who represents one of the parties to the time.
She has achieved, being a Lord's protector, is worth warming and mentioning."
Pig-bleed to death slaughtered farmers in China
According to the information, the domestic media in the pig market attacked the farmer in the south-west of China and killed him.
A man — mentioned only by his name Juan (Yuan) — was found to die with an arterial transplant, all in one blood at a pig market in Liupanshui in Guijo (Guizhou) province, reported "South China Morning Post" on Sunday.
Piglets are prepared to inject pigs into the vaccine in the province of Xining, China, in Qinghai, on 30 May 2005.
It is reported that he and his brother had travelled from the neighbouring province of Junnan to sell 15 pigs on the market on Wednesday.
The next morning, his brother found a man dead and found that the door of the nearby pigs was open.
He told me that there was a big pig's father in the pig's nest with blood on his mouth.
According to the information, the court’s medical investigation confirmed that some 550 pounds (~249 kg) of heavy manure had been released by the farmer.
"My brother's legs were bloody and twisted," said the brother — only his name was mentioned in the article "Guyang Evening News".
The security camera material showed how Juan enters the market at around 4.40 p.m. about Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Juan did not belong to him or his brother.
The market manager informed Evening News that the shop was turned on to prevent its attacks on others while the police collected evidence at the scene.
According to the information, the Juana family and market management discuss compensation for his death.
Although such cases are rare, other pigs are known to be attacked in humans.
In 2016 a pig attacked a woman and a man on his farm in Massachusetts, resulting in critical injuries.
Even 10 years ago, a heavy pig weighing 650 pounds (~295 kg) had the farmer pushed to the tractor until his wife was killed by the animals.
After the farmers in Oregon ate his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba, CBC News, explained that pigs are not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a "gun shot".
"They're just funny.
They like to intrude, they're very knowledgeable... they don't want to hurt you.
You simply have to show them enough respect," he said.
Orkana Rosa's conclusion brings a wide and powerful case to the southwestern US
As predicted, the Orkan Rosa will weaken as it moves across the coldest waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, during the next few days, Rosa will bring floods of rain to the north of Mexico and to the south west of the United States.
On the 5th afternoon (after the North East time) the Pink Wind Brass reached 143 km/h (85 miles per hour) corresponding to the category 1 orchid, and its point was 620 km (385 miles) south-west of Punta Eigenia (Punta Eugenia) in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
While above the Pacific there is a low pressure inlet moving east towards the east coast of the United States. For Roses with tropical wind power approaching the peninsula of Lejascalfornia (Baja California), on Monday it will begin the wet mass deep from the tropic strip to the north towards the south of the United States.
On Monday in part, Mexico will bring up to 10 inches (~25,4 cm) rain.
Then the tropical humidity, interacting with the approaching low pressure inlets, will create a vast area of heavy rainwater in the coming days in the southwest.
1-4 inches (~2,6-10,2 cm) of rain will cause dangerous sudden floods, double currents and possibly droughts of land.
The wetness will be caused deep from the tropical range by rain gases, which will reach 2-3 inches (~5,1-7,6 cm) per hour, especially in the south of Nevada and in Arizona.
In the south-west part, especially most of Arizona, there are expected to be up to 24 inches (~5,2–10,1 cm) rain.
Sudden floods with rapid deterioration due to the spread of tropical raindrops are possible.
It is very reluctant to go into the woods because of tropical rainstorms.
Strong rains can turn canyons into swift rivers, but they will soon bring local brilliance winds and sand storms.
The pressure of the ground will be lifted as the South California coast line approaches the local strong part of the case.
It is possible that rain gases together will exceed half a inch (~1,3 cm) and can cause small doubles and slippery paths.
It will be the region's first rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rain gases will begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday before the rain will take over a wider area later on Monday and early on Tuesday.
Heavy rains will spread on Tuesday in the Four Stours region (DR Colorado, DA Júta, NA Arizona and DR New Mexico) and will last all Wednesday.
In October, intense temperature fluctuations are possible throughout the United States, as Arctic temperatures are falling, but the tropicals are still quite warm.
Sometimes this causes dramatic changes in temperature within a short period of time.
This is an example of dramatic differences in temperature in the Central US on Sunday.
The difference between the temperature in Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and Senluis and Demoin (Des Moines), Iowa, is almost 20 degrees.
In the days to come, we will try to form and expand a long summer heat.
It is expected that most of the central and eastern parts of the United States will start in October with a temperature of 80 and more degrees (after Farenheit; ~27 degrees after Celsia) in wide areas from the southern plains to part of the north-east.
The temperature in New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday (after Farenheit; ~27 degrees after Celsius), which would exceed the average by about 10 degrees.
Our long-term climate forecast suggests that the first half of October will exceed the average in the eastern US.
More than 20 million people attended the Brett Caveno case
More than 20 million people on the six television channels on Thursday were thrilled to see the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christian Blaisey Ford, who accused Kaven of sexual harassment, as reported by a woman in the 1980 ’ s.
The political unresolved continued to cease regular transmission to broadcast companies to report on the latest developments on Friday: the agreement of Senator Jeff Fleik (Jeff Flake) of Arizona that the FBI will investigate charges for weeks.
Forda informed the Senate Judicial Committee that she was absolutely convinced that Kaveno had been robbed of her drink and tried to get her clothes off during high school.
He was convinced that this was not the case.
According to Nielsen, on Friday, it was all seen by 20.4 million people.
The companies CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC recorded average viewers' interests.
Other broadcasters, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, which demonstrated this were not immediately available.
And "Nielsen" is usually a problem, including people who are looking at the offices.
To get a better view, this number of viewers corresponds to the number of exclusion games or Oscar ceremony observers.
Fox News Channel, whose commentators have strongly supported the appointment of the Cave, was the largest number of viewers, on average 5.69 million each day during the long hearing, reported Nielsen.
ABC was the second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS committed 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million, reported Nielsen.
The interest remained strong even after the hearing.
Fleik was the central figure of the Friday drama.
After the moderate republican team had issued a statement that he was voting on the appointment of Caveno, the senator observed the CNN and CBS camera Friday morning, when he, accompanied by a call for protestors, tried to get to the hearing of the Justice Committee.
On-line CNN he stood for several minutes with his eyes worn out like a blanket.
"I'm standing here, right in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the country the truth?
He was told that "you have power until so many women are powerless."
Fleiks explained that his team had made a statement and informed before closing the elevator door that he still had something to say at the committee hearing.
Cable networks and broadcasters were reflected online several hours later when the Judicial Committee was preparing to vote on the hearing of the Senate.
However, Fleiks claimed that he would only do so if he knew that the FBI would be looking at the allegations brought by the candidates next week by the minority of Democrats.
Fleiku was partly convinced of the negotiations with his friend Democrat Senator Chris Coons.
After the discussion with Küns and several other senators, Fleiks made his decision.
Fleika's choice was important because it was clear that the Republics would not have a vote to approve the Caveno without an investigation.
President Tramps has commissioned the FBI to investigate the charges brought against Kaveno (Kavanaugh).
British Prime Minister Meja accuses critics of political games about Brexit
In an interview with the newspaper Sunday Times, Prime Minister Teresa Meja accused people who criticise her plan to leave the European Union of "political games" with Britain's future and national interests.
British Prime Minister Teresa Meja attends the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, in addition to an interview with her newspaper on the first page, Minister Boris Johns of Maya's former Foreign Affairs continues to attack her Brexit's plan on the future of relations with the European Union, called the Chequers plan, stressing that the proposal for Britain and the EU to use each other's tariffs is "full of absurd".
Simps Shooting: Police have arrested Ditheon Simpson, suspected of LSU's murder
Police have arrested suspects of the shooting of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Twenty-year-old Ditheon Simpson was arrested and arrested as accused of second-degree murder, a Baton Rouge police unit reported.
The officials released a video showing Simsa's match with Simpson, and the police mentioned that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The CBS daughter company WAFB reports that the police found glasses in the crime scene and found Simpson's blood on them.
After Simpson's understanding, the police informed him that he had confessed to the killing of the Way.
As the lawyer reports, he was given $350,000 in security.
The Eastern Baton Rouge Parish judicial team issued a temporary conclusion on Friday stating that death was the cause of a gunshot in the head that hits the neck.
The Department thanked the Operational Group for seeking refuge in the state of Louisiana State Police, the State Police Laboratory, the South University Police and the people of the territory for their assistance in investigating the outcome of the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva (Joe Alleva) thanked the territorial legislators for their "teachership and work on behalf of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
6 feet 6 inches (~1,98 m) long attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball LSU.
In the last season in one game he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 dropped bombs.
On Friday morning LSU basketball coach Will Wade announced that the team was "striking" and "shocked" about the type of death.
"That's what people always worry about," said the Way.
Volcano splintering ash across Mexico
Astounds rising from the Pokatepetla volcano have reached the southern part of Mexico’s capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned Mexicans on Saturday that they should not come close to the volcano after having observed the activity in the container and registered 183 gas and ash emissions within 24 hours.
The Centre has observed multiple sweating and shaking.
The images in the social networks showed that the car windshield near Mexico, for example, Hochimilko (Xochimilco), has a flat ash layer.
The geophysicists have observed 45 miles (72 km) south-east activation of the existing volcano from the capital, since the 7.1 magnitude earthquake hit the central part of Mexico in 2017.
Vulcan, also known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police conflict with Catalan separatists before the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday following the clash of supporters of independence with the public order police and when thousands joined the opposition demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarising separation vote.
The group’s masking supporters, who were hampered by the public order police, held them with eggs and painted a powder-shaped color, forming dark dust clouds in the streets that would normally be full of tourists.
Disagreements then arose later on, and policemen used knives to prevent fights.
Several hours of independence groups were involved in confrontation with united supporters who were scandalous: "For a long time for Spain!"
According to local newspapers, fourteen people received medical assistance during protests due to minor injuries.
A year after the 1 October referendum, which Madrid considered illegal, but which the Catalans praised, the idea of independence in the conquered region remains very tense.
The voters strongly expressed their independence, although the voters' activity was low, and those who opposed separation were mostly boycotting.
According to the Catalan officials, almost 1,000 people were injured last year when the police tried to stop the vote at polls throughout the region, and there were vicious clashes.
Independence-supported groups had been on their way on Friday night to prevent demonstrations in support of the state police.
Demonstration took place, but demonstrators were forced to choose another path.
Narcissus Teremezs (Narcis Termes), a 68-year-old electrician who participated in a separatist protest with his wife, admitted that he no longer expected Catalonia to gain independence.
"Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I saw my father's eyes filled with tears of joy that they were allowed to vote, but now everything has stopped," he said.
Although the parties that supported Catalonia's independence won the regional elections last year with a small but significant majority, these parties have struggled to maintain the momentum this year, as several of the most famous leaders have either emigrated or have been arrested and are awaiting a trial for their role in organizing the referendum and its subsequent declaration of independence.
A 42-year-old mechanic, Joan Puig, who filmed on the phone to support the police, said that the conflict had been fuelled by politicians from both sides.
"The judgment is getting bigger," he said.
On Saturday, one of the nine leaders of Catalonia, Uriol Junqueres (Oriol Junqueras), who has been in detention from the previous year to the court, announced that he will be candidates for the European Parliament's election next year.
"The candidacy of the European will is the best way of exposing the democratic values of regression and repression that the Spanish Government has directed against us," he said.
Londonderia: Men arrested after a car crash in the building
Three men (ages 33, 34 and 39) were arrested after the car was repeatedly hit by a building in London.
The incident took place in Balinagard Krescent (Ballynagard Crescent) at approximately 7.30 p.m.
Detective Inspector Bobs Blemmings reported damage to the gates and the building itself.
At the same time, it may have been shot off by an orlet.
The Mengas triangle allows "Livingston" with 1-0 to win "Rangers"
Dollija Mengas (Dolly Menga) was the first door to win Livingston
The supported Livingston interrupted the Rangers, bringing Stephen Gerard to his second loss in 18 games played by the Ibrox club manager.
Dollija Menga's strike turned out to be the decisive one, because the Gerija Holta (Gary Holt) team balanced the situation with "Hibernian".
The Gerard team didn't win this season, and the next weekend they have to meet the Hearts leader, from whom they are left behind by eight points.
Before that, on Thursday, the European League "Rangers" took on the "Rapid" of Vienna.
While Livingston extended its series without loss to six games in the division, the main coach Holt still hasn't felt the taste of the crash, since Kenya Miller (Kenny Miller) replaced the previous month.
Livingston doesn't take advantage of the opportunity to blow guests
Holta's team with their own direct game, which in various ways made "Rangers" difficult, had to be in charge long before they got their names.
Scott Robinson broke out, but he pushed his attempt at the gate, and Alan Lithgow's attempt at getting in the leg to stop Craig Halkett's head over the gate line was unsuccessful.
The owners allowed the Rangers to play in front of him, knowing that they would be able to stop the guests in the planned places.
And that's exactly how the decision-makers came in.
"Rangers" allowed the release, and "Livingston" used the corridor, Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined to provide an opportunity for Menga to sit and gain gates from the middle of the area.
At this stage, "Rangers" managed the bomb, but the protection of the guests proved to be insurmountable and the guard Liam Kelly (Liam Kelly) was not particularly disturbed.
This continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos (Alfredo Morelos) had Kelly rescue the gates.
The Scottish Pittman attempted to stop the activities of the Rangers guard Alan Makgregor, and Litgovs stopped long doors in the combination of Livingston.
In the Livingston area, there continued to be concentrated bombs, but two calls for punishment — after Halket’s fight for a bomb with a replacement Glenn Middleton and for hand-playing — were rejected.
"The Phenomenal" Livingston performance — Analysis
Scottish BBC Alsdairs Lamonts (Alasdair Lamont) "Tony Macaroni" arena
The phenomenal performance and result of Livingston.
Each of them was fine, continuing to keep up with the hope, always improving the performance.
Their game style and personalities have not changed since they returned to the highest estuary, but Holt has earned a great praise for how he has joined the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was a dignitary, maintaining the first organized defense, while Menga was making sure that Connor Goldson and Joe Warral always remained discreet.
However, the Rangers lack inspiration.
No matter how good they sometimes were under Gerard, they were far from these standards.
Their last bomb was long - only once they broke into the part of the farmer’s field - and it’s basically an appeal to reopen the “Rangers, which are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan is waiting in Cologne for shared feelings
Saturday (September 29th) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in breakfast in Berlin, there was a lot of laughter and blue sky.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aimed at restoring relations between NATO partners.
They have disagreements about various issues, including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Khelni to open a new giant mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish community outside Turkey.
The police, for reasons of security, blocked the efforts of 25,000 people, not to allow themselves to be gathered in front of the mosque, but many of the supporters came close to seeing their president.
Hundreds of Protestants against Erdogan — many of whom were Kurds — also made known their attitude by condemning both Erdogan’s policy and the decision of the German government to take him to themselves.
The mutual protests between the two parties reflect the contradictions caused by the guest, whose part of the German Turk is considered a hero, but others are null as an autocrat.
Road accident in Deptford: a biker dies in a car crash
In a car crash in London, a bicycle driver died.
Satursme took place on the Bestwood Street crossroad with Evelyn Street, on the road with intense traffic in Deptford, south-east of the city, approximately 10.15 BST.
The driver stopped, and the doctor provided help, but the man Mira was at the scene.
Satursme took place several months after another mirchailders street (Childs Street) biker left the scene on Sunday.
The Central City Police Service reported that the police are engaged in identifying the man and informing their neighbors.
Roads and coaches are closed at the site, but car drivers are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartin prison: six workers injured during an accident
The Prison Office (Prison Office) reports that six prison staff were injured in an irregular manner in a men’s strict prison.
The riots occurred at the "HMP Long Lartin" prison in Vorchester at about 09.30 BST on Sunday and continues.
In order to prevent irregularities involving eight prisoners who are confined to one wing, the staff of the Special Service "Tornado" were involved
At the site of the event, workers were treated with mild facial trauma.
The representative of the Prison Service reported: "In order to resolve the incident in the HMP Long Lartin prison, specially trained prison personnel were involved.
Six staff were provided with medical assistance due to injuries.
We will not settle for violence in our prisons and clearly say that those responsible will be handed over to the police and will probably spend more time after the rest."
The "HMP Long Lartin" prison has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the head of the prison hospital was treated after the arrest of the prisoner.
And last October, the workers in charge of dumping control were sent to prison to resolve serious accidents in which staff had been attacked with billiard bombs.
Orkan is threatened with sudden floods by Rosa Phoenix, Las Vegas and Soltleuksitia (probably the area affected by drought will benefit from the situation)
Arizona from tropical depression is rarely suffering, but it is likely that this will happen early next week, when the Orcano of Rosa will move across the southwest of the desert, creating a sudden flood risk.
The National Weather Service has already issued a warning about the sudden floods on Monday and Tuesday in the West of Arizona, on the south and east of Nevada, on the south-east of California and on the south-east of Jet, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Soltlegiti.
It is expected that Rosa will be heading right through Phoenix on Tuesday, when she comes up late on Monday.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix Twitter reported that since 1950, only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical wind or depression status 200 miles (320 km) from Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a 40-year-old hurricane (65 km) from the borders of AZ."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center (National Hurricane Center) predict 2-4 inches (~5,08–10,2 cm) of rainwater, reaching up to 6 inches (15,24 cm) in individual locations.
Other areas of the south-west forest, including the central part of the Klins Mountains and the Great Basin, may receive 1-2 inches (~2,54-5,08 cm), with a total of 4 inches (~10,2 cm) in individual locations.
For those who are not at risk of sudden floods, the rains of the Rose can be a blessing because the region has been hit by drought.
Although the possibility of extinction is a very serious concern, some raindrops are likely to be beneficial because the southwest is now suffering from drought.
According to the Drought Monitor, a little more than 40 percent of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, which is the second highest category, reported weather.com.
First, the Orcana Rosa road leads to Lejascalifornia (Baja California) peninsula in Mexico, where it will reach the shore.
Rosa is still with Orcana force on Sunday morning at maximum wind speed 85 miles (137 km) an hour, is about 385 miles (~620 km) south of Punta Eigenija (Punta Eugenia) in Mexico and is heading north at 12 miles (19 km) an hour.
The wind meets with warmer waters of the Pacific and is therefore evaporated.
Therefore, it is expected that the hurricane with tropical wind will reach the coast of Mexico on Monday afternoon or in the morning.
In the rainy part, Mexico can be strong by creating a significant risk of flooding.
"The rain gas is expected to reach 3-6 inches (7.62-15.24 cm) from the interior of Lower California in the south-west of Sonora, likely to reach 10 inches (25.4 cm)," weather.com reported.
Rosa will move north, across Mexico as a tropical wind, and then reach the Arizona border early in the morning as a tropical depression, which will then move across Arizona and arrive in the South Juts later in the evening.
"The main threat expected from Rosa or its residues is very strong rain gas in Lejascalifornia, in the north-west Sonora and in the south-west of the desert," said the National Orkan Centre.
It is expected that this rain will cause life - threatening sudden floods and floods in the deserts of the dunes, and earth’s debris in mountain areas.
Attack Midsommer Norton: four arrested for attempted murder
A three - year - old and 20 - year - old man was arrested in suspicion of attempted murder after finding a 16 - year - old boy with duress.
The injured teenager was found in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton, about 4.00 BST on Saturday.
He was transferred to a hospital where his condition remains "stable".
The police reported that 17 years of age and two 18 years of age, as well as 20 years of age, a man was arrested overnight, in Redstock, Eivo and Somerset.
The police have called for the withdrawal of anyone who could have a mobile phone for what happened.
Tramps asserts that Caveno is a victim of the Democratic Party of "worse and Anger"
"The vote on Judge Kaveno is a vote to reject the unfair and violent tactics of the Democratic Party," Tramps announced at a meeting in Wiling (Wheeling), West Virginia.
Tramps stressed that Kaveno was a victim of the Democratic Party's "worse and anger" throughout his nomination process.
The Caveno was shown in front of Congress, where he vigorously and emotionally rejected any Christian Blazey Ford (Christian Blasey Ford) charge of sexual harassment several decades ago when both were teenagers.
Ford also testified in the hearing of his accusations.
On Saturday, the president announced that "The Americans saw the Cave "of excellence, ability and courage" at that time.
"The vote on the approval of Judge Kaveno is a vote to approve one of the most educated lawyers of our time with a sharp history of serving the people," he told the supporter's effort in West Virginia.
President Kaveno mentioned the environment in terms of the importance of Republican activity in the interim elections.
"Five weeks to one of the most important elections in our time.
I didn't hesitate, but I did," he said.
"That's why I'm going everywhere fighting for great candidates."
Tramps objected that the Democrats have undertaken the mission "to protest and resist".
It is expected that the first of the main proceedings in the Senate for the nomination of the Caveno will take place no later than Friday, the CNN informed the senior assistant of the Republican Party.
Hundreds of people have been killed in Indonesia, and the number of victims is clearly increasing
On Saturday, the officials reported that at least 384 people were killed, many were simply displaced when the giant waves came across the shores after a powerful earthquake and tsunamis struck the island of Sulawesi.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered at the festival in the city of Palu on the beach when up to six meters (18 feet) of high waves swam across the shore chair, scattering death and tearing down everything that was on its way.
Cunami emerged after a 7.5-ball earthquake.
"When there was a tsunami threat yesterday, people were still working on the beach and not running away right away, and they became victims," BNPB representative of the Indian Disaster Reduction Agency Sutopo Purvo Nugroho (Sutopo Purwo Nugroho) briefed Jakarta.
"Cunami didn't arrive alone, it brought cars, clouds and buildings, it dragond everything that was on the ground," Nugoro told, adding that the tsunami had crossed the sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 mph).
"Many people crawled into trees to save, and survived," he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers of Paul.
The photographs taken by the disaster agency show many destroyed homes and shops, deformed and destroyed bridges, and water-covered mosque.
After Thursday, the coastal city continued to tremble on Saturday.
The earthquake series was felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency stressed in the BPPT Communication that the energy allocated by the massive earthquake on Friday was about 200 times higher than that of the Second World War on the energy of the nuclear bomb buried in Hiroshima.
The city’s location was long and the narrow end of the tower may have increased the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho's injuries were described as "wide", and reported that thousands of houses, hospitals, shops and hotels have been destroyed.
He said that some bodies of victims were found trapped under the rubble of damaged buildings, adding that 540 were injured and 29 were lost.
Nugroho acknowledged that the number of victims and injuries could be larger along the coast line 300 km (190 miles) north of Pala, in the area called Dongala (Dongala), which is closer to the earthquake epicenter.
"Communications were completely destroyed, information from Dongal was not received," Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there," the Red Cross reported, adding that its personnel and volunteers are going to the affected regions of the disaster.
"It is a tragedy already, but everything could have been even worse," the organization said.
On Saturday, the Agency was widely criticised for not being informed that the tsunami had been sought by Paul, although officials claimed that the waves had arrived at the time of the announcement of the warning.
On social media, the man on the top of the building is called the people on the bottom of the street near the tsunami.
Within a few minutes, the water wall hits the shore, shielding buildings and machines.
The Reuters news agency is unable to immediately confirm whether the material is true.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a serious electropade loss, which turned off the communication Paul, making it difficult for officials to coordinate their rescue efforts.
The officials announced that the army had begun to send cargo aircraft from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuations still need food and other items of first necessity.
The city airport is open only to aid measures and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Vidodo (Joko Widodo) was planning to visit Palu on Sunday.
In Indonesia, the number of victims exceeds 800.
It's very bad.
Mr. Doseba (Doseba) told us that the World Vision workers who successfully reached the city of Paul from Dongala (Dongala) and now have been in the morgues of the office in their homes, traveled along the way to the long damage.
"They told us that they saw many buildings that had been destroyed," he explained.
It's very bad.
Even when relief teams have undertaken to organize disaster relief efforts, some have complained that foreign aid workers were not allowed to go to Paul with great experience.
According to Indonesian legislation, the financing of overseas organisations, resources and personnel will only be allowed to enter if the postal area is declared as a national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a province-level disaster," said Aulia Ariani, a representative of the Red Cross of Indonesia.
"When the government announces, "Well, it is a national disaster," we will be able to accept international assistance, but such status has not yet been established."
When Paul arrived the second night after the earthquake and tsunami, friends and family members of the people still missing continued to hope that their love would become a miracle that would make life more bright during natural disasters.
On Saturday, a small boy was taken out of the river.
On Sunday, she was released from prison, and her mother’s body was buried in the grave for two days.
Gendon Subandano (Gendon Subandano), coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had prepared two of the missing paragliding Asian games that took place this month in Indonesia.
Others from the hotel Roa Roa, including Mr. Mandagi (Mandagi), were their grandchildren.
"As we experienced the paralysis," he said, "I'm teaching emotional burden."
Mr. Gendona recalled that after the paragliding team was spreading news about the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel, he had been sending whatsApp reports for hours to the participants in the Palus contest who participated in the beach festival.
However, the result of his reports was only one grey mark, not two blue marks.
"House, that means the reports have not reached the addressee," he said.
The hook breaks 26 750 dollars in the Newport on the Levee complex during the filling of the ATM
According to a report by the Newport Police Department, the banker was charged with a fine of $26,750 on Friday morning for a member of the Brink's who filled out the ATM in the Newport on the Levee complex.
"The driver of the car had exhausted the ATM and had prepared to fill it with more money," said Detective Dennis McCarthy in the press release.
While the manager was busy, another man "out the back joined the Brink's employee" and robbed the purse with the money provided by the ATM.
According to the press release, the Witnesses observed several suspicious persons leaving the crime scene, but the police did not specify the number of persons involved in the incident.
All who have information about their identities should contact the Newport Police 859-292-3680.
Kanje West: the repertoire changes its name to Je
Reperis Kanje West changes his name to Ye (Je).
When he announced a change of Twitter Saturday, he wrote: "Boutne, which is formerly known as Kanji West."
Forty-one years old West was already called Je, and used the title as his eighth album published in June ("Ye").
This change takes place before his appearance in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to publish his new album "Yandhi".
The composers of the show tell us that he replaces the singer Arianu Grandi, who stopped the work of "emotional cause".
West has told us that it is not only a shortcut to his current professional name but also a religious one.
"I believe "Ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "You," West explained earlier this year, discussing his album name with the radio director Big Boy (Big Boy).
"Then I'm you, I'm us, that's us.
At first there was Kanje, which means "only one," followed by "Ye", which is thought about good and bad in us, about our confusion, about everything.
The album is more thoughtful about what we are."
He is one of several famous rappers who have changed their names.
Sean Combs, who had so far been known both as Puff Daddy and as P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the words Love (Love) and Brother Love (Love brother).
JAY-Z, who had previously collaborated with the West, has both, and has not used thought signs and big letters.
The President-elect of Mexico promises not to use the army against civilians
The elected president of Mexico, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has promised never to use military force against civilians during the 50th anniversary of the bloody rebate to the students.
Lopess Obrador on Saturday "Tlatelolco Plaza" promised "never to use the army to suppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, a peaceful demonstration by the Army was taken away, killing even 300 people during the time that the left-wing movements of the students spread throughout Latin America.
Lopes Obrador has vowed to support the new Mexicans in their years by issuing a monthly grant to students and opening more public universities.
He said that the lack of unemployment and education put young criminals in the gangs.
US should double funding for artificial intelligence
As China is becoming increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount spent on research in this field, explains the investor and artificial intelligence practitioner Kai Fu Lee (Kai-Fu Lee), who has worked on Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments were made after the various US government bodies made statements about the artificial intelligence, although the US as a whole lacks a strategy in the field of artificial intelligence.
As yet, last year China launched its plan: it aims to become the main country in the field of artificial intelligence by 2030.
"The dual research budget for artificial intelligence will be a good start, given that all other countries have so much left the United States, and the next cardinal turn in the field of artificial intelligence is expected," Lee said.
In an interview with CNBC this week, Lee said that double funding could double the possibility that the next success in the field of artificial intelligence will occur in the US.
Lee, who published the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" this month published "Houghton Mifflin Harcourt", is the Executive Director of Synovation Ventures, who has invested funds in one of China's most important intellectual companies "Face++".
In the 1980s, Carnegie Mellon (Karnegi-Melona) worked at the University of Carnegie in order to create an artistic intelligence system that would overtake the best Othello (Revers) player in the United States, but later he was the head of Microsoft Research and the president of the Chinese branch.
Lee recognized the previous U.S. government-organized technology contests, such as "Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge" and asked when it would be prepared next to identify people with ideas about the future.
"Scientists in the United States often have to work very hard to obtain government grants," says Lee.
"It's not China's leading scientists anymore, it's the big companies," he explained.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have over the past few years paid university awards for the work of the art intelligence.
Lee added that changes in immigration policy could also help the US improve its achievements in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I believe that green cards should automatically be awarded to people with a degree of philosophy doctor in the field of artificial intelligence," he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese National Council published its next generation's artificial intelligence development plan.
Lee explained that the Chinese National Science Fund provides funding to people in academic institutions, like the National Science Foundation and other government organisations, but the academic quality of work in China is lower.
This year the U.S. Defence Department (USD) has established a single common art intelligence centre, which is intended to bring together partners from industrial and academic circles, and the White House has announced the establishment of a special committee on artistic intelligence.
And this month, DARPA (Central Research and Development Organization of the U.S. Ministry of Defence) announced a $2 billion contribution to the "AI Next" initiative.
The National Science Fund, on the other hand, is currently investing more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
In the meantime, the US legislation, which has been responsible for establishing the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, has not worked for several months.
Macedonians in the referendum on the change of national name
Macedonians voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether to change the name of the country to "the Republic of North Macedonia" by taking a step that will prevent the ten-year dispute with Greece that has blocked Macedonia's requests to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, emphasises that its northern neighbour's name shows claims on its territory and has imposed veto on the accession of Macedonia to NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June based on the new name proposed, but the nationalists in the opposition insist that the changes reflect the ethnic identity of the Macedonian Slavic majority.
President George Ivanov has said that I will not vote in the referendum, and the campaign with the call for boycott has raised concerns about whether the voter activity will reach at least 50% necessary for the referendum to be considered valid.
The referendum bulletin asks the question: "Are you involved in NATO and the EU by concluding an agreement with Greece?"
The name change supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zajev (Zoran Zaev), object that it is a price worth on the way to Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the collapse of Yugoslavia, becoming an organisation, such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come to vote for the future of the country, for the young Macedonians to live freely, in the protection of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Oliver Georgievska (Oliver Georgievska) in Skopje.
Although this is not legally binding, a sufficient number of Members have announced that they will take into account the outcome of the vote, which will become decisive.
In order to change the name, a 2/3 majority will be required in Parliament.
The National Elections Commission informed that no infringements were reported until one hour after noon.
However, the activity was only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent of the previous parliamentary elections, in which 66 per cent of the registered voters voted.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Jose Tanevski (Gjose Tanevski), a voter in Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaevs, his wife Zorica (Zorica) and his son Duško (Dushko) gave their vote in his referendum in Macedonia on the change of name to NATO and the European Union on 30 September 2018 in Stromica (Strumica) Macedonia.
In front of Parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardakov (Vladimir Kavardarkov), prepared a small view and arranged chairs at the tents that had been placed by those who had been in the referendum boycotts.
"We are about NATO and the EU, but we want to stand up with a raised head, not through the servant doors," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a small country, but we have self-esteem.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China or Russia, and become part of European-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zajevs argues that NATO will start the necessary investments in Macedonia, where the unemployment rate exceeds 20 per cent.
"I believe that most of the votes will be cast because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO," Zajevs said after the vote.
He said the result "yes" would "affirm our future".
The poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Policy Research (Macedonia's Institute for Policy Research) shows that 30 to 43 per cent of voters will participate in the referendum — less than the necessary activities.
Another survey conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV found that 57 per cent of voters are scheduled to participate in Sunday's vote.
70 percent of them replied that they would vote for it.
In order for the referendum to be successful, the electorate's activity must have 50 per cent and one more vote.
The failure of the referendum will be the first serious blow to the Western-oriented government that came to power last May.
See: Mančestras "City" Sergio Agvero (Sergio Aguero) runs through all the "Brighton" protection to get the doors
Serhio Agvero and Rahim Sterling (Raheem Sterling) introduced Brighton's protection by allowing Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England to win with 2:0.
Agvero was impressed that his opening was ridiculously light in 65 minutes.
The attacker of the Argentines received an attack at the beginning of the combination in the middle of the field.
He broke out between the three Brighton shields and went into the open field.
Then Agvero's put on four green cracks.
He led the bomb to one of the guards, then the running victory of several more at the edge of Brighton.
Then he made a left-hand call to get to Sterling.
The attacker of the English center used his first touch to play back Agvero, who put in the case a good football finger to score the "Brigton" guard Matthew Ryan, hitting the right-hand side of the bomb network.
"Agvero is struggling with foot problems," the city manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked to him about playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's exactly what happened.
We were lucky he got the gates at the time.
But it was Sterling, which provided the original advantage of Sky Blues in the Prime Minister's race.
The doors were opened in 29 minutes.
Agvero played the ball in the area of Brighton.
He sent a bomb with a beautiful set along the left leg of Leroy Sane.
Several seats were held in Sana until Sterling was entrusted with delivering the bomb to the next gate.
The Sky Blues Center attacker easily entered the bomb network right before crossing the border.
"City" will fight with "Hoffenheim" Champion Leagues at the "Rhein-Neckar-Arena" stadium in Zinshaim, Germany on Tuesday at 12.55.
Shercer wants to deliver problems "Rockies"
Since "Nationals" did not participate in exclusion games, there was no reason to resume.
However, Scherzer, who is always ready to compete, hopes to use the opportunity against Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if Rockies will be the current exclusion games. And Rockies in the Group of the National League of the West is led by one game against Los Angeles Dodgers.
"Rockies" has printed at least a white card with Friday evening with 5:2 winning "National", but still hasn't earned its first title in the division.
"Even if we play the same game, we will at least be able to have fun knowing that the airfield here, in Denver, with the effort and second team, will probably be the hottest I'm going to face this year.
And why wouldn't I want to compete then?"
"Nationals" have not yet announced who will start the game on Sunday, but, as news, is ready to allow Heart to do the meth.
Chercers, who will be at the beginning of the 34th, held a four-day meth session in the "bullipen" part of the outdoors, and on Sunday, during the normal rest of the year, will throw a bomb.
The Washington labroci is 18 - 7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikes 220 2/3 inches this season.
Tramps hold meetings in West Virginia
The President of the environment mentioned the situation in which his elected High Court candidate Brets Caveno, at the same time speaking about the importance of the electoral activity of Republicans in the interim elections.
"In November everything we've done is under threat.
Five weeks to one of the most important elections of our time.
This is really very, very serious — I didn't hesitate, but I did, and that's why I'm everywhere and I'm fighting for great candidates," he said.
Tramps continued: "You see this horrible, horrible group of radicals who are acting right now.
And they are committed to regaining power by all possible means to achieve the goal. You see the evil, the opposite.
They have no matter what harm they have to do to get power and control, that's why they want power and control, and we won't give it to them."
The Democrats, he said, have undertaken the mission "to protest and resist".
"And you have seen the same thing in the last four days," he stressed, calling the Democrats "neighbors, evils, randoms and liars."
He called on the name of the Senators of the Democratic Party of the Senate Committee of Justice Dianne Feinstein (Dianne Feinstein), to which the audience responded with loud calls.
"Do you remember her answer?
Have you lost the document?
Hmm, what are you talking about?
No, hmm, wait -- it was really a bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Leborist Party is no longer ready for diversity.
It's unbearable to the open
It was no wonder that Momentum activists in my local party wanted me to submit to censorship.
Finally, I am in the last line of Members of the Liberal Party of Parliament, who have been informed that he is not desirable, all because we do not hide our opinion.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, in the parliament, went along similarly because she was determined against antisemitism.
In my case, the censorship movement criticized me for not accepting Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of economic policy, national security, and Europe was ironic, but they were issues in which Jeremiah did not agree with previous leaders.
The report on the Leborist meeting in the eastern part of Nottingham said on Friday that 'we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive'.
Most of the meetings that took place during the career of my eight local Lebanese MPs were exactly that.
Unfortunately, at many meetings today, the air is different and promises of "better, safer" policy have been forgotten long ago, if they have ever been at all.
It has become increasingly clear that the Leborist party does not want to suffer from different opinions, and any opinion is assessed depending on whether it is acceptable for party management.
This began shortly after Jeremiah became leader: colleagues, whom I think our political views are similar, began to expect me to turn around 180 degrees and accept the views I would never otherwise agree on – whether it is about national security or the single EU market.
When I speak in public — and it is not really important what I am saying — the following issue of the use of social networks follows, calling for a ban on the running of the next elections by exposing the centre's policy, claiming that I have no place in the Labour Party.
And that's not just my experience.
Indeed, I know that I have been more successful than some of my colleagues because my comments are usually political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my colleagues, who are facing the currents of racist and sexist insults every day, but who are never reluctant to avoid.
One of the most unpleasant aspects of this political era is how normal use has become.
Last week, Jeremy Corbin announced that the Labour Party must develop a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer an organization that is ready for diversity and with every expression of distrust or change in the rules of choice, the party will be narrowed down.
In the last two years, I've often given advice by asking not to go to bed, think what I'm saying, and then with me "all will be fine".
But that is not why I have decided to take part in politics.
Ever since I joined the Leborists 32 years ago as a school teacher, in response to the rejection of the Techera government, which had literally led to the collapse of my integrated school class, I have had the task of fighting for better public services for those who are most needed — both as a member of the local council and as a minister of the government.
I have never concealed my political views, even in previous elections.
There was no reason in the East to question my position on policy issues and in areas where I would not accept the existing government.
To those who put forward the proposal on Friday, I can only say that at a time when the state is firmly moving towards Brexit, which will harm households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand such a desire to spend time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Liberian Party.
But in fact, the only thing I want to say is not that of Notingham's Momentum, but whether they are members of the Labour Party: I am proud that I can serve you, and I promise that there will be no threat of running or reminders that nobody in politics will be able to stop me from doing what I think is best for all of you.

"Ayr" 38 - 17 "Melrose": Unsaid "Ayr" reaches the top of the row
The last two attempts may have been to some extent the final result of the collapse, but there is no doubt that Air has earned to triumph this amazingly exciting Scottish championship match today.
Now they're at the top of the tables, the only unaided team of ten.
In the end, it was both their great protection and much better use of the opportunities that led the farmers, and coach Peter Marty (Peter Murchie) has all the reasons to be satisfied.
"We have been tested in all our games and we are not yet killed, so I have to rejoice," he said.
"Melrose" Robin Christie (Robyn Christie): "All respect "Ayr", they used their advantages better than we do."
Grant Anderson (Grant Anderson)'s attempt in 14 minutes, carried out by Frazier Klimo (Frazier Climo), pointed out "Ayr", but the yellow card to Captain Rory Hughes, where he was awarded "Warriers", changed the numbers of Melrose, and Jason Baggot (Jason Baggot) held an unrealized bomb.
The climate increased air management with a penalty, just at the end of the half-time, he gained points, then realized a solo attempt, so the air stopped with 17-5.
But Melrose's half-time started with a good game, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which Begots made, reduced the retreat to 5 points.
There was a long break, because Ruiy Nott (Ruihard Knott) had suffered a serious injury and was taken to the station away from the field, but when the game began, the air quickly moved forward when Stafford McDowall made an attempt to achieve the climate.
The existing Captain Blair Macpherson (Blair Macpherson) then received a yellow card, and again, after intense pressure, Melrose used a dead player — with Bruce Colvine’s attempt that was not carried out.
However, the farmers quarreled, and when Struan Hachinson (Struan Hutchinson) received a yellow card about crossing the climate without a bomb, from the penal corridor, Makferson made a doll in the back of the air.
As in the past, the climate began almost from the very beginning after Kyle Rowe took over the David Armstrong and sent the Flanders to the fifth attempt by Gregor Henry.
The "Still Game" star seems to plan a new career in the business
The comedy star Ford Kieran (Ford Kieran) appears to be planning to take part in the hospitality business because he found out that he was named as the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show that he is making and that he and his old partners play with Greg Hemphil.
Duets has announced that the next ninth season will be the last show, and Kirnan is apparently planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official information, he is the Director of Arigermorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although the source of "Scottish Sun" indicated that Kirnan was planning to participate in the "floating restaurant business" of Glasgow.
'The sea belongs to us!' said Bolivia, on the ground, hoping that the court will open the way to the Pacific.
The sailors patrol the tunnels of the Fleet Stabe in the Lapas.
Public buildings have raised blue flags in the ocean.
Fleets base ships from Lake Titicaca until Amazon are enchanted with the motto: "We have the right to the sea.
It is our duty to recover it."
The memory of Chile in the 19th century in a bloody conflict on the land is still alive in Bolivia, just as it has been in the Pacific for a long time.
This hope is likely to be the highest for several decades, as Bolivia is awaiting the International Court of Justice's judgment on 1 October after five years' examination.
"Bolivia is developing, it is united and peaceful in its spirit, and, of course, positive thoughts are waiting for the outcome," said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Kalzadilla (Roberto Calzadilla).
Many Bolivians will see the International Court of Justice's judgment on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will decide for the sake of Bolivia's claim that, after decades of negotiations with the interruptions, Chile is obliged to discuss the sovereign exits to the sea for Bolivia.
Bolivia's charismatic local president Evo Morales (Evo Morales) is also very interested in the Monday's judgment.
"We are close to recovering the Pacific," he was excited at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that Bolivia’s judgment is unlikely, and even if it is adopted, there are no major changes to be expected.
The United Nations based in the Netherlands has no power to grant the territory of Chile, and its representatives have said that they will not determine the possible outcome of the negotiations.
The fact that the International Court of Justice's judgment is not adopted six months after the final examination shows that the case was "free", explained international law expert Paza Zarate (Paz Zárate) from Chile.
And for the last four years, Bolivia's case has not gone forward, but, on the contrary, has been delayed.
"The issue of access to the sea has been addressed by the existing Bolivian administration," Zarate said.
Morale’s military rhetoric has blinded the rest of Israel’s good will, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to negotiate once again, but then it will be very difficult to maintain the discussion.
Both countries have not exchanged consignments since 1962.
The Bolivian representative in The Hague, who was once President Edward Rodriguez Velze (Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé), did not agree that the court had made a decision unusually quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia will bear "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile" and the opportunity to "appropriate paragraph 139 years of conflict, from which both sides will get," he said.
Kalzadilla also denied that Morales — still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America — used sea problems as a political hook.
"Bolivia will never give up its rights to access the Pacific," he added.
"This decision is an opportunity to understand what must be done to overcome the past."
North Korea will refuse nuclear weapons only if you can trust the US
Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea Ri Yong Ho (Ri Yong Ho) said that his people would never be the first to eliminate their nuclear weapons if they could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to fulfill the promises made during the two national leaders’ meeting in Singapore.
Her comments were made at a time when it appears that US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo (Mike Pompeo) is ready to resume the diplomatic measures that have been taken to prevent nuclear failure, more than three months after Singapore's meeting with North Korean leaders, Kim Čennu.
Ri argues that they are "fantasies" to hope that the US will ever be able to declare the end of the Korean war, which has not yet been lifted.
Washington is careful with regard to the declaration of consent before Phenjana will take significant disarmament measures.
Both Kims and US President Donald Trumps want another meeting.
However, many are skeptical about whether Phenjana really wants to give up the weapon that the state certainly considers the only way to guarantee its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Phenjan next month to prepare the next Kim meeting with Tramp.
Paris fashion show introduces you with the latest massive header line on the way to your nearest High Street
If you want to increase your shoe collection or completely block the sun, then you are in the right place.
The designers Valentino and Tom Browne introduced the viewers with a row of absurd, huge on the head-to-head item in the spring/summer season collection that sparkled the Paris Fashion Week’s style background.
These designers have sent their amazing achievements to demonstrate fashion this summer.
Valentino’s most excellent performance was a beautiful blue hat with a colour-like wide border that encircled his head.
Massive accessories included precious stones, magic hats and even pineapples — but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also displayed a strange mask — just before Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had their lips pierced, and they were soon added to Hanibal Lekter, not to the high fashion.
One of the forms was a reminder of breathing patterns for noses, tubes, and glasses, while the other was like a cold cone.
And if you want to go on in a massive way, then it's time.
Styling observers believe that huge abrasions are possible on the way to you nearest High Street.
The large-scale hats immediately became popular after the appearance of "La Bomba" — two-footed soles (~60 cm) on two sides seemed to have worn all, from Rianna, to Emily Ratajovski (Emily Ratajkovski).
The status of very impractical hats as a cult object in all social networks has led to another major milestone — the sommeal beach, almost as big as the swimwear model that carries it.
The reddish-yellow silver rhyme, covered with rhyme bars and equipped with a white leather handle, took a special place in the Spring/Summer season collection "Jacquemus' La Riviera" in 2019 in the Paris Fashion Week.
Lukke Armitage explained FEMAIL: "I expect that large hats and beach bags will appear in central street stores next summer, because the designer has left such a big impression that it will be difficult to ignore the demand for huge-scale accessories."
John Edwards: Knowledge of languages is essential for citizens of the world
Scottish independent schools have an excellent reputation for educational institutions, and it has preserved it in 2018, when the results of excellent exams were obtained on an ongoing basis, which are further enhanced by individual and collective achievements in sport, art in music and other public events.
The objective of this school, in which 30 000 students are taught in Scotland and represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), is to provide the best level for their parents and grandchildren.
Independent schools have set the goal of preparing their children for further and higher education, their chosen career and their life as citizens of the world.
As an education sector that can develop and implement specific school programmes, we see that today’s languages are still popular and desirable in our schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to people in the language he understands, it stays in his mind.
If you speak his native language, it will remain in his heart."
This is a convincing reminder that we cannot simply rely on English when we want to establish a relationship and get people from other countries to trust.
In view of the recent results of this year's exams, we can see that languages are at the top of the league table with the largest number of exams held in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who learned foreign languages achieved the highest mark of A.
The data from the Scottish Independent School Council for 74 schools show that 72 percent of students received the highest mark in Chinese A, and 72 percent of those who learned German, 69 percent who learned French and 63 percent who learned Spanish.
This shows that the support of independent schools in Scotland is a language of vital importance that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Now languages, as an object of choice, are evaluated in independent school programmes as high as those of the science-technology-engineering and mathematics group (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).
In 2014, the Commission on Employment and Skills of the United Kingdom revealed that 17 per cent of employers as a reason for the failure to meet the lack of language skills mentioned in the vacancy.
As a result, language skills become increasingly mandatory to prepare young people for their future careers.
Increasing the opportunities for work that will require language skills is essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of their chosen career, learning a foreign language will bring them real benefits in the future.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically improve the competitiveness of several languages.
According to a survey conducted by YouGov in 2013 involving more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom, 75 percent did not understand foreign language well enough to maintain the conversation, but the French language was the only language spoken by a two-digit number of people, 15 percent.
That is why it is important for today’s children to learn the language.
A number of languages, especially the language skills of developing countries, will provide children with better opportunities for meaningful work.
Schools in Scotland differ in language.
Some schools will focus more on the most common modern languages, while others will learn languages such as Chinese and Japanese, which are considered the most important for the future of Britain, according to the plans by 2020.
Regardless of what your child will be interested in, independent schools will always be able to choose from several languages, and teachers will be experts in the area.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a language environment that will prepare children and will provide them with the skills needed to achieve success in the future.
At present, in the global business environment, languages cannot be denied that languages are still vital to the future of the country, so this fact must be reflected in education.
Indeed, today's languages would be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer young Scottish people this choice, diversity and excellence.
Il need bene le fare (It must be done).

Lebron's debut in Laker's composition on Sunday Sandjego
Fans have finally waited for the moment when Lebron's first game will take place in Los Angeles's Lakers.
Coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play Sunday in the pre-season opening game against Denver Nuggets in Sandjego.
However, it is still up to us to decide exactly how many minutes he will play.
"It'll be more than one, but less than 48," Volton reported on Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell on Twitter reported that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
As James continued his practice this week, he asked about his plans regarding the six pre-season series of Lakers games.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need pre-season games to prepare," he said.
Trampa City in West Virginia Time, channel YouTube
President Donald Tramps is starting a series of settlements in Willing, West Virginia, today.
This is the first of the five meetings planned for Trampla next week, including a stop in friendly places, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Since the vote on his choice to fill the free space has been suspended in the Supreme Court, the purpose of the trampa is to obtain support for the forthcoming interim elections, as there is a risk that the Republicans will lose control in Congress after the vote is handed down in November.
What will happen today in Trampa’s home in West Virginia, and how can you view it online?
Trampa village in Viling, West Virginia is scheduled for seven evenings, after ET today, Saturday, 29 September 2018.
Trampa locality in West Virginia You can watch online on YouTube.
Tramps is likely to be talking about hearing this week at the Bret Caveno case of the Supreme Court candidate, who has been pressurised in the sexual prosecutions, and the Senate's vote is expected to delay approval for a week until the FBI conducts the investigation.
However, the main objective of this meeting is to help improve the situation for the Republicans that are expected to be elected in November.
President Trampa's campaign thus shows that this next week's five meetings are "to activate volunteers and supporters while the Republicans are trying to protect and increase the majority of them in the Senate and the House of Representatives," according to "Reuters".
"Congress control of his agenda is so important that the president will visit the state as far as possible because we are starting an active campaign season," said Trampa campaign representative, who did not want to reveal his name, "Reuters".
This evening's location, which is planned to be "Wesbanco Arena" in Vilnius, is likely to involve supporters of "Ohaio and Pennsylvania, and reflect it in Pittsburgh's media," reports "West Virginia Metro News".
Saturday will be the second time in the last month when Trump visits West Virginia, a state in which he won more than 40 percent in 2016.
Tramps is trying to help the candidate of the Senator of West Virginia Patrick Morrisey, who is behind the polls.
"It is not a good sign for Morise that the president has to come to help improve his results," said Professor Simon Haeder of Political Studies of the University of West Virginia.
Raidera Cup 2018: The US has demonstrated its determination to fight to maintain great hope for Sunday games
After three sessions "in one word" Wednesday's games in the form of "foursome" were possible exactly what was needed for this Raider cup.
Sportsmen like to talk about the fluctuations of success, and they really believe it, especially in such competitions as these.
So, which side do they think is a success now?
"They were in charge with six points, but now with four, as I think it means in its sense that success has come to us," said Jordan Spythe (Jordan Spyeth).
Europe, of course, is in favour because it is in charge of 4 points, but 12 more will be played.
Spitt explained that Americans believe that the wind blows in their cages and they have reason to be optimistic, of course, also in Spitt and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and each of them can boast with three points out of four.
Spite has been devastating from the first seat to the hall, and is an example of the winner.
Those gutular winners became more and more loud as his rounds continued, the decisive sitin was made in the frenzy to reach the same number of sitins four times when he and Thomas had fallen back for two sitins after two.
His seat in the abyss, which won his victory 15 , was taken with a similar call, from them, for his conviction that the American team had not yet been pushed out.
"There really must be a deep sleep, and worry about your cat," Spitt said.
That's all that's left for these players.
18 cheats to make a success.
The only players who have won more points in the last two days than Spyts and Thomas are French Molinari and Tommy Flietwood, who will undoubtedly enter the history of this Rayder Cup.
The European strange but attractive couple is left behind by four points and will not be able to hurt.
Molivud was the only couple who were left without bogies on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogies on Saturday mornings, Friday afternoons, and in the last nine of them on Fridays in the mornings.
This event and how their energy flows into this frightening effort and back convinces them that they are players to win on Sunday, and Flítwood and Molinari will be the most popular players who can ensure a potential European victory when the sun goes through Le Golf National.
At the same time, I would like to see both of them in different ways.
However, the talks on the European triumph were premature.
Babba Watson (Bubba Watson) and Webb Simpson (Webb Simpson) were quickly finished with this morning's fourball hero Sergio Garcia (Sergio Garcia), who played with Alex Noren.
Bogis and the two doubles in the front nine brought the Spanish and the Swedish. They were not even close to cultivate it.
However, there is no one to help us finish on Sundays.
The games "fourball" and "foursome" are so exciting to observe in close proximity due to the interaction of a couple, to see what advice they give, and what not, and how the strategy can change the situation in accumulating.
Europe has played better as a team so far, and before the last few days it is in a far-reaching direction, but this game in the form of a "foursome" has shown that the US team is committed to fighting for which many, especially the "Stateside", have doubted.
European Selection of Raider's bag last day is in charge 10-6
The European Selection of the Raider Cup will begin on the last day in good leadership after Saturday 'fourball' and 'foursome' competition ended with 10-6 against the United States.
The inspired couple Tommy Flietwood and French Molinars (Françasco Molinari) were in charge of two victories over the heavy-working Tiger Woods (Tiger Woods), which increased the number of "Le Golf National" to four.
Tomas Bjorn (Thomas Bjorn) European team to maintain the trophy lost by Hazeltine two years ago dominated the inaccurate American team in the morning in the form of fourballs, and the result of the series became 3-1.
The U.S. was more energetic in the form of "foursomes", winning two cats, but could not eliminate the deficit.
Jim Farik (Jim Fury) team needs 8 points on Sunday 12 games to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European year to win four points in a row with Molinári, named after Molliwood after a sensational weekend, is just another couple in the history of the Raider Cup, which won four points in the first four matches.
The experienced Woods and Patrick Reed in the form of "fourballs" they then broke the weary Woods and American novelist Braison Deshambo (Bryson Dechambeau) with an even more sensitive result 5–4.
Woods, which had two games on Saturday, at times presented a great game, but he lost 19 of the 29 men in fourballs and foursomes, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose retired before the morning games "fourballs", returned to his partner Henrik Stenson "foursomes", with 2+1 saying Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koopka, who took the first and second place in the world ranking.
Europe did not fully achieve its own, although the day in southwestern Paris was a pleasant and calm breeze.
The three-time winner of the most prestigious golf game, Jordan Spytts and Justin Thomas, set a two-point benchmark for Americans on Saturday.
They printed 2&1 against the Spanish John Ram (John Rahm) and Ian Poulter in fourballs and returned later to call Polter and Rory McIlroy with 4&3 "foursomes" after the first two cheats had been lost.
Only twice in the history of the Raider Cup has the team played 4 points in the deficit games, but as owners, the Farika (Furry) team is sufficient only with an undisputed result to keep the trophy.
In the second place, two days, as it appears, the attack on Sunday will be problematic.
North Korea has announced that in no case will it be untrustworthy
On Saturday, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea informed the United Nations that the continuation of sanctions had deepened its distrust of the United States, and in such a situation North Korea would not give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Yong Ho (Ri Yong Ho) informed the annual General Assembly of the fact that North Korea has taken "significant good will steps" last year, such as the cessation of nuclear and rocket testing, the dismantling of nuclear weapons and the promise never to distribute nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see an adequate US response," he said.
"If there is no trust in the United States, there will be no faith in the security of our country, and in such circumstances we will not be the first to unilaterally disarm ourselves."
Although Ri repeated well-known North Korea's rejection of the "step-up" approach to denuclearisation, according to which Korea will be rewarded for its steps, his statement left the impression that it did not automatically reject unilateral denuclearisation, as Phenjana had done before.
Ri referred to Kim Čenuna and Donald Trampa's joint statement at the first meeting of the US President and North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work to achieve "the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula", while Tramps promised to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea has officially tried to end the 1950-53 Korean war, but the United States has announced that Phenjan must first give up his nuclear weapons.
Washington has also failed to respond to the call to facilitate serious international sanctions applicable to North Korea.
"The U.S. insists that "denuclearisation must be first", and increases the level of pressure generated by the sanctions to achieve the goal of power, even in line with the "declaration of the end of the war", said Ri.
"The idea that sanctions could push us on the road is empty fantasies that people who know nothing about us.
However, the problem is that the continuation of sanctions only deepens our distrust."
Ri did not talk about the intention of the second meeting of Kima with Trampa, whose US leader had specifically mentioned speaking to the United Nations this week.
In his speech, the Minister particularly highlighted three meetings of Kim with South Korea's leader Munu Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If the other side of this denuclearisation were South Korea, rather than the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have come to such an end."
However, Ri’s tone of speech differed dramatically from what he said last year when he announced at the United Nations General Assembly that the nomination of North Korean missiles to the U.S. continental part is inevitable after Mr.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who had threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea last year, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps towards disarmament, but stressed that there is still much to be done and that sanctions must be maintained until North Korea denuclearises.
On Wednesday Tramps announced that he had not planned a specific time, stressing that "it does not matter whether it will take two years, three years or five months".
China and Russia stress that the UN Security Council should reward Phenjan for what he has done.
On Thursday, however, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council: "The implementation of the Security Council's sanctions must continue vigorously without any error until final and convincing denouncing is achieved."
The Security Council has unanimously stepped up its sanctions since 2006 in an attempt to improve the financing of the phenyana nuclear and ballistic weapons programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and then informed that he would visit Phenjan again next month to prepare another meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trips were not successful.
He left Phenjana in July, saying that progress had been made, but after a few hours North Korea accused him of "gangster's worthy demands".
North Korea's meeting with Muna this month was committed to dismantle the weapons polygon and also the nuclear complex if the US takes "appropriate measures".
According to him, Kim had informed him that "appropriate measures" that North Korea wanted to see are security guarantees that Tramps promised in Singapore and steps to normalise relations with Washington.
Harvard University students will learn a lesson on how to get enough rest
A new subject of study at Harvard University this year has found that students are sleeping more, and it is an attempt to address the increasingly popular culture of brutalism, which includes over-stimulating caffeine overnight study.
One speaker found that the best university students in the world often have no basic knowledge of how to care for themselves.
Charles Cheisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, as well as a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed a learning subject that he considers to be the first subject of such a study in the United States.
The inspiration to create a new subject of learning came after his talk about the effect of sleep deprivation on learning.
"At last a girl came to me and asked, "Why does he tell me this just now that I'm in my last class?"
She discovered that no one had ever explained to her how important sleep is — which surprised me, he told the Telegraph.
This year's first subject of study is presented, provides students with basic information on how good sleep habits contribute to learning and sports achievements and improve general well-being.
Paul Bareira (Paul Barreira), professor of psychology at Harvard Medical School and the Executive Director of University Health Services, informed that the university decided to take the course after learning that students suffer from a serious lack of sleep during the week.
In the course of hours of training, interactive series of tasks are included.
One part is an image of the doors of the dome where students click on coffee cups, bans, sports shoes and books to learn about the effect of caffeine and light and how performance affects sleeplessness in sport and how important a sleeping routine is.
In another part, students are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Then the student city map with interactive icons invites participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that it will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know. Just as you have the right to know how health will affect cigarette smoking," added Professor Cheisler.
He said that a culture that boasts the ability to learn all night still exists, and added that modern technologies and the increasing pressure on students meant that the lack of sleep became an increasingly serious problem.
He explained that a sufficient amount of quality sleep must be a student's "secret weapon" to combat stress, overwork and anxiety, and even to prevent weight gain, because lack of sleep can be switched to hunger mode by making them hungry.
Raymond So (Raimond So), a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Cheisler to develop a course after he attended one of the professor's lectures last year, at Harvard's first course.
He said that the subject of the lesson had opened his eyes and inspired him to make the course available to the entire student city.
He hopes that the next step will be a request for students who receive post-graduate education to get a similar programme before going to enjoy competition.
Professor Cheisler recommends that students install a modulator not only at the time they get up, but also when they go to bed, as well as keep in mind how people damage "blue lights", which is emitted by the screens of electronic devices and LED lamps, as they can disrupt the daily rhythms by making it difficult to sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 "Rangers": Men’s gates surround Gerard’s viruses
"Rangers" sought another sad game at the guests when Dollija Mengas (Dolly Menga) satin Steven Gerarda (Steven Gerrard's incarcerated team decided 1 - 0 for the loss of Livingston.
The "Ibrox" team was hoping to win the first round since February 4:1 St Johnstone triumph, but the Geri Holt team brought his second loss to Gerard in 18 games, since he became the club manager, and his team is at 8 points away from the Scottish Championship leader "Hearts".
Menga entered the bomb seven minutes before the end of the half-time, and the lack of the "Rangers" inspiration looked nothing after trying to balance the result.
"Rangers" falls to the sixth place, while "Livingston" climbs to the third place, and only "Hibernian" overcomes it by gate distinction.
And "Rangers" could be another problem, because the judge's assistant, Calum Spence, needed medical assistance due to a head trauma, which was apparently caused by the next final object.
Gerard made eight changes in his team, which quickly left behind the air, reaching the Betfred cup half-final.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same 11 players as Livingston, who took one point from Hearts last week, and he would be happy to see how his well-trained team pushed opponents into each episode.
It is possible that Rangers managed the bomb more often, but Livingston made better use of what they did.
They needed to get the doors for two minutes after Menga's first game sent Scott Pittman towards Alan McGregor's (Allan McGregor) gate, but the center player is leaving his big opportunity.
At that time, the distant liberation of Keagan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his partner in defense of Alan Lithgov (Alan Lithgow) was able to launch a bomb only for a long rear pole.
"Rangers" took control, but there was an impression that the last third was expected to play, not believed it would happen.
Alfredo Morelos (Alfredo Morelos) felt no doubt that he had to make a sentence in 15 minutes, after he had met Stephen Loles (Steven Lawless), but Judge Steven Thompson (Steven Thomson) rejected the Colombian call.
The Rangers took only two seats in the first half, but the former Ibrox guard Liam Kelly was not particularly disturbed, nor was Lassana Kulibali (Lassana Coulibaly) sitting with his head, nor was the faithful Ovi Edgaria (Ovie Ejaria) at the end of the attack.
Although the 34th minute of Livingston might have changed the course of the game, no one can deny that they had earned it by their efforts.
"Rangers" was no longer finished with Jacob's long-term combination.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Galagher (Declan Gallagher) broadcast a bomb to Scott Robinson, who maintained balance and chose Meng for a simple finish.
Gerard in the break, Kulibali replaced Rayin Kent (Ryan Kent), and it almost immediately affected the game because the halfguard sent the bomb Morelosam, but the impressive Kelly from his line immediately block the year.
But "Livingston" continued to make guests play how they liked Lithuania and Halket by having one spirit sit after another.
The Holta team could have continued to lead in the final phase, but Makgregor played well, stopping Jacobs, before Lithuania had a head start.
"Rangers" replacement Glenns Middleton (Glenn Middleton) later requested another sentence, after he had met Jacobs, but he ignored the request again.
Almanahs: Geigera Calculator Designer
And now the page of our Sunday Morning almanah: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago... one day in Germany was born John Wilhelm Hans Geiger, who grew up as a physicist.
Geigers developed a method for the determination and measurement of radioactivity as a result, in the end, was a device known as Geigera numerator.
In science, Geiger, who took his place and kept his place in the pop culture, such as in the 1950s, Bells of Coronado (Coronado bells), where the main roles were played by scientists of the cowboy type, Rogers and Deil Evans:
The man said, "What the hell is this?"
Rogers: "It's Geiger's counter used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these ears on, you can hear how the atoms act, which is released because of the radioactivity produced by this mineral."
Evans: "Really, it's a bird!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
However, his invention continues to exist.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" bad cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" bad cells and kill them
Vaccine therapy teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells
When using this method, immune system cells are obtained from the patient, which are converted into a laboratory
Then they could "see" the protein that is characteristic of many malignant tumours and will be injected back into the body
The test vaccine presents promising results in patients with different types of malignant tumours.
A woman who was treated with a vaccine that taught the immune system to recognize bad cells experienced the loss of her ovary cancer for more than 18 months.
The method is to obtain from the patient’s immune system cell by converting it into a laboratory to be able to "detect" several tumours with HER2 protein and then inject these cells back into the body.
In Betesda (Bethesda), the U.S. National Cancer Institute, Professor Jay Berzovsky (Jay Berzofsky) reported: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "promots the growth of several types of malignant tumours," including breast, ovaries, lungs and severe and straight intestine cancer, explained Professor Berzovskis.
A similar approach when immunosystems were obtained from the patient, which were "learned" how to attack the malignant tumour cells, has occurred in one type of leukaemia.
Kanje West after visiting SNL, clothes in MAGA hats, attacked Trampa critics.
It didn't end well
Kanje West was presented in a study on Saturday Night Live, following an independent performance in which he celebrated US President Donald Tramp and announced that he was in the presidential election in 2020.
After finishing the third song last night, which was called Ghost Town, during which he wore Make America Great hats, he began to whiten the sound phrases about the Democrats and again stressed his support for Trappam.
"Just many times when I talk to white people, they ask, "How can you like Trump? He's a racist!"
Well, if I was concerned about racism, it would have been a long time since America," he said.
"Saturday Night Live" began with a lecture with Matt Damon, where the Hollywood Star was screened by Brett Kavanaugh at the Senate Judicial Committee on the charge of Christian Blaisey Ford.
Although this was not transmitted, the material with West loved social networks was loaded by Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to get rid of the West like this.
And yet West felt sorry for the visitors for having treated him badly because of his headache.
"They pissed me off in the back!
They said, "Don't get out there with that hat in your head!"
They mocked me!
And yet they said that I've lost touch with reality," said West, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: "You want to see what happens when you lose touch with reality?" and promised to wear "your Superman's craft" because that means that you can't tell me what to do with me. Want the world to move forward?
Try love!"
"Variity" reported that his comments caused viewer swings at least twice, but the members of the show team looked silent, and at least one person told the press release: "The study was in complete silence."
The wedding had recently been invited to replace the singer Ariana Grande, who had died a few days ago by a friend of the Mac Miller rapper.
The West samulsed many with a song (I Love it), which he performed in the champagne bottle costume.
The wedding was supported by the conservative group leader TPUSA, Kandance Turner, who posted on Twitter: "To one of the strongest people in the world: PATEICOS, KA NOT APPLY!"
But on Twitter, the leader of the conversation show Karen Hunter said that West was simply "what he was, and it's wonderful."
"But I will choose not to reward a person (by buying his music or clothing or by supporting his 'student'), who, as I believe, supports and bleats with ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And we too," she added.
Before this show's reprisal on Twitter, he announced that he has changed his name, saying that he has now become "a creature previously known as Kanji West".
He is not the first artist to change his name, and acts like Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another snoop dog rapper earlier was snoop lion, and, of course, an unfavorable music legend Prince, replaced his name with a symbol, but then on the "story artist who was previously known as Prince".
Accused of attempted murder at Belfast Restaurant
A 45-year-old man is accused of attempted murder after a man was found at the restaurant in the east of Belfast on Friday.
The police reported that the incident occurred in Ballyhackamore.
It is expected that the accused will appear before the Court of Justice on Monday.
The prosecution will be examined by the Public Prosecution Service.
"Tron Games" Star Kitts Herrington's directed against Toxic Marriage
Another Herrington is known as the sword-cancelling John Snow HBO's ugly medieval fantasy series "The Thrones Games".
However, a 31 - year - old actor has turned to a brutal hero’s stereotype, saying that such characters on the screen often make young boys think they need to be strong to be respected.
In a conversation with "The Sunday Times Culture", Kits explained that he thought there was "a problem that had arisen", and asked how to deal with toxic marriage in the #MeToo era.
Another who recently got married with his "Tron Games" partners, Rose Leslie, also 31 years of age, admitted that he had a problem that was important to him.
"I just couldn't think of what mistakes we made with marriage," he said.
"What do we teach young men about this problem when they grow up, taking into account the existing problem?"
Others believe that television with its very male characters may be partly responsible for the growth of toxic marriage.
And he continued: "Who is born born again, but who is taught?
What are taught on TV and on the streets that make young boys feel that they need to be seen as men?
I think this is one of the most important issues of our time: how can we change it?
Because there are clearly problems with young men."
In the interview he also acknowledged that he would not participate in any "Tron Games" continuation or adventure, after the series ended next summer, stressing that "the battlefields and horses are abstinent".
Starting with November Kit will play the main role in the renewed Sam Shepard True West, which is a story about the film producer and his brother's captor.
The shareholder recently admitted that he considered his meeting with his wife Rosa as the best thing that happened to her as a result of the "Tron Games".
"I met my wife at this show, because it in itself provided my present family and my life from that time on," he said.
In the series of fantasy awards won by Rosa Emmy, the other person was John Snow's favorite Igriti.
A couple were married in June 2018 to owned by the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China reported that the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has risen by 14% rapidly.
Health care officials report that more than 820,000 people are affected.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases were the result of gender change.
Traditional HIV spread rapidly as a result of blood transfusions in some parts of China.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has declined almost to zero, Chinese health care officials informed the conference in Junnan province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased to 100,000 people a year.
The transmission of HIV through gender is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality in China was decriminalized in 1997, but LGBT is said to be frequent.
Based on national conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have had sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the cases of sexually transmitted diseases are the result of insufficiently protected sex in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised general availability of HIV medicines as part of the measures to address the problem.
Maxina Watersa denies that the employee has leaked data from the Republican senators, facing "dangerous lies" and "consistency theories"
On Saturday, the U.S. Chamber of Representatives, Maxine Waters, rejected allegations that her staff member had published personal information from three United States senators in the paper of the Wikipedian legislator.
The Los Angeles Democrat argued that the claims were being spread by "ultra good" bird news and websites.
"Melia, lie and more negative lies," Twitter posted Voters in its statement.
It is reported that the leaked information includes residence addresses and telephone numbers belonging to the US Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hečam from Jutta.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person from Congress, during a hearing with the Senate Group on the complaints of Bret Caveno, appointed by the Supreme Court, in sexual misconduct.
The flood occurred some time after the three senators questioned Cavena.
Conservative, internet sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the origin of the records is linked to the Waters cabinet, and revealed information about the Waters staff, Hills informed.
"This unwarranted claim is absolutely false and completely false!" said Waters.
"My staff member whose identity, personal information and security is compromised by this fraudulent and false claim is in no way responsible for the leak of information.
This unwarranted claim is absolutely false and completely false!"
Watersa's statement soon led to online criticism, including the criticism of former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer (Ari Fleischer).
"This is an angry ban," Fleiser wrote.
"It leads us to conclude that her temperament does not correspond to the Congressman.
When a person is accused of something he has not done, he must not be angry.
He must not be a warrior.
He must not speak of the accused's motives.
He must be calm and framed."
Fleissera's task was to compare the Waters' reaction to the democratic fall of Judge Kaveno, who was accused of being too angry at the hearing on Thursday.
Omars Navarro (Omar Navarro), a Republican candidate who is running for Votersa to lose an interim vote, also said his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great, if it's true," he wrote.
In its communication, Votersa informed that her cabinet had warned responsible officials and law enforcement bodies about these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that the guilty will be discovered," she continued, "and that they will be legally responsible for all their works that are destructive and dangerous to any of my staff."
John English 3’s comment — Rovan Atkinson’s exhibition on mirrors left in half
It has become common to search for association with Brexit in every new movie with British guards, and it seems also to apply to this who has recovered, the French comedy of Johnny England (Johnny English), which began in 2003 with "John England" and was born in 2011 with "John England Returns".
Is there a new export opportunity for our nation?
In any case, John England, with his eyes selected and unusually moving face, has the right to create the garbage after the second resurrection — his name more than anyone else indicates that he is a wide spectrum comic character designed for areas where consumers do not speak English.
He is, of course, the smart secret agent who, despite his strange claims of rounding out, is a little Kluzo, a little Mr. Binn, and a coyote of the guy playing one of the "Chariots of Fire" themes at the 2012 opening ceremony of the London Olympic Games.
He is also based on the traveler and the international, incomprehensible character that Atkinson once pictured in the already forgotten Barclaycard TV ads in which he left chaos on his way.
The latest Johnny England experience has at least one or two pleasant moments.
I liked the place where John England went to the helicopter clothes in the middle of the brown suit, and the propeller's faces were staring at his jaws for a moment.
Rekinson's gifts of visual creation of a comical impression are well visible, but humor is quite weak and strange, especially because "serious" cinema brands such as "007" and "Invincible Mission" themselves use comedy as one of the ingredients.
Humor creates the impression that it is dedicated to children rather than adults, and in my opinion the absurd remains of Johnny Angle are not as creative and objective as the playwrights of Atkinson Memeo trick of Bina's skin.
As usual, everything is based on the fact that Britain has fallen into a serious crisis.
Cyberhacker has hacked into the British super-blind mirror network, discovering the identity of all these British agents, as an unfaithful active agent — unfortunately little Kevin Eldon (Kevin Eldon).
This is the last address to the Prime Minister, the Pomozah and the man of conflict who has already lost a completely political popularity: Emma Thompson is doing something with Teresa Meja in part, but in the scenario there is not much to work with.
Her research advisors inform that, since all the active impressions have been discovered, she will have to call on someone who has retired.
And this man is the unmistakable John Anglis, who now works as a teacher in a fine educational institution, and he obeys teaches how to work as a secret agent (a few fun jockeys), because Anglis offers to learn a spy profession from the very foundation.
English is returned to the extraordinary meeting of Violet and is combined with his once-a-long number of victims of Bo, which is also playing Ben Miller.
Because now a man is hired, hired by the commander of the underground, a funny person who becomes important only at the end of the film — the role that Vicki Pepperdaina (Vicki Pepperdine) has not been fully used.
And so Batman, with Robin's huge mistake, has returned to the secret service of her Highness and met the beautiful fateful woman of Ophelia Bouletova, who was pictured by Olga Kurylenko.
As long as the Prime Minister has hired a dangerous charismatic technology billionaire, the evil Jason Volta, whose image is Jack Leisis (Jake Lacy), and he claims to be able to solve the British computer cache.
Anglis and Bo begin their forest-like fun odise: they masked themselves as officers, they set on fire a fine French restaurant; they create the confusion of sneaking into Walt’s luxury yacht; and Anglis causes absolute chaos by trying to use virtual reality on the head display to get to know the interior of the Walta building.
Everything is done as far as possible to the end of the film, but as attractive and curious as the film is, it has many children's television elements.
A lot of measured elements.
Just as in the case of other English films, can I not imagine that the British film industry could not give Rovan Atkinson a role that would fully use his talent?
The Labour Party rejects plans that the British will work four days a week, but will receive a salary in five days
Jeremy Corbina (Jeremy Corbyn) The Leborist Party is preparing to discuss a radical plan, according to which the British will work four days a week, but will receive a salary of five.
It is reported that the party wants the company's leaders to grant workers saved by an artificial intellectual revolution by granting them another holiday.
In such a case, employees will be able to enjoy the weekend of three days, at the same time receiving the same amount of pay as before.
The sources say that the idea will "response" the party's agenda in the economy and plans to change the economy for the good of the workers.
The four-day transition has been supported by the Trade Union Congress, which considers it an opportunity for workers to benefit from economic change.
One of the senior representatives of the Leborist Party informed The Sunday Times: "It is expected that policy changes will be announced by the end of this year.
"It won't happen in one day, but four days' work week is an idea that fits the Party's goal of balancing the economy for good workers, as well as the Party's overall strategy for industry."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party promised to introduce four days of work in the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the Leborist party as such does not currently support these hungers.
The representative of the Leborist Party reported: "The four-day work week is not part of the party's policy, and the party does not consider it."
The shadow cabinet minister John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to give an overview of his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. Macdonela explained that he has committed himself to withdrawing the power of "directors" and "speculators" from the public service company.
The Minister of the Shadow Cabinet also plans that the existing average shareholders of the water companies may not be able to recover their entire package because the Lebanese government could implement the "remuneration" due to the alleged injustices.
He also approved plans to include working companies in government and set up exclusive Property Funds to allocate 10% of the private sector company's capital to employees who would receive up to 500 pounds each year in dividends.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy answer "60 Minutes", or the FBI investigation into the Caveno case could change their opinion
The investigation of the charges brought against Judge Brett Kavanaugh by the FBI has delayed the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least one week, and raises the question of whether the findings of the Office could have led a Republican senator to withdraw his support.
In the interview on Sunday, a 60-minute news correspondent, Scott Pelley, asked Republican Senator John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could find out something that would change their mind.
Kennedy left a better impression on the person than his South Carolina colleague.
"Yes, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said, when I turned to the hearing procedure, I said that I spoke to Judge Caveno.
I called him after it happened when the charge became known, and I said, "Did you do it?"
He was determined, direct and incomprehensible."
However, Grema's vote seems to have been thrown into the rock.
"I have taken a decision about Breta Caveno, and there will be a great accusation," he said.
"Dr. Forda, I don't know what happened, but I know what: Brett strongly rejected it," Grems added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of her names could approve it.
The event is 36 years old.
I don't think there's any change to be expected."
What is the festival of the world’s citizens, and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday will be a World Citizens' Festival in New York, an annual music event with an impressive number of stars and an equally impressive mission: to reduce poverty in the world.
This is the seventh year of the festival, the World Citizens' Festival will be attended by tens of thousands of people who will meet in the Great Sea of Central Park not only to enjoy the benefits, such as Janet Jackson, the Cardi B (Cardi B) and Shawn Mendes, but also to increase their understanding of the real goal of the event, which is the end of extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an event set up by the Global Powery Project International Defence Group, which hopes to end poverty by attracting more and more people who are actively fighting poverty.
In order to receive a free ticket to this event (unless there was a desire to pay for a VIP ticket), concert visitors had to perform a series of tasks or "work", such as volunteering, sending e-mails to a world leader, making telephone calls or other important activities to promote awareness of the end of poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen movement been, for which 12 years to achieve?
Is the idea of awarding a free concert a good way to convince people to act, or just another so-called "clickivism" case where people think they can really influence by signing an online petition or sending a Twitter report?
The Global Citizen movement has claimed that since 2011, it has registered more than 19 million "work" from its supporters in order to achieve various objectives.
It informs that these actions have helped world leaders to report commitments and policies equivalent to more than US$ 37 billion and will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group referred to 390 commitments and notifications resulting from activities for which at least US$ 10 billion has already been paid or financed.
The group estimates that the funds allocated so far directly have affected almost 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main commitments include "The Power of Nutrition" — a partnership of investors and implementing partners established in the United Kingdom who are committed to "helping children to grow fully", promising to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end the country's incomplete diet after more than 4700 Twitter reports from the world's citizens.
"With the United Kingdom government, donors, governments of other countries and the world's citizens like you, we can leave incomplete food injustice in the history," Treisija Ulmena (Tracey Ullman) announced to the London concert in April 2018.
The group also mentioned that after more than 5,000 measures were launched, calling on the UK Government to provide mothers and children with better nutrition, the government announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which will provide food for 5 million women and children.
Answering one of the most frequently asked questions on your website — "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen commented: "It will be a long and long path where we will stumble and suffer failure.
However, just as the major civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us have done so, so we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are some of the artists who will take part in this year's event in New York, led by Deborah Lee Fernes (Deborra-Lee Furness) and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use war fleets for "blocking" to stop Russian energy exports – said Minister of Interior
"If necessary", Washington could use its war fleet to prevent Russia's energy from entering the market, including in the Middle East," said US Interior Minister Ryans Zinke (Ryan Zinke), as described by Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s activities in Syria, especially in places where it operates under the legitimate invitation of the government, are in the process of investigating new energy markets.
"I think the reason why it is in the Middle East is that it wants to supply energy just as it does in Eastern Europe — South European," he said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States, through its military fleet, can ensure that maritime roads are open and, if necessary, block them so that Russia cannot put its energy on the market," he said.
Zinke turned to the public who had come to visit the action taken by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organisation called the "Energy Consumer Voice" in the United States.
He compared the Washington approach to addressing the situation of Russia and Iran, indicating that they are actually the same.
"The economic opportunity of Iran and Russia is more or less fuel use and substitution," he said, at the same time referring to Russia as a country whose economy is mainly dependent only on fossil fuel.
It is further argued that the Trappa administration is promoting liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, thus replacing Russia with much cheaper options for consumers in Europe.
For this reason, Trampa's administration officials and US President Donalds Tramps themselves are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "unappropriate" Nord Stream 2 gas management project, which, according to Trampa, would make Berlin "dependent" from Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly pointed out that the $11 billion worth of North Stream 2 gas pipeline, which would double the existing gas capacity of up to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
Kremlis believes that Washington’s hot opposition project is simply based on economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we agree that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose a supplier," said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novaks after meeting in Moscow in September with US Minister of Energy Riku Periju.
The US has expressed its negative attitude towards Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German industry organisation — the German Industrial Federation (BDI) — has called for the US to refrain from participating in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I would feel a great problem if a third country were involved in our energy supply," said German Chancellor Angel Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin, head of the German Industrial Federation (BDI) Dieters Kempfs, after a recent meeting.
Senator Elizabeth Vorena will take his candidacy seriously for the 2020 presidential election
Senator Elizabeth Vorena of Massachusetts announced on Saturday that he is seriously considering running for the presidency post after the mid-term elections.
During the House's meeting in Holiok, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering running for the President's election.
"It is the right time for Washington to have women who will "save" the incomplete government, which also means women-presidents," her words are reflected in the newspaper "The Hill".
"After 6 November, I will carefully consider my candidacy in the election of the President of the United States."
During the House's sitting, Warren referred to President Donald Tramp, claiming that he was "leading this country in the wrong direction".
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Tramps is doing with our democracy," she said.
Warren has openly criticised Tramp and the candidate of the Supreme Court, Brett Caveno.
On Friday's Twitter report, Vorena said: "Of course, the FBI needs an investigation before the elections."
However, the poll published on Thursday revealed that the majority of Vorena's supporters did not consider that she should run for 2020.
According to the results of the Boston Globe poll of the Political Research Centre/University of Suffolk University, fifty-eight percent of the "possible" voters in Massachusetts claimed that the senator should not run the election.
Thirty-two percent supported such a decision.
The results of the survey revealed that more support had been received by former Governor Devals Patricks, receiving 38% of the candidate's vote and 48% against.
In the context of the possible candidacy in 2020, the election will also show the names of the high profile members of the Democratic Party as former Vice-President Joe Baiden and Senator Vermont Sanders.
The news agency Associated Press reported that Baidens is committed to making an official decision by January.
Sara Peilina quotes Treka Peilina PTSS Donald Tramp as saying
Trek Peilins (26) spent the year in Iraq following his call in the Karadesh in September.
On Monday evening, he was arrested and accused of domestic violence.
"To whom my own son goes through, to whom he goes through after returning, I can extend to other families who face the consequences of PTSS and some of the dose vulnerabilities that our soldiers return with," she told the audience at Donald Trampa in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Peilina called her arrest "a obvious problem that everyone remains invisible" and said about her son and other war veterans that "they return a little different, they return firmly, they come back wondering whether what their fellow soldiers and pilots have done and all the other members of the military have given to this country."
According to the representative of the Vasil police department, Den Beneta was arrested on Monday in Vasil, Alaska, and accused of violence in the family concerning women and the holding of arms while in a condition of fitness.
18 states, Colombia with a challenge for the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the Colombian region support the legal challenge of a new US policy that prevents refugees fleeing gang or violence in the family.
The representatives of these 18 states and the Colombian region presented a brief statement to the court council on Friday in Washington to support the asylum seeker facing obstacles created by that policy, reports NBC News.
The full name of the applicant Grace v. Session in the trial launched by the American Citizens' Freedom Union in August against federal politics is not revealed.
She claimed that her partner "and her violent gang members" abused her, but the U.S. officials refused her request on July 20th.
She was detained in Texas.
State lawyers who supported Greece described Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large proportion of US asylum seekers, as countries where the problem is common are gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy changed the 2014 decision of the Immigration Appeals Council, which allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing violence in the family to seek asylum.
The District Attorney General of Colombia, Karl Racín, announced on Friday that the new policy "is ignoring the laws of the state, federal and international imposed on dozens of people".
"Federal law provides that all requests for asylum are dealt with in accordance with the facts and circumstances of the claim concerned, and such an obstacle violates this principle," said the court counsel's brief statement.
In addition, the lawyer stated in his statement that the policy that prevents immigrants from entering the country would harm the US economy, as these immigrants would probably become entrepreneurs and would "provide the necessary workforce".
In June, General Prosecutor Jeff Sessons (Jeff Sessions) turned to immigration judges with a request to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing violence in the family and gang abuse.
"The asylum is available to people who leave their homeland because of persecution or fear associated with their race, religion, ethnicity, belonging to a particular social group or political opinion," Sessons said in his Communication on Policy on 11 June.
Asylum has never been designed to address all the problems, even all the serious problems, that people face every day throughout the world.
Disregardful rescue efforts by Paul, doubled by the number of people who have fallen in the search process
The situation became more and more difficult for the survivors.
"The situation is very tense," said 35-year-old Ríza Kusuma, calming her little brother-in-law in the city's evacuation center of Palu.
"For a minute, the rapid medical service introduces new victims.
Clean water is scarce."
The people were visible when they returned to their ruined homes and moved to the water, trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals suffering from 7.5 major earthquakes were overcrowded.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who had a broken spine and back, slept outside the Pale Army hospital, where patients were being cared for outside the incredibly strong post-mortem.
Her eyes burst with tears, recalling how a powerful earthquake began to shake the hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save.
It seems I was impressed by the wall holes," the news agency Associated Press said to Harris, noting that his family had arrived for the city's wedding.
"I listened to my wife's name for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to him or my child.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. Ambassador accuses China's introductory attempts to use propaganda advertising
A week after the official Chinese newspaper released four pages of spirit advertisements, highlighting the mutual benefits of the US and China trade, the US Ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
Last Wednesday, US President Donald Tramps referred to the annex paid for "China Daily" in the state of Iowa's most sold newspaper "Des Moines Register", accusing China of trying to interfere with the will of the US Congress on 6 November, but China rejects it.
Trampa's complaint that Beijing is trying to interfere with the US's will marked what US officials told the news agency "Reuters", that it was a new stage in the growing Washington campaign to put pressure on China.
As long as it is perfectly normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an increasing trade war, resulting in a series of tariffs for each other.
At the beginning of the trade war, Chinese repressive tariffs were directed at exporters in states such as Iowa, which supported the Trampa Republican Party, said Chinese and US experts.
Terij Branstad, US Ambassador to China and former long-term governor in Iowa, who is a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said that Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote his opinion on Sunday's edition "Des Moines Register", claiming that China "now doubles this perception by placing advertising advertisements in our own free press."
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses for its own good the tradition of freedom of speech and free press in America by placing paid advertising "Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, here in the ordinary Beijing news gallery you will find a range of different views and you will not see the true representation of such different views that the Chinese people may have in connection with China's worrying economic trajectory, given that the media is here under the strict supervision of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He noted that "one of the most influential Chinese newspapers avoided publishing" his article, but he did not mention which newspaper it was.
Analysts warn of Republicans that are depriving women voters of the mid-term elections involving the Caveno scandal
Since many leading Republicans support and defend the High Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, against which several allegations of sexual violence have been made, analysts have warned that the expected mid-term elections will experience a negative reaction, especially from women.
The emotions associated with this have been extremely high and it is evident that most Republicans have already been prepared to give their voices.
Such things can't be recalled, "for the Saturday newspaper "The Hill" told Professor of Science at the University of Syracuse Maxwell School of Science, Grant Reeher.
Rühers doubts that the last time Senator Jeff Fleik (R-Arizona) was encouraged to conduct an FBI investigation will be a pretty big reason to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday. They will not forget it either tomorrow or November," according to the newspaper "Washington, D.C." on Friday, Karine Jean-Pierre, the senior adviser and national representative of the progressive movement "MoveOn".
On Friday morning, protestors in the Senate, protesting in front of the Senate, sang "November coming!" when Republicans under the authority of the Court Committee chose to continue with the candidacy of Kaveno, despite the testimony given by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, said "Mic".
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be at a very high level," independent political analyst St. Rothenberg told the news portal.
"People say it's already at high level, it's right.
However, it could be even higher, especially between the citizens of the city and the younger voters (from 18 to 29 years of age), who often do not go to elections even if the President does not like it."
Even before Forda’s public testimony, in which she described allegations of sexual violence on the part of the High Court candidate, analysts point out the possible failure if the Republicans continued to apply this candidacy.
"The Republican Party has become a jolly mess," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee's vote or the final vote, or about whether Kaveno will be convicted, it's also about how the Republicans have dealt with this situation and how they've dealt with it," said Gay Cecil (Guy Cecil), the Director of Priority USA, who runs this group that helps elect the Democrats.
However, it seems that the Americans have been a little divided over what they believe in ford and cafe testimonies, a little bit more likely to believe in the latter.
The new survey "YouGov" shows that 41 percent of respondents are either certain or most likely to believe in Forda's testimony, while 35 percent claim that they are certain or most likely to believe in Caven's testimony.
In addition, 38 percent claimed that Caveno may have lied about his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
According to The Guardian, the FIB is currently investigating the claims made by Forda and at least another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez.
Last week Forda pointed out to the Senate Judicial Committee that at the age of 17, Kaveno was drunk against his sexual assault.
Ramireza claims that during his studies in Jeil, a candidate for the Supreme Court judge showed her his genius in a ballet in 1980.
Global Web Designer plans to start a new Internet to take over Google and Facebook
Tim Bärnerss-Lei (Tim Berners-Lee), a global web designer, is launching a project that could compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the Technology Legend "Inrupt" is a company based on the open source platform "Solid".
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people are allowed to access any information.
In an exclusive interview with "Fast Company", Childrens-Ley joked that "Inrupt" was "dominating the world".
"We have to do it now," he said about the new company.
"It's a historic moment."
The use of Solid technology is used to enable people to create their own "personal online data storage" or PTD.
It may include contact lists, work lists, calendars, music libraries, as well as other personal and professional tools.
It is the same as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify would all be available in one browser at a time.
The storage of personal online data is unique because only the user determines what and what type of information can be accessed.
The company refers to it as "personal powers by means of data".
According to John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is to provide the company with resources, processes and skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company is currently operating in Kinderss-Li, Bruce, the IBM-acquired security platform, some external developers working on the project, and a voluntary coding community.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world could create their own decentralised applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Children's-Lei said he and his team don't talk to Facebook and Google about whether to make complete changes during one night completely turning all their business models.
"We don't ask for his permission."
The "Medium" platform, published on Saturday, Children's-Lei, said that "Inrupt" "the mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web based "Solid".
In 1994 the Children’s-Leigh transformed the Internet through the establishment of a Global Network Consortium of Massachusetts Technology.
In recent months, Children's-Le has had an impact on the discussions on network neutrality.
Even after "Inrupt" the Childrens-Li will remain the founder and director of the Global Web Consortium, the Global Web Fund and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm really optimistic about this new web age," Children's-Ley observed.
Bernard Vann: Marking the Victorian Cross granted to a priest during World War I
For 100 years in its hometown, the event has been marked when the only Church of England priest has received Victorian cross during World War I as a fighter.
Colonel Bernard Wens received this award on 29 September 1918 in connection with the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaukort.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper, so he did not know about the highest British military award.
On Saturday’s show in Rašden, Northamptonshire, his two little children discovered a stone dedicated to him.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, mentioned that it was "excellent symbolic", that such a stone was discovered just 100 years after his grandfather had received a significant award.
According to the newspaper "London Gazette" on 29 September 1918, Colonel Vens led his battalion through Canal de Saint-Quentin "through very frequent fog and lightning and lightning.
Later he rushed to the shooting line and with the utmost confidence led this line forward before the adoption of the large area where three groups were established.
On October 4, 1918, a German sniper killed Colonel Ven, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Wen (72) said that his grandfather's action was "killing something that I could never do, and that at the same time is also very humble action".
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also took the lead in the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Wen said that he felt "honored to participate in this debt", and noted that "the true value of the hero shows the support of many people".
MMA fans waited all night "Bellator 206", but instead waited for Pig Pepu
Imagine that you have spent the entire night watching Bellator 206, but at the end you are denied this main event.
There were 13 fights in Sanhos, including six main maps broadcast online throughout the entire night in Channel 5 of the United Kingdom.
At 6:00 p.m., when Gegards Musasi (Gegard Mousesi) and Rory MacDonald (Rory MacDonald) were about to face each other, viewers in the United Kingdom were surprised by the change of the transmission to Pepu.
Some were really confused when they stayed in bed all night until early in the morning, waiting for the battle.
A fan on Twitter described a transmission change to a child's multifilm as a "failure joke".
"The government has determined that the content of this kind is not acceptable after 6.00, so the transmission to the children's programme was switched," explained Dave Schwartz, the senior vice president of marketing and communication.
"Pep's pig," "yes."
The president of Bellator, Scott Coker, said he was working on schedule planning so that the viewers in the United Kingdom could see these transmissions.
"When we think about re-transmission, I think we can sort of solve it," Koker said.
"But there's six o'clock in the morning on Sunday, and we won't be able to solve this problem until Sunday after our time and Monday after their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, many texts have appeared after the transmission, and they have not been positive.
We tried to prevent it because we thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn't, it was controlled by the government.
I can promise you that there will be no such problem the next time.
We will stick to five fights, not six (as it has been so far).
It's a failed situation."
"Desert Island Discs": Toms Daily wasn't good enough because of her sexuality
The Olympic Kidney Tom Daley (Tom Daley) claims that he grew up feeling less valuable than others because of his sexuality, but it motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old man didn't realize that "not all are like me" until he started attending high school.
While visiting the first Radio 4 program "Desert Island Discs", led by Lauren Laverne, he mentioned that he started talking about the rights of homosexuals to give others "hope".
He also mentioned that becoming a parent made him less concerned with winning the Olympics.
The permanent director of the long-term programme, Kirsty Young, has been involved in the illness for several months.
Looking like the rash of Laverne's first programme, Delis said that growing up feels "less valuable" to others, because "the society is not supposed to like both girls and boys".
He said, "Even today I feel that I am not as good as others, or that I am different, has been the main engine that has given me the strength and stamina to succeed."
He said he wanted to prove that there was a "killing something" so that people wouldn't hope when they finally learned about his sexuality.
The double winner of the Olympic bronze medal has become the leader of the high-level LGBT campaign and has used his appearance in the Consistency Games in Australia this year, calling for more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said that he decided to speak to society because he felt happy that he could live openly and without difficulty, and wanted to give hope to others.
The three-time world champions said that love for a man, the American filmmaker in Dustin Lansa Black, whom he met in 2013, "suddenly unprepared".
Deili was a 20 - year - old Oscar award winner last year and claimed that the age difference had never been an obstacle.
"When you're so young you've gone through so much for someone" (his first Olympics were 14 years old, and his father died from cancer three years later), it's hard to find someone at your age who would have experienced similar surfaces and falls.
The couple became the parent of Robert Ray Blakes-Delley (Robert Ray Black-Daley), and Dellie claimed that his "whole perspective" had changed.
"One year ago everything that mattered to me was the acquisition of a gold medal," he said.
"You know what? Life has more important things about the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic Gold Medal is Robbie."
Her son Robert has the same name as his father, who died in 2011 at the age of 40.
Deili said that his father did not want to accept that he was dying, and one of the last things he asked Deili was whether they had tickets to the 2012 London Olympics where he wanted to be in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him that she would no longer be in the first row," he said.
"I held his hand until he stopped breathing, and only when he actually stopped breathing and was dead did I finally admit that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Delhi participated in the 2012 Olympic Games and won bronze.
"I just knew it was what I had dreamed of all my life – going in front of householders in the Olympic Games. There was no better feeling about it," he said.
It also inspired his first selection of songs – Heather Small performed "Proud", which reasoned with him on his way to the Olympics and still raise the rose.
The program "Desert Island Discs" will be heard on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11.15 a.m. after British summer time.
From the shape of Michelson's reserve floor on Saturday's Raider's cup game
The American Phil Mikkelson (Phil Mickelson) will set a record on Sunday by playing his 47th Raider's cup game match match, but he will need to change his strategy to avoid the turn of events.
Michaelson, who has already participated in the two-year-old championship every 12 years, Captain Jim Furiks (Jim Furyk) sat on the reserve floor for four games on Saturdays and two couples.
Instead of being in the centre of action as often as it has been in connection with the US teams, the fifth winner divided his day by acting both as a supporter and participating in his game with the hope of correcting what he is learning.
Since the 48-year-old golfer has never been the most accurate player even on the top of his career, he is not the most suitable candidate for the tight fight "Le Golf National" in an unparalleled field where inaccurate gossip is regularly punished.
And if the game itself is not scary enough, on Sunday's ninth match, Mikelson will fight the precise British winner of the French Molinari, who has joined forces with young Tommy Fleetwood to win every four matches this week.
If four-point Americans, starting with 12 single-game cats, are successfully guided, Mikelson’s sword could play a decisive role.
Farik expressed his conviction that he was a member of the team.
"He fully understood his role today, spread me over my back, applied his hand to me and said he would be ready tomorrow," said Furik.
"He is very sure of himself.
He is an excellent athlete who gave so much to these teams earlier and also this week.
I don't think I'd have imagined him playing in two cats.
I imagined more, but everything went wrong the way it went, and we'll figure it out.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else."
Mikelson will hand over the Nick Faldo record in connection with the most played men in the Raider Cup fight on Sunday.
This could mark the end of the Raider Cup career that it never really coincided with his individual record heights.
Mikelson has won 18 victories, has suffered 20 losses and seven undisputed games, although Furik claimed that his presence gave the team some of the benefits of the non-material nature.
"He's funny, sarcastic and intelligent, he likes to be concerned about people, and he's a great teammate," he explained.
"I think the younger players also liked to kiss her this week, which was fun to watch.
He provides a lot more than just a game."
European Selection Captain Thomas Bjorn (Thomas Bjorn) knows that a significant turnout can be quickly eliminated
From experience, European Selection Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a major step forward in the fight for Raider's helmets in the last day's single game can easily turn into an unpleasant situation.
Danis won five points over the Americans in 1997 in Valderram, where the team of opponents, the captain of the Sive Ballesteros, won five points over the Americans, but only now went on the finish line with a very small point over, namely, winning with 1411⁄2-1311⁄2.
"You continue to remind yourself that we were very much in the direction of Valderram; we were in the direction of Brooklyn, where we lost, and Valderram, where we won, but only with a small majority," said Bjorn (in the picture), looking at the 2018 release group's victory with 5-3 on Friday and yesterday, in the direction of the 10-6 golf course "Le Golf National.
Thus, history will show both to me and to every member of its team that nothing has ended.
Tomorrow you'll give up everything.
Go to the field and show your best performance!
This will not end until the points obtained on the screen are visible.
Our goal is to get this trophy and we will focus on it.
I have always said that we have concentrated on 12 players on our side, but we are very well aware of what is on the other side of us — the world's greatest players."
In light of what his players showed in the golf course, Bjorn remarked: "I have never enjoyed myself.
There are new challenges to be faced tomorrow.
Individual games are scheduled tomorrow, and it is quite another thing.
It is great if, at times when everything goes well, you have a partner with you, but in individual games your golfer skills are fully checked.
This message should give you to your players, that is, that they give everything in the next day's game.
Now you leave your partner, and he must also be able to show his best performance."
Unlike Bjorn opponent team captain Jim Furiks will watch his players show their best performance in individual games rather than in partner games. The exception is only Jordan Spyth and Justin Thomas, who won three points from four.
Furiks himself has played on both sides of these important last days’ tournaments – both as part of the winning team in Brussels and later as a result of the European team’s sensational success, which is later known as Miracle at Medina.
"I look forward to every condemned word," he said, responding to how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 team captain, joined his players in the last day's fight.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you'd like to get into the quick shot that you've experienced in Brooklyn, which you've experienced in Medina.
When such impulse is broadcast in one direction, it creates great pressure for mid-stage games.
We created our own composition, and we made the guys look right to us. We'll try to do some magic tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of attempting to control the attack, and he joined Rory McIlroy in the main game and European Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter in the first part.
"I've got guys in this order, because I think it's the best thing to do during the tournament," Bjorn said about the selected single players.
Retired transfer of the new German fleet into operation
The German fleet's latest fleet had to be put into operation in 2014, thus replacing the older Cold War War warships, but it will not happen at least until next year due to the faulty system and increasing costs, the local media reported.
The transfer of the main ship "Rheinland-Pfalz" from Baden-Virtemberg’s cargo class is now delayed until the first half of 2019, reported in Die Zeit newspaper, quoting the military representative.
The ship had to join the car fleet in 2014, but the unpleasant post-ship problems had an impact on the fate of the vast project.
Four vessels of the Baden-Virtemberg class, ordered by the car fleet in 2007 will replace the old Bremen class fleets.
It is expected that they will be equipped with a powerful spacecraft, a series of anti-air and anti-ship rockets, as well as some secret technologies such as a reduction in the reception of radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other essential features include longer maintenance periods — the possibility of placing new freights up to two years away from the ports in which they are registered.
However, the constant delay is that the latest technology warships, which would allow Germany to demonstrate its power in overseas countries, have already grown old by the time it comes into operation, notes "Die Zeit".
Last year the F125 failed frigate was known in all headings when the German fleet officially refused to ship in operation and sent it back to the shipyard "Blohm & Voss" in Hamburg.
This was the first time the fleet returned to the shipyard after delivery.
There was little knowledge of the reasons for this step, but the German media mentioned several important "software and equipment defects", which would render warships useless if used in the fight mission.
The lack of software was a particularly important factor since boats of the Baden-Virtemberg class are operating around 120 large crews, which are only half of the older crew of the Bremen class.
It also showed that the ship has too much weight, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the fleet to improve it in the future.
It is considered that the 7000 tonnes heavy ship Rhineland-Pfalz is twice as heavy as the similar class ships used by Germany during World War II.
In addition to the wrong equipment, the cost of all the project (including crew training) was also a major problem.
Its costs amounted to EUR 3.1 billion instead of EUR 2.2 billion originally planned.
The problems associated with the new freight are becoming particularly important, given recent warnings that the German maritime forces will be reduced.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, acknowledged that the car fleet is really "starting to miss the ship to be used".
The official claimed that over time this problem has been significantly exacerbated, since old ships are being withdrawn from service but no new ones are being delivered instead.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Virtemberg class freighters joined the car fleet.
"National Trust" listens to the life of secret birds
The new study carried out in some property of the hill of Scotland is aimed at discovering how bats use the screen during the food search process.
It is expected that the findings will introduce new clarity on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and will help them in their protection measures in the future.
The Scottish "National Trust" scientists in Invereves Gardens in Westeros will study punuristic birds, pigmentary birds, as well as brown pineapples and waterless birds.
Special entrants will be located in the main premises, which will track the activities of bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys using hand detectors.
The sound experts shall analyse all records to determine the frequency of avian callee and of the species carrying out the specific activities.
The biotopes map and report will then be developed to create a detailed view of the landscape reflecting the behaviour of birds.
NTS Nature Protection Advisor Rob Dewar (Rob Dewar) hopes that the results will reveal which habitat areas are the most important for bats and how each species is used.
This information will help to identify the benefits of biotope management activities such as the establishment of the dams and how best to preserve forests for turtles and other related species.
During the last century, the population of bats in Scotland and the United Kingdom has fallen significantly.
These lands are threatened by construction and development works that affect the loss of their shelter and habitat.
Wind generators and lighting can also pose a risk, as can shell paper and some building materials, as well as cat attacks.
Actually, wings are not blind.
However, because of the presence of their footing hunting, their ear is more useful than their eyes during hunting.
They use a complex method to determine the location of the support to find insects and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76 000 hectares of land management across the country, is very serious about the problem of bats.
The organisation has ten trained experts who regularly carry out surveys, inspection of bats and sometimes even rescue work.
The organisation has even set up the first and only reserve for shrimps in Scotland owned by "Threave" in Damfris and Galova, where eight of the ten species of shrimps found in Scotland will be planted.
The property manager David Thompson (David Thompson) claims that this area is ideally suited for birds.
"Here's a great place for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and generally suitable biotopes.
But there are still a lot of things we don't know about birds, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us better understand what they need to survive."
He emphasises that it is important to check whether birds will not be accommodated in the place concerned before the maintenance of the property is carried out, as it may happen that, because of the unknown destruction of one mother’s shelter, up to 400 mothers and their babies are killed, it is possible to destroy the entire local population.
The birds are protected animals, and they must not be killed, killed, killed, disturbed or destroyed.
The staff of the Scottish Bat Conservation Trust (Bat Conservation Trust) Elizabeth Ferela (Elisabeth Ferrell) has called on the company to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about bats, and we just don't know how they look."
Ronaldo rejects the appeal by ordering lawyers to sue the German Journal
Christian Ronald (Christian Ronaldo) has condemned him in the defamation of his charges as "bad news", claiming that people "want to pay attention to themselves", using his name.
Her lawyers have been ordered to sue the German news magazine "Der Spiegel", which published these claims.
The Portuguese and Turkish football star Juventus is accused of defeating American Kathryn Majorg (Kathryn Mayorg) in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is claimed that he paid the woman $375 000 to keep her silent about the incident, it was reported on Friday by Der Spiegel.
A few hours after the statement by Ronald, 33, using Instagram's online video, he turned to his 142 million followers, calling this information "bad news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they've said today is false news," said Ballon d'Or, a successful winner of the Ballon d'Or award.
"They want to become famous using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous for my name, which is part of my work.
I'm a happy person, and everything's good," laughing at the player.
According to the information provided by "Reuters", Ronald's lawyers are preparing to appeal to the court the journal "Der Spiegel" about the statements they have made about "inadmissible reporting on suspicion in the field of basic privacy".
The lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player would claim compensation for "moral damage to the extent that corresponds to the severity of the infringement which may be one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
This incident occurred in June 2009 in the hotel "Palms Hotel and Casino" "Suite" class room in Las Vegas.
According to the documents submitted to the Court of Justice of the state of Nevada, Ronald and Majorg went back to the hotel number of the player where he had won the woman.
Majorga claims that after that incident Ronaldi fell on his way and said that there was "by 99 percent "good boy", but that he fell into this "one percent" trap.
According to the information contained in the documents, Ronald confirmed that the couple had had sex, but it happened after a bilateral agreement.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police and had taken photographs of the injuries she suffered in the hospital, but later she agreed to an outlaw settlement because she felt "feeled from the activism" and worried about "public humiliation".
A 34-year-old woman claims that she no longer wants to accept the terms of this agreement, as the incident left a lasting trauma.
At the time of these statements, Ronald was about to move from Manchester United to Real Madrid, but this summer for 100 million euros, he moved to the Italian Grand Juventus.
Brexit: The loss of "for all time sorry" car manufacturers in the United Kingdom
"The United Kingdom "will regret it forever if after Brexit it loses its position as world leader in the production of cars," said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
Their concern is that Toyota UK has announced to BBC that if Britain withdraws from the EU without agreement, it will temporarily stop production near the existing factory of Burnaston in Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese auto manufacturer said that delays at the borders in the case of Brexit could be put to work without agreement.
In the last year, the Toyota plant produced almost 150 000 cars, 90% of which were exported to other Member States of the European Union.
"I think that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production in our factory will be stopped," said Toyota, Managing Director of Burnaston Marvin Cooke (Marvin Cooke).
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have decided to withdraw from the EU without a contract and how cross-border trade will work.
For example, BMW claims to close its mini factory in Oxford after Brexit for a month.
According to car manufacturers, the main concerns are the threatened supply chain if no agreement is reached after Brexit.
Toyota's production line works according to the principle of "split time", where cars manufactured on order are available from both the UK and EU suppliers every 37 minutes.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be obstacles at the border that could lead to some delays and shortcomings.
According to Toyota, it would not be possible to hold more than one day's worth of inventory at its Dürbijshire plant, so production would have to be stopped.
Mr Clarke said that the Chequers Plan for future relations with the EU, developed by Theresa Mejas (Theresa May), is "precisely calculated to avoid such border checks".
"We need an agreement. We want to reach the best agreement that would allow, as I would say, not only to benefit at this moment, but also to use this opportunity," he said in the BBC Radio 4 programme "Today".
"Adequate this not only from Toyota," but also from other producers, is that we must be able to fully pursue a very successful supply chain strategy."
Toyota could not state how long production could be stopped, but warned that long-term increased costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately threaten jobs.
Peter Tsuvalaris (Peter Tsuvallaris), who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and has been working in the factory as a Union merger coordinator, said that his members felt more and more concerned: "I can say from experience that once a job is lost, it will not return."
The government representative said: "We have presented a precise and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU."
Trampa meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again, White House reports
Donald Trampa's important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein (Rod Rosenstein) can be "remained for another week" because the fight with the Supreme Court judge's candidate Bret Kaveno continues, it reported the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein monitors the link between the funds used by Trampa and Russia, as well as the possible violation of the rule of law by the President, by Special Adviser Robert Miller (Robert Mueller), who investigates the interference of the Russian will.
For months now, Washington has been considering whether Trump will resign the Deputy Attorney General and thus threaten Miller's independence.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed entering the negotiations with Tramp and the possibility of replacing the President with Amendment 25.
Rosenstein denied this information.
On the last Monday, however, he went to the White House, where he spoke up about his resignation.
Instead, we were notified of a Thursday meeting with Tramp, which was currently in the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Tramps said that "better" I would not give up Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a coincidence with the hearing of the Senate's judicial committee, which showed both Kaveno and one of the women who accused him of committing sexual misconduct — Dr. Kristine Bleisija Forda.
On Friday, Tramps had the FBI investigate for weeks in connection with Kaveno's allegations, continuing to delay the Senate's vote.
Trampa Press Secretary Sarah Sanders visited Fox News Sunday.
She said about Rosenstein's meeting: "The date of the meeting has not yet been set, it could be this week or a week longer, taking into account all the cases that are taking place around the Supreme Court.
But we will see that, and I always want to inform the press about the news."
Some reporters dispute this claim: Sandersa has not held a White House press briefing since September 10.
The leader, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sandersa said that the lack of letters is not related to the unfavorable attitude towards the TV reporter "flavoured," although she added, "I reject the fact that they are famous."
She then proposed direct contact between Tramp, which would increase the interest of the press.
"The President took more part in the questions and answers sessions than any president before him," she said, and without giving any further information, she remarked: "We are interested in the number."
Sandersa said that the briefings would still take place, but, "if the press were to be able to ask the President of the United States questions uninterruptedly, it would certainly be better than talking to me.
We are trying to do a lot of it, and you see that we have done it in the last few weeks, and it will happen instead of a press briefing when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Tramps regularly answer questions by leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or press conferences that visit important people.
Individual press conferences are rarely held.
The president may have demonstrated his reasons this week in New York, focusing on the uncontrollable efforts of reporters and at times a strange expression.
Minister of Health writes to EU staff in Scotland NHS about fears associated with Brexit
The Minister of Health has written to EU staff working in the Scottish National Health Service (NHS) to express their gratitude and delay their endurance after Brexit.
Gina Freeman (Jane Freeman) sent a letter less than six months before the United Kingdom left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to covering the costs of permanent status applications for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In his letter, Fremena wrote: "The negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU continued during the summer on the withdrawal, leading to the decisions expected this autumn.
However, the UK Government is also preparing for the possible scenario if no agreement was reached.
I know this is a very restless time for you.
Therefore, I would like to stress again how much I appreciated the involvement of each employee regardless of their nationality.
Members from both the EU and outside it provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health care service and benefit our care patients and communities.
Scotland is definitely your home, and we very much want you to stay here."
After a head trauma, Kristen Abercrombie undergoes an emergency operation
In Tennessee, for the protection of Christian Abercrombie (Christion Abercrombie) the state of Tigers, an emergency operation was carried out after a head trauma that he won in a Saturday game, with a result of 31-27 access to "Vanderbilt Commodores", reported sports reporter "Tennesean" Mike Organs.
In Tennessee, the state team’s chief coach, Rod Reed, told reporters that the trauma was caused shortly before noon.
"He came to the side line and said it was broken," said Ryd.
While Abercrombie was on the side line, the coach and medical staff handed him oxygen, then put him on the bench and delivered him to the next investigation.
One of the state officials in Tennessee told the reporter Chris Harris, in Tennessee, that Abercrombie was operated at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
Harris added that in the meantime "no information about the type of trauma" and the state team in Tennessee was trying to understand when the trauma occurred.
Abercrombie, the Red Crescent Representative, is in his first season after Ilonise's replacement against the state team in Tennessee.
Before leaving the Saturday game, he had made a total of five blocks, which made up a total of 18.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher national fee when buying property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher national fee when buying property in the United Kingdom and the additional funds obtained will be used to help homeless people in accordance with the new Tory plan.
This will neutralise Corbin's efforts to attract new voters.
The increased national tax will apply to persons who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
The national cash fund provides that up to 120 million pounds can be collected per year to provide assistance to homeless people.
A higher national fee will be applied to foreign buyers when buying property in the United Kingdom and turning aside the funds they have received to provide assistance to homeless people, it will today notify Teresa Meja.
Such a step is considered to be an attempt to neutralise Jeremy Corbin's efforts to attract new voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and speaking to the more affluent part of society.
The increased national tax will be applied to persons and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, in addition to the money they receive, to the government’s efforts to combat the problem of homeless people.
The premium included in the current national levy, including the application of a higher level of charge imposed two years ago for the purchase and purchase of another dwelling for renting, could be even three per cent.
The national cash fund provides that such a step may complement its budget to up to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of London’s newly built property is acquired by non-residents, thus raising prices and making it difficult for first-time buyers to get to their home.
Many wealthy countries, especially in the capital, have become "pocket cities" due to the large number of foreign buyers, most of their time spent outside the country.
The new policy was introduced only a few weeks after Boris Johnson (Boris Johnson) called for a reduction in the national tax so that more new people could be allowed to buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high real estate prices while burying the land, but not using it, and encouraged Ms. Mejas to give up quotas for affordable housing in order to address the problem of British housing.
Mr Korbina has proposed a number of attractive house reform, including a reform on rent control and leaving the house for no reason.
He also wants to give the Council more powers for the construction of new houses.
Ms Mejas said: "Last year I mentioned that I would use my Prime Minister's position to restore the British dream of a better quality of life for every new generation.
And that means organizing our beloved housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work and set up their lives.
However, it is not right that dwellings can be bought as easily as foreign companies and people who do not live in the United Kingdom.
Many dreams about their home have become too far away, and the problem of homeless people is still up to date."
Jack Ross: "My biggest goal is to run Scotland."
The leader of Sunderland, Jack Ross, claims that his greatest goal is to become the leader of Scotland at some point.
Scott, 42, has taken the challenge of restoring the North East Club, which is now taking third place in the first league with three points from the top.
This evening he went to the Stadium of Light after St. Mirren's return to Scotland's prime minister last season.
"As a player I wanted to play for my country.
I got box B, and that's all," Scott's BBC broadcast Sportsound said Ross.
"But I grew up, together with my father looking at Scotland's games in Hampden Park, and it's always called me back.
However, such an opportunity would only appear if I were successful in running the club."
Rosa's predecessor is Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Alardys, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Guss Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former leader of Alloa Athletic claims that he has not felt concerned following so many well-known leaders in the footsteps of the club, before rejecting the offers made by Barnsley and Ipsviča.
"My achievements will now be assessed as to whether I can return to this club's prime minister.
Because of the structure and opportunities of this club, it certainly fits the prime minister," he said.
"Returning the club to the prime minister will not be an easy task, but I will probably think that I will only succeed here when this task is accomplished."
Ross is only in his third year in his career, some time ago acting as Deputy Director in Dumbarton and spending a 15-month period in the composition of Hearts coaches.
He then helped the club Alloa recover from falling to third level and in the same season helped St Mirren to win the championship title.
Ross claims that he now feels much more comfortable than his player's career in clubs "Clyde", "Hartlepool", "Falkirk", "St Mirren" and "Hamilton Academic".
"That might have been a real crossroads," he recalls, taking responsibility for "Alloa."
"I really believed that management was my true call – much more suitable than playing.
It seems strange, for I have made good progress, and I have been able to live and enjoy certain heights as well.
However, playing can be difficult.
You have to go through a lot of things every week.
I still feel it because of the stress and the pressure involved, but management is my field.
I've always wanted to drive and now I'm doing it. It seems that I'm in the right place, I don't feel so good all my life."

The survey found that the best time to enjoy the pineapple is at 5:30 p.m. on Saturday evening
The summer heat wave has left Britain's less popular circles to collapse, but it has increased the pressure on restaurant chains.
The aggregated data showed that sales of goods and bars increased by 2.7 per cent in July, but they decreased by 4.8 per cent in restaurants.
Peter Martin, representing a business consulting agency of the CGA, which collected data, said: "Continual solar time and participation in the World Cup campaign in England meant that in July there was a similar trend as in June, i.e. the profit of the round had increased by 2.8 per cent, while the restaurants suffered a fall.
Restaurants, with a fall in sales in June of 1.8 percent, experienced an even more difficult situation in July.
The situation in the bars and bars was most grateful because they experienced much higher altitudes than the restaurants experienced downhills.
Food-based gangs are also hard from the sun, but not as dramatic as restaurant workers felt.
It seemed that people simply wanted to go out for a drink.
In cows and berries, the market for beverages increased by 6.6 per cent per month, while the market for food decreased by 3 per cent."
RSM leisure and hospitality analyst Paul Newman (Paul Newman) said: "These results continue the trend seen at the end of April.
The circumstances and the impact of broad social or sport measures are the main factors that determine trade outside the home market.
It is not surprising that the groups of restaurants continue to fight, although the drop in sales of 4,8 per cent compared to the period of the previous year will be particularly painful for additional non-lethal costs.
With regard to food suppliers in the long and hot summer, it was not possible to arrive at an even more inappropriate time, and the time will indicate whether a more moderate temperature, normally experienced in August, would provide the necessary space."
The overall increase in sales between shops and restaurants, including in new companies, reached 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting a decrease in sales volume of brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker, which is the sales monitor for the UK’s freight, bar and restaurant sector, collects and analyzes the data of the 47 working groups where the total turnover exceeds 9 billion pounds, and this is the industry’s criterion.
Every fifth child has a secret social media account it hides from his parents
The survey reveals that every fifth child, some of whom are only 11 years old, has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents and teachers.
The survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a false increase in Instagram’s pages.
This information raised concerns about the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they have a "main" account to show their parents.
Every fifth child, some of whom are only 11 years old, is a social media account that they hide from adults.
In an interview involving 20,000 high school students, Instagram has shown that the number of false profiles is increasing rapidly.
This information raised concerns about the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of students mentioned that they have a "clean main" account to show their parents and also private accounts.
A mother who attacked her 13 - year - old daughter’s secret site discovered a teenager who encouraged others to beat her.
A study conducted by the Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Independent School Leaders (HMC) revealed that 40 percent of the 11-18-year-olds had two profiles, and only half of them recognized that they maintained private accounts.
HMC leader Mike Buchanan said: "It's scary that so many teenagers have online profiles where parents and teachers can't find them."
Elida Doila will be "lighted voice" in the Scottish Board of Lightweights
The annual meeting of the Board of Eilid Doyle was elected by the Scottish Executive Board as Director without the right of the Executive.
Doila is Scotland's most award-winning space and outer space lighthouse, and President Ian Bytie (Ian Beattie) described this step as an excellent opportunity for those who are driven by sport to use her wide experience at international level for the last ten years.
"The elite is highly respected throughout the whole of Scotland, the United Kingdom and the world, in the lightletics community, and we are convinced that Scotland will easily gain tremendous amounts by participating in its board," said Beatys.
Doila said, "I would like to act as a "light voice" and I hope that I can really get involved and help drive this sport into Scotland."

It was a terrible job, but I recovered completely, learned to walk again, and today I can do business training!
Thank you for the inspiring words!"
Indications about breast milk pump advertising that compares mothers to cows
The breast milk pumping company has taken care of shared views online in relation to an advertising where nursing mothers are compared to cattle feeding.
In order to mark the release of the so-called "first silent breast pump" into circulation, the consumer technology company Elvie has launched a sticky meal advertisement to demonstrate the freedom that the new pump provides to breast-feeding mothers.
Four real mothers dance with a wall-filled cow at a song whose words sound like, "Yes, I hear myself, but you don't see any aces" and "if you don't notice, they're not deaf, they're my breast".
The addition continues: "Send, send, I feed the young, send, send, I praise my ladies."
However, the advertisement published on the Facebook page of the company has called for a broad resonance online.
77,000 times and hundreds of times the video commented on has been received by shared viewers, and many claim that it highlights the "shocks" of the milk industry in the light.
"It is a very wrong decision to use cows for advertising.
Just as we, as they, to produce milk, have to become difficult and have to be born, but their babies are being taken away from them a few days after they were born," wrote one.
"Elvie" breast milk pump is inextricably included in breast-feeding women (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment states: "I understand that it is traumatic for both mother and child.
But why not use them to advertise breast milk pumps to mothers who can keep their babies?"
The view was also expressed: "Advertising creators didn't know what they were doing."
Others advocated advertising, and a woman admitted that she thought the song was "sympathetic".
"I think it's an excellent idea.
I'd buy it if I were still breast-feeding.
The milking made me feel just like a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I understand her idea.
This is a great product," they wrote.
Another comment states: "It is fun advertising for mothers who cancel milk (nurse at work or in toilets) and feel like "bovine".
It is not advertising that celebrates or condemns the milk industry."
At the end of the advertisement, a group of women discovered that they were all dancing with non - falling pumps placed in their breasts.
The concept of the campaign is based on the observation that many women who break up their milk claim to feel like a cow.
However, the Elvie Pump pump is completely quiet, it has no pipes and pipes, and it does not necessarily fit into the breast of breast-feeding women, allowing them to move freely, keep babies and even participate in activities outside the home.
Anna Balarin (Anna Balarin) "Mother" partner and creative director, commented: "Elvie Pump" is such a revolutionary product that it deserves bold and provocative marketing.
We wanted to draw attention to the elimination of milk, while at the same time demonstrating the sense of freedom of expression that the new pump will bring, in a fun and understandable way."
It's not the first time the Elvie pump has come to the center of attention.
Two children’s mothers showed up in London’s Fashion Week at Marta Jakubovska (Marta Jakubowski) when using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children's silences moved to the Texas border
The number of children detained migrants has risen rapidly, although the borders of each month cross relatively the same number of people as before, and have partly been reached by the rhetoric and policy of the Trampa administration, which has made it difficult to accommodate children with sponsors.
Usually the majority of the sponsors have also been immigrants themselves without documents, fearing that openly claiming to take the child will endanger their ability to stay in the country.
The risk increased in June when federal officials announced that potential sponsors and other members of their household would have to allow fingerprints to be removed and this data would also be transferred to other immigration-related institutions.
Last week, Matthew Albence, the senior officer of immigration and customs law enforcement, before the congress, showed that the agency had arrested ten people who had applied for non-sponsored minors.
The Agency subsequently confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested had not been previously punished.
"Almost 80 percent of those who are either sponsors or homeowners are illegally staying here, and a large proportion of these are foreign criminals.
That is why we continue to follow such persons," Mr Albens said.
According to the asylum officials, when trying to deal with children's cases more quickly, officials have introduced new rules which provide that some of them will have to be brought before the court within a month of detention rather than 60 days as provided for by the previous standard.
Many will take advantage of the videoconferencing call instead of going personally to defend their legal status before the immigration judge.
Persons who will be considered unfit for exemption will be expelled quickly.
The longer children are held in custody, the more likely they will become uneasy or depressed, which may lead to violent attacks or attempts to escape, the information provided by asylum workers and the evidence obtained from the system during the last months has been reported.
The lawyers argued that these concerns would be reinforced in larger objects, such as Tornillo, where signs that the child is suffering are more often overlooked because of their wideness.
They added that moving children to a tent city, not having enough time to prepare them for emotional preparation or to allow them to leave their friends, could cause injuries that many are already struggling with.
Syria forces US, French and Turkish "occupiers' armies" to immediately execute its forces
Turning to the UN General Assembly, Minister for Foreign Affairs Valid al-Moualems (Walid al-Moualem) also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country's war has been in progress for the past eight years.
Moualem, who also serves as Deputy Prime Minister, claimed that foreign forces are illegal in Syria, defending the fight against terrorism and "will be dealt with accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he told the assembly.
Moualems argued that in Syria, where more than 360 000 people and millions of people have died since 2011, they have been forced to leave their homes, "the fight against terrorism has almost ended".
He announced that Damascus would continue to "fight the holy war until all Syrian territories are cleared", purified from both terrorist groups and "any foreign military presence".
The United States of America has deployed approximately 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and consulting both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs, who are opponents of President Bashar Al Asada.
France has sent more than 1,000 men to this war - torn country.
With regard to the issue of refugees, Mualems announced that the conditions were great for them to return and blamed "the individual Western countries" for "the spread of Iraqi fears" as a result of which refugees do not want to return.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate this return," he said.
"These people are politicizing what should only be a humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not receive assistance to rebuild the country before agreement on the end of the war will be reached between Asad and the opposition.
The United Nations diplomats explain that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone based on the latest dumping in Idlib (Idlib) has created an opportunity to accelerate political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkey Agreement has prevented the large-scale attacks by the Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province of three million people.
However, Moualems stressed that the agreement "is a certain time frame", and expressed the hope that the military action will be directed against the jihadists, including fighters from the Al-Qaeda-related group "Jabhat al Nusrah", which "will be destroyed".
UN Messenger Staffan de Mistura (Staffan de Mistura) hopes to convene soon the new committees, which include government and opposition representatives, first meetings to develop the post-war Syrian Constitution and pave the way for elections.
Moualems laid down the conditions for the participation of the Syrian State in the Committee, stressing that the work of the group would be limited to the "review of the existing Constitution" and warned of the intervention.
Why Tramps will be elected for a second time
From this point of view, Mr Trampa will be re-elected in 2020, unless, and possibly, many liberal observers, impeachment and scandal, are expected to give his presidency an early stage.
And then, "it will be the most dramatic final of the presidency all the time!"
At present, there is no evidence of decommissioning.
Since 2014, ratings have been more than doubled in the most favourable CNN radio time, reaching 1.05 million viewers, but MSNBC has almost tripled to 1.6 million viewers.
Fox News is looking at 2.4 million viewers in the most favorable broadcast time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, Nielsen informs the company, while MSNBC "The Rachel Maddow Show" (Reichelas Medovas show) is at the top of the cable TV rating with 3.5 million main news viewers in the evening.
"It is a fire that attracts many people because it is an incomprehensible thing for us," explained Neal Baer, the support of the ABC drama "Designed Survivor." This drama is told about the secretary of the cabinet of ministers, who becomes president after the attack is destroyed.

To some extent, chaos is fun.
Of course, unlike the rest of the TV you see, news from Washington could determine what will happen with the Rue v. Veida case, whether immigrant families can get together, and the global economy.
Ignorance is a beauty that can only be allowed by the most privileged observers.
And yet this is more than being informed to the citizen when at six o'clock we look at the expert group's discussion of how Bob Woodward (Bob Woodward) has used unspecified sources of information for his book Fair, Pola Manafort (Paul Manafort) $15,000 worth of bomber jackets from sharp colors and leather ("the cloth from which the smell is high," said "Washington Post") and what role Stormy Daniels (Stormy Daniels) will play, in other words, in the anatomical detail description.
I, for example, will never press Super Mario again as before.
"Part of what he does that creates the impression of reality show is that he surrounds you with information every day," Brent Montgomery (Brent Montgomery), CEO of the Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of the show "Pawn Stars" explained about the variable team of the Trampa show and the daily turns (sweet with the celebration of N.F.L., Kima Čenna).

"I remember the time when we made all those crazy shows and when people said that "it's the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleis told me.
"I think it's such a joke, but it turns out they were right."

Money from abroad comes into the pre-election campaigns of some of Parliament's most pressing interim elections
It is no wonder that the 17th Congressional Region is seeking money through the transformation of Congressian regions, which will result in the fight for one place by the two existing Members.
This recently changed Pittsburgh nomadic area is linked to Democratic Representative Conor Lembo (Conor Lamb), who won his place in the special elections last spring in another region.
Lembs will fight another Member, the Republican of Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing some 12 areas of Pennsylvania, which are largely covered by the new 17th.
After the decision of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January that the old areas were unconstitutionally distributed for the benefit of the Republicans, the maps were recast.
Competition in the new 17th area has led to the fight between the party's main financial groups: the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee and the National Republican Campaign Committee.
Lembs became known in Pennsylvania when he won with a small majority of the March elections held in the 18th Congressional Assembly in Pennsylvania.
The Republicans had held this place for more than 10 years, and President Donald Trumps won 20 points in this area.
Political experts provide for a small majority of Democrats.
The US considered Salvadoran punishment for China's support, but then thought
The diplomats acknowledged that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognised Beijing without much pressure from the Washington side.
Mr. Trampa had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and he stayed at the hotel in Panama until the partners left behind the Trampa management team.
The officials of the State Department decided to withdraw the diplomatic missions of the United States from Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama, on the basis of a "new decision no longer to recognise Taiwan", his department’s representative Hitter Nauerte (Heather Nauert) indicated in a statement earlier this month.
However, the penalties were considered to apply only to Salvador, which received around 140 million dollars from the United States in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which would include reducing financial assistance and limiting targeted visas, would be painful for the Central American country where unemployment and deaths have reached the highest level.
During the internal meetings, North American and Central American officials held a high-level conference, which focused on security and economic well-being and which followed a similar meeting last year, which was recognised as an attempt to prevent migrants from moving to the United States.
In mid-September, the senior officials of the state made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, essentially ending the considerations of punishing Salvador.
The diplomats informed that Vice-President Mike Pence has now decided to participate in the planned conference in mid-October to show how serious the administration is stressing the meeting.
And three American ambassadors returned quietly to Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new and serious statements or sentences from Washington.
The White House representative, speaking on behalf of Mr Bolton, did not want to provide more information on the debates described by three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss in the internal negotiations if their anonymity is preserved.
His story was confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration, who also spoke on condition that his anonymity would be preserved.
History study
The second stone garden could have been the report by Special Prosecutor Robert Miller (Robert Mueller) that Mr Trampa may have hindered justice, which has very much evidence in society.
It is claimed that Mr Miller will also examine whether the Trappa campaign has secretly cooperated with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If a second party gets the upper hand at Congress, Trappam will have to respond to this structure and perhaps also to the jury of his fellow members at the moment he is about to meet with the voters again.
There is a lot of 'but' and I do not claim that the fall of the Trap is inevitable or that it will happen to his fellow citizens in Europe.
There are choices that will have to be made for all of us on both sides of the Atlantic, and these choices will show the duration of the fight.
In 1938 the German officers were ready to turn against Hitler, unless the West had opposed him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We get out and let go of the opportunity to avoid blood clots for years.
History revolves around such turning points, and the unstoppable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans now have to face a number of such turning points.
What will we do if Mr. Trampa resigns General Rod Rosenstein, a man who controls the fate of Mr. Miller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has had a hard time since it was reported that last year he proposed secretly to register with the president and thought about his inadequacies.
Mr Rosenstein claims that the "The Times" story is not accurate.
"How do we answer if the FBI's investigation into Brett Caveno is not complete or honest or if he will be approved by the Supreme Court judge in spite of his unjust testimony and credible allegations in sexual assault?
And what is the most important thing, will we vote in the interim vote of Congress, which will call the Tramp on responsibility?
If we do not endure all these tests, democracy will take a long winter.
However, I believe that we will do everything in our power to respond to what we have learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was sent to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once hid in my missionary home.

"Rangers" star Grems Dorans (Graham Dorrans) feels optimistic about the fight against Vienna's Rapid
"Rangers" will take place on Thursday at Vienna Rapid, knowing that victory over the Austrians after an impressive undecided game in Spain with "Villarreal" earlier this month will allow them to take a stable position to qualify from the Group of the European League G.
The road trauma did not allow the centre's attacker Graham Dorans to resume his participation in the season until the undisputed result with 2:2 with "Villarreal", but he believes that "Rangers" can use this result as a trampline to achieve more.
"We're happy about it because "Villarreal" is a good team," said 31-year-old footballer.
"We went to the game to believe that we could make good progress, and we got this point.
We may have been able to accomplish them at the end, but in general there is a good result.
They may have been better in the first half, but we had left in the second half and were a better team.
And on Thursday there will be another important night for Europe.
Hopefully, we will get three points, but it will not be an easy game, because they won a good result in the previous game, but I am sure that with the help of our supporters we will be able to continue to fight and get good results.
Last year, with all my injuries and changes in the club itself, it was obviously hard, but now there are new colds that I can feel.
The team is great, and the guys enjoy it; training is good.
I hope that we will be able to continue our fight, leave the past season behind and succeed."
Women cannot sleep because they are worried about their pension charges
Although the respondents were well - aware of the care they wanted to receive, there were few who had discussed the matter with family members.
Approximately half of the individuals in the national study indicated that they were not talking to a spouse about the long-term cost of care.
Only 10 percent replied that they had discussed it with their children.
"People want family members to take care of them, but they don't do anything to talk about it," says Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the National Life Insurance Agency.
Here's what we should start with.
Talk to your spouse and your children. You cannot prepare your family for you will need care if you do not know your wishes well before.
Communicate with your consultant and family to discuss where and how to get care, as these options can be an important factor for determining costs.
Involve your financial consultant. Your consultant can also help you figure out how to cover these costs.
Your ability to provide long-term care funding can include traditional long-term care insurance policy, hybrid insurance policy with a cash amount to cover these costs or also security through your property, the main thing for you to have money.
Draw up your legal documents. Avoid legal struggles before they begin.
Talk about the health of authorised persons so that you can be a reliable person who will monitor your health care and ensure that specialists act in accordance with your wishes if you are unable to express them in your own strength.
Consider also the possibility of giving financial powers.
Choose a reliable person to make financial decisions on your behalf, who will take care of paying your bills if you are unable to do so by your own strength.
And don't forget the seemingly small details! Imagine that one of your parents is being taken to a hospital to get emergency help.

A man shot several times with an air shot in Ilfracombe (Ilfracombe)
The man received several shots with an air rifle going home at night.
The 40-year-old sufferer was found in Ilfracombe Oxford Park (Oxford Grove), Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and lungs.

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to government information, at least 384 people have been killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that claimed the city of Palus, Indonesia, on Friday.
Because of the decommissioned communications, rescuers have not been able to obtain any information from the Dongala (Dongala) area, which is located north of Pala and is closer to the epicenter of 7.5 magnetic waters.
More than 16,000 people in Paul’s day were evacuated after a natural disaster.
Here is the basic information about Pala and Dongal, located on the island of Slaves:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi and is located at the end of the narrow lake on the west side of the island of Sulawesi. It is estimated that 379 800 people lived there in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary of the earthquake and tsunami.
Dongala is an area about 300 km (180 miles) along the north-west coast of the island of Sulawesi.
It is estimated that in 2017, 299 200 people lived in the region of the province.
Fishing and agriculture is the support of the province's economy, especially in the coastal region of Dongal.
The production of nickel also plays an important role in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morovali, Sulavesi on the other side.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Prevention Agency, over the past 100 years, Paul and Dongal have suffered several times from tsunami.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and devastated hundreds of buildings in Dongal.
Cunami also gasped over the West Dongal in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in a six - activated Pacific fire ring, where earthquakes occur regularly.
Here are some of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake in the north of Sumatra on the west coast of the province of Aceh caused a tsunami on 26 December, which struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean Coast line, more than half of which were in Aceh.
2005: a series of powerful earthquake hit the western coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias (Nia) near the coasts of Sumatra.
In 2006, an earthquake of 6.8 magnets hit Java, Indonesia’s most inhabited islands, in the south, causing tsunamis that hit the south coast, killing almost 700 people.
In 2009, a 7.6 - magnitude earthquake left the city of Padang — the capital of the western province of Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: 7.5 magnitude earthquake hit one of the Mentawai (Mentawai) islands on the coasts of Sumatra, causing up to 10 meters of high tsunami waves that devastated tens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: Earthquake near the surface of the ground sought the Paddy Jaya (Pide Jaya) area in Aceh, causing injuries and panic, as it reminded of the destruction of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, however, more than 100 people were killed by the blow - up buildings.
2018: strong earthquakes have visited the island of Lomboku (Lombok) of Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mainly in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and in time, hundreds of tourists were forced to return home.
The eldest son of Sara Peilina was arrested on charges of domestic violence
Treks Peilin (Track Palin), the eldest son of the former governors of Alaska and vice-president of Syria Peilin, has been arrested because he has been charged with the attack.
According to a report issued on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers, 29 - year - old Peillin, who lives in Vasilla, Alaska, was arrested in suspicion of domestic violence and opposition to arrest.
According to the police report, when a woman-in-law tried to call the police to report what she said about the crimes she had committed, she withdrew her phone.
Peilin is detained in the Mat-Su Pre-trial Detention Authority, and he has established $500 large security money, reports the KTUU.
He was brought before the court on Saturday, where, on the question of whether to confess himself to be guilty, he declared that "he is certainly not guilty".
Peilin has been charged with three Class A violations for which he can be sentenced to a year of imprisonment and a fine of $250,000.
He is also accused of a class B offence for which he can receive a day-long prison sentence and a 2000-dollar fine.
It is not the first time that he has been charged with criminal offences against Peylina.
In December 2017 he was accused of assaulting his father, Tom Peilin.
Her mother, Sarah Peilina, called the police and reported an attack.
This case is currently being brought before the Alaska Veterinary Court.
In 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, of delaying the report on domestic violence and of carrying weapons in a situation of dizziness in connection with this incident.
Her friend says he's going to walk into it with the doorway through his face.
In 2016, veteran groups criticised Sarah Peilina for linking her son’s violent behavior to post-traumatic stress syndrome, returning from the service in Iraq.
Earthquakes caused by tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds of people killed
At least 384 people have died after the earthquake that struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday.
7.5 of the magnitude of the earthquake caused tsunamis and devastated thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been broken down and the number of victims is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake set off near the central part of Sulaves, south-east of the capital of Jakarta, Indonesia.
There are videos on social networks that show the moment of collision.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a beach festival in the city of Pale when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors want to request a rare death penalty for a person suspected of terrorist acts in New York City.
Federal prosecutors want to demand execution of the death penalty for Sayfullo Saifov (Sayfullo Saipov), who is suspected of a terrorist act in New York City when eight people were killed. This is a rare form of punishment that has not been committed in the state for federal crimes since 1953.
According to the report, 30-year-old Saipov used Home Depot rental cars to attack the West Side Highway (West Side Highway) in Lower Manhattan, where he defeated the riders and bikers on his way.
In order to justify the execution of the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov's "with intent" killed eight victims and "with intent" caused a serious injury, as mentioned in the communication on the intention to request the death penalty brought before the New York South District Court.
According to the court document, in the case of both of these charges, the death penalty may be imposed.
During the weeks following the attack, the Federal High Court adopted an appeal against Saipova's summons to charge 22 charges, which included eight charges for extermination of killings normally used by federal prosecutors in organised crime, as well as allegations of ill-treatment and damage to motorised vehicles.
The attack required "significant planning and a prior intention", the prosecutors explained, stating that the attack by Saipova was "stupid, cruel and inhuman".
"Saifull Habibulajevičs Saipov (Sayful Habibulaevic Saipov) injured, damaged and caused damage to these people's families and friends: Diego Henrike Angelini (Diego Enrique Angelini), Nicholas Klivs (Nicholas Cleves), Anna-Lorija Decadt (Ann-Laure Decadt), Darrens Dreiks (Darren Drake), Ariel Elichs (Ariel Erlij), Ernáns Feruči (Hernan Ferruchi), Ernans Diego Mendoza (Hernan Diego Mendoza) and Alejandro Damjans Pagnocco (Alejando Damian Pagnucco), "
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
Ten years have passed since the New York South District Court prosecutors brought an action in which the death penalty can be tried.
The accused Khalid Barnes was sentenced to death by two drug suppliers, but in late 2009, he was sentenced to life imprisonment.
The death penalty was last executed in 1953 in the federal case of New York for Julius and Etela Rosenberg, a married couple who were sentenced to death after being accused of participating in the repression of the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
The couple of Rosenberg died in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, in the course of days and months, Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, did not show any regret for the attack.
According to the police, he informed the investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the complaint, Saipov told officials that he received the inspiration to make an attack after watching the ISIS video on his phone.
The police informed him that he had also requested permission to place the ISIS flag in his office.
He has rejected the 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipova, said that he was "unsatisfied by nature" about the indictment decision.
"We believe that the intention of demanding a death penalty is not to accept guilt in exchange for life imprisonment without the right to release will only extend the ongoing trauma caused to all parties involved," Patons explained.
The Saipova defence team has previously called on prosecutors not to request the award of a death penalty.
The Conservative Member announces that the management of Brexit's negotiations should be entrusted to NAIDJELAM FARÁZAM
At the conservative conference today, Niedgels Faražs promised to "mobilize the nation's army".
A former leader of the British Independent Party announced that politicians should feel Eurosceptic anger when one of the members of the Parliament of Teresa Mejas suggested that negotiations with the EU should be entrusted to him.
Conservatory Peter Bone announced to the march in Birmingham that Britain would have long been out of place if Mr. Faraz was the minister of Breksita.
However, the challenge that Mrs Mejas will face in trying to join her opposition party has been demonstrated by conservatives who supported the EU's stay and joined a separate protest in the city against Brexit.
The Prime Minister is fighting to maintain his compromise plan on Britain and the European Union's future Chequers compromise and to feel the attacks of those who want to leave the EU, those who want to stay the EU, and those who want to stay the EU themselves.
The public suggested that she would strive to reach an agreement with Brussels despite a negative reaction, and would make Europeans and Lebanese choose between her offer and "shade".
Mr. Bouna, at the location "Leave Means Leave" in Solihall (Solihull), announced that he wanted to throw the Meja plan into the garbage.
He suggested that he make Mr. Faraz public and entrust him with the talks he had with Brussels.
"If he had been on the floor, we would have already left," Bones said.
The honourable Member from Wellingborough said, "I will support Brexit, but we must throw out the Meja plan!"
On the basis of his opposition in the EU, he said: "We did not hesitate to serve!
We want to adopt our laws in our country!"
Mr. Bouna ignored the assumption that public opinion could have changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and wants to stay in the EU is absolutely not true."
Brekita's supporter Andrea Jenkins also took part in the march and told reporters: "I just say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chequers plan is not popular with society, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular with our party and our supporters who actually do all the work and choose us.
Please answer the Chequers and start listening."
In terms of Mea, she added: "The Prime Minister remains in his place when they fulfill their promises."
Mr Farage told the politicians in the city to feel pressure if they were going to fail to comply with the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's a matter of trust between us — people — and our politicians," he said.
"They're trying to get Brexit and we're here today to tell them we won't let them do it."
In his message, he adds to the enthusiastic effort of people: "I want you to let our politicians, who are planning to transfer Brexit, feel pressure.
"We will call on the people of this country, who have allowed us to win the fight for Brexit, and we will never relax until we are independent, self-greeding, proud of the United Kingdom."
However, the Palikirs had been through Birmingham before the city center for two hours.
Unknownly, the activists welcomed conservatives against Brexit banners after the weekend meeting.
The representative of the Workers' Party, Lord Adonis, examined the Conservatives on security issues they experienced at the beginning of the Party's application conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they are able to maintain the IT system and all their technology for Canada and yet, undistributed, free trade without borders with Ireland," he added.
"It's an absolute farss.
There is no such thing as a successful Brexit," he added.

Russian Grand Prix: Louis Hamilton approaches the world championship title after the team allows him to intercept Sebastian Fetel
From the time that Walter Boots qualified on Saturday before Louis Hamilton, it became clear that the Mercedes team would play an important role in the competition.
From the start, Botass began well and almost left Hamilton in the dry state, defending his position on the first two trips and calling on Fetel to attack his teammate.
Fetel first came to the garage and left Hamilton in the mood to deal with the others, it was probably the decisive.
The Mercedes pilot filled the circle later and withdrew from the Fettel, but Hamilton continued to stand up to the leaders after a match of forces that saw the Ferrari driver leave continuously inside free, risking leaving behind a double manoeuvre to defend himself at the third point.
Max Verstapens started from the back row and at the end of the first round was the seventh on his 21st birthday.
After that, he was in charge of a large part of the race because he focused on the tires to reach the finish quickly and to live in Kimi Riconnen’s fourth.
Finally, he arrived in the garage at about 44 C.E., but was unable to increase speed in the remaining eight circles, because Raikonen remained the fourth.
This is a difficult day because Walter did a fantastic job all week long and was a real gentleman.
The team did an extremely important job to get one or two," Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language
President Donald Tramps made a statement on Saturday's residence by Senator Diān Feinstein about her refusal not to express a letter from Christina Bleisia Forda, in which she accused the Supreme Court candidate Breta Caveno of sexual harassment.
Speaking in West Virginia, the President did not speak directly of the Forda's testimony he gave to the Senate's Legal Commission, but commented that what happened in the Senate shows that people there are "bad, accidental and unreliable."
"One that can happen and something beautiful that has already happened in the last days in the Senate, when there is anger, when you see angry, evil, accidental and unreliable people," he said.
"When you read press releases and leaked information and then they say, "Oh, no, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diana Feinstein, did you leak information?
Remember her answer to the question... did you leak the document?
Oh, no.
I didn't do it."
Okay, wait a minute.
Did we do it...No, we didn't do it," he added, senators in tone.
In July, Feinstein was sent a letter explaining in detail what Forda accused Kaveno, and in early September the content of the letter was made public, but Feinstein denied that it would have happened in her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Forda's accusations, I unloaded her story, "Finestein told the commission, report "The Hill."
"She asked me to keep it confidential and so did I."
But her refusal was not in favour of the President, who commented on this situation in his home on Saturday evening: "I will tell you that it was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn't do it, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
By continuing to defend the High Court candidate, whose three women are accused of sexual harassment, the President proposed that the Democrats use the charges for their own benefit.
"They are targeted to regain power through any means."
Whether you see the evil, the unhappiness, they don't care what they feel they have to destroy in order to gain power and control," said the president, "Mediaite".

Air traffic controller dies allowing hundreds of people on the plane to escape during an earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is being heated up as a hero after he sacrificed himself so that a plane with hundreds of passengers would be safely lifted from the ground.
More than 800 people have died and many have lost their lives after the powerful earthquake struck the island of Sulaves on Friday, causing tsunamis.
The territory will continue to have a strong post-harvest, and many are immersed in doubles in the city of Palus.
However, despite the fact that his colleagues saved their lives, 21 - year - old Antonius Gannanas Agung refused to leave his job at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu’s airport, which was heavily suffocated.
He remained in his post to make sure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then on the runway, would probably be picked up in the air.
After that, he decided to leave the traffic control station, thinking that it could be broken.
Later he died in the hospital.
The Indonesian air navigation representative, Johannes Sirats, said that his decision could save hundreds of lives, reports Australian ABC.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to take him to the largest hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Paul.
"We're heartbroken to hear it," he adds.
However, national authorities are concerned that the number of dead could reach thousands, the National Disaster Prevention Agency claims that access to Dongal, Sigi and Butangao (Boutong) is limited.
"It seems that there will be a great increase, because many more people are under the rubble, and many cannot be accessed," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency's representative.
The waves reaching a height of six feet [6 m] devastated Paul, where there would be massive barges on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft continue to supply assistance and necessary goods.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, Sky News, said: "In minutes of rapid medical assistance, the service introduces new victims.
Clean water is scarce.
Small shops are all over the place."
Jans Gelfands, International Red Cross leader in Indonesia, CNN said: "The Red Cross of Indonesia has rushed to help the survivors, but we do not know what we will find there.
"It's a tragedy already, but it can all get worse."
On Sunday, Indonesia's President Joko Widodo arrived at the military entrance of Paul and the state: "I ask you to work day and night to fulfill all the tasks relating to evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia has already been hit by earthquakes in Lombo, where more than 550 people have died this year.
A plane crash in Micronesia: Now Air Niugini says that one of the people is missing after the plane crash in the yard
The airline took a flight during which the plane crashed into the Pacific Ocean basin in Micronesia and now claims that one of the people is missing, even before it reported that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the crashing aircraft.
Air Niugini reported on a press release on Saturday afternoon when they could not answer for one of the passengers — the man.
The airline reported that it cooperates with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the missing man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more information about the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
The locals helped rescue other passengers and services after the plane landed in the water trying to get off at Chuuk Island.
The officials, on Friday, said that seven people were hospitalized.
The airline reported that six people remained in the hospital until Saturday, and all of them were in stable condition.
There are still unclear reasons for the accident and the sequence of events.
The airline and the United States Navy report that the aircraft crashed into the deck shortly after getting off the runway.
Some eyewitnesses felt that the length of the runway had been changed in the plane.
American passenger Bill Janes said the plane was very low.
"It was really very good," said Janes.
Janes says that he and other passengers were able to get out of the crashing plane using emergency exits, since the water was only up to the road.
He said that he was panicking and crying and that he had a mild headache.
Marines from the U.S. Navy who worked nearby to improve the ship’s landing also helped rescue operations by using an inflatable boat to transport people to the shore about 30 metres (100 feet) below the water before the plane crashed.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that over the last 20 years, 111 people have died in registered companies in PNG, none of which are related to Air Niugini.
Psychoanalysis Commentary explains events during the night in which a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution provided evidence in the case under review, where the man was accused of burning a living woman in 2014.
Commenting on the psychoanalysis of the Department of Justice of the United States, Pauls Rovletts demonstrated for several hours as a witness expert in intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used the information he received from the phone to collect together what the 29 - year - old accused Quinton Telis and 19 - year - old Jessica Chambers did on the night she died.
Rovletts said that he received location data from several phones that showed that Telis was with Chambers in the evening of her death, arguing his previous testimony, reported "The Clarion Ledger".
When the data showed that his phone was at Chambers when he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to ask Sanford.
On Saturday in the courtroom, Sanford testified that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecution asked if Telis was telling the truth, claiming that it was Sanford's car that night, Sanford said that he was "melling because my car was in Nashvila."
Another coincidence was that Tellis said that he knew Chambers only about two weeks after she died.
The phone records show that they only know each other for a week.
Rovletts said that shortly after Chamber's death, Telis would delete from Chamber's receipts, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He will wipe her out of his life," said Heil.
Defence is expected to provide its concluding arguments on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the trial to be handed over to the jury later this same day.

Again black?!
In New York, a couple complained about the dismissal after receiving "racist" news
In New York, a couple complained to the court about a discriminatory dismissal after receiving a wrong message from a mother who complained that the child "is again black."
The couple refuse to be racist by comparing the court case to "depression".
Lindsia Plasko-Flaksman, a mother of two children, expressed her rejection of knowing that the new child caretaker, Giisele Mauriza, was the black day she came to work on the first day of 2016.
"Flasman wrote to his husband in a short time.
However, she sent a message not to her husband, but to Maurice, twice.
In summing up his insubordination, Plasco-Flasman dismissed Mauritius, pointing out that his previous exodus, who was an African-American, had done a bad job and that he had been waiting for the Philippines in response to New York Post.
Maurice paid for her one working day and sent home to Uber.
Now Maurice has appealed to the court for compensation for dismissal and wants to receive $350 a day for six months for work with a secure residence, which she originally applied for, and without a contract of employment.
"I want to show them that such things don't work," she said on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
Some reject allegations that they are racist, claiming that the termination of Mauritian employment was a reasonable decision because they feared that after her accusation, she would not be able to trust her.
"My wife sent her what she didn't mean.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist," Joel Plasco, the man, said "Post."
"But, would you trust your children to be treated with rudeness, even if it was only because of a mistake?
Your newborn?
Think about it."
The court's hearing like "pression", Plasko said that his wife had only been born a few months back and found herself in a very "troublesome situation".
"You're really looking at something like this?
It is not an acceptable action," the investment banker added.
As long as there is still a trial, public opinion is quickly tried across social networks, rejecting them for their behaviour and logical thinking.
The new letter reveals that the publishers of Paddington’s book were worried that readers would not be able to associate with the speaker.
Bond's daughter Karen Jenkel, who was born just before the book was approved, said about the letter: "It's hard to "put yourself in a basket," who reads the book for the first time before it was issued.
It is very surprising now to know what we know about the great success of Paddington."
By saying that her father, who worked for an operator BBC before he felt the inspiration to write a book for children about a small toy, was optimistic that his work would be rejected. She added that the 60th anniversary of the book was "sweet acid" after Father’s birth in last year.
Speaking of Paddington, whom she calls a "very important member of the family", her father quietly boasted about his possible success.
"He was a quiet, quiet man and was not great," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was like having a child who achieves something: you're proud even if you haven't done it yourself.
I think he saw Padington's progress in a similar way.
Even though it was his birth and the fruit of his imagination, he always gave all the merits to Paddington himself."
I had to leave my dying daughter by phone
Upon her arrival, her daughter was quickly taken to the hospital in Nice, Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors constantly fought for her life.
"Neds called regularly and said that it is very bad and expected that she will not survive," said Ednana-Laperuza.
"Then I got a call from Ned, saying that she would die in the nearest two minutes and I had to get rid of her.
And so did I.
I said, "Tassi, I love you very much, darling.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicine that doctors gave her to maintain her heart rate gradually ended and left her body.
She would've died even faster and it's all over now.
I had to sit down and wait for it to happen.
I could not enjoy or scream because I would find myself in a situation where there are families and people around me.
I needed a lot of power to control."
In the end, then already the daughter's loss-sighing, on the plane of Ednan-Laperuze with other passengers who were not even aware of who she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I'm a natural head down and tears flowed all the time.
It’s hard to explain, but it’s just during the flight that I feel deep compassion for Ned.
That he needs my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Women who are breast-feeding attach cards to bridges to prevent suicide
Two women, whom people loved to commit suicide, are acting to help others not to take their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Hamfrija strengthen the maps at the Welsh Bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers so that people can call and receive support.
David’s son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression, but he committed suicide when he was 18 years old.
"I don't want a parent to experience what I have every day," she said.
Davis, aged 45, who lives in Lydia, said that her son was a promising meal with a dependent smile.
"Everyone recognized him by the smile.
Everyone always said that his smile "lighted" always and everywhere."
However, he gave up his job before he died because he was "bad, very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, now 11 years old, was the one who found him after Tyler had committed suicide.
Davis said, "I'm constantly worried about the consequences."
Davis created the cards, "to make it known that there are people you can turn to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
You don't have to sit quietly — you have to talk."
Hamphrey, who has been a friend of Davis for many years, lost Mark, his marriage mate for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
"He did not say that he would feel sad or be depressed or in any other way felt," she said.
"Some days before Christmas, we noticed that his attitude has changed.
He reached his lowest point on Christmas morning — when the children opened gifts he did not make eye contact with them or something like that."
Her death was a great trauma to children, but they had to end it by saying, "It's ruining the whole family.
It separates us.
But we must all continue and fight."

Breta Caveno's future in the air of war because the FBI launches an investigation
"I think if we could really get what he requires - in terms of time and volume, we could achieve little consensus," Fleiks said on Saturday, adding that he was concerned that the Commission 'shared' between the firm partisan content.
Why do the supporters of Caveno and his Republics not want the FBI to investigate?
Their rejection is only coincidence.
Interference is five weeks later, on November 6, if the Republicans are expected to get worse, their efforts will be much weaker to choose a man in the highest court.
George V. Bush called the senators in lobbying them to support Caveno, who worked in the White House during Bush and thanks him to meet his wife Ashley, who was the personal secretary of President Bush.
What will happen after the FBI prepares its report?
A vote will take place in the Senate, where 51 seats now belong to the Republicans, but 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kaveno can obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pens, Vice-President, to vote and approve him in the Supreme Court.
Kima's management "reduced" North Korea's number of asylum seekers
North Korean political asylum seekers in South Korea have decreased since Kim Jong came back to power for seven years, said the South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from the South Korea Merge Ministry, said that last year 1127 asylum seekers had been compared to 2011 when their number was 2706.
Park said that stronger border control across North Korea and China and high rates of smugglers are the main factors.
Pyongyang has not submitted any public comments.
Most of the political asylum seekers from the end of North Korea are offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most of it goes through China, which has the largest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the severely protected Demilitarisation Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
Chinese political asylum seekers are considered illegal immigrants and are deported in a coercive manner.
The relationship between North Korea and South Korea, which remains technically at war, has improved considerably over the past few months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of the two countries met with Pyongyang to discuss delayed denuclearisation negotiations.
This took place after a historic meeting in June between President Donald Tramp and Kim Yongong in Singapore when, in large trains, they agreed to cooperate to free the Korean peninsula from nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the US sanctions for the progress that has not been made since these negotiations.
"If there is no confidence in the United States, there will be no faith in the security of our country, and in such circumstances we will not ever be the first to unilaterally disarm," Ri said in his speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York."
Nensia Pelosi calls Breta Caveno "historic" and claims that he is not fit for work in the Supreme Court.
The Court's minority leader, Nensia Pelosi, called the Supreme Court candidate Breta Kaveno a "historic" and claimed that he was not fit for work in the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi gave comments on Saturday's "Texas Tribune Festival" in Austin, Texas.
"I can't stop thinking that if the woman had acted like this, they would call her "historic," Pelosi said about his reaction to the testimony given to the Senate Judicial Commission on Thursday.
Kaveno emotionally denied charges of sexual harassment to Dr. Christiana Blezia Forda when they were both teenagers.
In his initial argument, Caveno was very emotional, sometimes almost smoking and talking about his family and high school years.
He, in particular, condemned the Democrats on the Commission, calling for complaints against them about the "destruction of a grotesque and concerted nature", organised by liberals who are angry that Hillary Clinton lost his presidential election in 2016.
Pelos said that she believed that the Café testimony was a reason that he could not work in the Supreme Court because it showed that he had a bilateral attitude towards the Democrats.
"I think he is disqualificating himself with such claims and his attitude towards Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Pelos objected when she was asked if she would try to question Caveno if he would approve him and if the Democrats would get a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say so – if he does not tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he is not only in the Supreme Court, but also in the existing place of work in the court," Pelosi said.
Kaveno, at the moment, is Judge Washington County Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that as a democrat, he was shocked by the possibility that Kaveno would take decisions against the "Affordable Care Act" or Roe v. Veid because he was considered a conservative judge.
In his approval negotiations, Caveno examined questions as to whether he would reject the Supreme Court decisions.
"There is no good time for a hysterical and double-minded man to work in court, but we would expect us to say happyly: 'Is it not wonderful?' said Pelosi.
But women need to keep their hands on them.
It is a denunciation, months and years everything has collapsed "by far", but she is not allowed to get it all out of her crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Mrs Steinema told me after 45 years.
"I don't think it's something unusual, what do you think?"
She continued, "One day a woman who was the head of a company who said that she was also crying when she was angry but created a technique — when she got angry and started crying, she told her person she was talking to: "You might think I was sorry because I was crying.
I'm angry."
And then she kept going.
And I thought it was great."
The type of discharge of the tears as anger is only partially recognised because they are simple on the basis of their own.
One of my most vivid memories is of an old job where there was a percentage of men when I once cried out in unparalleled anger, when after I had been buried, the older woman, the stubborn leader (the woman), from whom I had always been a little frightened, dragged me to the stairs.
"Never let them see that crying!" she said to me.
"They don't know you've moved.
They think you're deaf, and they're just happy that you could "get under your skin."
Patrija Srædere, then a congressman from Colorado, worked with Gerry Hart at his election as president of the campaign.
In 1987, when Hartt, who was caught in a foreign marriage, was also called "the making of fools" and got out of the elections, Shreeder was deeply upset and considered that there was no reason why she could not run for the president's office.
"It wasn't a careful decision," she laughed at me 30 years later.
"The election was already seven other candidates and the last one they wanted another to come up.
There were those who called it "Snow White and Seven Smokes."
She later took part in the campaign, she withdrew from the fund collection and promised that she would not participate in the election unless $2 million was collected.
It was a lost fight.
She discovered that many of her supporters, who had donated $1,000 to the men in charge, had only donated $250.
"Do they think I'm getting fired?" she wondered.
When she announced in her speech that she would not start a formal campaign, she was very emotional — thanks to the people who supported her, to the system that made it very difficult to collect money and to talk to the voters instead of the delegates, and to get angry about the sexism — where she was "nossed".
"You'd think I had a breakdown of nerves," recalled Schroeder, as the press responded to him.
"You'd think Kleinex was my corporate sponsor."
I remember thinking what they're going to write on my hat.
"She was crying."
Why the U.S.-China War Can Be Good for Beijing
The main objections to how the US-China war of trade began are hidden and, while the fight is not over, disagreements between countries can be favourable to Beijing in the long term, experts say.
US President Donald Tramps issued the first warning at the beginning of this year, imposing a tax on the main Chinese export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most important escalation started this week at new rates, affecting the unit's value of $200 billion (150 billion), immediately placing half of the goods exported from the USA from China.
Beijing also responds to "welcomes" every time, the latest is five to ten percent of the $60 billion worth of American goods.
China has announced its commitment to respond to the US against each other and it is doubtful that the world's second largest economy could be minimized in the near future.
In order to withdraw from Washington, certain requirements should be met, but public attendance in the US would be too overwhelming for Chinese President Xi Shi Jinpin.
However, experts say that if Beijing is playing its cards correctly, the pressure of the US trade war can have a positive effect on China in the long term, reducing the interdependence of the economies of both countries.
"The fact that a rapid political decision has been taken either in Washington or in Beijing could create uncontrollable economic conditions in any of the countries that are really more dangerous than previously recognised observers," said New American Security researcher, who focuses on Asia.
Syria is ready for the return of refugees, the Foreign Minister said.
Syria states that it is ready to return to the refugee voluntarily and calls for help to rebuild a country that has been in war for more than seven years.
Speaking at the United Nations Assembly, Minister for Foreign Affairs Valid Almualems said conditions are improving in the country.
"Now the situation on earth is much more stable and safer, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The Government continues to restore the territories destroyed by terrorists in their normal state.
There are all conditions for refugees to return voluntarily to the country they were forced to abandon because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and their livelihood.
The United Nations assumes that since the beginning of the war in 2011, the country has abandoned 5.5 million Syrians.
Six million people still live in the country and need humanitarian assistance.
Almualem said the Syrian regime would accept assistance in the reconstruction of the devastated country.
But he stressed that the State would not accept the help or help of countries that helped to promote peace.
European golf selection sensational victory in the Raidera Cup fight in Paris
The European golf team won the 2018 Raider Cup, winning the US match with a score of 16,5:10,5 "Le Golf National" outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has lost six times in Europe and has not won the Raider Cup since 1993.
Europe recovered when the team led by Tomas Bjornna acquired 14.5 points needed to stop the US sample.
The U.S. star Phil Michaelson, who had a hard time going through the whole tournament, entered his T-shirt water at PAR 3 16 bedside, joining the match Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari played brilliantly in all his stages, becoming one of the four players who have ever managed to score 5-0-0 since 1979 when the tournament is played in an existing format.
American Jordan Spitt lost 5 to 4 European teams by rating the lowest player Torbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's best player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 to 1 Ian Polter from England, which was possibly the last of Raider's.
A veteran of eight Raider's cages, Spanish Serhio Garcia, became the best player in the tournament all the time from Europe with 25.5 career points.
"Of course I don't cry, but today I can't manage tears."
This was a tough year.
I am grateful from the heart to Thomas that he raised me and trusted me.
I'm very, very happy that we've recovered the cage.
This is the team's merit and I am glad that I could help," Garcia commented emotionally after the European election.
He then gave the name to his nation, John Rama, who won the United States Gulf legend of the Tiger Woods on Sunday with 2 to 1 matches.
"The pride I felt when I won the Tiger Woods, I grew up following this player's footsteps," said 23-year-old Rams.
Woods lost all his four matches in France and now he has a career record with 13-21-3 in Raider's cage.
Unfair statistics for one of the best players all the time who won the 14th level golf tournaments behind Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. team fought all week long to find its opportunities, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Tomas and Tony Finau, who played a high-level golf tournament all over the world.
The U.S. select captain Jim Furik said after his team's unsatisfying performance, "I'm proud of the guys, they fought.
This morning there was a moment when we were able to put a little pressure on the European team.
We fought.
All due respect to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played a very good game.
We will be restructured, I will work with the American PGA and the U.S. Raider Cup Committee and we will move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to put on your hats.
He beat us."
Latest information on the red landscape: Concentration decreases in Pine (Pinellas), Manatee (Manatee) and Sarasota (Sarasota)
The latest report from the Florida Committee on Fish and Wild Animals (FWC) indicates the overall reduction in the red landscape concentration of the area of the Tampa Bay.
According to FWC, donor plans have been reported in Pine, Manat, Sarasota, Charlotte, and Collier, which indicate a decrease in concentration.
The red landscape flowering ranges around 130 miles from the North Rhine-Westphalia to the South Sea coast line.
Boards are located about 10 miles from the Hilsboro (Hillsborough) coastal area, but in some places it lasts about a week.
The red landscape is also appreciated in the Pasko area.
Last week average concentrations were reported in the Pinella area or its coastal zone, low to high concentrations in the coastal zone of Hilsboro, low to high concentrations in the Manat area, low to high concentrations in the Sarasota area or its coastal zone, low to medium concentrations in the Charlotte area, low to high concentrations in the Lee area or its coastal area, and low concentrations in the coastal area of Kolje.
Respiratory irritation is still reported in the areas of Pinelas, Manat, Sarasotas, Lee and Kolje.
No respiratory irritation has been reported in North West Florida last week.
