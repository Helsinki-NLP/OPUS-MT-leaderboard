New issues on the California Water Supply Project
Critics and state legislators say that they want to know more about who pays for a $16 billion project supported by Governor Gerry Brown, according to the leading representative of the California Water Supply Administration, that the Brown Administration is offering government funding to complete two huge water tunnels.
Critics claim that the government's funding described by the Los Angeles Metropolis Water Supply Management may contradict the state's long-standing claims that the various local water supply administrations, not California itself, would pay for the Brown vision to extract two equal 35-year-long tunnels to bring water to the south of the Sacramento River, mainly Central and Southern California.
The initial expenditure for the construction of tunnels amounting to US$ 248 million, which is still to be authorised by the supervisory authority, has already been initiated by a federal audit investigation.
On Wednesday, state legislators also ordered a state audit on the construction of tunnels.
On Thursday, State Speaker Nensija Vogel said that despite the Los Angeles metropolis water supply management account, no money will be used from the state's general budget to complete the current planning phase of the two tunnels.
However, tunnel opponents and a group of taxpayers were critical on Thursday, and the Assembly representative Susan Ega, one of the state legislators in the audit order this week, asked the state for explanations on Thursday.
"It's a game with the buyers," said David Wolfs, Legal Director of the Howard Jervis Tax Payers Association.
In my opinion, this is linked to today's audit (request): there are a lot more questions than answers.
The tunnel project has been approved by Brown and some politically influential water and water users in Central and South California.
Supporters claim that tunnels will benefit the environment and provide safer water supplies to Californiars.
The opponents claim that they are concerned that the state will use tunnels to divert too much water from the Sakramento River and the San Francisco Bay, causing damage to Northern California and even more to local species.
The metropolises and other water supply administrations intended to receive water from the tunnels still have to undertake to pay them for their insecurity as to whether the investment of huge resources will actually provide enough water to repay it.
The same water supply administrations also announced this year that they would not pay for the completion of the current preparatory work unless the project was first authorised by the supervisory authority.
On Thursday, the monthly report published by the Government of Los Angeles on the tunnel project states that "the post has indicated that additional funding for the completion of the planning phase will be allocated from state or federal budget resources."
After all that local water management has spent on the project, including US$63 million from its water supply management, it is "expected" that the state will use national money to complete the planning," said Bobs Muirs, spokesperson for the Los Angeles water supply management.
He then turned questions to Vogel, the state chief.
Vogela said that the state is planning to grant money to complete the planning of the tunnels from the existing half-century old water network, the state water project.
The opponents of the construction of tunnels, however, point to a regulatory framework issued in 2009, which, they say, prevents the state from spending money on the construction of tunnels until the water supply authorities that benefit from it will accept payment obligations on them.
"The project contractors have promised to pay for this project, and they have used financial tricks to circumvent these commitments," said Patrija Šiferle, environmental consultant and former tunnel opponent.
This raises questions about where this money was suddenly found.
Towards a business group under the Chinese Cybersecurity Act
The coalition of international business groups has turned to China with a request to change the proposed cybersecurity rules by warning that they will harm trade and isolate the country.
The letter to Chinese Prime Minister Li Kecjan has been signed by 46 groups from the United States, Europe, Asia and Latin America, showing global concern that the rules could restrict or restrict access to the market in Chinese information security products.
Signatories include the US Chamber of Commerce, the European Services Forum and groups from Japan, Korea and Mexico.
The proposed rules require suppliers to show the Chinese authorities how security products operate and how the country will store information about Chinese citizens.
The last letter dated Wednesday said that it could make data loss easier and reduce access to Chinese customers.
Chemical Explosion in Tianjin: A Year of Tragedy
Zhang Mengfan claims that the company has earned to know what happened in Tianjin.
Chinese leaders plan to keep silent about the large-scale chemical explosion that killed 173 people on the first day of the year, but not everyone agrees.
John Sadwarts reports from Tianjin.
Nearly anywhere else in the world would be the anniversary of such a global disaster, a time that the people remember and remember.
But not in China.
Although a memorial service is held in the city of Taijin for the memory of some of the dead, such reminders are excluded elsewhere.
The media controlled by the Communist Party have been told what they can and cannot say, and some survivors as well as members of the deceased family have been warned not to speak to foreign press.
However, 23 - year - old Zhang Mengfan does not want to shut up.
"This year's society should know something about what happened," he tells me.
I don't want to be quiet.
On 12 August last year, Zhangs was a radio operator in a military fire brigade that was only a mile away from the explosive epicenter.
"The call was received last night at 22.53, and we started sending my team members," he says.
At the event site, they could arrive within 10 minutes.
Eating a large amount of chemicals in the warehouse also rushed teams from other places in the city.
None of them drew attention to the fact that a large number of volatile and toxic substances were illegally stored, with a gross excess of permitted quantities and without proper supervision.
Fire began when nitrocellulose - the chemical substances used in nail lacquer - were allowed to be consumed by the party and then burned in the summer.
It then spread into a vast area - 800 tonnes of ammonium nitrate fertiliser.
In the explosions windows and fire-fighting warehouses were removed, where Zhangs Mengfan was waiting for news from the scene on the radio.
This information was not received either.
"When I saw the magic of the shadows, I fell into error," he tells me.
I knew what that meant to my friends.
Of the 26 firemen of his unit who were sent to the site of the shooting, eight never returned.
Many others have suffered severe burns and other injuries.
Most of the two major explosions were likened to an earthquake, and the waves of the explosion were felt many miles away.
The total loss is estimated at more than US$ 1 billion, including more than 300 damaged buildings.
In general, 173 people were killed, of whom 104 were firemen.
The dead remains of eight people were also not found.
The investigation authorities of the official government are unanimously guilty of corruption, political communications and formal secrecy, thereby allowing circumvention of the rules and ignoring security systems.
First of all, such a warehouse should never have been built close to home.
More than 100 officials and company managers have initiated some kind of disciplinary or criminal investigation.
Thus, as long as the government can point to the progress made - thousands of homes and compensations for the population - these sensitive issues remain relevant.
Tragedy has been found in a flat system where rapid economic growth is a priority and the lack of independent supervision is a fact.
There is no doubt about the courage and sense of duty of that evening, but without a fire - extinguishing image of a hero, the scene is not entirely pleasant.
It has a fire extinguisher as a victim sent without warning to fight a man - made disaster that could be prevented.
Zhang Mengfan no longer works in the fire department but attends the memorial service in Tianjin.
He will carry the message of his dead loved ones in his heart.
Most of all, I would like to say to them, I have visited your parents and they are doing well.
Leave your parents in my regard.
Now I'm a member of your family.
I will fulfill your duties as a son.
The cold spring could affect the Scottish border shooting season
The Scottish border shooting season will start later, as the number of birds has fallen this year because of the cold weather.
Shooting has been delayed in several properties because many of the new borders have not survived under cold spring conditions.
Marking the start of the season, the Scottish Toys Association (SGA) said that the shooting of rubles provides more work than the Edinburgh Festival.
However, the OneKind Animal Welfare Fund calls for the end of the "brutish slaughter of birds".
The director of the organization, Harij Hütton, said: "The work that is invested in the provision of large numbers of games intended for shooting is huge and irrefutable including some very controversial activities."
There is no surprise that society is preventing this so-called sport and calls on the government to ban the unnecessary, unnecessary work enjoyed by only a very small part of the Scottish population.
Landowners also stress that they are committed to keeping the number of birds and that shooting the edges is important for the development of the rural economy.
SGA President Alex Hogs said that the sector provides 8 800 full-time jobs per year in the outermost regions and that it has been "rich in work" in uncertain times.
He said: "In comparison with many European countries, the culture of hunting has not been so deeply rooted in Scotland, and some people do not know how the shooting season affects the state in terms of the economy."
Hogs said that the number of jobs provided during the shooting is superior to the number of jobs created at the Edinburgh International Festival, Fringe Festival, Tattoo Festival and the Old Age Evening Celebrations.
He added: "The employment situation in Scotland is currently very worrying, especially in the oil and gas sector, so game managers and their families want to see the sector rise.
We want to work with the Scottish Government to ensure that hard workers can also rely on these jobs in the future.
RSPB Scotland considers that at least eight golden eagles have been killed in the vicinity of the rubella.
Many game managers acknowledge that the shooting of rubies is not generally popular, but SGA claims that the industry has "taken significant steps forward in terms of best practice."
Traditionally, the day of the opening of the Rubin shooting season is known as the "Holy Twelfth."
However, there is still much discussion about this type of sport, and the management of rubella shooting sites is linked to the persecution of some of the perpetrators by the nature conservation authorities.
On Thursday, the RSPB Scotland said that during less than five years in the Monadliat Mountains, south-east of Inverness, eight golden eagles were lost.
The Natural Welfare Fund considers that they have been illegally killed near the edge shooting sites and their satellite a process has been destroyed.
Scottish Environment Minister Rosanna Kaningema said that these reports are "very disturbing and regrettable."
Ms. Caningemas asked officials to analyse the evidence of approximately 90 survivors and missing eagles with transmitters to determine whether there was a trend in criminal activity.
The Scottish Cleanser Group blames the RSPB for trying to raise anti-stolen feelings before the start of the rubella season, and also stated that there is no clear evidence that birds had even been killed in the vicinity of the Monadlita Mountains.
Rio Olympic Games 2016: Brionija Paige Great Britain shines silver in the trampline attack
Representative of the United Kingdom of Great Britain for the Striking of Silver
Briony Paige became the first British woman to come to the Olympics in a trampline attack in Rio by embodiment of silver.
Peedja (25) to gold missing 0.425 points, as Canada's representative Rosana Maklenana already scored the second Olympic title in a row with a result of 56,465.
The World Championship, China’s representative Lee Dana was at the bronze, while the second British finalist, Katrina Driscola, finished at the sixth.
I couldn't believe I fought the Olympic medal.
I am so happy," said Emotional Paige.
I had no idea that it was a medal, but the ability to show the best performance, so I was so happy that all the training and heavy work had been paid back.
I am so happy that I could finally start with Ketu, already one representative's participation in the final would be historic, but there were two of us.
The fifth place in the 2015 World Cup in Denmark was the highest achievement in international competitions before the Olympics.
The trampline attack in the Olympic Games was included in 2000 and this is the first time British women have managed to reach the final.
The reaction to the medal.
The British team's representative Nathan Beilius, the only representative of men in the competition for trampline attacks on Saturday, was in ecstasy.
Hanna Velana, who plays the Olympics for the second time, soon began to celebrate the success of Paige.
Peyge has obtained a bachelor's degree in biology with excellence at the University of Sheffield.
Rio 2016: Fiji fans celebrate gold medal in the regbie-7
12-year-old boy to watch the game, take half of yogurt and sugarcane fields to the nearest TV
Fiji, after its history, begins the first Olympic gold medals to be celebrated on an unprecedented scale
Banks closed, shops fast and the celebration took over Suva streets by dancing, singing and moaning
Fiji won a gold medal, at Deodoro Stadium Regbie-7 at the end of 43-7 to destroy Britain.
Thousands of people throughout the island stopped their normal work to watch the historic game.
Fiji celebrates its first Olympic medal in its history
Many of them were dressed in Fiji’s colors and were dressed in cribs, wearing the national flag and encouraging the team.
At the end of the game, the excited celebration went to the streets, licking and dancing.
"Some people even stopped their vehicles in the streets of Suva and joined the Fijian flags, not focusing on the small constraints they created," reports Fiji Times.
Pigs will definitely continue at the end of the week and next week.
Irish Prime Minister: Finn Harps 0-5 Derry City
Aaron Makenefs entered two first half-time sentences in favour of the guest team in Finnpark.
Derry City has risen to the second Prime Minister, winning a convincing victory with a 5-0 match with Finn Harps.
Arons Makenefs pointed out "confection strips" in successful implementation of the two first half-time sentences that were awarded for violations against Lucas Schubert.
Nathan Boil entered the gates at the beginning of the second half, and Schübert's victory in the fourth quarter before the late attacks of Kitta Varda, closing the enemy's funeral in Finnpark.
Derry is one point in front of Cork City, and both teams will be in the decisive game on Monday evening in Brendwell.
It was Derry's first victory over his North-West competitors in the season, and they were disturbed by me on the part of the Harps.
Makenef saved the game's discovery site in 17 minutes after Kiran Kola's exit against Szubert, although the offense turned out outside the court.
There was no doubt about the second sentence, the former half guard of the "Caramel Strip" for Bari Molo, leaving Sübert to fall to the ground and making it a result in 2-0 in the third minute after the break.
Boil added the exact point after Din Jervis's play with the foot inside the eighth minute after the game is started.
Derry City Warden Gerard Doherty had a peaceful evening, but he managed to protect the gates well, overcoming David Skalley's guests in the best discovery of the game.
Smurfs covered the length of the bomb to Cole in 83 minutes, followed by Varda’s wise takeover over the protection of the Harps center of Richard Brass.
It was Derry's biggest match series and excellent preparation for the final game with Cork.
Test after mass irregular tests in the course of the University of Upper Stairs and Isles (UHI)
All 20 students' courses could have been released at the University of Inverness at the UHI's highest media course.
Most of them were 17 - and 18 - year - olds who hoped to use the note received from the studies to attend the university.
Inverness College UHI argues that quality assurance processes are being applied, adding that the Scottish Qualification Authority (SQA) investigates this case.
The SQA press secretary said that the highest evaluation of the media available throughout the country in 2016 is "eventual as planned".
Twenty students enrolled in the offered and evaluated course of the Inverness College UHI.
Many of the students were young people living in rural areas who were learning online, but they often had to go to Inverness College from their homes, such as Locheiber.
One student’s father said that after his daughter’s publications in the social media that she had not received any assessment of her work, at least 10 also reported that she had not received any assessment of her course work.
He told BBC News Scotland directly that about five more people who took this course at Inverness College last year and who managed to get in touch with said the same thing happened to them.
The situation means that his daughter cannot afford a place at the University of Glasgow, but she will be able to accept another offer from another university thanks to the qualifications acquired at school.
However, her father said that there were others who visited the school's organized media course, which was now "forgettable" and insecurity about whether their work would be reviewed and evaluated with notice so that they could enter universities.
Inverness College UHI is part of the University of Upper Stairs and the Islands.
Diāna Rovlinson, Head and Executive Director of the Inverness College UHI said: "The results of our exams and the success of our students are very important."
This is also confirmed by the excellent review of the Her Majesty's Education Inspectorate (HMIE) this year, as well as by the improved levels of achievement in both further education and higher education over the past year.
As we have done every year, we are reporting all the published results compared to each student predicted.
In the case of this specific course, standard quality assurance measures were taken and the assessment body recently reported on "essential improvements in the provision and management of this assessment" and confirmed that "evaluations were consistent with national standards."
SQA is currently investigating this case at our request.
The SQA press secretary said: "We are pleased that the evaluation of the highest media in 2016 has taken place as planned and that candidates had the opportunity to show their understanding of the subject."
Many candidates have shown good performance and there was a slight increase in the A-C performance rate compared to the same qualification last year.
It was developed in accordance with previous and model documents and in accordance with our course and assessment specifications.
Brothers in prison for samurai's "bloody" sword in Kilmarnok
Jason Braden was attacked with samurai teeth, Nazis and nuns
Two brothers were imprisoned in prison for killing a man with a samurai sword after drug-related robbery in Airshire, which was evaluated as "blood alcohol".
Victim Jason Braden (38) was arrested several times at his home in Kilmarnok on 5 July 2015.
The Supreme Court in Glasgow, James Clark (36) will be sentenced to 22 years in prison for murder.
His brother John (38) was sentenced to 10 years in prison after being sentenced to less severe charges of murder without a prior payment.
When he sentenced both men to prison, Judge Bill Danlops told the brothers that they had committed "an unforgivable, cruel and forestish attack."
He rejected any assumption that Mr. Braden had slept and waited for them to arm himself with a samurai sword.
Judge Danlops added: "You are planning illegal entry together with at least one Nazi and novice."
Jason Braden may also have been a drug addict, but he was a son, father, and friend.
You killed him.
After both men were imprisoned in prison, the criminal police inspector who conducted the investigation said, "John and James Clarke's violent and horrible act has led to Jason Braden's death."
Go to the sun at 38 years of age and under such terrible conditions there is a heart condition that the family needs to survive.
The court had heard earlier that the brothers in Kilmarnoca had decided to seize Mr. Braden’s golden image that they had given him in exchange for drugs.
Both alcohol and drugs went to his house, masked his face with helmets, and armed with a knife and Eastern combat.
It is considered that the sword used in the killing belonged to the dead.
The neighbors said that they saw Clarke's attack on Braden when he sat on the couch at the window and heard his scream.
Prosecutor Richard Godards at the court hearing said, "The assault on this man was sustained, chaotic."
Then the place of slaughter was described as "blooded".
In addition to the wounds from the blades of the blades, Breeden was severely injured during the attack with a troll object.
Three days later he was at Kilmarnokas Krossaus hospital.
Both brothers are not allowed to go to the funeral.
In presenting the evidence, James Clark, who had already been tried 38 times, including the attempted murder, said, "I didn't want it.
John Clark, who has already been tried 23 times, said that he was only involved in helping a brother who, according to him, attacked Braden."
A man is sentenced to imprisonment for shortening and obliterating his child’s age
David Sinclair admitted his guilt at the child's death in his home in Erichkilbraid in 2012.
A man who cut and killed his unborn child in a rage because he did not want to eat was sentenced to seven years and three months in prison.
David Sinclair cut off four months old Joshua when he "lost control at the moment" at his home in East Kilybraid, South Lancashire, on December 6, 2012.
The cause of death was determined only after judicial medical examination.
Sinclair (34) was initially accused of murder but was found guilty of murder without prior payment.
In the Supreme Court of Glasgow, indicting him to prison, Judge Lord Breissidl Sinclair said: "You attack your child's son by scratching him by causing the injuries he's looking at."
When you cut him, you had to know that, but you didn't.
Only after a thorough medical examination you will be aware of what you have done.
Your wife believed you.
Now her feelings are transferred and she can no longer support you.
Lord Breissidl described the consequences of Joshua's death as "catastrophes" for all and added, "Nothing will return to Joshua."
The court had previously found that on the day the child died, Sinclair and his wife, Kersty, went with Joshua to swim and to buy food.
At 5:30 p.m., Kersty Sinclair went to see his mother and sister.
Only 11 minutes later, she was called by Sinclair, who heard "shocked."
He said to her, "Joshua doesn't breathe like he's coming, even coming home right away."
Then he ended the conversation and called 999.
The infant was immediately taken to Hermira’s hospital, where he died.
The cause of Joshua’s death was not clear at first, but he was examined by a team of court medical experts, who found that shortly before the consequences of the trauma of death in the eyes and brains, such injuries were not possible by accident.
One of the experts, Dr. Peter Richards, the neurosurgery consultant at John Redcliffe Hospital in Oxford, said: "It has happened because the child has been hit and thus has suffered injuries, as well as been subjected to more force than ever."
The representative of the defence told the court that Sinclair was "extratingly sorry".
Rio Olympic Games 2016: Hloja Tatone threatens the positions of July Jefimova
To the United Kingdom representative Taton is released from the hands of bronze in the 200 m swimming
British representative Chloe Tatone criticises the participation of the contrary-rated swimmer Julia Jeffimova in Rio after he is executed by the Russian representative in the 200 m swim.
Jefimova, who was allowed to participate in the games following the complaint concerning the prohibition of participation on doping, is fined by leaving Tatoni in the fourth place.
"I would have wanted them to be completely clean games," said the 20-year-old bicycle swimmer.
I haven't decided who's in there.
I'm not satisfied with it, but that's it.
Jeffimova, who fought in the second place, learned about his participation in the games only three days ago.
I don't want to see people get out of sports, but I don't think it's really right.
She was not supposed to participate in the competition, and 20 years of age the old British representative had to make a medal.
Rie Kaneto won Japan's seventh gold medal in 2016 in Rio, defeating Jefimov, who was at the silver medal.
China's representative Jinlinga This was at the bronze, only six hundred seconds in advance of the fourth one remaining Tatoni.
Her British teammate, 20 - year - old Molly Renshaw, finished at 6:00 p.m.
"Remaining in the fourth place is a little disappointment, no matter what's in front of you," Tatone added.
It's a great experience, and I'm a little confused about the fourth place.
I'm so close to the medal, and it would have been a dream.
However, meeting yourself at the end is an excellent experience that I will take with me in the years to come.
It was a little disappointment, but in the long run it will make me strong, and it makes me get closer to the medal, so hopefully the next time I get closer to it.
Tatone was only 0.01 seconds away from the British record of women at the end of the 200 m swimming.
"Every man must give a second chance," - Jeffimova.
Jeffimova, who said he was already tired of answering questions about her doping past, defended his right to start Rio.
In 2013, she was banned for 16 months after anabolic steroids were found in her body.
The Sports Arbitration Court (CAS) stated that athletes cannot be denied participation in the Rio games because they have already been subject to sanctions.
CAS looked at my complaint, and I won.
If someone doesn't like it and has a different opinion, they can turn to CAS," she explained.
I don't support doping, and I've never used it.
In the second case, it certainly was not my fault.
Each person must give another opportunity.
When you go and get a ticket from the prison, no one's gonna put you in jail.
Ben Prauds is a place to swim 50 freestyle
A British record was previously installed to clear the space at the end of a men’s 50 m free-style swimming.
The distance of the Union’s Prauds (21) was 21.54 seconds in order to be the fifth fastest qualified Friday finals (02:44 BST Saturday).
Your delegation is harmless and rude
Indian Sports Minister Vijay Goels Rio has been a very attractive person in the Olympic Games, often manned in the Tribes, encouraged Indian athletes and taken by themselves after their start.
However, he and his large company have apparently caused the anger of the Olympic game organizers due to their uncontrollable behavior, repeatedly trying to break out to the areas of the game without proper accreditation and by reacting abruptly to the tests, reports the Indian News Agency Press Trust of India.
Vijay Goels, photographed in July, justifies his behavior.
On Wednesday, the organizers of the Olympic Games threatened to cancel Goel’s accreditation if his behavior did not improve by sending a warning message after he and his company tried to enter restricted access areas for the tournament competitions at the site and in the arena where the surrender and lecture takes place.
"We have received a number of reports that your sports minister has tried to enter the accredited competition zones with people who do not have accreditation," says the continental manager of Sára Peterson, Rio 2016.
When the staff tried to explain that this was not allowed, the people with the minister became aggressive and rude, and sometimes they broke out along with our staff.
"If our protocol team is aware of any other such behaviour, your sports minister's accreditation will be cancelled and his privileges in the Olympic Games will be cancelled," the letter continued.
The leader of the Indian delegation referred to this case as "from the fly's tails", and Goels himself said that he had done nothing wrong by writing it all as "understand".
On Twitter he wrote: "As far as I know, we have observed all the rules.
We maintain the spirit of the Olympic Games and support our Indian athletes.
Otherwise, this Olympic game in India is full of dreams, there are currently no medals.
Desperate fans of the social media indicated that Michael Felps has won as many medals as India has in its history.
Several prominent candidates have already been excluded, including the shooter Abhinav Bindra, who won the gold medal in Beijing in 2008.
This time he left the fourth.
The wind started money and opportunity," wrote the author of the Sardinian tweet and column author Shoba De.
However, there are still some bright hopes, as there will still be competitions in boxing, golf, tennis, lightweight and, yes, in badminton.
The only Indian winner, Dipa Karmakara, will make the finals of the summer on Sunday, showing his terrible double turn "Death Lens", the Produnova's summer, which only a few other winners have tried.
In the country where 1.25 billion people live, the low number of medals fought in India has always been the cause of confusion.
Analysts say it has countless reasons.
National jealousy is a cricket that is not an Olympic sport.
India has not made a significant contribution to infrastructure and Olympic training - Karmakar’s first gear was made from the old skier’s spare parts.
Parents have always stressed the academic knowledge over sport.
And the authorities responsible for sports have been taken over by corruption.
The International Olympic Committee has deposited India's Olympic Association on violations of its statutes in 2012, as it has elected leaders against whom criminal proceedings have been brought.
In sochos three Indian winter participants were even prevented from representing their country, carrying a flag or wearing any national symbol.
They met as independent athletes.
When people get injuries, the short turbulence JetBlue aircraft route Boston-Sakramento is forced to land in the South Dakota.
On Thursday evening, the JetBlue aircraft was forced to make an emergency landing after 22 passengers and two crew members were injured during the turbulence, reports CBS Sakramamento.
Travel 429 from Boston to Sakramento left in Rapidsit, South Dakota, just before 19:30 evening after local time.
The airline reports that the injured have been sent to the hospital for examination.
JetBlue claims that it has sent personnel to assist the injured, has banned the spare aircraft to be delivered to Rapidsitia to the other passengers of Sakramento.
The Agency for the Control of Drugs (DEA) launches a long-term opportunity for medical marijuana
Unfortunately, the answer is: it is unlikely.
This is a loss of opportunity to further delay treatment for countless people.
To date, only one source of medical marijuana has been approved at the federal level for scientific purposes at Mississippi University.
Apparently a little more positive today, the DEA also announced that it would now allow other places to apply for permission to do the same.
There is hope that the amount of marijuana available for scientific purposes and diversity could be expanded.
Although it will draw attention to good study, it will be largely symbolic, because no matter how many marijuanas are available, if access is still difficult, it has little meaning.
Imagine a product that is highly requested but is stored behind closed doors.
Responding to a request for a product which makes a difficult, understandable decision to produce it more, but never unlocks the door.
This product is marijuana and its location on list 1 is this closed door.
This is an unpleasant situation with medical marijuana.
Since marijuana is a substance listed in list 1 (respectively, after its definition "not currently approved medical use and there is a high potential for its intended use"), there are significant barriers to the lockdown of the doors.
Potential researchers usually focus on the DEA as it grants permission to start scientific studies.
Even if an authorisation is granted for the examination of substances listed in list 1, the authorities must comply with very strict safety rules and set up high-level safety systems that may be costly.
There is also the most subjective consideration of obtaining an authorisation from its academic authority to carry out studies of substances listed 1 in the first place.
Even if individual faculty representatives want to conduct this study, university management may not want problems or potential side effects due to negative press reports.
This happened at the University of Arizona when Dr. Sue Sisley was released from the post after trying to advance medical marijuana trials.
Sysley was finally looking for private funding for his project, and only in April, seven years after the initial project was proposed, her project became the first approved medical marijuana trial to prevent post-traumatic stress for veterans.
Years later, the National Institute for Drug Addiction was entrusted with the key to the latter.
It is currently the largest federal public funding provider of marijuana research and is the only provider of marijuana itself.
Even if there is a higher amount of medical medicine in free circulation, the Institute will still have to approve all the studies it has funded.
However, the problem is the word "disuse".
The representative of San Francisco University Dr. Donald Eibrams, who interviewed his documentary film "Marihuana", said that the main task of the Institute is to study substances in the context of their potential dependence, not as medications.
Ebram draws attention to an important fact.
Even if the study will overcome all the obstacles listed above, the door may still be closed if the intention is to investigate the benefits of medical marijuana rather than the damage it has caused.
Note: In a quick (and, to be recognized, non-scientific) search, 1,434 works on medical marijuana were found in the U.S. National Library of Medicine in the last five years.
In the same search, only 57 works were available for the benefit of medical marijuana.
Most of the studies were about the damage suffered by marijuana, such as "Bad travel due to the anticholinergic effects of marijuana", "pancreatitis caused by marijuana" and "use of marijuana and lung cancer."
Such a disproportion creates a completely distorted view.
The way to the use of medical marijuana is accompanied by surprises and lucidity wherever possible.
As long as the status of list 1 is maintained, without regard to the medical effect, the U.S. Department of Health and Social Affairs maintains a wide range of canabionic patents for medical purposes.
DEA continues to establish marijuana with heroin and LSD as a potential for high-dependence drug, although the main administrative judge Francis Jangs himself objected to it.
Strictly medically, marijuana is safer than many widely consumed foods.
For example, 10 fresh potatoes may cause toxic reactions.
In comparison, it is physically impossible to eat so many marijuana in order to incur death.
Marijuana is one of the safest therapeuticly active substances known to humans.
By rational analysis, marijuana can be safely used in medical care, as appropriate.
It should be said again that it was proposed by the DEA judge himself.
And yet, almost 30 years later, little has changed.
Whether we realize it or not, all of us accept certain dosage fluctuations in our daily lives.
Maybe we don't always have the energy to say it loud or we're so stupid or stupid that nobody seems to have noticed it.
As regards liquefaction in the context of the federal medical marijuana policy, it is necessary to have the strength to present the facts at all times.
The lives of patients, such as Charlotte Fiji, whose attacks are reduced by medical marijuana, and many other lives depend on it.
The fact that the ground can do so much good and remains behind closed doors is worth speaking at the highest level.
Bloody Beeroots: Donalds Traps "Blonde Berlusconi"
Bloody Beeroots is known in the context of electronic dance music
The musicians say that Tramps dominates the media like Berlusconi
You know, we've been to Berlusconi in Italy, and Tramps is looking after Blonde Berlusconi," the founder of the electronic music band "The Bloody Beetroots" said CNN.
The candidate of the President of the Republic and the political magnet of the Italian media, both known as his resounding personalities, the ability to attract press attention and the changed stories of the media.
The composition of "Bloody Beetroots" is familiar with its electronic dance music and has worked with various artists, starting with the legendary Seru Polo Margartni and ending with the electropop singer Grete Svabo Beču in 2013 in the song "Chronicles of a Fallen Love."
Rifo was born in Basano del Grapa, near Venice, Italy, in 1977, about the time of Pancroc’s birth, and the numbers "1977" were placed on the chest.
"The English language is not my native language, so I don't understand everything about your world," said Rifo, hiding behind the black fee he is familiar with.
I am trying to explore, and I am trying to improve my understanding of your culture.
Rifo invited Americans to watch the "Videos", a documentary that explores the Berlin Monopols over the Italian media.
The documentary is about how "Berlusconi made Italy a trap," said Rifo, adding that Trappam had a similar effect on America.
"You see how a person can completely turn the system and dislodge everything... by himself," he said.
I don't think Trump is good for this country.
Two Turkish sailors imprisoned in prison for more than 500 million pounds of drugs
Two Turkish men were sentenced to more than 500 million pounds of cocaine smuggling on board a ship in the North Sea, each sentenced to at least 20 years in prison.
Momins Sahins and Emins Ozmens were found guilty after a trial in the Supreme Court in Glasgow after about 100 miles from the Aberdina coasts on the MV Hamal deck were found three tons of Class A drugs.
Detainment in 2015 is the largest single-supply of cocaine held in Europe at any time.
Momina Sahin and Eminina Ozmen sentenced to a prison sentence for his role in a large-scale drug deal
The valuable cargo found on the ship is one of the largest in British history
Narcotics were found hidden in a specially equipped secret on a trailer registered in Tanzania, which sailed from Istanbul to Tenerife and then to the North Sea.
It was stopped by the British fleet frigate "HMS Somerset" and the border forces "HMC Valiant".
Sahins (47) was sentenced to 22 years but Ozmens (51) was sentenced to 20 years in the Supreme Court of Glasgow.
Justice Lord Kinkleivens told men that the amount of drugs was not only "significant but ambitious", and that the smuggling of drugs has a "disgusting effect" on people and the surrounding society.
He said: "You have been involved in commercially in the most extensive operation, including the transport of cocaine by ship, in an operation that crossed international and truly intercontinental borders."
He said that Captain Sahins was not a "drug in the forest", but he had an important role in the crime, while the second Captain Ozmen was "killing to some extent less".
The inspectors went to Hamal's deck after collecting information from the French customs authority DND, and when it landed in Aberden, they went through the steel plate, accessing a secret compartment where 128 cables were found with cocaine with a weight of 3.2 tonnes, as the approximate value in the black market is 512 million barrels.
"MV Hamal" was checked last year by the Royal Fleet.
There were three tons of cocaine on board.
During the inspection of vessels, it was found that it had been bottled in ballast tanks for tonnes of Class A drugs
The ship was on its way from the Bosphorus Sea narrow to South America before it was stopped in the North Sea.
Access to this place was discovered under the cabinet in one of the crew’s premises, and the sample was cemented.
Sahins and Ozmen were found to be responsible for the transport and concealment of cocaine on board the ship from 20 February to 23 April of the previous year and for the delivery of cocaine during the period from 21 April to 23 April.
Both uncondemned men who have worked in the shipping industry since the end of school continue to claim that they are not guilty, yet accept the judgment they have sworn.
The charges against four other men are missing evidence.
Sahina's lawyer, Jonathan Krows, said that married father of two children is "glorified mother".
He said, "Someone who was involved in drug trafficking."
Someone who was able to drive a ship.
Looking at the drug hierarchy, Sahins certainly does not have drugs at the bottom of the tree, but somewhere below.
The huge quantity of cocaine on board means that it had to be transported by road
Police went through the whole ship for days before drugs were distributed through these boxes
Sahina asked questions about his master's work on Hamal in February 2015, the court heard.
Mr. Krova said that he was "astounded" by the fact that the events of the daughter (9) and the son (13) were to be left behind and that he "just wanted to go back to Turkey".
Both men have not seen their families since their arrest in April 2015 because families are still struggling to obtain visas.
Ozmena's lawyer Di Murs said he wanted to see his family "indiscriminately", but he knew that in the future it would "not be possible".
Speaking after today's judgments, Scottish prosecutor David Harvey said: "The international drug trade is not bordered, and we whose task it is to tear it down are working increasingly closely together to achieve that we are one step ahead.
"The success of Scotland in the persecution of criminals is indeed at global level, and in this case we have suffered considerable economic losses to the representatives of organised crime."
Narcotics were planted in all the shells on the ship, including under the floor.
This smuggling pack inspectors found hidden in the ship’s laundry room
Mr. Harvija added: "Hamal" was identified by intelligence from the French authorities, and by rapid cooperation with Tanzania, where the ship is registered, the Attorney General, who also allowed the boat to be caught.
"Our investigation then came from Gijana, who provided access to essential data on shipments to Spain, who provided us with very valuable information about the ship's detention sites in the Canary Islands.
We also cooperated with colleagues in Denmark, Norway and the United States to combine specific evidence elements.
Despite the thorough investigation that Hamal is being carried out with a large number of drugs, representatives of the British authorities in international waters on board could not catch without the permission of the Tanzanian government - something like what they had never given before.
Sju Peitna, Head of International Justice and Organised Crime Control of the Office of the Royal Criminal Cases (CPS) said: "In the quick and accurate conduct of the CPS's criminal law council, the Tanzanian authorities were able to get permission to board the ship within 24 hours of receiving information.
Under international maritime law, British officials are not entitled to catch international waters on board a vessel flying the flag of another State unless that State grants special legal permission to do so.
Without our criminal law council, there would be a great risk that the ship could escape and that we could never call these people responsible.
Photographer Brians Romeigins is studying the famous "East Express" train
Photograph by Brians Romeigins from Rotterdam took pictures of this abandoned train in Belgium
In the images you can see the inside of the rolling train, the seats carved, the windows with dust and the narrow car cabin
It has already been designated as an Eastern express car, but it belonged to the Belgian national railway company
The city researcher has taken these significant photographs showing that passengers' train wastes have been reached, which has once been one of the best modes of movement.
Its flower times have long passed, and the train car and locomotive have been left to understand the train depot in Belgium, where they have become the object of a popular photographer and adventure searcher review.
Photographer Brians Romeidgens, 40, has taken these terrible photographs, showing the inside of the train's moving, slammed seats, dusted windows and a compressed driver's cab
The train car and locomotive are left to understand the train depot in Belgium, where they have become the object of a popular photographer and adventure searcher review.
These trains were a symbol of beauty when they operated under the legendary name from 1883 to 2009.
The locomotives were used by the Belgian national railway company about 50 years ago.
After 126 years on the track, the last train operating with the name of the Eastern Express went from Strasbourg to Vienna in December 2009, closing the famous history phase.
Eastern expression was a famous route in Paris - Istanbul.
When it was launched in 1883 (operator - La Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits) it was known as Express d'Orient in French.
It became an Eastern expression in 1891, and by 1930 it had already been a regular route throughout Europe.
This should not be mixed with the private "Venice Simplon-Orient-Express".
There's left a very small "Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits" luxury car.
In the narrow cab of this photograph in which the equipment is in the pipe, measuring instruments and open guides are still installed
The Romans said that the cab of the motorist was "claustrophobic in its own way, and the locomotive noise was probably unbearable."
The abandoned locomotive and wagon have become the object of a popular photography and adventure search.
After visiting the forgotten train in Belgium, the Romans MailOnlineTravel said: "I could really feel how it was used in its flowers."
Ladies are accompanied by beautiful dresses on high heels.
Grima artist Katrina Gelovey overtop series "Arrested Development" in Bustera Blut
Thanks to her impressive grasping skills, reviews and conversions, you're texting and YouTube censorship Ketlina Gelovey has come to the fan army.
However, her latest conversions to Buster Blut from "Arrested Development" are completely unbelievable by any standards.
Three minutes in a video clip uploaded to her Kiki G YouTube channel, Gelovija slowly and constantly turns itself into a failed image with a hook in place.
At the end of the clip, she even uses an audio recording from the show's dangerous but at the same time in a great performance.
The talented grima artist begins his video in his, blonde woman image.
Then, with the help of the slowed photographs, she slowly turns into a brilliant "memmemmemmemmemmemmelin", which is already derogating from the hair, and which is Tony Heila Buster's Blue.
Gelovija does this with colored contact lenses, shadeing and drawing contours around the nose and eyes, as well as drawing the Baster face on her head.
Wise methods: Using the slowed photography, she slowly turns into Tony Heila Buster's Blue.
During her video she also takes over the character and manners of the cult TV image, as well as attracting the metal.
The video on YouTube has been viewed more than 45,000 times, and quite quickly the skills of the Grimm artist have appeared to be glamorous comments:
"You're extremely talented," someone recorded under a video posted by Geloveja.
In her video she also takes over cult TV image personality and manners
"I like how you keep it all in the picture," said someone else.
Videoblogger Ketlina Gelovey had previously successfully converted into "Parks and Recreation" by Ron Svenson.
She told her followers on YouTube that in the future she expected to form gray conversions every week.

Lancashire's father is expelled from school for wearing T-shirts with bad names
The father of two children was expelled from the children's school for entering their sports day in T-crecle with an insulting inscription.
Craigs Makbets (36) from Children's City in Lancashire says that he "didn't wear a tie with the inscription "Laija and Dr.!
However, despite the fact that when he noticed his mission and drew on the opposite side of the T-cricket, the next day he found that he was forbidden to enter the school territory.
The only father, who worked for four years as the principal of the Park School in Kolne, Children, was unable to go back to the children because of the ban, and the staff even called for social services and police.
Craigs Makbets (36) from Children says that he was not admitted to school territory after having arrived on the children’s sports day in a prettier T-cricket.
Mr. Baby accused the school principal of overreacting to Sarah Midjly.
He says that he has been unjustly punished because, before going to watch his two children's games, he has made a mistake after the T-cricket.
A father who no longer works as a school manager said, "It was a mistake and a misunderstanding on my part."
I don't think about the sports day and I'll hurry up when I pull it off.
At the end of the event, we had our father's competition, and the director noticed my T-shirt and said that it was not appropriate.
I apologized and cut it on the other side, and that ended the case.
However, a 36 - year - old man said that he had received a letter from the president of the school leaders the next day that he was invited to a meeting with the director, but he did not see the need to do so because he had already apologized.
"The school director then called me and said that I was forbidden to enter the school territory," said Mr. Bärnlie.
I learned that after the sports day some parents on Facebook had become concerned and that many people were interested in it.
Anyone who thinks about it would say it's overplayed.
Mr. Macbeta, who is the editor of the online Love Mini magazine, said that he did not think he could even come back to the children on the last day of the semester because of the ban.
However, this was the reason for the call from school and social services.
On T-Crecle was the image of Craig Charles Lister from the BBC cult comedy "The Red Rake" with one of his iconic statements "Laija and Dr.."
He said, "I told them I wasn't there because I was forbidden to go to school.
Then he called me from the social services and asked why I wasn't behind the girl.
The school also called the police because I hadn't come back to the girl in 40 minutes."
Mr. Makbeta claims that he was told that he could no longer enter school and that the ban would apply until further notices.
He also mentioned that he had been warned that he could apply 500 pounds [500 pounds] of fine if he was caught in violation of this provision.
Sara Midjly, Director of the Park Primary School, said that the case is now over.
Sara Midjly, Director of the Park Primary School, said: "It is time to confirm that Mr. Makbetta has withdrawn from office and is no longer the head of our school."
This thing is now over, and I hope to return to the usual school life in September."
Children’s city counselor Joe Kuny said that the school has clear policies and guidelines.
"We all need to keep in mind that when taking on positions as a counselor or leader, you are subject to higher standards, and unfortunately this time he did not meet those standards," he said.
Counselor Jonathan Nixon added that he did not think that the school should apply the ban and that there was a thunderstorm.
Mr. Nixon added, "The wearing of such a T-shirt was stupid, and he apologized for it too."
The Lancashire police confirmed that they had been called from school, but they did not arrive.
Recently, the former factory's VEF premises located on the streets of Liberty have been renovated - there are several IT companies, the sector has already begun to call this area a local Silicium street.
The other VEF area, including Bürzaunes, is also developing.

The nature of the science centre building following it is similar to the one designed and constructed in round 1 to the academic centre of nature and its work, which is similar to the most important technical and technological parameters, as well as to the number of scientific and academic staff and students in the building.
The competition law had been added to the SIA Sixth style sketch project, which provided all possible suppliers with information on the development vision of the University of Latvia Academic Centre in Tornkal, including a list of the planned objects of the University of Latvia Academic Centre, which indicates the name of each particular object, the estimated area of the object, the planned year of the transfer of the object and other information.
At the end of 2015, the 6th style of the SIA carried out meta corrections to the complex area of the buildings complex of the University of Latvia in Tornjakal, which resulted in clarification of the location and interconnection of the buildings of the Academic Centre, as well as the transport organisation in and around the meta area.
An invitation to tender shall be issued for the consignment of a medicinal product in the road compartment.
VAS Latvia's road driver has announced a purchase for a mechanised medicine to be sold in the road compartments in the regions of Latvia and Pieriga, the LAU informs.
The property is divided into 9 lots: Alūksnes, Daugavpils, Jäkabpils, Jelgavas, Rezeknes, Valmieras, Talsa and Riga road areas.
Applicants may submit an offer for one or more lots.
In order to improve the transparency of the roads and of the surrounding areas, it is necessary to facilitate the flow of water from the road, as well as to limit the position of the road and the formation of the ball.
The most valuable handling of the medicinal product is for farmers in the Tals road area at a total of 28 motorways of 637 km, in the Valmiera road area of 20 motorways of 432 km and in Alūksne at 17 motorways of 384 km.
It has already been reported that in June, the company completed the pulsating of the product on the main and most important regional asphalt roads, but on less important regional roads and on the local highways, the holder of the VAS Latvia Roads planned to entrust part of the pulsing work to farmers.
"We have the opportunity to make more effective use of the funding granted to road maintenance works, while giving farmers the opportunity to apply fully the technique and earn," stressed the Chairman of the Board of Directors Vladimir Kononov of the VAS Latvia Roads.
The time limit for submission of tenders shall be August 22.
Legal protection: Demagogy on the mandatory health insurance model with additional financial burden on citizens is not subject to any criticism.
Any demagogy of compulsory health insurance, which would impose a direct and substantial burden on the public, does not withstand any criticism, is considered by Lawyer Juris Janson.
Janson met with Health Ministers Andu Chakš today to discuss the situation in the health sector.
After the meeting, the journalists were told that the sector financing model offered by the Minister of Health was a sustainable and developed health care system that would make it more accessible to patients.
He noted, however, that in this case, additional funding for health care is needed because it is currently insufficient.
Janson also stressed that any demagogy of compulsory health insurance, which would impose a direct and high pay burden on citizens, would not be criticized, especially when the Netherlands model is called.
Janson said that the Netherlands gives health 11% of the domestic product, while Latvia only 3%.
Therefore, the government and Parliament must be responsible enough to understand that this meeting point must rise from the point of view, the law enforcement officer said and added that otherwise the model proposed by the Ministry of Health (VM) would not work.
Chaksa thanked the lawyer for the support and pointed out that the main concern is that the patient should be approached by a doctor, which means that the health care system needs additional funding.
The Minister also pointed out that the planned additional EUR 35 million next year would only make the most acute things possible for oncology patients and birth care professionals.
As a result, the VM has drawn up a plan and submitted a request for an additional EUR 41 million to be granted to health care in order to reduce the numbers of specialists and investigations.
"The question of priorities is whether or not funds will be available," Chaksha said.
This amount does not include an increase in remuneration for doctors.
Commenting on the fact that the doctors are not aware that the VM is driving all three options of the health care financing model, including those that provide for additional payments to patients, Chaksha said that the government was given the opportunity to move all three models.
Janson also added that by moving all three models, it is possible to demonstrate clearly that Latvia is not ready to impose additional burdens on the population.
It has already been reported that VM will defend a variant of the health care financing model that does not provide for an increase in the overall tax burden, but requires a part of the social tax to be redirected to health, the summary of the conceptual report on the change in the model for the financing of the Latvian health care system.
At the same time, the Ministry pointed out that the best option of funding the health model will be selected as a result of the discussions by the end of September.
Local grasses are ready.
Arbūzi has this year been recognised by the owner of Rolands Dambis of Grobinės municipality of Medzes pajata.
We've already bought the works on the Liepaja market.
The regional newspaper Kursas Time reports that several early varieties began, but later the bubbles were well off.
"This year the grass grows better than last year," says the great owl breeder in the town of Rucava, Artis Kūsis.
As for the weather, it was much more favorable in the summer than in the past when it was cold and windy.
The Riga Liepaja theatre shows begin.
On August 12th and 13th, the Daily Theatre will visit the Liepaja Theatre in Riga, offering viewers both the performances awarded for the "Spielman's Night" award and the bright intrigue - the solo performance of the director of Liepaja Theatre Herbert Laukstein, the portal Delfi informs the theatre representatives.
On the evening of August 12th, viewers will be shown the human drama "The Lion Man", which was studied by director Laura Groza-Kiber.
It is a story about a real historical person - John Meric - who lived in the Victorian era in London and in his body, was called Zilon Man because of the deformed body of the disease.
Egons Dombrovskis, who has received the title "Spielman's Night" nomination "Annual Actors" for the role of America.
As critic Norman Aktos describes his performance, Meriks is "through the heart" a role in which the birth of the image cannot be repeated".
On 13 August, the presentation "Portraits" will be offered to the viewers.
The exhibition has received six "Play Night" nominations, including "The Big Year Exhibition".
The director has created the imagination as a beautiful portrait gallery, while giving each play a great role to each image, each of them is both a center and a background.
The exhibition consists of a number of mini demonstrations that are finally closed in the same health.
It is an observation of the nature of man, where the main conflict is between true emotions and a cold calculation, quickly discovering how man changes in different situations - each of the heroes is sometimes a wolf, who for the sake of his wealth and his own benefit is trapped in the surrounding, sometimes sheep, which are trapped by another.
On the other hand, both of these dates will be played in the Small Hall by the director of Liepaja theatre Herbert Laukstein's solo show "Man who is more from the elevator" in the Polish state of Galina.
It's not sad, but it's a full story of how a person's only friend becomes an elevator.
Despite the capsulated stylistic that dominates the visual image, however, the dominant intonation of the study is bright and even optimistic.
"A man who is more of an elevator" is not about the determination of loneliness and age, but about the worth of life to love.
Also, if it appears that there is nothing," critic Līga Ulberte wrote about the performance.
Tickets can be bought on all occasions in "Balecian Paradises" boxes and on the Internet.
Detective Olga: My work is not serious, but real life.
I already have a half-way waiting for Olga Zelīka, owner and investigator of the Riga Detective Agency.
She smiles loudly and leaves a very positive impression.
Dressed in white trousers and white jacket - a very elegant woman who cares about all my ideas about what a woman-detector should be.
She's waiting for me with champagne, from which I'm kind of responding.
I'm telling you that I spoke to her because I thought it was interesting that the woman was dealing with such an unusual thing.
This has always been the work of men.
Olga has higher legal education - master's degree.
At the same time, they worked with the criminal police.
Realizing that he wanted something of his own and founded his company.
He's got enough knowledge.
"I really don't want to go back to the police," Olga says.
It's routine.
There, in the criminal police, we were investigating cases, collecting information.
We're working with suspects.
"This year we celebrate the 10-year anniversary of the Riga Detective Agency."
She calls for the anniversary celebrations: "There will be no drinking."
Everyone's solid people.
The question about her business, Olga says, "Business is very specific."
For the first five years, I had a team.
Then I realized that working on a team sometimes is dangerous.
It's a business where, if someone does not work professionally, they can get into a very bad situation.
If journalists are the fifth power, we're the second.
The sphere is, of course, not simple.
Many try to buy us out because we are involved in cheating on our marriage mate.
That's what people think!
Many come and ask whether hearing aids can be applied to attract dogs.
Many have seen films.
Detective business is serious.
"It's information collection," Olga says.
If there's a crime under the law, I have to warn you.
Let's burn green tea and laugh - to be at least a cross to hold and engage in negotiations.
I've had a client whose husband is constantly sitting.
She was looking for protection, of course.
We also have protection.
Her husband was a maniac.
At first everything is always beautiful and good, but then it starts.
"It's the most dangerous thing," Olga says.
The psyche is broken, and what happens is that you can treat like a cow.
That was a bad end.
God don't give it to me by suicide.
It's very dangerous.
People become victims at some point.
"Many women try to leave their families and then return," she says.
I refused the last order.
"It happened the first time in my life," Olga says.
There was such a strange situation.
The woman had been married, she had a son.
"Her husband sat down and made her invalid," Olga remembers.
I believe that a woman has a mother’s instinct and, first of all, must protect her children.
When all this happened, she came to me with a request to be released from her husband.
There are people who are obsessed with rebelliousness.
The most dangerous thing is that the mother noticed it.
I can't understand that.
Her child is now disabled.
We could not find the body once, and the dog was very helpful.
The drug department can't happen without dogs at all.
"I understand that there are adequate people and there are those who do not have a whole psyche," she says.
Of course, the facts of fraud are relevant.
Or there is a division within the family and information needs to be collected.
It's clear what the guilty party is.
The last thing I have been thinking about is when other congregations have been mentioned.
That's interesting, because sometimes men are squeezing, now women.
Even the best friends are fighting!
Women's "out" assemblies are worth 100 and more thousands of euros.
Women need to be careful when going abroad because they can be sold into slavery.
"Latvian women are intelligent and have a lot of confidence," Olga says.
There have been cases when couples go abroad to get married a second time.
It's not legal.
Olga relates that she had a husband who was like Jesus Christ.
Long growth, long hair.
When I was 22, there was a tragedy.
He had a serious head injury.
He came back as a completely different person.
"I'm pulling them," Olga remembers.
It could be compared to hell, it was terrible.
The question is, what's the most unusual thing you've ever encountered, Olga says, "All are special, but it's the most obvious thing where trust is used."
That's when the band's "defense" band.
Takes away and doesn't pay back the money.
If you have a lawyer's education and experience in the police, you can work as a detective.
"One thing is to feel like a detective, the other to be," Olga says.
The situations in which we deal with distrust are extremely worrisome because women are often not ready to resolve the situation.
They are not ready to accept the result.
This is an unexpected situation because a person is not prepared to lose his family.
Not every woman was willing to accept reality.
Often, young girls who feel a sense of money use wealthy men.
One man who pursued his wife said that she could not be loved because all her wives had cheated on her.
"He had been married three times," Olga remembers.
At that time, there is already a man's problem if all his wives cheat on him.
Olga tells of a man who left his wife and all his children, and she asked him if he had ever raised his hand against her.
Above all, I sat him down all the time, he answered.
In such cases, I will refuse to work.
I think it's interesting how things are handled - whether photographs are taken and shown to a spouse if there's evidence of fraud.
How's that going?
"Parallely detective work exists for the protection of personal data", Olga tells.
This is a provocative issue.
One law allows everything to be done, the other does not allow anything.
We can take such photos and videos for personal interest, but not for public viewing.
If a case is brought before a court which does not comply with the law, there may be serious problems.
To become a detective, education and experience must also be mentally healthy and meet the criteria.
We don't get fingerprints, that's what the police do.
I tell my clients - to get rid of the serials, here is real life!
In fact, when I worked in the (police) system, dogs had to be used, they were very helpful.
"A drug department can't happen without dogs at all," Olga says.
Some customers are looking at me in connection with a murder investigation, but I don't like to do things like that.
These are very serious things.
Now there are more and more customers because women tend to compete for men.
It used to be different.
Now women are enjoying themselves, but men are sitting at home with children.
"Of course, most people are suffering right," says Olga.
I like Deile's carnage.
He says, "Stop worrying and start living real.
We all know that if you're on one side, you have to turn the other, but you can't!
You have to say that you don't like it.
It must not be done.
You can’t be afraid to lose what’s bothering you!
You must not become a pettyist, and what we are allowed to do with ourselves is what happens to us.
Yes, my first case was directly related to the husband’s unfaithfulness when the woman was not willing to accept the fact that the husband was cheating on him.
She called all the time and demanded what she had to do.
"I now ask all clients if they are willing to accept the situation when they know that a man really is cheating on them," Olga says.
It's not fun, it's life.
If you're coming and something detective, you have to take responsibility.
It's not a theater, it's a show, it's a real life.
I'm also an expert.
It is a heart thing and is related to Japanese medicine - treatment with hands.
It's a very interesting thing.
Why did I start working on it?
This is associated with a large amount of adrenaline, and you need something to calm down.
We need not only to calm down, but to restore energy, to the light.
"People leave my office positively and contented," Olga tells.
She has signs at the wall office, and Olga tells that they are written, not with the help of the other, but with her fingers.
I didn't just do it until I got there, the book about my needs literally stuck in my hands.
I'll feel it as a sign.
However, it is very personal.
You need to know more about it here.
Olga also sings.
It's her greeting.
All of us are waiting for creativity.
I played guitar for 11 years.
I've recorded songs and clips.
I'm positive and funny, but I need to rest to recover.
Others save alcohol, I need it.
Alcohol in the stomach.
The police use it a lot because work is full of stress.

I'm interested in sports and things.

Detective work has a narrow limit when work comes into your life.
"It's a work that shouldn't be allowed to live," she says.
The question of how you can combine your work with your private life is, "My loved one is in Italy."
We have very strong feelings.
At that time there is the most real love in my life.
I've had enough to think about her, and I already feel better.
Detectives usually don't trust him, but he's taken my job.
Actually, I'm separating work from private life.
I'm not even in this business.
I've got a point to make.
By the time I was a child, I had seen more than anyone else.
Thanks to the need, intuition is open.
There's a lot of detectives, but they're actually working - little.
In any case, it is work with brains, and it is difficult to unlock.
You also need some rest.
"Others you can't recover," Olga admits.
The most difficult case I've ever worked with is the story of Constancia.
I spent a year working on it.
The man literally cheated on his wife.
I did so, however, that the child and Mom went to England - far from danger.
There was no other option.
We mustn't be jealous.
We're looking for compassion.
You must not do this.
We have to worry about every day that we have.
Thank God.
Every day, three good things must be told to someone else.
A good work should be done or a day should be spent.
We can't do that with men.
That's a big mistake.
Understandably, we have a man, not a child, and we need him to take care of us.
If it's not right, you have to turn around and leave.
You can go to church, it's been very helpful to me.
You don't have to be a fan, but do what you like and help.
Nothing will change if you don't change, you have to leave and you have to change your life.
In no case should you put yourself and your children at risk.
You don't have to sit down and wait for something.

How better to prepare for the family photo session.
The summer is still running full - time, as is the immediate course of the current school year, which families tend to live in pictures.
To illustrate everyone looking happy and beautiful, it is worth considering how to prepare for the photo session in advance.
The advice "Ihappymama" is provided by a multi-child mother, Alexander Nesterenko and a professional photographer, Marina Levickaj.
It has to be photographed in nature, because it is much more natural and more harmonious.
The study makes it much more difficult for children to feel comfortable and relaxed.
It is recommended to choose a uniform style of clothing for the entire family, preferably in one color range.
For example, Alexandra says that she chooses clothing for all six members of her family so that the clothes are not more than three color tones and may be less than the inscriptions on the clothes.
Don't forget about the good mood.
Ask yourself, laugh, play, but in no way interfere and psycho if children are not as obedient as they would like.
And, look, the following tips are already available from the professional photographer's pura charge!
You have to understand exactly what you want to do during the photo session and tell me about their photographer.
For some they will be beautiful, accurate children and ideally formed family image, for others - "living is what it is", that is, in the images of the will to see true, true emotions, or, as to love to say itself photograph, - "escapeous back", "captured eyes", "to burn".
Of course, it happens that someone also wants "two in one", but it happens rarely.
In any case, when you go to the photo session, you have to understand that they are only a few hours away from your life, and the less you'll be impressed, the better.
You're yourself - not even a hard mom who works, is ready to eat, is growing up and it's still, and not a busy dad who talks over the phone forever.
And neither is he that dwelleth in thee of a strange woman.
Be a family, remember how great it is to be each other’s faces, smile at each other, and laugh at each other.
And then the photographer's task will be only to realize the true moments of emotion that governs between you.
If you have chosen a photograph, trust him.
Stop asking 250 times to show what has come together, listen to his advice in the choice of clothing, instead of the best frames.
Put all the necessary clothes on and off so that the day of the photo session no longer needs to be worked on.
Plan a route and think about how much time you will need to get to the photo session (especially if photography takes place in the study and time is limited).
If you have young children, choose the time for the photo session that corresponds to the withdrawal day regimen so that it does not happen at a time when the baby usually sleeps on a dinar.
And, of course, to bring with your children food, biscuits, water and favorite toys (to use almonds and sweets only in extreme situations).
She prepared Dad that he might need to remove the bags, but she didn't usually write them in these tips, and only the photographers know what the problem is, she recognizes Marina.
Don't drink too much water before the photo session and sleep well before it.
And it would still be recommended after the photo session to arrange some fun for everyone together.
Go to the park of attraction, eat some sweetness, have fun with the slippers - which the family likes more.
At the same time, you will have obtained excellent pictures and pleasant memories of the day together.
Krasnopjorovs and Fadejeva: Minimum wage raising - a miracle or a brake for the economy?
The issue of minimum wages in public discussions is almost either the status of the holy cow: either the promotion must be supported or the mention of any unspoken, general phrases.
In view of the significant increase in the risk of economic stagnation (just barely avoiding the technical recession), it is important to stress that raising the minimum wage is not a miracle that will reduce income inequality with one house, bring Latvia's wages closer to Western Europe's level and fill the national budget.
On the contrary, if the minimum wage goes too far, it is more harmful than beneficial because it reduces the competitiveness and employment of businesses, especially in low-income sectors and regions.
At first glance, despite several wage increases in the post-crisis period, the minimum wage in Latvia does not seem to be so high as to bring about a substantial reduction in the competitiveness of businesses by the average of some ten euros a year - only 370 euros, while in some European Union (EU) countries the minimum wage is about half a thousand.
However, a similar scenario is seen when compared to the average wage in Latvia (%) - the minimum wage in Latvia (44%) is higher than the EU average.
Since the share of the minimum wage beneficiaries in Latvia is significantly higher than in neighbouring countries (Latvia - 17%, Lithuania - 11%, Estonia - 6%[1]), the same minimum wage increase is binding on most companies.
According to the results of the Latvian Bank's survey, each of the five Latvian companies replied that, by increasing the minimum wage in early 2014, it was important or very important to increase the prices of the products.
This means that, firstly, the minimum wage increase was partially financed by consumers (i.e. by the Latvian population); secondly, the increase in prices for several companies meant loss of competitiveness on both the domestic market and abroad (i.e. increased imports and limited exports).
Because of the lower competitiveness and smoking production levels, almost every fifteen years Latvia’s company was important for the dismissal of workers (meaning greater unemployment and emigration).
In addition, almost every eleven companies replied that it was important for them to limit the recruitment of new employees to the minimum pay.
It is worth remembering that the minimum wage in Latvia was not changed in 2011-2013.
Therefore, even if the assessment of the raising of the 2014 minimum wage showed an important improvement in productivity, this does not yet mean that a similar result could be expected in 2017 (the increase in the fourth minimum wage could gradually exacerbate productivity opportunities).
Another important result is - because of the minimum wage increase, it was also important for several companies to increase the remuneration of employees who deserve more than the minimum wage.
Therefore, the impact of the minimum wage was significant even for those companies where none of the employees received the minimum wage.
In recent years, the minimum wage increase in all three Baltic countries has exceeded the increase in nominal labour productivity (real labour productivity + inflation).
Therefore, the further increase in the minimum wage, which is not supported by the increase in labour productivity, (even though the overall level is relatively low in the euro) will have a negative impact on the competitiveness and employment of businesses.
In assessing the eligibility of the minimum wage, an analysis of the average economic performance is not sufficient.
It is also necessary to assess whether raising the minimum wage is in the "panesama" sectors and regions where the minimum wage is the most frequently used.
The results of the Bank of Latvia's survey show that employees with minimum wages are the highest in small enterprises (the number of employees is between 10 and 19 employees; 25%).
At the end of 2013, the share of employees in industrial and service sectors with minimum wages was higher (16% and 19% respectively) than trade (15%), construction (11%) and financial and insurance sectors (2%).
On the other hand, Latvia, where the minimum wage is 64% of the average wage (and more than two thirds of the average wage in the private sector), can suffer further growth by reducing labour demand (i.e. maintaining its already high unemployment) and promoting the sustainability of the shadow economy.
Some indications show that the growth of the minimum wage in 2015 (a total of 27%) has slowed the development of Latgale.
For example, Latgale is the only region in Latvia where unemployment was higher in 2015 than in 2013.
It should be noted that there is no region in Estonia and Lithuania that would so significantly leave the average wage from the rest of the country.
In Estonia, for example, the average wage in all regions is at least twice the minimum wage established by the country.
The lowest wages in Lithuania are in the Taragese region, but also there was 54% of the average wages in 2015 (after two rapid minimum wage increases in 2016 this figure could reach 58%).
In the discussions, the time-consuming call for a minimum wage to be raised up to 68% of the average wage in the country (e.g. here) lacks economic justification and is not implemented in the short term or in the long term.
Firstly, such a high figure from the average wage or even so close to it is not in any EU country.
Secondly, this would mean raising the minimum wage above the average wage in several sectors of the economy (which would mean the bankruptcy and massive dismissal of these companies), such as clothing, leather products, fish processing, food services and veterinary services; it is also more than the current average wage in the private sector of Latgale.
The raising of the minimum salary from January to January 2017 in the month of 400-410, as currently offered by the Ministry of Welfare, would make the minimum salary in Latvia (% of the average salary) one of the highest in the EU.
If nominal productivity increases by 4% but the minimum wage is at least twice as fast, it has clearly negative effects on the competitiveness and employment of companies.
Such negative effects will be most common in sectors and regions where the current minimum wage is often used, for example in Latvia.
The fact that we cannot now allow a significant increase in the minimum wage means that other mechanisms must be used to support low-wage beneficiaries.
The immediate effect can be achieved by travelling with the public income tax at a minimum (within the limits of the budgetary possibilities).
Insufficient levels of education, inadequate education and poor quality of education, as well as unsatisfactory health (commonly due to the expensive and long-term range of medical services) are mentioned among the real causes of income inequality.
During the interview, 521 responses were received from the Latvian company to the minimum wage increase in January 2014.
The survey took place within the framework of the project for the Wage Dynamics Network (WDN) of the European System of Central Banks.
These figures represent companies with a number of employees not less than 10.
It also explains the proportion of low-employers with minimum salaries in construction.
11 fires are registered in Latvia on the last day, showing operational information from the National Fire and Rescue Service (VUGD).
In Latvian terms, the biggest fires had arisen in the town of Ogres novad of Ogresgal, where in the 80 square meters area of the fuel unit was unmanaged in the residential house and in the railway street of Jäkabpil, where with an open fire filled with sparks in the 30 square meters area.

Legendal editor Hafington leaves "The Huffington Post".
Arianna Hafington, co-founder and editor-in-chief of The Huffington Post's influential U.S. media holder and editor-in-chief, announced the company's departure after 11 years.
The Huffington Post, created in 2005 and awarded with the Pulicera Prize, which offers every day both serious policy and economic journalism, as well as the reflection of Internet sensations in entertainment, is considered a source of media development during the time of the rapid development of digital technology solutions.
The media, starting its work in 2005, offered innovative and interactive content solutions for its time under conditions where there was no tweet yet, but Feisbuk was only popular among students in national colleges.
Shortly after the Republican Party representative George Bush, President Hafington of the United States, did not hide the fact that media journalists represent liberal values, and with such a view of the world, ready news material.
Now on Hafington's tweet, he found that he was about to start a new business after he left - he's planning to set up a "Trive Global" startup that would address the health and overload of employees.
At the moment, it is not known who could stand in her place under the leadership of The Huffington Post.
During her work, the portal refused to comment anonymously, stressing to Hafington that freedom of speech is granted to people who rely on what they say and who do not hide behind anonymity.
She was also led by a decision in the summer of 2015 to publish the news section for Donald Tramp, a candidate for the US President.

There were two explosions in southern Thailand in the province of Surathan on Friday at about eight o’clock after the local time.
One blast exploded in the basement in front of the sea police building, killing a municipal employee and injuring a man, said Governor Vongsiri Promčana of the province of Suratthan.
"I think it's related to explosions in Huahin," said the governor.
The second explosion took place in front of the provincial police station.
On Friday morning in southern Thailand, two explosions took place on the favorite island of Phuket.
On Friday morning, two blasts exploded at the bell tower in Huahin, killing one and hurting three people.
It has already been reported that on Thursday evenings, shortly before midnight, two explosions broke out in Huahin, killing one woman and wounding 19 more people, including foreigners.
The woman who was killed in Huahin was Thai.

The police rescue the babies from the car overcrowding; the parents threaten the out - of - the - way glass with judicial works.
In Riga yesterday, municipal policemen rescued infants from a car that was being burned, while the child’s parents threatened the police with judicial work on the out - of - the - car glass, LETA informed the Riga Municipal Police (RPP).
Yesterday at the patrol, a man who told us that Spice had seen a car in the parking lot where there was no adult baby for half an hour.
Upon arrival at the site of the event, the vehicle indicated by the eyewitness, which was placed in the sun position.
The first passenger seat was a baby seat with a baby.
The sun was shining directly on the child.
The infant’s face was reddish and unsweetened.
In view of the fact that the owner of the vehicle has not been found on the spot, the immediate decision taken shall be taken to remove the rear-view glass of the vehicle in order not to endanger the health and life of the baby.
The child with all the seat-belts is removed from the warmer vehicle, and the doctors are called.
The child breathes a blanket, the skin is red and hot, so until the doctors arrive, the order guard on the door imposed cold compressions.
At the site of the event, doctors and the child’s parents arrived at almost the same time.
The baby’s father, as he saw the window on his vehicle, remained aggressive, and the doctors did not let the child in.
Talking with parents and explaining that children under the age of seven are prohibited from leaving one without supervision.
In addition, the child was left with health and life under dangerous conditions.
After a discussion, the doctor examined the patients and found that hospitalization was not necessary.
On the other hand, the child’s parents categorically refused to provide any explanation about the incident and threatened to do judicial work on the outside of the car.
During discussions with the parents, nothing indicated that they were alcohol - related or otherwise harmful to the child, so a four - month - old infant was placed in both care.
The files have been sent to the Children's Laws Prevention Section, whose staff will assess the responsibilities of parents.
RPP recalls that even if the outside is not very hot, the car left in the sun will burn very fast.
If a child or pet is left in such a car, it can endanger their lives.
The LPF members could request the removal of Poni.
The members of the Latvian Swimming Federation (LPF) could soon request the federal president's office to cancel its existing leaders, Kaspar Poni, the agency LETA told the federation's former vice president, Jānis Dzenis.
Jean said that in view of the criticisms expressed in recent days about Poni and his activities in the federation, several LPF members have signed a letter asking to convene a general meeting of the LPF, which is the highest institution of the federation, and that it is entitled to decide on any issue raised in the LPF general meeting.
The members of the federation are not satisfied with the style of the Ponie leadership, and his going to the Riodejaneiro Olympics, which, in turn, was not able to go to the Latvian record of the Olympics by coach Alonas Ribakovas German Jakubovski, who was a non-ethical and vice president.
Genis pointed out that the members of the LPF, as well as the Secretary General of the Federation, Aivars Platonov, have done great work for the development of the federation and sport, but the contribution of Mr.
Jean, who has worked for a long time in the federation, explained that there was an attempt in the federation to concentrate power in the hands of one person.
Consequently, the members of the federation could also require the amendment of the regulations governing the operation of the LPF, which would exclude such a possibility in the future.
Janis explained that the dissatisfaction with Mr's work has existed for a long time in the federation, but the events of the last days have served as members of the "last pillar" federation to decide what to do.
The former vice-president of the federation said that the work of the Coach and Judges Council was greatly reduced during the work of the Pone.
Genis explained that, in order to ensure faster progress in the process and decision-making in the federation, the LPF members had decided at a general meeting to run the federation on the authorisation of the board of directors of the Pone and two vice-presidents.
However, as Jean acknowledged, Mr.
The members of the Federation trusted Ponym, believing that they would be able to make decisions more quickly in the federation.
"He gained the confidence of his fellows because he practically took power in his hands by taking a non-ethical step," said Jean.
"This attitude cannot be one of the people who should serve as an example for other sports representatives," said Jean.
In Jean's view, Mr President, he has tried to satisfy his ambitions, which, on the other hand, does not honor him as President of the LPF.
LETA told LPF's long-term secretary-general Vladimir Maslovski that the letter could be submitted to the federation next week and should therefore be submitted to the LPF general meeting earlier than within a month.
In his opinion, the general meeting is "to speak on all the issues that have been hurt" and must decide on the next action.
Mr. Friday had not yet been informed that the LPF members were planning to convene a general meeting to decide on his resignation.
I don’t know anything about the meeting at the moment, so I don’t have a comment.
As for the fact that the members are not satisfied with my work, so far there has been only one case, with the former coach Jakubovski when some dissatisfaction has been expressed.
Before the London Olympic Games, when Ribakova was not approved among the participants, he complained to the International Federation of Water Sports (FINA) and asked Latvia not to send any athletes.
"After this case, Jakubovskis lost his career as senior coach because his actions were not in the interest of LPF," said Mr.
He also pointed out that the LPF members had not yet received their surpluses at the general meetings of the members of the LPF.
"On the contrary, we have received recognition that the quality of the Federation's work has improved," said LPF President.
Mr. also explained that the Olympics of Riode Janeiro should not have had fun but should have worked.
For most people in Latvia, it is not clear and they do not understand what the functions of federation presidents are.
People do not understand that we are volunteers in this role, and, for example, unlike the leaders of the Latvian Olympic Committee (LOK), we do not receive wages.
At the same time, we need to make sure that the sport federation has sufficient funding, as only 10% of the necessary amount is received from the state LPF.
During the Olympics, I have had formal and informal meetings with representatives of international federations and various international programmes, including international sponsors.
"The negotiations have also been introduced and I have been working to ensure that one of the phases of the World Cup takes place in Riga in 2018," said Mr.
According to company.lv, LPF’s revenues in 2015 amounted to EUR 249 444, which is less than EUR 36,000 in 2014.
About 40% of this amount was made up last year of targeted grants with an increase of around EUR 10,000 compared to 2014.
Similarly, LPF received around 43% of revenues, i.e. EUR 109 442 as members, admissions and other annual contributions.
In the form of donations and donations, the federation received another 35,532 euros last year.
Last year's federal expenditure, compared with 2014, increased by around EUR 70,000, by a total of EUR 263 876 in 2015.
The higher expenditure was not related to payments for persons, material expenditure or salaries - EUR 215 733 is indicated as "other expenditure".
In cash payments, EUR 20 549 was spent on persons, while EUR 14 684 was paid in wages.
If the 2014 federation had a positive balance sheet, then the 2015 LPF had a negative balance sheet.
As reported, the Ministry of Education and Science (IZM) requested an explanation to the Latvian Olympic Committee (LOK) for the participation of LPF President Pones in the Olympics of Riodežaneiro, on which the Latvian swimmer's coach, Ribakovas, Jakubovskis, did not attend.
Latvian nationals have not been affected by the explosions in Thailand, the entry of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (AM) shows on the social site Twitter.
The Ministry pointed out that according to the Latvian Consulate of Honor, the information available in Thailand was not affected by the public explosions of Latvia.
LETA has already reported that the AM calls on travellers to follow up on a regular basis with information on the development of the political and security situation in the country, as well as to make sure of the safety of the place of residence, indicating that there is a high threat of terrorism in the country.
Latvia’s AAM calls for the avoidance of human meeting places, to be particularly attentive and cautious, while staying in public places, and to follow the instructions of the local authorities.
Travellers located in or planning to go to the Thai resorts shall be invited by the Ministry to contact tour operators or airlines, specifying whether the journey will be carried out in accordance with the planned plan.
The Ministry also calls on travellers to follow up on a regular basis with information on the development of the political and security situation in the country and to make sure that the place of residence is safe.
There is a high threat of terrorism in the country.
In view of the unstable security situation in the country, the AM does not recommend going to the border of Thailand and Cambodia, as well as to the provinces of Thailand and Malaysia on the border - Patan, Jala, Narathivata and Sunkhla.
In the event of an emergency, the Ministry shall immediately contact the Consular Department's day of office by telephone +371 26 33 77 11 or by e-mail palidziba@mfa.gov.lv.
It also strongly recommends that any person travelling abroad acquire life and health insurance policy before travelling, which also provides for repatriation in the event of sickness or death, as well as registered in the Consular Register.
However, she won't leave Argentina's football game.

Immediately after the loss, the Messiah announced that he would end his career in the state unit, but then it was reported that he could return to the election.
"I seriously considered the possibility of leaving the election, but my love for Argentina and the election is too great," 29-year-old Messi said.
The Spanish Grand Barcelona attacker Mesi in the ranks of the National Union in general 112 won 55 gates, which is the best indicator of all time.
Together with the adult selection, Messi had not made much progress, although in 2014 Argentina became the world’s vice champion.
Mesi was named the world's best footballer five times.
For the Chinese, Jean and Dzelinja are double-weighted Rio 20 km.
China's champions Vans Jens and Cai Jellins fought a double-strength in the 20-kilometre championship of the Riodejo Olympics.
The Olympic champion was crowned with Jean, who spent 19 minutes and four seconds at the distance, in 12 seconds, in a hurry.
The bronze, on the other hand, was fought by Australian bidder Deans Burds-Smitt, who lost Jean for 23 seconds.
The host’s favorite Kaiu Bonfims repaired Brazil’s record, but he needed five seconds to climb to the high ground.
Jean was awarded a bronze medal in London four years ago.
He is also at the same distance to two silver medals in the world championships.
Coach Judo Baskin: Nikiforenko is not a real weight.
Latvian Jewish coach Oleg Baskin acknowledged with good faith that the Arturam Nikiforenko Rio Olympics were just as unlikely as there was any chance of intercepting the toughest sportsman in Azerbaijan, Ushangi Kukauri.
It was practically impossible, only minimal, if it were possible to catch him on a method or party.
We had already planned that it would.
He was right and fought right, but the opponent was stronger.
The opponent was well - known because Nikiforenko had already fought him twice and both of them had lost Arthur.
He's tougher, though.
Arturus has been artificially transferred to the most difficult weight category to enter the Olympic team.
The weight category up to 100 kilograms had already been taken up and Arthur used the European quota in the heavy weight category.
Arthur, weighing 100 kilograms, struggled with a Jew with 140 kilograms and who had won several serious tournaments.
In the heavy weight category there is at least a moment of chance.
If the lightest weights in the categories of weight are all the same, it is very rare, very difficult.
On the question of whether Nikiforenko would further be better off fighting one degree in the lightest weight category, Baskin replied positively.
I think so - Arthur would be better off fighting in the category up to 100 kilograms.
That's his real weight category.
He's not the real weight.
65% of Venezuelans want to leave Maduro, the question is whether they are ready to fight for it.
Two of the three Venezuelans want to leave President Nicholas Maduro, but the question is whether they are ready to fight for it.
The day after the National Elections Board announced that "no time" for the withdrawal of the vote this year with which Chavismo will be in power by 2019, people continued on the streets of Caracas on their usual days as if nothing had happened.
"I didn't hear the news because I was looking at the Olympics and how Michael Felps got two more medals," said Rafael Deyan, 36-year-old office worker who rested in the Altamira field on Wednesday.
The area of Altamira, located in the eastern part of Caracas, was at the beginning of 2014 an ash unrest epicenter in which it protested against the Maduro regime.
However, now that the opposition has to exert more pressure than ever to achieve the referendum this year, people across the country no longer show such energy.
"I want a referendum, but for security reasons I will not participate in the protests," Dean said.
Others, more informed, want to mobilize in the future, but admit that the Venezuelans are not so motivated.
The President of the Election Board Tibiseis Lusena comments that the government is delaying the withdrawal process.
I will protest whenever the opposition calls for a protest, but I know that some of my friends are afraid," Roberto Reijess, (60), said Fox News Latino.
So in addition to all the barriers the government has set up to stop the referendum, the opposition now faces a new challenge: to motivate people to go out and protest.
Recently, the referendum initiative was supported by a large number of people who had not yet come together in the process of collecting signatures.
However, when it comes to protesting against government moves to block efforts, the number of people who have arrived at myths is likely to be smaller.
"Some people focus on building food lines, while others are afraid of arrests and deaths after 2014," said Cipriano Eredia, the opposition legislator.
After Lusena announced that before the next step of the referendum - even more so for signatures to be taken across the country - it would be necessary to wait until October, those who are against the Socialist government say that President Maduro and his followers are simply trying to discourage the Venezuelan courage by letting them believe that the vote this year is practically impossible.
According to the Constitution, if the referendum was held in 2017, Maduro could be removed from office, but he would be allowed to appoint the next president.
If he is left behind today, he has an obligation to declare general elections.
The U.S. Department of State addressed this issue in its statement on Thursday afternoon, urging the Venezuelan authorities to ensure that Venezuelan constitutional rights are respected.
"Exterior steps for the implementation of the presidential referendum should be made clear, concrete and immediately, thus contributing to the rapid and effective resolution of the political, economic and social difficulties of the current country," it said.
Luis Salamanka, political analyst, who was a member of the electoral board from 2006 to 2009, that changes are not expected so soon.
"I think there will be no referendum this year unless social unrest and protests become even stronger," he said to the FNL.
He said that Lusena and the government were violating the law, but they would achieve their goal if people did not protest loudly.
The opposition called for a broad demonstration in September. First of all, in Caracas, to demand that the process be accelerated so that the withdrawal can take place this year.
We want people from all over the country to be mobilized in the capital today.
The government will feel pressure," Eredia said.
Salamanca, on the other hand, feels that this situation cannot be waited so long.
"They should respond to Lusena's statement faster and stronger because it practically kills the referendum," said the FNL expert.
Congressman Eredia acknowledged that some opposition parties want to get the event to take place faster, but another group wants more time to organise.
The opposition must now be careful.
If people feel insecure in this situation, there is a risk that the second signing campaign will be low," Salamanka said.
In order to activate this, the referendum process must receive support from 20 percent of the national voters, who are almost 4 million people.
Salamanka and other analysts are confident that even if the withdrawal takes place in 2017, Chavismo will be disappointed.
However, some people are not so optimistic.
Our party wants political changes today.
"If the government closes the way to elections, we will have to explore other legal possibilities," Eredia said to the FNL.

For the senior sports, Ogres is a holiday.
Today, the Sports Festival of Ogres pensioners took place at the sports center of Ogres novad.
At the Seniors Stadium, Ogres novada Sports Centre, the organizer of the development work of the Sports Centre, Sanita Tauriņa, who had prepared a special program for participants in the Sports Festival.
This time, individual results will not be assessed, but participants in sports festivals will be divided into four teams.
"The sum of each participant will be the result of the team," explains S.Tauriņa.
Participants will have to perform four tasks - basketball racing, Eiffel Tower construction together with memory game, Florbola activity staff, summer skiing.
In order to successfully start all four holiday programmes in disciplines, participants had to perform heating tasks – "Unity circle", "Ringo dance", "Izpletnis", and three staffs – with horses, have to perform frescoes and badminton elements.
All the tasks were prepared in an attractive form, and the participants of the sports festivals carried them out with joy, laughter and fun comments, while others supported them.
A special feeling was caused by summer skiing, which took place in the clothes prepared by the organizer.
The competition was followed by volunteers from the Ogres novad Sports Centre, who conducted the tasks, fixed the results and failed to apply the advice.
There was also the symbol of Ogres Čiekurs, who inspired the participants of the Festival of Sports.
The elders of Ogres proved that they are quite active, attractive and are in good sport.
Green Team representative Peter Zeps spent eight times exactly in the basketball game, only one resultant left his team member Jānis Staudz.
The pensioners are active.
In the excursions, buses are always full, and there are about 300 people on the ball.
"We meet twice a week in the rooms of the Family Support Centre where we can play new, table tennis, use coaches," says the president of the Ogres Pensioner Society, Jānis Staudz.
At the end of the sports festival, all participants received thanks for their participation at the Ogres novada Sports Centre, but the greatest benefit is fresh air, good mood and shared time.
For 2016/2017, Prime Minister No.19 West Bromwich Albion
Guardian journalists predict 14th position (Be careful: it is not only Alana Smita's forecast, but our journalists' councils in general)
Last season 14th position
The chances of winning a league (with Oddschecker) 1000-1
Until last week it looked after a new season, such as the old Bromwich Albion: 2016/2017 season will once again be a struggle for pleasure or stagnation, depending on how empty the glass is in the direction of even more pragmatic Tonia Police.
However, Jeremiah Piss sold 88% of his club's share to Guochuan Lai and Pulis, an architecturally safe hand made by Bummeikers immediately as a favorite in the unfavorable first released manager.
The situation has unquestionably changed Balack Country - and not only Hawthorns, but also some of the jealousy on the north-west in Volverhampton, where the new Chinese owners, while not wasting time, refused to serve Kenya Jacket.
To confirm that his work is not immediately threatened, however, the police have also expressed their desire not to change the culture of the club.
"I don't want to change the beliefs of the club or start a sustainable friendship," he said, taking over the responsibilities.
I want to be a good owner and invest in this club in the long term.
First of all, our aim is to ensure that the Prime Minister remains and then goes further, I would like to see the club strengthened at the top of the division.
I think it's the best league in the world, and I want to take this club as far as possible.
These are the achievements of the Police, and the first aspect should not be difficult.
The next goal is to break down to the top of the table, but the new owner and the increasingly fragmented fan base will be important to hope for a fast extraction table up to the top to realize that this is an extremely difficult task, given the basic work that has recently been invested by the other teams next to the table.
There will certainly be more work to be done in order to get beyond the 14th place in the past season.
Only Aston Villa, which is located at the lower end of the table, enters less gate and is worth recalling that on average the Christmas Albion did less than one seat per door in 90 minutes, almost or the worst indicator of division.
They failed to get the gates 13 of the 38 games, and enter more than one gate in only nine games.
Out of their 10 wins in no game failed to get more than one gate, and the seven games ended with 1-0.
As expected, a total of 34 gates were obtained from standard positions.
There is no wonder that Hawthorn's team ruled the dissatisfaction most likely after the shocking 0-0 unsolved with Villa at the end of January when the team looked better.
On the other hand, only six best teams had better protection indicators - although no club has managed to list four half-guards in the center.
These safeguards are often not sufficiently assessed, especially by Johnny Evans, who wants to be Arsenal, given their recent crisis in terms of their own players.
The Northern Ireland international team has experienced a great start at the European Championship, and Albion will have to make a real effort to sell.
Ben Foster's gates are reliable, and they are well integrated in the middle line.
Darens Fletchers, largely like Evans, showed to a large extent that he was still able to play at a high level at the age of 32, and Claudio Jacobs has been underrated.
It is disturbing for all parties that the long and lynching story of the future of Saido Berahino is still unclear.
In short, the rates from the Stoke and Crystal Palace were rejected, but they still remain peaceful and Mark Hughjs is ready to wait.
After the last season, close to liquidation, it is worth all the parties involved to take action.
The attacker is certainly talented, but, as Pulis has already mentioned it several times, he has been here on one side, here on the other side, for a long time now it is obvious that such relations are not working.
Albion insists that it is necessary to sign the documents on change before allowing the former UK U-21 member to go, but his 15 million-dollar walk with Diafrus Saho disappeared a few days before the takeover, claiming to the club that he had passed medical examination and had all agreed, but he had a back injury which would mean that he would have to release the beginning of the season.
This creates great pressure on the Venezuelan Solomon Rondon, who last season looked very right at the moment, but he needs to improve his nine gate performance, especially if Ricky Lamberts continues to be so ineffective.
The decision to release Viktor Anicèbi and Stefan Sesignon's retrospective also looks strange.
Pulis throughout his career is sadly famous for moving his slow new players up and three shades – Jonathan Leko, Sam Felda and Tyler Roberts in the last season of the previous season with undisputed 1-1 with Liverpool, almost or will become the norm.
He will return to those already tested and tested, but Leko is worth keeping in sight.
The 17-year-old attacking half-guard in general participated in five games during the previous season, becoming the first-born Premier, who is also highly valued in the English youth football system.
Mets Phillips, with a 5.5 million deal with Queens Park Rangers, will be fast, but he is the only new player who participated in the first game week end.
This would not be said in the long run if the end could be rather hasty.
"All," Pulis said last week in Express and Star about what would be improving.
Any position you see.
We need to strengthen the players behind the back, the middle players in the field and the players in the front positions.
Targets are, we know what we want.
They are found to be much more difficult than expected, mainly because of uncertainty about the takeover process.
The season could determine how they started, with seven largely winning games prior to the difficult competition with Tottenham, Liverpool, Manchester City and Leicester from mid-October.
At that time the pressure on Pulis would have become less or less difficult.
And who knows, maybe even Berahino will find a new club.
Tata Steel UK closer to the rescue business after the authorised changes in pension support
Behind Tata Steel UK pensioners said that the scheme could be restructured by not participating in the Pension Protection Fund (PPF), increasing the company's chances of closing a rescue transaction.
The British steel pension scheme has a commitment of 15 billion pounds and, on the basis of calculations, at least 700 million pounds of sterling, creates serious obstacles to the conclusion of the rescue business between Tata Steel UK and Port Talbot Steelworks in Wales.
Tata Steel is increasingly convinced of the business of the UK in which 11,000 people are employed, ensuring the future after negotiations with the Minister of Economic Affairs and Pension Regulator.
The company plans to combine its European activities, including the UK business with ThyssenKrupp, the German Conglomerate.
However, the conclusion of the transaction depends on whether the British steel pension scheme will be restructured and the government will provide financial support.
Alan Johnson, the President-in-Office of the Pension, said that this scheme could avoid PPF if the benefits received by employees were modified.
Although this is well-funded compared to other schemes, with a deficit narrowed to 300 million pounds for individual measures, Tatata Steel and ThyssenKrupp wants to control its commitments.
Johnton said that the authorities recognize that it is "in reality" for the joint venture or for any Tata Steel Uk buyer to assume responsibility for financing the current and future deficit.
The modification of the benefits gained from the scheme was much more binding than the addition of the PPF, he added, where workers should accept more favourable conditions.
Tata Steel sources warn that it could still sell Port Talbot.
The company has consistently refused to guarantee the future of the steel industry, since negotiations on the future of its UK business were started in March, and it has been put on the line in the negotiations with the British government.
Kushiks Chatterje, Executive Director Tata Steel Europe, said that the Indian conglomerate wants to make its steel business "more sustainable".
Speaking at the Tataba Steel annual meeting in India, Chatterje said that negotiations on pension scheme restructuring were moving forward, but he argued that the scheme was well funded.
"We are talking to various stakeholders, including the British Government and other stakeholders, such as the Welsh Government, etc."
There is a view that pensions have a known impact on goods such as steel business, so we need to find a structural solution that does not hinder business progress.
The wish to cooperate in the negotiations on the restructuring of the scheme will be supported by Tata Steel.
Potential changes in the scheme include the direction of how the increase in annual inflation-based benefits is measured from the retail price index to the lower consumer price index and the limitation of future pension payments to the minimum laid down in the law.
Johnson added: "The Plenipotentiary and its advisers have provided Tata Steel, the government and pension regulator with evidence of the scheme's ability to pay modified benefits for an indefinite period and with a low level of risk outside the Pension Protection Fund.
Our investment strategy has meant that the funding position of the scheme has not affected the recent decline in the securities market in the same way as in other British pension schemes. We are still convinced that the scheme is capable of providing benefits at an adequate level.
CBS commenter blends Michael Felps and Rayen Lohti all over the game
Canadian broadcaster CBC Olympics commented on Thursday evenings, causing anger by mixing Michael Felps with his rival Rayen Lohti.
Eliot Friedman both enjoyed the entire 200 m length of individual swimming where Felps won the 22nd Olympic gold medal.
When Felps crossed the line, Friedmen held him for Lohti, the Felps nation and the former competitors of the world's swimmers at the top.
Friedman said, "At last he will!"
Ryans Lohte will beat Michael Felps in this game!
Felps could not even get to the top of his foot.
However, Felps won, but Lohte finished fourth.
As soon as Felps was near gold, the CBS passed the silence.
In a miraculous way, Friedman immediately acknowledged his error.
I'm sorry. I'm confused.
Felps with gold," he said.
The Canadian commentator, whose professionalism was widely appreciated after the error, once again acknowledged his error and apologized to the viewers in the tweet.
I'm all sorry.
I'm surprised.
"No excuse," he wrote.
At the time, Felps won 2 168 years of record as the winner of the largest Olympic victory ever.
The previous record belonged to Leonid from Rhodes, who had won more Olympic titles than anyone else in the ancient Olympic Games.
Russian hackers attacked the former NATO Force Commander's computer.
The hackers published General Filip Brídlov's lists and data on one of the Soros funds.
The same hackers who may have been attacked by the US Democratic Party e-mails a while ago and published their lists could also be guilty of a new series of attacks, reports Bloomberg.
According to its information, these cyber-attacks attacked the list of the former NATO Force Commander General Filip Brydlov and the Open Society Institute, which is part of the projects supported by the millionaire George Soros.
The attackers have published the information obtained on DCLeaks.com link.
There is a list of Brídlova and data on the operation of the Open Society Institute.
Hackers are reported to have been accessing the Fund’s computers for about a year.
The news agency claims that it is the same hackers who launched the attack on computers of the U.S. Democratic Party led by Russia's specialist.
The U.S. Intelligence has already warned high-ranking officials of Congress about a possible hacker attack on the Democratic Party.
The Reuters news agency reports that it has information that the spies have told a number of politicians at the time - cyber attacks are coordinated by two Russian intelligence agencies or their controlled organisations.
However, Congressmen have not been able to pass this information on to the victims of cyberattacks because it has been hidden.
The opposition scandal for the Democratic Party computers began after about 20,000 emails were published online by the party's representatives during the US presidential election campaign.
The party’s candidate, Hilaria Clintone, announced that Russian expeditions had organized the leaking of these letters.
Russian President Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov announced that Russia has no contact with cyberterrorists.

Disneyland has come up with information on its long-planned location structure, consisting of a transport hub and a new pedestrian to the east side of the park.
The project, located in the east of the attractive park in the vicinity of the 5 Freeway, includes a 6 800 site structure and a transport hub where buses, buses, taxis and other vehicles can release visitors to the park.

Two thirds of its population will have to be admitted to the heating of the burning house.
If the property owners are very concerned and specifically talked about the technical condition of the building, if there is such an opportunity to receive support and the building in all possible ways, it is quite easy not to use it.
One of the most important changes is that EU co-financing from this year will be available to any multi-dwelling house, only the condition is that the building facade must be heated.
It was previously allowed to be used only in a series of multi-dwelling houses.
The biggest big housekeepers, however, provide the organization of meetings of apartment owners.
The important problem where this process is currently being built is that 67% of apartment owners are required to agree.
"The previous programme required 51%," says SIA "The House Manager of Liepajas" (LNA) project manager Toms Cirrulis.
"Of course it is very difficult to ensure this because in most of the meetings such a number of apartment owners do not exist," said the project manager of the Home Service APSE, Gints Ločmelis.
The largest house managers in Liepaja - "House service APSE" and LNA, which serve around 900 buildings, plan to renovate at least 50 multi-dwelling houses during the new planning period by 2020.
They do not exclude the possibility that it will be difficult to convince people at work to vote for the renovation work, but every project implemented should improve the attitude of the population.
I also needed a bank loan, 76% of the household.
"In explaining what will be - I did, however, produce these signatures," says Vita Iselniece, the oldest in Latvia, of the most energy-efficient building.
She agrees with John, who also lives in a warm building.
Well, you can't think about it, and the other side plus one person doesn't agree.
"No, of course, it is important that everyone agrees with the whole measure," says John.
These provisions have been proposed by the representatives of the financial institution ALTUM.
They explain that with 51% of the votes in the banks it is not possible to attract the necessary funding, which has also been experienced in the past programming period.
The majority of commercial banks need two thirds of the owners of apartments.
As one of the recommendations for housekeepers, the head of Anda Lagzdiņa, the European Union's Department of Funds of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, mentioned the possibility of introducing the existing examples and the various benefits of refurbishing the building, such as saving energy.
In his youth, Aaron had a long history of his mother’s death.
The arrest of a potential suicide bomber in Canada was worthy of a press film.
It all started when the Canadian police received a video captured by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Very early this morning, the Royal Police of Canada has received reliable information from the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Among other things, it contained the so-called "mock" video recorded by an unknown person who was clearly in the last stage of the preparation of the attack.
"And he was going to do it with a self-inflicted spray," said Deputy Chief of Police of Canada, Mike Kabana.
In the black mask, a man dressed in English and Arabic threatened the Canadians and promised to get involved in everything they had done to Muslims.
Within about three hours, using facial and voice recognition programs, the Canadian police have been able to recognize this man.
It was 24-year-old Aaron Driver.
He has already been under the supervision of the probation service for celebrating the ideas of terrorism and radical Islam on the Internet.
By judgment of the Court, Dravier was prohibited from continuing to do so and also from participating in any radical organization.
However, until then, the authorities did not consider that Drivers could create any physical threat to the environment.
When the police arrived at his home in Stratroja in the province of Ontario, the young man had gone out and sat in a taxi.
At that time, the guards tried to arrest him, but the driver, sitting on the back seat, had a spray.
To prevent the detonation of the second trigger, the police shot the new man.
He's dead from the trauma.
The taxi driver is not a tough guy.
In an interview with Canadian television, a neutralized terrorist father, Wayne Driver, said that his son had turned to Islam in his teenage years.
This had initially helped him to cope with drugs and alcohol.
Yet, Aaron was a troubled teenager who was a long - standing nipper to the world about his mother’s death.
Only when I saw it in the news today would I wonder how far he had gone.
I had no idea he was so radicalized.
"And I didn't know he was so good at speaking Arabic," says Aaron's father.
The Canadian police recognize that if they arrived a few hours later, the development of events could have been quite different.
Radēviča will go to Rio as a tourist and support Latvian lightweights.
The former Olympics and easy-to-use Ineta Radēviča LTV in the Olympics said that the performance of the seven-star sportsmen Laura Ikaunieces-Admidina in the first two disciplines was not bad, given that the athlete had a trauma.
On the other hand, Laura’s defenses were carried out with the right foot, not as usual with the left.
Radēviča pointed out that this is comparable - just as a person who is able to write with his right hand would suddenly be forced to write with his left hand.
The results of Ikaunieces-Admidine are therefore not bad in view of the trauma.
Radēviča discovered that she had not yet contacted Ikaunieci-Admidini, but actively followed with her initials and felt with her.
The Ineta learned about Laura’s recent trauma and expressed support for the athlete, indicating that the ransom did not begin to create itself a safety belt, but showed the character and the spirit of the fighter.
Speaking of other sports, Radēviča believes that the Olympic regulations are very high, so one of the Latvian athletes to move that he went to Rio as a tourist is wrong.
She remembered that when she went to the first Olympics, where she competed for 13th place, she too was called a tourist, and it creates negative emotions.
Ineta sometimes remembers its beginnings, not just Olympics.
"I like to remember my emotions, not the results," recalling his experience in sport, Radēviča discovered.
She told me that it was always important to have someone in the Tribes who gave the energy of coexistence.
Radeviča herself will be a tourist this year - she will go to Riodežanier next week to support Latvian athletes in attendance.
She points out that she will certainly go to the games of easy-to-play.
Ineta Radēviča won the European Championship title in 2010.
In 2004 in the Olympic Games in Athens, she took 13 places in the distance and 20 positions in the three-story attack, but in 2008 the athlete did not start because he was waiting for his son.
In London, as mentioned earlier, Radévicchi had a 4th place in the distance.
In Murjanj will show the film "Quanta Code" with physicists in Kaštevi's main role.
The film's note says that in parallel to the electron breaking in Kaštej's laboratory, Kaštej is a dreamer, a teacher, a socially active and civic-minded man and father who is looking for a connection with Visvarano.
The same film hero of Latvia's TV broadcast "Rita Panorama" pointed out that he had had an interesting experience.
I knew how the top movie, how it's filmed, how it's recorded.
"And really great work," said the physicist.
He recognized that the film had become two years old.
The biggest disagreements with the directors were about the name of the film.
I'm categorically against this name.
No quota code available.
"There is no secret that, when watching the film, could be known and everything is clear," added the associate professor LU.
Kašteev admitted that he liked the fact that the movie’s premieres would take place in the evening of Murjan’s outdoor cinema.
They are organised by friends from the Easy Foundation, and these cinema sessions will take place every evening until 9 September.
In Thailand, four people lost their lives in bomb blasts at favorite places of entertainment
After the people of Thailand voted in favour of the military-supported Constitution, on Thursday and Friday in the five southern provinces of Thailand - in popular tourist destinations - a series of bombings took place that killed four people and injured many people.
The first two explosions took place at the seaside resort in Huahin on Thursday evening, the next - Friday morning.
The city is about 200 kilometers south of Bangkok.
The police reported that one Thai woman was killed in the first explosion and 20 people were injured, 10 of whom were foreigners.
The authorities confirmed that other explosions took place in the southern cities of Phuket, Trana and Surathan.
Two bombs are fired in the city of Phuketa in Paton and two more in the province of Phana - in the tourism region to the north of Phuketa.
During the last 24 hours, 11 bombs have been fired in Thailand.
On Friday, Prime Minister of the Royal Police of Thailand, Krisana Patanačaroens announced that the explosions were not related to Islamist extremists and were considered to be local acts of sabotage.
"It is still too early to make conclusions," he said.
"But we certainly know that these incidents are not directly related to any kind of terrorism, in fact it is local sabotage, and we are trying to find guilty people."
On 12 August 2016, following a low-capacity bomb explosion in Huahin, investigators gathered evidence from the crime scene.
On 12 August, officials announced that four people were killed in a series of bombings in important tourism areas in Thailand.
There are no conflicts in the country that could lead to terrorist attacks.
"That's why we can say that these incidents are not terrorist attacks," he continued.
No group has yet assumed responsibility for the attack, and no specific group has been accused by the competent authorities, but the explosion took place the same week that Thai voters approved the new Constitution.
All three southern provinces - Huahina, Phuketa and Phanna - rejected the military-supported referendum, and in the southeastern provinces of Thailand, where most of the population are Muslims, more than 6500 people have been killed since the riots in 2004.
The demonstration took place on the day of the birth of the Syrian king of Thailand, which is the day of the national festival in Thailand.
The city of Klai Kangwon is located in Huahin, where the royal family of Thailand often stays.
King Bumibol Aduljade was the world’s easiest monarch.

Porgy and Besa - what we have earned before!
There are endless numbers of operas that have never been scanned in Latvia.
There's something that's very rare.
However, it seems strange that since the 1970s, George Görsvina’s opus Porgy and Besa have not been studied or played, unless they count the number of the hrestomatic solos such as summertime periodicals on the stage (including the title work at the Ines Galantes festival), individual student projects, guest shows and so on.
It has its own reasons - since Latvia is a civilized Western state, it has binding rules and copyright licenses for the family of Görsvina, which are valid for Portugal and Besu by 2030.
The harmonisation procedures are not simple.
In addition, the author wanted all fourteen soloists to be black.
In Latvia, of course, the existing discussions and contexts of these operas in the U.S. are not well known and the composer's desire to meet would be difficult.
On August 6, a concert performed by four black American soloists and their Latvian brothers and sisters on the road to compromise, on the 10th anniversary of the Cēsis Festival of Art, commemorated the magical song of Goersvina, in which his European classical music traditions with American jazz rhythms, gospels, early 20th century fashion dances and leftover hits, depicting the notorious Katfišrova band in the Ubaga Porgija and the light music lovers of the Tournament Bes in such a musical quality as would have earned a record for the musical life stories.
First of all, LNSO and Director Andra Pogas.
Despite the complex space of concert venues in the outdoor park of Cēsu, the orchestra is located on the side of the scene next to the view, on which the soloist and singer (and great dance!) choir While, the overall screening was stylishly nuanced, rich and precise in contrasts in both stylistic and metal spring instruments and piano parties (Martíns Zilberts).
Second, because of the excellent soloists team.
The Harismatic Dramatic Barton Lester Linčs (Portugal) is a popular singer in Europe and America, whose repertoire includes both baritone and basbaritone parties, especially Verdi operas.
Porgy's role has been played countless times, several times as well as Krauna - he felt as a fish in the water in this opera and inspired the audience's partners even in the concert to excite the emotional atmosphere of the village of the poor population's solidarity.
Latvia Mura in its second concert concert in Portugal and Besa (the first one in 2012 was no more, no less than Berlin's Philharmonics and Ser Simone Retlu) was found to be a vitally plastic vocalist combination with a dramaticly toned darkness and fantastic piano at the top of the register.
Not by the way, she's one of the brightest today's Aidas.
The attractive Jamaican tenor of origin, Germain Smith, and Andris Poga, who at the same time sought to study in Boston, is the image of the drug dealer Sportinlaifa, a company's role on four continents.
It demonstrates its synchronous singing and singing skills as a well-trained musical actor.
Smit is one of the rarely occurring cleaners whose voice seems to still conceal undiscovered vocal possibilities as 15 years ago when the opera voice was accidentally located, ticking it to bite the singles.
It is unbelievable that even from the 24th and relatively dark German Smith’s expressive gestures allow him to see the dust bag in his hands even if it is not there.
How could poor Besa not follow such a mephistophelic deceiver who in vain leads to the illusion of a wonderful life in New York?
The role of the Krauna was illustrated by the generous Rodney Clarks.
The biggest vocal surprise of the Latvian soloist team in Cēsus was the Sonora Vaice's image of Sirina - a beautiful top register, a skilled balance between the spoken and sung text, according to a change of voice position, vocal acrobatics and dramatism, both the performance of Sirina's favorite My Man is Gone Now and the stylized chairman's wide prayer Oh, Doctor Jesus.
The voice of Margarita Wilson was well-scanned, but the iconic Summertime itself was a bit of a smiley and nervous when it came to getting its true character in retrieval.
Colorites and beauties were discovered by Mikhail Chulpajev, Richard Mačenovski, Andrim Lapinjas-trusted parties (especially the Crab seller placed on the city walls in response to Irma Pavarer's delicious Soprano Soprano salesman).
Ilona Bageles, Riharda Miller, Emil Kivlenieki's paintings, as well as the roles of Ivo Martinson's distinguished investigator and white lawyer, the director and actor Juris Žagars, unexpectedly presented to the viewers of Cēsus Festival.
In the spatial design of the concert hall of Historic Kairis, the choir acted on stage, soloists - mainly in the proscene, rarely coming up or going down the stairs.
In a rather dynamic activity, a little comical situation was made by the map in the hands of Latvian soloists.
Their presence, however, has a clear explanation.
First, some soloists sang several epic roles (sometimes they had difficulty tracking their identity).
Secondly, in Portugal and Besa there is a lot of dialogue, a conversation-in-the-art phrase, a replica that is easier to track with the events ahead.
Introduced by the opera’s nuances, Cēsis was very helpful in the title machine.
The weather did not run and the first part of the concert was long enough.
However, this did not prevent most listeners from staying until the end to engrave the artists.
Nine in the evening, however, there is a rather late start time for full-length operas, especially if the longer journey from Cēsis is expected, but Opera Porgis and Besa are likely to return to Latvia's musical course and will probably become one of the most famous musical experiences this summer.
Also in Liepaja, where it appeared in the evening, as well as in other acoustic conditions.
In the field of Riga, the man scared the children with a worm.
Yesterday, August 11, at about eight o’clock in the evening, the State police received news from a frightened mother of a child who was worried that a man was in the street of Lomonosova, in a children’s village, who was afraid of children.
The law enforcement immediately responded to the call and arrived at the scene, where this man also met with a worm that was very heavy in alcohol at the time of the event - 3.07 miles.
It was found that the man who was born in 1962 had already feared the children so that they would not row.
This time, however, an aggressive man used a worm to lure the children into the field.
The man was arrested.
A criminal proceeding has been initiated in connection with the occurrence of a disorder in the public order, which is manifestly disrespectful to society or without justice, ignoring the general rules of conduct adopted and disrupting human peace.
Such a crime shall be punishable by the withdrawal of liberty for a period of up to two years or by the temporary withdrawal of liberty or by forced labour or by the penalty of money and by the supervision of the trial for a period of up to three years.
The presidents of the federations usually use guest accreditations in Olympic games.
The presidents of the sports federations usually arrive at the venue of the Olympics for a few days and use the guest accreditations that can be changed, so they have several owners during the competition, LETA told the agency the representative of the Latvian Olympic Unit (LOV).
On Wednesday, a wide variety of axiography was triggered by the words of coach German Jakubovska of the Olympic swimmer Alonas Ribakov, who discovered that the last time he decided to go to Riodjeneiro Olympiadi, the leader of the Latvian Swimming Federation (LPF) Kaspars Pone, while the coach had to stay at home.
Later it became known that Mr. Brasil had come with a coach's accreditation, which the president himself said was a surprise because "there is no place in there."
According to Vilnius, only two federation presidents - Pone, as well as the leader of the Latvian Civilian Union (LVS), Guntis Zālītis, lived in the sports village of London.
In the Olympic village, athletes live as well as officials including, for example, coaches, doctors, the administration of the delegation.
As a result, it is likely that in London Pone there was an accreditation of the coach.
"The former federation presidents appear as guests, and they have different accreditations - they come in a couple of days and then use someone else," Vicini said, explaining that the presidents of these federations do not live in the Olympic village.
Mr. Riodežanier arrived at the end of July and Brazil will be left on 13 August, and he will probably be the least of the presidents of all the national federations.
Significantly, Latvia's payback in swimming started only one day - 10 August.
Latvia Riodežanier will be represented in 11 sports games, and LETA's calculations show that six or seven federation presidents will attend the four most important competitions.
Zālītis will arrive in Brazil on Saturday, the president of the Latvian Ride riding Federation (LRF) Igo Japiņš will be at the BMX next week, the president of the Latvian Windserfinga Federation Ansis Dāle to Riodežanier planned to fly on 16th August, when the beginnings of Ketia Birzulai have already ended, and the president of the Russian Federation Dzintars Urbančiks - the day before.
The following week, the president of the Latvian Shooting Federation, Karlis Kresliņš, also planned to arrive, when the shooting of Dainis Uppelniek has already ended.
The president of the Latvian Judo Federation Raymonds Rublovskis did not find Riodežanier during the Latvian sports competition, although he was scheduled to arrive, the Latvian Kanoe Federation is currently no president, but there is still a conflict in Latvia's society and its athletes are applying to the international competitions by the Latvian Olympic Committee.
Meanwhile, the president of the Latvian Volleyball Federation, Atis Drynītis, and the leader of the Latvian Tennis Union, Juris Savickis, decided not to join Riodežanier.
Vasiljevs evaluates the natural breast of Latvian women.
The world-famous Russian fashion historian, interior decorator, screenwriter, book writer, lecturer and collector Aleksandr Vasilijevs is very often visiting Latvia over the last few years.
He recently evaluated the contestants "Mis and Misters Latvia 2016" at the final and acknowledged that Latvia's actors may be proud of natural breasts and lips that have not been improved with silicone and botulinal injections.
In a conversation with "Vakara News", Alexander Vasilijevs reported that for many years he has been the President of the jury in the popular Miss Russia beauty contest.
That is why he was also very interested in the evaluation of the participants "Mis and Mister Latvia 2016".
In calling for different standards of Latvian beauty competitions from similar competitions in Russia, Vasiljevs stressed that Latvians and Russians have quite different figures: "Krevije's participants have a denser breast than Latvian competitors."
However, Latvian youths are beautifully dressed and decorated, and can also boast of natural beauty, not of the miracles performed by plastic surgery.
I therefore particularly congratulate the participants in the Latvian beauty contest with their natural beauty.
In connection with its professional activity in Latvia, Vasiljev has great plans.
Currently, the fashion historian's collection exhibition "Natural nature" is seen in the Museum of Decorative Art and Design.
On the other hand, in Ventspil, in Livonija’s castle of order, the exhibition of Vasiljeva “Kazu clothes 1860-2010” is shown.
Vasiljevs loved Ventspils so much that for a few days they also enjoyed the city’s hospitality and walked along the sea.
I like Latvia very much.
Especially now that there is a threat of terrorism throughout Europe, there is a real corner of paradise.
"In Latvia, spending time and rest is a pure joy," said fashion guru.
In addition, on 23 November, Alexander Vasilijevs will discover the private fashion museum.
Please help!
Please donate to our son, brother, for treatment.
We, the Rinalda family, are grateful to the wonderful people around us and to God that there was an opportunity to save Rinalda, but unfortunately, there is currently no way to fully cover the medical costs of the forces themselves.
Rinald Grinberg is an 11-year-old tucuminist who was diagnosed with a brain tumor at the end of July.
This year he graduated from the fourth grade at the primary school of Milzkalne with excellence, a powerful athlete and a very talented artist.
Looks like he's got it all.
A healthy, vibrant, unrelenting, industrious and active boy.
Always funny and kind.
On July 26, our family will remain in memory of life.
In the last couple of weeks, they have had problems, headaches, but doctors are delaying it on the abdominal virus.
And at first it seemed that it was.
For whoever could have imagined that such "invincible" symptoms of guilt are something much more serious that we cannot comprehend.
On July 26, we received a diagnosis - Rinaldam is a brain tumor.
Fast storage fluid in the brains, but all that doctors can help in Latvia is to perform a surgery to transmit excess fluid, as the tumour is virtually not available for direct surgical action.
It is also not possible to determine whether the breeder is benign or malicious.
The following national plan: start radiation and see what happens.
We're going to experiment here, we're going to test the results.
Fortunately, Rinalda’s research results were able to show a doctor in Spain.
He is the Vice-President of the Association of World Neurosurgery, one of the world's leading neurosurgery.
He took up surgery, and it turned out that surgery had to be performed immediately.
The planter creates enormous pressure on the brain, and the risk of complications is too high.
It is also urgent to understand whether the breeder is benign or malicious to develop a plan for further treatment.
Not for a moment, the parents chose to go to Spain to save his son.
At a fantastic speed, Rinald was operating in Spain with his mother, Evi, on August 8th.
A very complex, more than 6 hours long operation was performed.
The surgery took place at St. Elena's.
The majority of tumours were removed, the pressure was reduced, and samples were obtained.
Rinald is already on his way from bed and as a teenager, he asks for free potatoes in the evenings.
The results of oncological analyses must now be expected.
Thank you to Dr. Araez and the management of the clinic, who understood the situation and operated urgently without receiving full treatment prior to surgery.
They believed that the remaining amount would be paid, requested only a first contribution of EUR 10,000 to operate and save Rinalda's life.
EUR 6 000 was made available to the parents by selling the technology, but the other necessary amounts for travel, living, the hospital's first contribution was made to borrow from relatives and friends.
However, at least EUR 24,000 is needed to calculate the first stage of treatment in Spain and to return the money we have borrowed for the first contribution.
Please help us to repay this, Rinalda's health operation so important.
Each euro is important to help cover the costs of the operation already carried out and to enable Rinalda to continue its treatment successfully.
The disturbing signs in Ukraine raise the question: What do Vladimir Putin’s advice?
It has been decided on the truth of these claims.
Ukraine rejects them, while the US and the European Union claim that Russia has not provided any evidence.
The Open Analysis Group, Digital Forensic Research Lab, has found some signs of Saturday shooting, but quite little to be able to delay Moscow's big plans.
Russia is known for distorting or misinterpreting events for political purposes, in particular in the context of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.
This does not mean, however, that all Russian claims are unfounded.
Ukraine's opposition forces broke down the power pilons supplied by the Crimean Power last year, and some of them are also involved in criminal activities and human rights violations.
The attack attempt in Crimea is still a topical issue, although there is little reason to suspect that the Ukrainian government would sponsor a scenario of such events.
Whatever the case, the findings of the open source analysts show that Russia has been increasing its military presence since at least last Saturday - before the expected attack.
It shows how heavy-arm convoys are moving along the coast, including missile systems for coast protection.
Intrusive Russian escalation
Some reports show that the Russian forces in Crimea had already planned a rotation that could help explain the activity, although it would be a very good coincidence that it was simply expected to happen at one of the most stressful times since the annex in 2014.
Whatever has become known at the end of the week, Mr Putina has undoubtedly drawn even more attention to Ukraine by choosing to use this episode as real as it would be, for a greater purpose.
The analysts point to disturbing parallels with Russia’s behaviour right before the previous military action against Ukraine.
In February 2014, similar talks and military maneuvers were provided to protect Crimean Volunteers from taking part in the peninsula currently controlled by Ukraine, only to reveal that they were in fact the Russian special units that started military occupation.
In August, when Russian-supported separatists were not in East Ukraine, Putin placed forces along the border, warning them that they might be needed for the "protection" of the ethnic Russian civilians in Ukraine, which he said was attacked.
He organised an aid convoy to a region that, according to NATO information, was the only protection of Russian invasion forces.
What is Mr. Putina planning to do in Crimea?
Some have pointed out whether Moscow alone does not plan another military intervention.
Fighting in Eastern Ukraine has accelerated as it was before the attack in August 2014.
But this seemingly parallel could be the point where fear of military activities is to be introduced, not of actual action, - it will give Putin short in relations with both Ukraine and the Western countries.
Mark Galeoti, professor of the University of New York, who is investigating Russia, pointed out that Crimea would be of little importance as a point from which military action against East Ukraine, bordering on the part of Russia rather than Crimea, and that the rest of the country is better protected.
"There is a very small opportunity if the Russians are really planning a large-scale offensive," Mr Galeoti said.
Rather, "we can observe a classic Russian strategy in creating pressure."
The international peace negotiations on Ukraine, which was once a mechanism by which Putin made contact with Western leaders who ignored him because of the Crimean annexation, are becoming increasingly ineffective and irrelevant.
By suggesting that there is a threat that the conflict can erupt again, Putin gives the negotiations a new meaning: to get them away from the bottomless edge.
"It's a standard Putina tactic - he wants to try to start from a force position," Galeoti said about the next peace talks scheduled for early September.
"And the only strong side is to say, "If I wanted to, I could do everything even more, much worse."
To reach agreement with the West
Putin also said this week that during Crimea's struggles, it was not important to continue negotiations by telling other parties to convince them to return to the negotiating table and to come to the centre of the process.
What does it really give him?
Firstly, it allows Russia to continue to strengthen as the world’s major power, although its economic size is less than Australia.
Secondly, it positions Moscow as having veto rights in relation to Ukraine's sovereignty, to a certain extent maintaining the country's control over Russia.
It can also benefit Putina's long-standing hopes for a broad-ranging agreement with the United States to resolve their disputes on the issue of Ukraine and Syria, with Moscow's favourable conditions, of course, also ending Western sanctions against Russia.
A number of cases have been reported since the deterioration of the state economy in 2014, mainly due to the decrease in the value of national oil and gas exports.
Since the attack in Syria last autumn, he has repeatedly called on the West to join him in the great coalition against extremists.
However, Russian leaders may consider that they would need to ensure such an agreement before January when President Obama's term of office expires.
Russian officials believe that the next president will be Hillary Clinton, which is more hostile to Moscow.
Donald J. Tramps, although he is thought to be friendly with Russia, is still considered unpredictable.
Obama, on the other hand, is considered to be "seek solutions, not conflicts," Galeoti said.
So it makes sense to close the window of opportunity to get something done quickly.
As long as it fails to reach a broad agreement, Putin seems satisfied with keeping Russia’s weak neighbour in mind what will be further.
The earlier version of this article wrongly stated the year Russia invaded Crimea from Ukraine.
This took place in 2014 rather than in 2013.
At the convention, the White House spent its time fighting Zika's virus
The Obama administration said on Thursday that it would divert $81 million from biomedical research and anti-poverty and health care programmes to pay for the Zikas virus vaccine in response to emergency measures because Congress did not approve new funding for the fight against the virus.
Silvija Metjus Barvela , Secretary of Health and Human Services, in a letter to the Congress, indicated that without redirected funds, the National Institute of Health and the Biomedical Research and Development Authority would remain without money to fight skin disease until the end of the month.
Therefore, the development of the vaccine should be discontinued at an important time, with Mayam increasing the number of cases of Zika’s disease in the country.
Last week in the United States there were 7,350 cases of Zikas virus, mostly Puerto Rica (according to the data from the disease control and prevention centres).
Ms. Barvelas said that 15 infants were born with Zika's virus-related birth defects.
The virus may cause brain development abnormalities and other serious defects in children born to infected mothers.
The prevalence of disease in the continental United States, when the first cases were registered at the end of last month, has increased the political rates for the federal government's response.
Hilaria Clinton stopped in Vienna on Tuesday, Miami, where there was a local outbreak of Zikas virus cases, and pressured Congress to return from its five-week break to confirm emergency funding for the fight against the virus.
President Obama and Congressional Republics have been controversial about most of Zika's annual virus issues.
In February Obama requested $1.9 billion for emergency funding.
The Republicans stopped it by requesting a more detailed report on who the money will be used.
For months the legislators have been arguing about how much money should be allocated and how much it should be spent.
Last month, the Democrats blocked the review of the measure proposed by the Republicans when US$ 1.1 billion was allocated to the fight against Zika's virus but included conditions that would prohibit the allocation of funds for family planning to provide contraceptives in connection with a virus that could be so transferred on a gender basis.
The White House was forced in April to send $589 million to fight Ebola virus, to fight Zika virus. About two thirds of funding is intended to be used within the country.
On Thursday, Mrs Barvelas said that her department had spent most of the money and that it would be spent entirely by the end of August.
"The failure to take a decision on emergency funding for the fight against Zika's virus has led the administration to choose between delaying the work of important vaccine development and the placement of other valuable national programmes to avoid this delay," Barvela wrote.
The Democrats objected to this communication in order to transfer to the Republics the non-allocation of additional money to the fight against Zika virus.
At the news conference, the representative of Nensia Pelosi from California, the leader of the minority, urged the representative of Paul D.Raien, the Speakers of the House of Representatives, to remind the Congress of the continuation of this event.
"All possibilities are exhausted, and now we are looking to the National Institute of Health," said Mrs Pelosi.
Mr. Raine's advisers say that the diversion of funds is a step that had to be halted long ago and which Obama's administration has withdrawn in order to express the maximum political benefit of Zika's problem.
Last week, the National Institute of Health announced that there were clinical trials of Zikas virus vaccines with 80 people and hoped to begin the second phase of Zikas virus epidemic countries in early 2017.
However, as officials said on Thursday, without immediate additional funding, the study will stop.
Barvela said that she would send 34 million US dollars from the National Health Service to fight Zika's virus for other diseases, including cancer and diabetes.
Another 47 million will be transferred to the Biomedicine in-depth research and development body supporting the development of medicines and vaccines in response to emergencies in public health.
This money will come from several accounts, including US$19 million from a programme that grants small-scale heating subsidies to small-scale families and US$4 million from substance-dependent programmes such as opioids.
Even as Barvela said, extra money will be enough only next month when agencies come to "fund their operations" in the fight against Zika's virus if Congress does not act.
Over the past four months, the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention has spent $60 million on helping states protect pregnant women, $25 million on strengthening their preparedness for Zika virus and plans to fight it, as well as $16 million on helping them establish data collection systems to quickly detect microcephaly and other symptoms associated with Zika virus.
The leader of Thailand links attacks to favorite tourist sites with constitutional changes
On Friday, the leader of the Thai Hunt called on the public to be patient until the investigators found out what followed this week's series of deadly bombings took place in Thailand.
General Prajutt Čan-oča, the leader of the hunt and Prime Minister, said that criminals had been "bad people", protesting against the new Constitution, approved by the voters in the Sunday referendum.
"There are still bad people, and they worked before the referendum," he said in a speech to the people.
The bombings in five provinces on Thursday and Friday, including Phuket and Huahin, in the most popular places among tourists, killed four people and injured two people.
The authorities state that the attacks by firefighters are linked to another country.
Analysts claim that the aim of the bomb explosions was not to kill many people, but to harm the tourism sector, one of the brightest points in the Thai economy.
At least nine foreign tourists were injured in Huanhin.
"In order to be motivated, explosions and firefightings cover the hunt's claim that the post-referencing situation will be stable," said Sunajs Fasuks, senior researcher at the Human Rights Watch.
These attacks result in discrediting the authorities, terrorising society and harming the tourism-based economy.
Photos of Thailand's rescue service personnel provide the wounded in the bomb blast in Huahin on Friday.
The police claim that in their view these explosions are not related to international terrorism or to prolonged Islamic unrest in southern Thailand.
They consider the attacks to be "local sabotage", not terrorism.
The chosen attack time and location have a strong political symbolism.
The show took place on Friday, when people were ready to celebrate the birthday of the queen of Siricita, who is considered a Mother’s Day in Thailand.
Four explosions destroyed the royal residence in Huahin, about 125 miles from Bangkok, where there were also most injured.
The Constitution prepared by the military will reduce the influence of political parties and grant military authorities greater powers even if the government is once again in control of civilians.
Hunta helped to ensure its victory without allowing opponents to campaign against it.
Mureis Hübert, a South-East Asian expert at the Strategic and International Studies Centre in Washington, pointed to military suspects that the attacks had been carried out by unsatisfied people.
The explosions were "precisely coordinated, but apparently aimed at creating fear and confusion, not mass damage and damage and injury," he said.
Last year, 20 people were killed in an explosion at the popular Erevan temple in Bangkok, mostly tourists from China.
The Thai officials linked the explosions with Uighur fighters who were not satisfied with the return of more than 100 Uighur to China.
General Prejutt, who has been working together since 2014 when the civil government was set up, said that this week's explosions "pain the heart of Thais."
Why is it that now, when the country gets better when the economy goes better and the tourism sector is getting better?" he said.
We need to ask why and what did.
Golden reaction: How did Simone Manuel’s historic puzzle look?
This evening, when I started fighting, I was trying to take away from my shoulders the weight of a black community, which is something that I carry with me just being in that position.
However, I hope it will all go away.
I am more than happy to be able to serve others as an inspiration and, hopefully, to diversify this type of sport.
At the same time, however, I would like to have the day when we have more, and it's not Simone, a black swimmer, because the name of the black swimmer makes it look like I shouldn't be able to fight the gold medal or that I shouldn't be able to stop the records.
This is not because I work as hard as everyone else, and I love sports and I want to win just like everyone else.
The fight against a student - lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons (L.G.B.T.) - defence in Colombia
Two years ago, 16-year-old Sergio Urrego was sitting in the house, getting out of the shopping centre in Bogotá, before leaving a message about his suicide on Facebook, quoting Pink Floyd's song "Goodbye Cruel World" ("The Evil World").
Her death was the beginning of contradictions that emerged this week in Colombia, where efforts to extend the rights of L.G.B.T. were seen in the broader political struggles that divided the country into two camps.
After his death, the mother of Urrego Alba Reyesa, filed a complaint against school officials, blaming them for excluding her only son when it was discovered that he and his classmate had had intimate relations.
A year later, the Supreme Court of Colombia announced a favourable judgment to her, urging schools across the country to develop a clearer policy to prevent discrimination.
The decision was part of a series of legal victories for the gay movement in Colombia. Some time earlier this year, the movement celebrated the decision to legalise marriage.
However, this week they faced an obstacle in their struggle for equality, because Gina Perodiya, the minister of education, who is openly gay, became a scandal about the application of this rule in the scandal.
The scandal began when social media began to circulate sexually open content from the journal of pornography to people by distributing speeches that it was part of the textbook issued by the Ministry of Education.
The perody is exposing this activity.
Although the Ministry has offered help to schools on issues related to sexual orientation and gender identity with a view to helping them to focus on the rule, it has not tried to impose standardised rules.
"What we want for schools is a tool for conflict resolution," said Mrs. Perdodia on Thursday.
The debate began before the national debate on the future of the country where the peace negotiations between the government and the revolutionary armed forces of Colombia, or the FARC, will be negotiated.
The political coalition and the leaders of the Catholic Church in the opposition to the government have been extremely quick to mobilize, accusing President Juan Manuel Santos of promoting one gender union and gender change.
To make everyone even more difficult, a government delegation participating in negotiations with FARC Havana recently reached agreement on gender and L.G.B.T. equality, calling for more inclusive policies.
The government's criticism and peace negotiations, which have been held for 42 years for the old Perodiya, for the flying star of the policy of Colombia.
They have demonstrated parouse posters in their homes and some have also threatened to resort to violence against them and their partners, Cecilia Alvaresa-Correa Glen, former trade ministers.
Perodiya maintained a wonderful peace for a whole week, trying to correct the mistake and restart the discussion with constructive conditions.
"Partly what makes me stand up and keep my head clear is that there are children that will only be revealed," she said.
This is a very busy field and a very lonely time.
She also pointed to the relationship between the peace process and the debate on L.G.B.T. students.
As long as the Colombians continue to assess the benefits of a deal with FARC, which would be an earthquake-like turning point in the country, they have to consider the outcome of the conflict, she said.
"Is there a country of peace that promotes inclusion or exclusion; is it a country where everyone has equal opportunities?" she asked.
Although this week she did not like to be the target of insults and abandonment, she is happy that today's gay students in Colombia can take an example from her and think that they can also try to become ministers someday.
"It is very important for them to be calm and to realize that they can fully realize their potential," said Mrs. Perodia.
We can't wait for a new suicide to start changing something.
Save vote in cybersecurity - The New York Times
"The U.S. is looking for ways to keep hackers per piece from polling stations" (news article, August 4th)
Internal Security Minister James Johnson says the Obama administration is thinking about additional security protection of the national electoral system.
These changes may be necessary and should be considered immediately.
Cyberdraudi in various manifestations and the recent revelation that external forces may be national countries are increasingly interested in the influence of our elections, requires the federal government to pay further attention to our electoral system and perhaps to consider it part of our country's essential infrastructure.
Johnson should immediately contact with thousands of national jurisdictions that help to conduct elections and offer the assistance, consultation and management of the Department of Homeland Security.
As long as the diverse and diverse nature of our voting infrastructure prevents efforts from being made to ensure this, this tells us that the process should start as soon as possible.
The writer, a Democrat from Mississippi, is a member of the High-ranking National Security Committee.
In Pennsylvania, a boy injured in a carousel, this week the third time in an attractive park
Thursday, falling from the carousel, a boy and taken to Pittsburgh Hospital won the injuries. The Quick Help Service and Park Officers say this is the third accident this week in the U.S. attractive park where children have been affected.
A child whose name is not found was only taken to a children’s hospital in Pittsburgh about 50 miles (80 km) west of Aidvailda and Soukzona Park in Laidjonjer, Pennsylvania, said a representative of the rapid relief services in the Westmurland area.
The three-year-old boy who was visiting with his brother while he was being helped on the spot was aware by the e-mail of the park representative Jeff Krushors.
The cruiser said that the "Rollo Coaster" attraction would be closed for the time of the investigation.
Children should have at least 3 feet (91 cm) long and those less than 4 feet (122 cm) in adults in order to be able to visit the carousel.
The attraction, according to the information published on its website, was built in 1938 and the State Department of Agriculture indicated that it had been tested in August.
The representative of the hospital refused to comment on the son’s condition.
On Sunday from the neck injury that will result from driving from the world’s highest water mountain in Kansas, Kansas, a 10 - year - old boy died.
On Monday, three 6, 10 and 16-year-old girls who fell from more than 30 feet (9 m) high were delivered to the hospital, covering the panoramic shift to the annual market in Greenville, Tennessee.
Japanese Prime Minister Abe World War II will not visit a shrine that honors the memory of the war: Jiji
The news agency Jiji reports that the Japanese Prime Minister of Singapore Abe Japan will not visit the Tokyo Holy See, which celebrates the commemoration of the war during World War II.
Thursday, Jiji reported that Abe, however, was planning on Monday to send Yasukuni a ritual gift for the anniversary.
The temple also honors the 14 Japanese caravans, which are condemned only as war criminals, and China and South Korea consider it a symbol of the militaryism of the Japanese kingdom.
Both have not visited the shrine since December 2013, when he announced that he has visited it to show respect for those who love his birth.
The new Japanese Minister of Defence Tomomi Inada has not answered the question of whether she will visit the shrine, explaining that it is a matter of conscience.
Inada - a supporter of the amendments to the Japanese pacifist constitution - visited Yasukuni regularly in the past.
The news agency Kyodo reports that on Thursday, the Minister of Reconstruction of the Territories affected by Japan's disaster, Masahiro Imamura, visited the shrine and said he had prayed for Japan's peace and prosperity.
The relationship between China and Japan, the two major economies in Asia, has become more tense after the growing presence of China’s coastguard and other national ships near the South Sea, which is called Senkaku in Japan, but in China as a Diaudz.
Two suspects detained in the planning of the Rio Olympics terrorist acts: police
On Thursday, the police detained two people who are suspected of supporting the Islam State group in planning a possible attack during the Olympic Games in Riode Janeiro.
Prior to Thursday, the police had already detained 12 people, all suspected of co-operation with the Islamic state fighters.
The Brazilian Federal Police report that three more persons were understood and later released.
Both are Brazilians on Thursday, but the police don't reveal their names and other information.
Although there have been no conflicts in Brazil’s history with known groups of fighters, the government reports that the Olympics have made the country a more up-to-date goal, in particular because the countries that fight the Islamic state are participating in the games.
Its fighters are controlled by individual territories of Iraq and Syria, and the US-led coalition has launched air attacks against them.
The group has supporters all over the world who have been harassed and harassed by civilians.
Officially charges against a newly suspected French priest in the murder
The French priest's murder investigation carried out last month against the man arrested on the day of the first day of the year, and on Friday Reuters reported a source of information to the police.
A 21-year-old suspect is being investigated for cooperation with terrorists, and he has planned attacks on people, mentioned a source of information.
The man was contacted by telephone with Adele Kermič and Abde Malik Petitján, who had stopped church service in Sentetjén du Ruve, West France, on July 26, and had returned the tool to Father Jacques Alem, an 85 - year - old Roman Catholic teacher.
Both police were killed.
The suspect had left his home near Toulouse, on Sentencing Du Ruve and spent the night there before the attack, mentioned the source.
The young man who had not been convicted in the past admitted that he had spent the night there, however, told the investigators that he was away the next day because he did not have a good relationship with Kermic and Petitjan, said a source of information.
Investigators are trying to determine whether Kermič and Petitjin were partners in France and whether they were related to the Islamic State that has assumed responsibility for the attack.
At the end of last month, a pre-trial detention was applied to Brother Petitjanna.
Doruss de Vriess before moving to Celtic
Nottingham Forest Club Guard Doruss de Vriess has arrived in Glasgow because he hopes to conclude an agreement on moving to Celtic.
De Vriess was photographed, entering Roshol's hospital before medical examination after Hoops agreed conditions with the Sky Bet Champions Club.
Parkhead Club leader Brendan Rogers is looking for an experienced centre guard so that the current first room for Craig Gordon would be competitive.
Tomert Rogers trusts 35-year-old de Vriesam because he worked together with the Dutch team at Swansea Club.
He played 51 games in the composition of Swansea, which they played under Rogers in 2011 fighting the right to move to the Prime Minister.
He changed the form of bicycles to join "Wilki", and has been City Ground since 2013.
He also played in Scotland during his career after the Diunvergline season, after his transition back in 2006.
Her stay in Istland ended with a contagion, however, Pars experiencing a double agony, becoming "sold in a trim" from the highest level before losing Celtic Scotland.
The guard under the contract had still remained a year in Forest, and it was reported that Celtic would only have to pay a nominal fee to get his signature.
Macy's gonna close 100 stores.
Big store giant Macy's announced on Thursday its plans to close 100 shops, which is a dramatic step to help the store chain get ahead of the potential segregated problem: In America, it claims, there are too many shops online for the buy-in age.
Macy's regularly reduces its store portfolio, often closing several dozen insufficiently profitable stores immediately after the annual holiday company.
However, its summer announcement that it will close 15 per cent of its 728 trading venues, shops chains seem to have taken a much more aggressive position than many similar retail sector representatives in terms of reducing its number by adapting to the very variable purchasing environment.
Streeters and buyers go along Macy's shop in New York.
The retail giant announces that it plans to close 100 shops.
Macy's has many reasons to try to change: many of its shops are located in small regional shopping centres, as the number of buyers has particularly affected the flow of e-commerce.
In general, the category of supermarkets has become more difficult, as buyers are increasingly choosing less priced retailers such as T.J.Maxx and fast fashion workers such as H&M.
These factors, together with short-term challenges such as the increasingly lower consumption of international tourists and seasonally unsustainable weather conditions that Macy's has put in an unstable situation that has been strained for more than a year.
On Thursday, the company announced that its comparable sales volumes in the last quarter had fallen by 2,6 per cent, a very weak indicator, however, which was an improvement, taking into account the very bad 6,1 per cent decrease in the annual turnover observed in the previous quarter.
The retailer's income was US$ 5.87 billion (US$ 7.64 billion), with 3.9 per cent less than last year.
Macy's said it would cost about US$ 1 billion in the annual turnover.
And the closure of so many shops could at the same time be considered a recognition of the retailer’s collapse.
However, the company’s share value declined on Thursday by 17 percent, which shows that investors take this move as a proactive measure that reports about Macy’s stronger future.
In its sense, Macy's reducing the number of shops, should not be surprising.
The retailer’s Director General Terijs Lundgren has said earlier that the chain is almost simply too many shops.
The top level managers said for a while that they had adopted a new strategy, with a special emphasis on 150 of its most profitable shops in order to achieve higher sales volumes in the already profitable trading venues.
Jeffs Janet, Macy's director, who has been appointed instead of Lundgren since 2017, said in his statement almost all the shops that the company plans to close are those where sales volume and profitability shift downwards.
"We realize that there is still no adequate return on investments in these trading venues and often there is no level of customer procurement experience that reflects our efforts with Macy's brand," Janet said.
The company announced that it would come up with a list of shops that would be closed later.
Macy's said that while still being decided on closing shops and that therefore it is not yet known exactly how many employees will be fired.
The retailer has not completely withdrawn from the main markets where he currently has shops, but it is thought of closing shops in less active places.
This move is unlikely to affect the managers of the shopping malls, which will account for large tenants such as Macy's, to attract and maintain other smaller shops in their shopping malls.
Do you have dangerous bacteria in your water bottle?
According to a new study, drinking from a refilled bottle may be "a lot worse than dropping your dog’s toy", given how many bacteria will have to deal with.
The website Treadmill Reviews commissioned EmLab P&K to check 12 four different types of water bottles - with screw hook, with spare hook, with sealed hook, and with straw.
Each bottle was used by a sportsman for a week without washing.
Your refillable water bottle may be as unclean as the dog's toy.
"On the basis of the 12 bottles of water we have examined, we found that reusable drinks can contain an alarming number of viable bacteria: more than 300,000 colony units per square centimeter (KVV/kv.cm)," says Treadmill Reviews.
Bottles with suspended caps detected a maximum quantity of microbes, more than 900,000 colony-forming units per square centimeter (CVV/kv.cm.)
The bottles contained microbes that could cause skin infections, pneumonia, or blood contamination.
Bottles with compressed corks were the next worst with 162,000 KVV/v.cm, while the screws with screws contained only a little less than 160,000 KVV/v.cm.
"Drink the water from such bottles may be worse than eating from your pet's pot," is indicated on the website.
A much better display is observed for bottles of straw with only part of the bacteria present in other bottles - only 25 KVV/kv.cm.
This could be because the water fills up to the bottom of the floor, not fit into its sides, thus attracting moisture - loving microbes.
In bottles of strawberries, the microbes are described as "mostly safe."
"On the basis of our test results, we recommend choosing a bottle of salmon and small bacteria because of the absence of harmful microbes," said the website.
We also know that when it comes to bottles and bacteria, stainless steel is a better choice than plastic.
In addition, water bottles with no stains and difficult cleaning sites will contain fewer microbes.
On the website, it is recommended to wash the bottles after each use, ideally with a low whitening solution.
Religion needs to be modern or forgotten
In the United States, the Democratic Party recently nominated Hillary Clinton as its president.
If the results of the last polls are indeed the same as in the elections, in January America will grow its first president - a woman.
Last week, over the ocean, British Prime Minister Teresa Meja discussed Britain's withdrawal from the European rules with German Chancellor Angelo Merkel.
Women raised in Western society have been brought up in such a way as to know that through education, ambition and hard work, they can be competent and successful in any sphere of professional activity.
And today, young girls can target a number of existing role models in the field of higher leadership.
So, is it really a long and difficult struggle for equality of women that has finally ended?
Hilary Clinton is ready to become president of the United States at any time, but women's leadership in religion remains a controversial issue.
Okay, not completely.
In the religious field, women's leadership is still a controversial issue.
Last week Pope Francis announced the establishment of a new commission to assess whether women would be admitted to the diacons in the Catholic Church.
The Church of England blessed Libya as the first woman-bishop in January 2015, but it was only after a failed attempt in 2012.
While women's rabbinic reform has been organized in the Jewish movement since the early 1970s and the conservative movement since the early 1980s, the concept of female rabbinic in Orthodox Jewishism remains a very strong resistance.
In November 2015, the Orthodox Council of the United States of America published a very sad message that the concept of female rabbinic is contrary to the law in November 2015.
Not without irony, when Hillary Clinton was appointed as the candidate of the Democratic President, the group of the United States-led correct rabbinic who objected to women's orders started a series of "debate" on this controversial issue.
Why is there such a difference between time and time?
Orthodox Judaism, like most other religions, seeks stability in what it considers to be lasting traditional values.
This demonstrates the ability to resist pressure to adapt to changing society.
Those who oppose women's orders do so on the basis that it is not "traditional."
However, it is a price that can be taken into account in maintaining traditions in this way.
And the price of such unilateral thought can paradoxically convey the tradition of itself by removing the traditional community of oxygen that it needs to sustain life.
In the book "August Firearms", in World War I military history, Barbara Thaczmena stresses how dangerous it is to give priority to the tradition of what has become known as the "red birch tragedy."
By the start of World War I, when the war went from combat to more severe artillery from a distance, it became beneficial to hide the soldiers as long as possible.
The British and German armies responded to these changes by changing their shining uniforms against long-lasting greys and browns.
However, French soldiers still wore the same red hats and trousers that made them easy targets.
The proposal by French War Minister Adolf Mesimi that his forces under his control should act in a similar manner was taken with ridicule and opposition.
The red trousers reflected the pride and prestige of the army, and the military traditionalists were not ready to give up.
Speaking in parliament, former wartime minister Eigen Etienne spoke on behalf of France.
"Resistance from red trousers?" he exclaimed.
Sometimes!
"There was an inconceivable and idiotic attachment to the most visible of all colors," he later wrote in the Messim, "it had to be a bad consequence."
Leaders of faith who are fighting for the inclusion of women in the leading religious roles could be included in the same roles.
Focusing only on "traditional" religion, rather than asking the important question: "What changes are necessary for religion to go up?" they risk losing about 50 percent of their followers.
They also deprive the whole community of talents, skills and enthusiasm that women would otherwise provide.
Introduce men to keep wearing trousers when it comes to religion can be traditional, but as the red beak tomb shows, it may not be worth it.
Dina Breivere is the founder of JOFA (Women’s Orthodox Feminist Association) in Great Britain and an Orthodox rabbinic student in Jeshivat Maharat in New York.
The children of the Paradise Valley in the camp gained new skills.
From 1 to 6 August Rojupe's children and young people took place in the centre of the "Varavīksnes Bridge" camp, during which participants were creatively expressed, sported, and acquired new skills.
We arrived at Nouttne on the final day when children were excited to see the glass bubbles.
A youth specialist at the Rojupes Children and Youth Initiative Centre, Māra Folkmane, told that this was one of the activities that the participants liked most.
A visit to the "Mazbebriņi" table at Einar Mountain was also a great pleasure.
Most children liked lasergravier because it was possible to see how the drawing on the computer is gradually applied to the son.
E. Kalniņš has told us what subjects at school should be taught if he wants to work in the office, that is, there is mathematics, especially geometry, computer science, as well as technical drawing and drawing.
He also stressed the need for more work in this profession with brains than with muscles.
A small dish has individual orders, and it is important to plan everything first.
To get to know others better, at the start of the camp, the participants participated in the various games, and together they formed tents "herboni".
On Wednesday the crossing took place along the sea from Rojas to Žocene, along the way natural materials were collected, which were later used for map making.
Sports games that are of particular importance to participants were also introduced.
We went to multi-dwelling houses where we had a sports and leisure area, played football and network bombs.
Children like sports activities, we have lots of kids playing football, basketball, and every time they ask for something sportsy.
Girls like more peaceful jobs.
On the next day, with the help of self-contained mass, decorative jars will be used later as seal holders.
There was also the evening of the talents, the children themselves chose to be present, and one evening they were assigned to the event.
Table games were also played, each of them could show their knowledge at the time of photo orientation where objects were to be found and photographed after the paintings.
The task was to meet differently in each picture.
We also dyed mandals - some like it more, some less.
There will never be one activity that will be liked by all - one that is closer to sport, another that creates.
"Now it seems that everyone is acting curiously with glass painting," said Mr. Folkmane.
At the end of November, diplomas were given on creativity, sport and assistance - several children helped directly in economic work.
The name "Varavīksne bridge" was created because it includes children from three associations - Rojupes and the Centre for Children and Young People's Initiatives in Montenegro, as well as the multifunctional centre of the Rojas novad "Strosts".
They are such agreeing bridges.
If parents think about something faster, we take up ideas; if not, they take it from us.
We share experiences.
This year 30 participants were involved in the camp - children who were active during the year.
"I'm afraid there will be 30, and it's coming," said Mr. Folkmane.
Nomatne was born in the fifth year.
It began in 2010 when the Social Service of the Rojas municipality decided that multiple families and children with disabilities needed to organize camps in the summer.
However, this time the situation in Rojo has improved, and the camp is now designed for the people of the municipality who come and work in youth centres.
The aim is to spend all our time and leisure time in a sustainable and comprehensive way.
There were two camps in the past, and 20 children attended each, while only one camp was being held at the moment because of the country’s overall decline in the number of children.
Similar activities are taking place during the next year.
The children drew, painted glass, came to the villages of Einars Kalniņš, who taught wood burning, making machines out of wood, with figurines carved various forms.
There is also a new technique - encaustic, it is coloring with hot wax cream.
The teacher Ilze Shelkov was in charge of the production of polymer material, we made kulons and various turfs.
We make paintings of natural materials, interesting mandalas of beans, grains, lentils, autumn leaves.
We're trying to use what's around us.
The youth centre works from 3 p.m. to 2 p.m., but in the summer - from 2 p.m. to 2 p.m.
"On average, 15 children visit the youth centre in Rudė," said Mr. Folkmane.
She stresses that there is great support for the Paradise municipality council, which understands the need to give money to children, because they form our future.
Charlton Athletic fan "may only have a season ticket if he signs a behavior contract" and agrees not to criticize the club's social media.
Although we recognize that each person has the right to his or her own personal opinion, the publication of silent comments on such websites is not good.
In the field of administration, the fan was then told that he would have to receive a ticket personally from former police inspector Cliff Eiger, who joined the club last month after 35 years of career police force.
In the following letter: "I must inform you that the allocation of the season ticket will be renewed provided that you sign the "Harmonised Behavioural Agreement" (ABC) which will provide that you will continue to refrain from publishing negative or silent comments about clubs or club representatives on all kinds of social media websites or any other behaviour that might be considered anti-social."
Speaking to Daily Telegraph, the fans described how he called the club after the season ticket that it was not received, and two days later a letter was received by mail.
Yesterday he went to a meeting at the club and said, "They told me that I was too much "twisted" by tweeting to others who are funny."
Rising holidays on Dalmatian coasts
What do you mean, "breath"?
I am going here from all the strength," said Colina, former U.S. Marine Force Commander, who had just taken a 25-year ride along some uneven central part of the Croatian island, leaving nothing there, except the Spanish expression of sweat and salmon, scattered in the hostile mountains.
Some riders sing hymns or a number of children’s garden branches to make it easier to be in the mountain.
Colin's friend Petiya recommends "The Little Engine That Could".
Other lines or simply have to be quiet, thinking of what it requires to enter a trance in a similar situation as wheeled riders are talking about.
Colina is more prone than many.
Driving a few yards ahead of her is like living behind Hugh Greens as a movie at the beginning of "Four Weddings and One Babys".
She and my mission are a week-long "luxus" yacht and cycling trip along the coast and islands of the North Dalmatian Croatia organized by Freedom Treks.
Driving in summer heat at a mountain spot such as Croatia may not fit every sense of beauty, however, saying that the North Dalmatia is easier to drive than South Dalmatia, our sails are soft, and when we filled the booking forms, freely and convincingly before all those months, there was a window that we did not notice that could have provided us with the battery-loaded e-bicycle.
The luxury part of the deal is our swimming house for a week, a whole new "Melody".
At the end of the trip, we can ride our bicycles in a pile of water at our guides Ivana and Ivana and the ship’s back to the blue water, without facing sea waves, ash stones, and other people on the narrow stone slopes called the Croatians.
In June the water temperature at sea is perfect, everyone agrees: it will be cold enough to cool, but not cold.
On Melody there are masks and breathing tubes and some kayaki, if someone feels energetic after a heavy morning on the sails.
Instead, most of us return to our cabins with air conditioners, where Helen, the ship's massier - I'm not dancing - will have already laid our beds, added our minibary stocks and left a new box of chocolates on the table.
Ivan says that after cycling is very important, and in the afternoon we learn to sneak out on our beds or with our pillows on the upper deck together with the barrister Antonio, who is always ready to prepare one of his cocktails.
"Melody", 42 m long with 15 cabins and half-duci teams, is not a superjacket but a stylish little cruise ship.
It turns towards a small island port between fishing vessels and fleet holiday yachts, and we are proud to belong to it.
Colina and Petija belong to a group of friends from Washington, Colombia: to sports and public activists after 45, as they call themselves.
Last year’s Easter Eve and Christmas Eve in the Netherlands were so great that they decided to try something even more richer for their experiences, and so they are in Croatia.
The competitive chapel from their church is on a sailing and cycling holiday in Provence, and every afternoon air connects a competing Facebook publication pingpong rally.
The element of holiday experiences can be played because our schedule is nothing unless a specific regime is established.
"The lunch and dinner are in eight," Ivan told the new participants at the opening meeting, when we started our way from the beautiful old port of Trogir, which is close to Split.
One ship’s bell signal indicates that the buffet is open, while the other at the end of the meal invites you to follow the silence and listen carefully to the further information.
"Good!" is the cultural context which may have been lost everywhere, but not in the British contingent.
What a difference - friendship has already taken turns, jokes are being made from the point of view, until Ivana issues the day's tour map, but we all insist that we are afraid of sneezing, running out of contours and profiles with increases and falls, even though any other would be a surprise on the Croatian journey that starts and ends at sea level.
"It's like a heart monitor," said Ivan.
Not completely recommended.
Ivan conducts an information meeting in parallel by freely switching from English to German.
There are weeks when he has to deal with a dozen different peoples, but we are a simple group - Swiss, German, American and British - who sit easily at the tables during the lunches where they speak English at two and one at a German.
On the way, we're all friends.
Ride driving promotes membership, and the only competition within is, respectively, itself.
I do not remember when the dynamics of the group would have been more harmonious and relaxed.
Soon we were sleeping on Ivan's wave.
A small increase is a slope that should not be mixed with inequality that is good.
Matatas are serpentines and straight forward means straight: simple but not always easy.
The driving instructions are always the same: "Use one by one, hold the distance, and they are not a competition.
Let's go to the coast at nine.
All right, five pairs - I remember that you're on holiday.
Take plenty of water.
From Trogir we will take a two-day cruise north through the Kornati archipelago, where we will travel almost all along Dugi Otok - in the Croatian language "garo island" - and after a slight effort we will take a walk through the natural park of Telascica, marveling at its standing cliffs and salt lake, where the sea flows through the underground canal.
It says that those who sink into it by force become younger.
If we do so, will our feet feel younger and stronger?
In the small island of Molata, we return to the south again, moving from the continent to the nearby islands seems to be accidental.
Most of our journey is on empty small roads outside the country with wide sea views and a variety of plants: olive groves, vineyards, ash plants brigades, Mediterranean fresh air and countless fresh air in flight.
As we move forward, there is always the time, but when John stops, there is always a great shadow, and small holes are like the prize for those who have arrived faster.
Sports and public activists spend a lot of time on road trips at the end of the week, and they know the rules of conduct by sending warnings in a row and leaving free space so that motorists can carry out the occupation maneuvers much more safely.
"You're almost or you've done it," one wheelman says to another after the heavy car driver decided to do the manavage in the invisible curve and quickly stopped.
The brakes worked for luck.
Ivan divides us into three groups, each in a short time to travel on the main roads, with Ivan himself in the back to encourage and "give the tempo", as Ivan says.
If we have to cross the main road, we all meet, get off the bikes and safety after crossing with our bikes on the other side as instructed, not before.
"Do you think Ivan is aware that he's not talking to a group of children?" asks the Swiss rider when we stand by the road and wait for a signal when we can cross it.
Not all afternoons can be devoted to rural recreation.
In the city view, the Roman Forum and the sea eagles are found in Zadar, playing music that smells like the role of a sea monster incarcerated, through stone-worked pipes in a walkway and open in water.
The glorious sunset of Zadar perfectly fall during the time between the main meal and the puddle, and after dark entry we return to the sea eagles and observe the flue-operated lamps on the sidewalk of the glass glass, which is actually a dance floor.
When "Melody" early in the morning starts the way to the exciting Biograd resort, the organ song is no longer more than just smell.
On the fifth day, we are completely free from cycling.
The trip up the estuary of the river Krka to view its waterfalls; then the afternoon tour in Sibenik, where we look at thought cathedrals, Dalmatian Renaissance masterpieces, as well as a walk through the peaceful Zlarina island, looking for its local coral, makes this day interesting.
Lurda is ready to take the pilgrims into the shadow of the attack
During the annual celebration of the Catholic Church, people gather at the temple of the Lord.
The French security forces are in high alert because thousands of Catholics meet at the annual celebration of the Church of Lourdes in the shadow of a number of acts of terror.
Each year on August 15, tens of thousands of people gather at the temple in the Pyrenees at the Festival of Destiny to mark the arrival of the young woman Mary in heaven.
This year’s celebration takes place at a time when Catholics have been shocked by the killing of an elderly French priest on July 26, by two Islamic extremists who entered the church in the north of France and turned his gear around.
Zakka Amela's killing took place two weeks after a Tunisian -- investigators say they have radicalized jihadist online video material -- crashed with a truck at Bastilia's birthday party in the city of Nicaea, killing 85 people.
After three large attacks over 18 months, many French citizens are cautious about public action.
The number of tourists dropped dramatically, and the authorities were shocked that this year’s holiday could be fast.
However, fear of mass responses has not materialized -- and some organizers say that even the flow of visitors' applications has been observed in the last minute.
Approximately 25,000 believers are expected to arrive, including large groups from Italy and Belgium and about 200 Christian delegations from the East - the correct representatives.
Many pilgrims have announced that they have not allowed themselves to be stumbled.
"We do not intend to stop living," 66-year-old visitor Christian told the agency AFP, describing prayer as "the only weapon" in the fight against violence.
"It is important to show that life will continue," said Matje Guinärs - one of the coordinators.
We will not give up our faith, our beliefs, and our way of life simply because some fanatics are trying to sow fear.
Due to the concerns about security in France since the attack in Nice, a number of large-scale measures have been lifted, including a huge slum market in the northern town of Lilly and a European cycling champion, which was due to take place in Nice in September.
"Last week I was afraid that my phone would ring in the same call to cancel applications," said Fabjens Legessne, a priest responsible for the official celebration last week.
"On the contrary - it seems that the attacks have mobilized the believers," he said and announced the influx of applications at the last minute.
The head of the association of local hotel staff confirmed the "increased interest" in the celebrations after the attacks.
The site where the young woman Mary was in the cave in 1858 was shown to the poor sheep of Bernadette Subiru was marked by extreme security measures.
About 250 police officers and two dozen soldiers have been deployed for site protection, including bomb neutralisation experts and experts with explosives in search of dogs.
In addition, the number of access points has been reduced from twelve to three.
Catherine Simcox, who traveled from northeastern England to Lord in the beginning of this month, described the enhanced security measures.
"Up until Thursday morning there were armed guards in the temples, and then through the doors (with metal barriers) could only go one by one, and the bags were searched," she said.
"This all frightened my three children who had gone to Lurda, and it was hard not to hurt them when they asked why it was happening," she said.
It did not damage my impressions, but I became sad that it was necessary, and I understood that many people had taken these measures to rest.
The process of opening Friday is also shortened - instead of starting in the city of Lurda and moving further to the shrine, it will start and end at the shrine.
Other measures include the closure of airspace for flights above Lurda, the closure of roads in the vicinity of the transport sanctuary and the replacement of waste pipes against transparent plastic bags.
French Interior Minister Bernard Kazeneev will examine security measures on Saturday.
About six million people go to Lourde in the year, making it one of the largest Catholic celebrations in the world.
Many visitors lead relatives who are sick or with disabilities who come to swim in the well where Bernadette has seen Mary, touching water’s medical properties.
There Kastijo, one of the organizers, described this year's meeting as "a bit unusual", taking into account "the threat as the root seems to be being sought in France."
However, he claimed that this would not affect the quality and depth of his experience.
Francis, a 58-year-old volunteer who helped sick pilgrims, admitted that she felt that the presence of soldiers dressed in civilian clothing was "a little boring."
However, if it calms everyone down, it's good.
The Saragos shopping centre is shot by two wounded

The opening of the hunting season for aquatic birds is imminent.
Each year, on the second Saturday of August, a season of hunting for aquatic birds is opened.
This year it will begin at 16:00 p.m. on 13 August, so the National Police invite both hunters and citizens to be especially careful and to comply with security rules.
Waterfowl hunts take place not only in hunting areas but also in public watercourses, and although weather conditions do not show sweat as they do for other years, it is possible to use these watercourses together with hunters as well.
Both the hunters and the restoratives and the aquaticists are urged to be especially careful in the vicinity of the lakes and rivers and to comply with the safety rules, without endangering themselves or others.
Since it has been observed in previous years that a large number of hunters are involved in the first days of the opening of the season, this year the National Police, in cooperation with the National Forest Service, will also carry out increased control of hunting.
The law enforcement will focus on the compliance of arms and ammunition with the rules of the law, as well as on monitoring the occurrence of hunting without the effects of alcoholic beverages and arousing substances.
The police recall that it is prohibited to use semi-automatic firearms in the hunting of aquatic birds whose total capacity is greater than three cartridges of cartridges and magazines, including a mention of amendments to the arms and ammunition law, in particular Article 22 (91), which states that persons whose firearms or large energy weapons are registered for hunting or sports and who, during a short period of two hours when these weapons are transported to or from hunting, are entitled to hold arms and ammunition in a hunting vehicle, but must be placed as safe as possible in order to ensure that the futral or other packaging in which ammunition or weapons have been placed, do not appear to be in a person’s handshake, to be locked from the vehicle’s rearwards and to be locked in the rearwards of the vehicle, to be locked, locked in the rearwards and locked.
The police are calling for the security of their own and of fellow humans during the hunting season and, if you think of violations of law or of any danger to security, we are calling for immediate reporting by telephone 110.
In any event, the legislator is prepared to respond to information provided by the public.
New Caledonian coast satricine 7.2 magnitude earthquake
On Friday, the New Caledonia coast was hit by a 7.2 - magnitude earthquake, said seismology, indicating that the tsunami was not a threat.
The Earthquake Epicenter was located nine kilometres in depth 109 kilometres east of New Caledonia Ilantar at 1.26 p.m. after the time of Grinicach (at 4.26 p.m. after the time of Latvia), the Center for Geology of the United States reported.
The Pacific Ocean Cunami alert centre indicated that there is currently no warning or recommendation regarding possible tsunami threats to the region.
"The earthquakes in this region, as it is known, are not uncommon, nor have they been reported recently," said Seismologist Phils Kamins, research center of Geoscience Australia.
It could potentially be felt in Vanuatu or New Caledonia, but I doubt it is so powerful to cause damage.
New Caledonia is located in the "Fire Circle" - the Pacific Ocean's tectonic activity zone, where earthquakes and volcanic eruptions occur frequently.
Colombia and Venezuela agree to open the border.
Colombia and Venezuela agreed to open the checkpoints at the borders of both countries, which were concluded on Thursday after the Venezuelan initiative, Presidents Juan Manuel Santos and Nicholas Maduro told them.
The initial border points will be open only to walkers.
Starting on Saturday, five border points will be opened every day from 8 a.m. to 20 p.m.
The Presidents indicated that it would be possible to open the border to transport once separate international agreements on security, trade and energy have been concluded.
Maduro was forced to close the border in August in response to the attack by the Colombian fighters on the Venezuelan border patrol.
Three Venezuelan soldiers were injured in this attack.
In July this year, the Venezuelan unilaterally opened the border twice because of the economic crisis - the Venezuelans who came to poverty tried to cross the border to buy the first necessary goods in border stores.
This edition was used by 200,000 Venezuelan citizens.
This time it is time for us to be one of the proud of Latvia, the sympathetic Madara Palameki.
Born 18 June 1987 in Tals.
She is a Latvian lightweight who starts in the game of cutting.
Her coach is Father Gints Palameik.
Latvia's record was in the loop.

"Facebook" refers to anti-fighting blockers.
The most widely used social network in the world Facebook has broadcast a warning shot, making it plain that blocking advertising banners using special tools is not acceptable and that users will have to watch the same.
The popularity of special blockers is increasing, but this means that companies whose main source of income is directly advertising are falling.
Facebook has now made it known that it is good to understand the harmful nature of advertising banners, but users will also have to live with them.
It is true that they will be provided with tools to choose for themselves what kind of material they are shown to them, the BBC reports.
"As we provide more and more control opportunities for people, we will also begin to show advertising to those using advertising blocking software," said Facebook's commercial vice-president Andrew Bosvort.
In other words, users will be able to choose what type of advertising they see by selecting brands and sectors that they find interesting.
"People don't like to see advertisements that don't apply to them or interfere with content enjoyment," Bosvort added.
Advertising blocking tools in mobile devices do not usually work, from which Facebook receives the largest visit, but their reduction in banner exposure is also measured in billions.
According to BBC information, the advertising blockers are used by approximately 200 million people.
It has already been reported that in the last quarter of the business, Facebook revenues from advertising amounted to USD 6.2 billion, or EUR 5.55 billion.
It should be said that this is not the first time Facebook is actively involved in determining what network users see in their news flows.
As one of the last steps, Facebook has just begun to act to remove or at least limit the headlines from the news of new flows, which are actually hiding "empty" news.
Asphalt work will take place in the street of freedom at night; traffic restrictions must be taken into account.
At this point, asphalt insertion works will be carried out on the road from Bürzaune Street to Gustav Zemgal Street, and drivers will have to count on limited traffic at this stage of the road.

I suspect that more than €130 000 subscriptions will be kept in the accounts.
This month the National Police (EPP) Anti-Economic Crime Management (ENAP) for a total of 130 thousand subscriptions from a Riga commercial company held books held in the company for 20 years, BNS informed VP representative Gita Gjibovska.
The current information shows that the suspect woman has committed illegal activities for several years and has caused more than EUR 130 thousand losses to the company together.
Given that the company’s officials were not closely following the cash flow and trusted their employee, they only learned about the current developments after several years.
VP ENAP policemen arrested a woman who was born in 1963 suspected this month and had been harassed in the company.
In relation to the incident, criminal proceedings have been initiated for recruitment, if done to a large extent.
The law provides for the withdrawal of liberty for a period of up to ten years by confiscation of property or without confiscation of property.

In Estonia, nine people were exposed to Zika virus antibodies.
Nine Zikas virus antibodies have been identified in Estonia, which means that they may have been in contact with this infection, reported by the Estonian public broadcaster ERR.
The laboratory's information shows that this year Zika virus tests were carried out for 121 samples and nine of them were positive.
The first cases of Zika have been identified from Estonia in neighbouring countries in Finland and Sweden.
Estonia’s health management data indicate that no acute cases of Zika’s infection have been recorded in the country and that in case of flu-like symptoms, people do not have to perform a Zika’s virus test, but they should contact their family doctor.
We have found IgG (Immunoglobulin G class) antibodies that show that the person to be tested is at some point infected with Zikas or similar virus.
"It does not mean that the patient is infected with Zika's virus," explained the head of the Synlab Disease Division of the laboratory Pauls Nábers.
The "Aedes" gene of Zika's virus has been transferred.
In Latvia there is a problem with the development of quality car purchases, BNS told the agency in an interview with Auto Association Vice-President Ingus Rutiš.
Whether there are problems with dumping prices in the car sector or in the car sector, Rutīš replied positively.
Of course.
Car purchases differ from service purchases where handling at prices is easier.
The final result of the car must be paid in any case because it must be purchased from the manufacturer.
However, the problem is and can be classified in two groups.
Whether the contracting authority is incompetent or unable to create a qualitative procurement, as a result, it is often not aware of it, "purchase".
"Or a very well-known purchase is being built to get something concrete, and then there are all the wonders that are visible," said the Vice-President of the Auto Association.
He pointed out that it is now popular to talk about moving away from the lowest price offer to the most economically advantageous offer as a criterion for determining the buyer, but in part the public still has a false idea about these things.
Now it is very popular - let's go from the lowest price to the most economically advantageous offer!
However, the criteria must be established in both cases and, when taken into account and evaluated, the decision shall be taken on the basis of the lowest price principle.
The technical criteria for quality procurement should be very precise and market-friendly.
However, there is no need for points to evaluate anything that can be expressed in terms of money.
Points should not assess fuel consumption, emissions, service and similar matters.
It is the expected life cycle of the car, the journey etc., but it can also easily be counted together.
"The question then is only about which of the scenarios is the client's interest?" explained Rutīn.
Peter Rubulis, on the other hand, pointed out that the problems are linked to the fact that often the same person makes purchases for both cars and work and food, and these purchases are derived from one sample.
We have also brought to our consultation the spare parts of the purchase sample, which was difficult to describe rather than a detailed absurdity.
"The problem is that the purchaser very often lacks any understanding of the subject matter and the requirements are simply copied from somewhere," said Rubulis.
Rutīn added, on the other hand, that less is the structure that announces the purchase, because there may be more problems.
"This is obviously because of a lack of human resources and competences," said the vice-president of the associations.

"The Answer" accuses "The Unit of Suicides" of mastering style.
The South African group "Die Reply" accused the director of the film "Suicide Sqaud" on Thursday about the use of the group's unique look without permission, calling the honorary director "the little dainty."
The group's lead singer in the mobile app "Instagram" addressed the film director "Warner Bros", saying, "That's right, David Ajer, you look at our style".
As she claims, the film stars of the War of Delavinia and Jared Leto have told you that Ayers was yours on the filming field of Die Reply.
"But you didn't ask for permission to cheat on us," said the singer.
The 31-year-old musician claims that her group member Ninja (Ninja) had briefly turned to Ajera in this matter, but he "did not answer anything as such a little bit of food would be eaten".
Jolandi argues that Ajers has lost the scene since 2011 in short films "Umshini Wam" in which the South African hippop duo is seen.
She also published a video showing that Ayers Joker and Harley Queen had gone from the look of both singers.
Leto himself argues that the inspiration of the image of Joker is based on the image of the handicraft David Bowie.
The Netherlands concludes its claim by voting in favour of the heavy critic’s assessment of the film’s performance.
Jolandi and Ninja, in real terms Anri du Tuata and Watkins Tudors Jones, earned a fame with three repa studio records, popularizing African 'Zef' counterculture.
Today's most brilliant gypsies and jazz guitarist assembly "The Rosenberg Trio" (The Netherlands) will be the first time in Latvia to hear this evening, August 12th, at the festival "Summertime" - Inese Galante calls.

Turkey searches for missing diplomats
Turkey is looking for at least 32 diplomats who did not return after the attempt on 15 July with the withdrew staff.
Minister for Foreign Affairs Mevits Čavušogl said on Friday that, from the workplaces around the world, 208 Turkish Ministry staff were withdrawn from Ankara for the time of the round-off investigation, and 32 have been missing "without permission".
Some 18,000 civilians, military leaders and academics have been arrested or withdrawn from their duties in Turkey, viewing them as loyal US officer Fetul Gulen, who is accused of developing a government recovery plan.
Gulen, who lives in Pennsylvania, is one of Turkey's most sought after men.
Kavooglu said that the U.S. Department of Justice team will visit Turkey later this month to discuss its possible issue.
This issue has become a problem in the US in relations with Turkey, NATO Member State.
The U.S. opposed the strong armament tactics of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after turning, and Turkey responded in an effort to establish closer ties with Russia.
Kavooglu said that Turkish military attachés in Greece had fled to Italy, the attaché in Kuwait tried to flee to Saudi Arabia, but was sent back, and two Generals from Afghanistan were arrested in Dubai and sent to Turkey.
He also said that two Bangladeshi officials fled to New York, and one of the Russians went to Japan.
The Ankara newspaper Daily Hurryeit, quoting military sources, reported that the loss is also Turkey's military attaché in Jordan.
The Wall Street Journal, quoting an official of the United States who is aware of this situation, reported that a Turkish military officer based in the NATO Command Centre in Virginia has requested asylum in the United States.
There are those who have managed to escape.
There have also been refugees among our diplomats," NTV said in a Kavuoglu interview.
Since yesterday, the time has run out for those who were originally called back.
We will take legal action against those who have not returned.
The organizers of the Olympic Games try to clear the green color diving pool
The Olympic kidneys, which were scheduled for training on Friday, arrived at the closed pool because the organizers needed more time to clean green water before the first individual competitions in the Rio Olympic Games.
The water suddenly changed color on Tuesday, between the synchronized diving competition.
The organizers claimed that the water competition was safe even after the larger pool next to the water polo and the synchronized swimming were also light green.
Nursing was not yet possible when athletes arrived at the morning heating, although the pool was finally opened 13.00 after local time - only 2 1/2 hours before women competed 3 meters.
The water color looked closer to its normal color, but still with green color.
A U.S. man named Ebie Johnstone, who is struggling with tramplin, told me that she only came to the heat to find out that the pool was closed without warning.
She wrote in her tweet that "#FixTheSwamp (salve dirt) should be fashion.
British kidney Tom Deili, who fought bronze in a synchronized platform's kidney, also commented on the status of the pool on Twitter.
It is hoped that this means that we are not as bad as we are in the last days!
Mario Andrada, the head of the local organizers’ committee, stressed that the pool is safe for competitions by giving green light to the 3m prerequisites.
He agreed that some athletes had trouble watering, but he said it was the result of the pool’s cleaning efforts.
"We repeat over and over again what we have said all the time - water in no way threatens the health of athletes," he said.
On the first day of such a water situation, one or two athletes complained that they had no eyes.
This was the result that the first reaction, when we saw how water becomes green, was using one of the chemicals - chlorine - it is used very often in swimming pools.
We immediately reduced the quantity.
We rechecked the water, and it fully responded to the parameters.
Simons Langford, the main spokesman of the Maria Lenka Water Sports Centre, said that the pool was closed for additional cleaning work.
He said he supported the decision by the leading organization FINA (International Swimming Federation).
"The reason is that the water needs to be calm so that the pool can get back to its blue color as soon as possible," Langford said in his statement.
Andrada said that the deterioration of the pool's condition surprised unprepared organizers.
"Chemology is not accurate science," he said.
Some things you can see take a long time.
In the last few days, the development of water color in normal conditions has made it even more difficult.
"Something wrong," Andrad said.
He added that early in the morning sportsmen were available in January, but he admitted that it was "not ideal."
He explained that the change in pool colour was due to an increased level of alkalinity, as the aquarium water can become green if not properly monitored.
When we started doing something to prevent green color, there was a discussion about the best chemicals.
We can't use too much chemicals in water because athletes are training in it," Andrada said.
We would certainly have been able to do better at the beginning so as not to allow the water to become green.
When it became green, we made a mistake again.
AP sports reviewers J. Cohens and Steve Weid Riodežanier participated in this issue.
Shanghai, Taipei, despite stopping cross-border communication, however, a forum is being held
However, Shanghai and Taipei are holding an annual city forum from 22 to 23 August in Taipei, the Shanghai municipality announced on Friday despite the suspension of cross-border communication mechanisms.
This High-level Municipal Officer, Mr. Hailins, will lead a delegation represented in the forum on behalf of Janga Xionga, announced by the Government of Shanghai in its official microblog account, Sina Weibo.
The forum has been held in the order of rotation of both cities since 2010.
The 2016 Forum will focus on sharing experiences in areas such as health care, electronic administrative services, culture and transport, with a view to "enhancing the exchange of experience and cooperation in various aspects" between the two cities, as reported by the Government of Shanghai.
The Taiwanese side has not recognised the 1992 agreement that strengthened the single Chinese principle since the new leader, Tsai Ing-vens, took office in May, as a result of which communication and consultation mechanisms have been suspended.
On Friday, Ma Xiaoguang , a spokesman for the State Council of Taiwan's Landing Office, said that a peaceful cross-border relationship could exist until the Taiwanese side stops at the political foundations of the 1992 agreement.
"We have an active and open attitude towards the exchange of experience between the cities of both sides," the MA said, stressing that the nature of cross-border relations and the exchange of experience of cities should be properly interpreted.
The President of Uganda meets with the Chinese Foreign Minister, hoping for closer cooperation
On Thursday, meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Vango Ji, President Joveri Musveni of Uganda thanked China for its long-term support for Uganda's development and expressed hope for closer cooperation.
Museveni said that China is a sensible friend of Uganda and Africa who supported the liberation of the African continent from colonialism and later supported Africa's economic and social development.
The president mentioned the construction of Tanzania-Zambian railways in the 1970s as proof of China's generous support, which was provided even when China itself was not particularly fed.
Museveni said that China has implemented multilateral cooperation with Uganda by investing in infrastructure and business as well as cultural exchanges, and added that such cooperation contributes to the long-term development of Uganda more than mere financial assistance.
He hopes that China will be able to participate in various ways in the development of Uganda's infrastructure and in the construction of industrial parks.
He also calls on the Chinese to invest more in Uganda and travel it.
Wang Ji praised Uganda's efforts in the areas of industrialisation and agricultural modernisation and added that China would continue to be the most reliable and ideal partner for Uganda's cooperation.
Vangs announced that China is ready to do everything possible to help implement Uganda's economic and social development, and added that China and Uganda's cooperation is true and without any political considerations, because it is based on high-level political reliability and time- tested friendship.
He said that China could strengthen cooperation with Uganda's infrastructure and industrial parks, as well as support the development of the energy and agricultural sectors of this East African people.
