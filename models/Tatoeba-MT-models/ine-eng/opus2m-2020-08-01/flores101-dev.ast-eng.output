Karno is a well-known and controversial English teacher who placed a school in Modern Education and King's Glory and claimed to have the number of 9,000 students in his career.
In his notes he used words that some parents and mothers consider gross, and agreed with the reports he used bad words in class.
Modern Education accused him of putting big ads on buses without permission and of lying about being the principal English tutor.
He was also previously charged with copyright violations, but had no charges.
One former student said that he was "talking in the classroom, learning to connect to the points and was like a fellow student."
In the last three decades, although it remains officially a communist state, China has developed a market economy.
The first economic reforms were made under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping.
Since then, China's economic power has multiplied its value 90 times.
For the first time last year, China exported more cars than Germany and went beyond the US. as the largest market in industry.
China's GDP can be higher than that of the United States in two decades.
The tropical storm Danielle, the fourth storm named from the 2010 furacanes season, was formed in the east of the Atlantic Ocean.
The storm, located about 3,000 miles from Miami, Florida, brings sustained winds of 40 miles per hour (64 km/h)
Scientists at the Furacan National Center predict that Danielle took power and was turned into a hurricane on Wednesday.
It is still difficult to calculate the potential damage in the United States or in the Caribbean.
Born in the capital of Croatia, Zagreb, Bobek became famous playing for the partisan of Belgrade.
He joined them in 1945 and remained until 1958.
In his time with his computer, he scored 403 goals in 468 participations.
Naide played as many games as she ever scored more goals with her computer as Bobek.
In 1995 he was voted as the best player in Partizán's history.
The celebrations began with a special show from the group known worldwide as Cirque du Soleil.

Luckily it didn't happen to me, but I saw macabre scenes trying to break people's windows to get out.
There were people beating the crystals with them, but the windows were unbreakable.
"One of the crystals finally broke, and they started going out the window," said survivor Fanciszek Kowal.
Stars give light and heat to the energy they do when hydrogen atoms mix (or merge) with other heavier elements.
Researchers are working to create a reactor that can produce energy the same way.
This, however, is a perfidious problem of solving and it's going to take many years to see closed fusion reactors that are useful.
The steel needle floats over the water by the surface tension.
Surface tension is produced because molecules on the surface of the water attract more each other than the air molecules above them.
Water molecules form an invisible peel on the surface of the water that allows things like a needle to float over it.
The modern patent knife has a double thread with a concave on the middle. The two lines make it fit better on the floor, until it is done by one side.
Since the lower part of the knife is curved, from which the knife is tilted one side or another, the wire that is in contact with the needle is also curved.
This makes the skater turn, if the skates turn to the right, the skater will turn to the right, if they do it to the left, the skater turns to the left.
To get back to their previous level of energy, they have to get rid of the extra energy that came out of the light.
This is done by issuing a small particle of light called photon.
Scientists call this process "stimulated radiation emissions" because atoms are stimulated with strong light, which causes the emission of a light photon, and the light is a type of radiation.
The next illustration shows how atoms emit photons. Since then, the photons are actually much smaller than those of the drawing.
Photons are even smaller than the matter of what atoms are closed!
After hundreds of hours of use, the filament ends to melt and the bomber stops working.
The bomb needs replacement. You need to search when you change it.
You must first turn off the lamp or disconnect its cable.
This is because the letter of the plug where the metal part of the bomb is connected can stick a good pencil if you touch the plug or the metal part while it is partially embedded.
The largest organ in the circulatory apparatus is the heart, which pumps blood.
The blood comes from the heart through tubes called arteries and goes back to others called veins. The thinest are called hairdressers.
The teeth of a triretaops could not only crush leaves, but also strong branches and roots.
Some scientists believe that the Triceratops eat peanuts, which is a common type of critical plant.
These plants are like tiny palm trees with a bunch of leafy leaves and rocks.
Triteratops may use their strong tip to peel the leaves before eating the killer.
Other scientists say that these plants are very poisonous, however, it is unlikely that any dinosaur will eat them; now Galbanians and other animals such as them (which descend from dinosaurs) can eat poisonous leaves or fruit.
How would you take away from me the gravity of Io? If you had on Io's surface you would weigh less than you weigh on the earth.
A person who weighs 200 books (90 k) on Earth will weigh about 36 books (16 k) on Io. So gravity, of course, takes less than you.
The sun doesn't have a cortex like the Earth in which to move. It's all gas, fuzzy and plasma closed.
The gas is done longer than the distance from the center of the sun.
The outer part that we see when we look at the Sun is called the photoosphere, which literally means "the golden ball".
About three years later, in 1610, the Italian astronomer Galileo Galileo used a telescope to observe that Venus had phases, like the Moon.
The phases are produced because only the side of Venus (or the Moon) that gives to the Sun receives light. The phases of Venus support Copernicus' theory that the planets rotate around the Sun.
Then, a few years later in 1639, an English astronomer named Jeremiah Horrocks observed a trance of Venus.
England lived a long period of peace after the conquest of Danelaw.
Anyway, in 991, Etelredu had to face a larger Viking fleet than anyone since Guthrum's time, a first century.
This fleet led by Olaf Trygvasson, a Norwegian who was about to release his country from Danish rule.
After several military coups, Etelredu obtained an agreement with Olaf, who returned to Norway with the desire to claim the throne, which I did with its unequalness.
The Hangul is the only alphabet at the expense of its popular and daily use. The alphabet was invented in 1444 while King Sejong's kingdom (1418–1450).
Sejong the Great was the fourth king of the Joshuan dynasty and is one of the most admired.
He originally called the Hangul alphabet Hunminjeongeum, which means "the right sounds for people's instruction".
There are many theories about how Sanskrit began. One of them is about air migration from the West to India that took its language with them.
Sanskrit is an ancient language that is comparable to Latin spoken in Europe.
The first book of the world known is written in Sanskrit. After the collection of the Upanishads, Sanskrit was lost in the hierarchy.
Sanskrit is a complex and rich language that has served as its base for many modern Indian languages, in the same way that Latin is the basis for European languages such as French and Spanish.
At the end of the French war, Germany began to prepare to invade the island of Britain.
Germany pointed to the attack on the key name of "Operation Lion Marine". Most of the British army's weapons and supplies were lost in the evacuation of Dunquerque, so they were too weak.
But the Royal Navy was even stronger than the German Navy ("Kriegsmarine") and could destroy any fleet of invasion sent by the Canal.
In any case, a few British Royal Navy ships were based near the likely routes of the invasion, drawing the admirers on the possibility that the German air raids would undermine them.
We started by explaining Italy's plans. Italy was basically the German and Japan's brother.
They had an army and a weaker army, even though they had just made four new ships before the war began.
Italy's main goal was African countries. To control those countries, they needed a launch so that the troops could cross the Mediterranean and invade Africa.
After all, they had to rid themselves of British bases and ships in Egypt. In addition to these actions, the Italian warships had to do nothing more.
Japan was an island country, just like Britain.
Somarians are ships designed to travel under the water, and there is a great amount of time left.
The submarines were used in the First and Second World Wars. They were then very slow and had a very short range of shooting.
At the beginning of the war, they were displaced by the marine surface, but when the radars developed and perfected, the submarines had to smorguise to avoid being detected.
German submarines were called U-Boats. Germans were well suited to navigate and manage their submarines.
Because of its success with the submarines, after the war, Germans are not allowed to have many.
Yes! Pharaoh Tutancamon, sometimes called "Pharaoh Tut" or "the boy Pharaoh", is one of the most famous Pharaohs of ancient Egypt in modern times.
Interestingly, it was not considered very important in the old domain and it was not registered in most royal lists.
However, the discovery of this tomb was famous in 1922. Although many ancient tombs were stolen, this tomb remained virtually intact.
Most of the objects buried with Tutancamon are preserved, including thousands of artifacts closed with precious metals and rare stones.
The invention of radio wheels made the Assyrian cars lighter, faster and better prepared to leave behind soldiers and other cars.
The arrows of the mortal dancers could destroy the armor of the enemy soldiers. Around 1000 C.E., the Assyrians introduced the first cavalry.
The cavalry is an army that fights the horse. The riding seat will not be invented yet, so the Assyrian cavalry fought over the naked back of its horses.
We know many Greek politicians, scientists and artists. Probably the most famous person in this culture is Homero, the legendary Greek poet, who composed two masterpieces of Greek literature: the poems of Iliada and Odisea.
Sofocles and Aristophanes continue to be popular playwrights and their works are considered among the best in universal literature.
Another famous Greek is the mathematical Pythagorean, known for its famous theorem about the relationship between the sides of the rectangular triangles.
There are limited calculations of how many people speak Hindi. It is believed that it is between the second and the fourth most spoken language in the world.
The number of native speakers changes depending on whether the dials shown are taken into account.
Estimates range from 340 million to 500 million speakers, and up to 800 million people understand it.
Hindi and Urdu are similar in vocabulary but not in writing; speakers of both languages can be understood in everyday conversations.
During the 15th century, northern Estonia had a lot of German cultural influence.
Some German monks wanted to warn God of native people, so they invented the Estonian literary language.
It was based on the German alphabet and added the graph "Õ/õ".
In time, many German loans were converted. This marked the beginning of the illustration.
According to tradition, the heir to the throne would only have military training to finish the studies.
He studied anthropology and archaeology at Trinity College in Cambridge and later in history; he graduated from 2:2 (a minor title).
Carlos was the first member of the British royal family to get a title.
European Turkey (East Tracia or Rumelia in the Balkan Peninsula) includes 3% of the country.
Turkey's territory is more than 1,600 kilometres (1,000 km) long and 800 km (500 km) wide, with a more or less rectangular shape.
Turkey's surface, including lakes, covers 783,562 square kilometres (300948 square miles), of which 755,688 square kilometres (291,773 square miles) are in South-West Asia and 23,764 square kilometres (9,174 square miles) in Europe.
Turkey's surface makes it the 37th largest country in the world; it has the combined size of continental France and the United Kingdom.
Turkey is surrounded by the sea for three parts: the West Ezeu Sea, the Black Sea for the North and the Mediterranean Sea for the South.
Luxembourg has a long history, but its independence date of 1839.
Part of the current Belgian territory was part of Luxembourg in the past, but it became Belgium with the Belgian Revolution of 1830.
Luxembourg always tried to remain as a neutral country, but it occupied Germany both in World War I and World War II.
In 1957 Luxembourg became a founding member of the organization currently known as the European Union.
Drukgyal Dzong is a fortress in ruins and a Buddhist monastery on the upper part of the Paro district (in the village of Phondey).
It is said that in 1649 Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel created him strong to commemorate his victory against the Tibetan-Mongolian forces.
In 1951 a fire forgave a few relics of Drukgyal Dzong, such as the sculpture of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal.
After the fire, the fortress was preserved and protected, maintaining itself as one of Bhutan's most fabulous attractions.
In the 18th century, Cambodia was built between two powerful neighbours, Thailand and Vietnam.

Every eight years, about 1.5 million herbivores are displaced from the hills of the north against the plains of the south, crossing the Mara River, looking for the rain.
And back north west, crossing the Mara River again, after passing the rains by April.
The Serengeti region is within the Serengeti National Park, the Ngorogoro Conservation Zone and the Maswa Recreational Reserve and the Masai Mara National Reserve in Kenya.
Learning to make interactive means involves both conventional and traditional skills and skills learned in interactive classes (writing scripts, editing video and audio, speaking, etc.)
The interactive design needs to re-evaluate our ideas, not just five to the production and we learn to think of nonlinear forms.
The interactive design rich that the components of a project are connected between them, but also felt like an entity apart.
The problem with the zoom lens is that the focus complexity and the number of lens elements needed to get a list of focal lengths are much greater than for fixed targets.
This has less impact because lens manufacturers are improving production standards.
This allowed zooming lenses to set photos of a quality comparable to that of a fixed focus distance lens.
Another disadvantage of the growth lenses is that the maximum opening or speed of the lens is lower.
This makes it difficult to use cheap zoom lenses in low light conditions without a flash.
One of the most common problems when converting a movie to a DVD is overscan.
Most of the televisions are closed to please the general public.
That's why all that you see on TV has cut edges, tops, bottoms and sides.
This is used to ensure that the image covers the entire screen. It is called "Overscan".
Unfortunately, when you make a DVD, the more likely the edges are also cut and, if the video has too many titles near the edge, they won't be seen properly.
The traditional medieval castle inspired much imagination, conjuring images of justice, lacqueredness and arturic cavalry.
As long as the millennial ruins remain, it is easy to bring to mind the sound and aromas of old battles, until we almost feel the noise of the helmets in our wake and swallow the honey rising from the bush.
But is it our imagination based on reality? Why did castles be built? How were they designed and built?
The typical Kirby Muxloe castle, typical of the period, is more secure house than a complete castle.
Your large crystalline windows and thin walls would not support multiple attacks for a long time.
In the 1480s, when Lord Hastings began his construction, the country was in relative peace, and the defense was no longer necessary but against small band of thieves.
The balance of power was a system in which European countries sought to maintain the national sovereignty of all states of the continent.
The idea was that all European nations would seek to avoid any nation becoming powerful and porous, national governments often changed their alliances to maintain balance.
The Spanish succession war was the first war in which the central issue was the balance of power.
This meant an important exchange, because European powers would no longer have the pretext of religious conflict; therefore, the war of the Thirty Years was the last war on religious issues.
The temple of Artemis in Ephesus was destroyed on June 21, 356 B.C.E., and was not intended for Erostrato.
According to the narrative, his motivation was the fame at any cost. The effects, offended, announced that the Erostraut's name should never be mentioned.
Greek historian Estrabón later noted the name, so we know about it now. The temple was destroyed the same night that Alexandru Magno was born.
Alexandru, as king, was offered to pay for the reconstruction, but they denied it. After Alexander died in 323 C.E., the temple was rebuilt.
Make sure that your hand is as relaxed as possible while giving good notes; it also avoids the extra movements of the gods.
In this way, you will lose weight as much as possible, remember that you don't need to hit the keys with too much effort to get more volume as is done in the piano.
In agreement, to have more volume, use the sheets with more pressure or speed.
Mysticism is the search for communion, identity or consciousness of a last reality, a deity, a spiritual truth, or God.
The believer seeks a direct experience, intuition, or vision of the divine reality/dad or deities.
Followers are looking for certain forms of life or practice that feed on these experiences.
Mysticism is strained by other forms of religious and cult religion by the emphasis on the direct personal experience of a unique state of consciousness, in particular by keeping seal, glow, gaysperu or the same euphoric.
Sikhism is a religion of the Indian subcontinent. It originated in the Panyab region in the 15th century of a sectarian break within the Hindu tradition.
Sikhs consider their faith to be an extreme Hindu religion, though they recognize Hindu roots and sometimes Hindus.

The Indo Valley civilization was a civilization of the bronze age in the northwest of the Indian subcontinent that included most of the current Pakistan and parts of the northwest of India and the north-east of Afghanistan.
Civilisation flourished in the Indu River basin, where it came with its name.
Even some scholars say that when civilization exists also in the river basins, today the drought, Sarasvati, should be called Indo-Sarasvati civilization. Others call the Harapana civilization, by Harappa, the first eviction that took place in the twenty-first years.
The militaryist nature of the Roman Empire helped to develop medical advances.
The Emperor Augustus joined the first doctors and formed the first Roman Medical Corps to be used after the battles.
The surgeons had knowledge of several sedatives that included morphine, extracts of the ampola grain, and scopolamine, of the benign grain.
They became experts in amputating to save patients with gangrene, as well as torniquets and arterial pins to control blood flow.
Over many centuries, the Roman Empire has had great advances in melecine that have reached today and are the basis of what we know.
The pureland origami is an origami with a restriction that no more than one fold can be made at a time, the more complex folds are not allowed such as the reverse fold and all the folds must have a clear location.
It was developed by John Smith in the 1970s to help inexperienced practitioners or those with limited motor skills.
Children develop a sense of race and racial stereotypes of good young people and this affects their behavior.
It is also, children of racial minorities with low academic performance stereotype tend not to do so well in their classes after knowing about the stereotype associated with their race.
MySpace is the third most popular website in the United States and has today 54 million profiles.
These web pages have called great attention, especially in the educational field.
These websites have positive aspects, including those that are easy to develop a class page where blogs, videos, photos and other items can be included.
You can easily access this page by giving a web page, which makes it easy to remember and write to students who have keyboard or spelling problems.
It can be customised to make it easy to read and have as many colors as we want.
The anxiety about lack of attention "is a neurological syndrome and the classic definition of its characteristic symptoms includes impulse, distraction, hyperactivity and energy output".
It's not an intellectual disability but a learning environment; "it affects 3 out of 5 children, perhaps reaching 2 million in the United States."
Children with TDA have problems focusing on duties, but they can do it with things that I lend them, like playing video games, watching drawings or writing phrases without score.
These children also face many problems because they "participate in risky behaviors, engage in riots and question authority" to stimulate their brain, which cannot be stimulated by normal methods.
The TDA affects relationships with peers because other children can't understand why they do what they do or why they write as they write, because their maturity level is extreme.
By changing the ability to gain knowledge and to learn, as mentioned above, the basic rate at which knowledge was acquired changed.
The method to get information from was extreme. Pressure stopped getting into individual memory, but the ability to remember texts became a focus.
In essence, the Renaissance changed significantly the focus of learning and the dissemination of knowledge.
Unlike other primitives, mummies don't use their hands to move, load weight, or mix with trees.
The hands and feet of the chimpanzees are similar in size and length, although the hand carries the weight of our nails as we walk.
The human hand is shorter than the foot, with more straight bows.
The fossils of hands from two to three million ancient times reveal this change in the specialization of the hand of locationomotion to manipulation.
Some people think that experimenting with a lot of lucid dreams can often be tired.
The main reason for this phenomenon is the result of lucid sounds, extending the duration of time between REM states.
With less REMs per night, this state in which real experiments dream and your body is recovered becomes uncommon as to be a problem.
This is as tired as waking up every twenty or thirty minutes and watching TV.
The effect depends on the frequency per night when your brain tries to dream in a lucid way.
Things didn't go well for the Italians in North Africa almost from the start. In the week they declared war on 10 June 1940, the 11th squadron of British housewives located Fort Capuzzo in Libya.
In an ambush east of Bradia, the British captured the chief engineer of the tenth army, General Lastucci.
On June 28th, Marshall Italo Balbo, the governor general of Libya and the supposed successor of Mussolini, was murdered by a friend who was buried in Tobruc.

Maybe the most common type of tourism is what people associate with traveling: recreational tourism.
This is when people go to a place that's very different from their daily life to relax and enjoy.
The sands, the thematic parks and the campaigns are the places to which tourists are told.
When the objective of our visit to a specific site is to know its history and culture, this type of tourism is known as cultural tourism.
Tourists can visit certain designated places from a particular country or can choose to focus only on a specific area.
The colonials, in view of the activity, also called for reinforcements.
It is up to the troops to strengthen the front positions until the 1st and 3rd New Hampshire regiments with 200 men, under the command of Colonel John Stark and James Reed (both became generals).
Stark's men were positioned along the valley in the far north of the position occupied by the settlers.
When the tide opened down a gap along the Mystic river in the north-east part of the peninsula, they extended the valley with a low stone wall in the north direction, ending it on the shore of the water on a small beach.
Well Gridley well Stark punctured a position of about 100 feet (30 m) ahead of the valley and ordered that it not be shot until regular soldiers passed it.
The American plan was to launch coordinated attacks from three different positions.
General John Cadwalder launched a distraction attack against the British garrison in Bordentown, to cut any reinforcements.
General James Ewing was supposed to cross the river with 700 militias in Trenton Ferry, take the bridge over Assunpink Creek and avoid enemy troops fleeing.
The main assault force, consisting of 2,400 soldiers, was to cross the river nine miles north of Trenton, and then stretch into two groups, one under Greene's command and the other under Sullivan, in order to launch an attack before it takes place.
With the change of a quarter of a mile for a half mile, speed is much less important and resistance is paramount.
Since then, a first runner, who runs half a mile in less than two seconds, is somebody fast, but has to develop resistance.
Run around the field for winter, besides telling the gymnasium to strengthen the top of the body, is the best preparation for the race season.
Appropriate nutrition patterns do not guarantee elite performance, but may affect the general health of young athletes.
Maintaining the energy balance, hydrating well and understanding the various aspects of the supplement can contribute to the improvement of its performance and increase the enjoyment of the practice.
Running medium distances is a relatively cheap sport; however, there is a lot of confusion rather than five little equipment that is needed for it.
Products may be purchased as required, but most will have little or no impact on performance.
Athletes can prefer a product but I don't give them real benefits.
The atom can be considered one of the fundamental foundations of any matter.
It's a complex entity, which consists of, you agree with the simplified Bohr model, not a nucleus orbited by electrons, in a way similar to the planets orbiting the sun – see Figure 1.1.
The nucleus is made up of two particles — neutrons and protons.
The protons have a positive electric charge and the neutrons don't have a charge. The electrons have a negative electric charge.
To see the victim, you'll first check the scene to ensure your safety.
You have to get stuck in the victim's position when you land and see any automatic warning signal.
If you're not trying to help, maybe the only thing you do is make everything worse.
The study showed that depression, leprosy and catastrophic thinking mediate in the relationship between pain and disability in people with lumbar pain.
Only the effects of catastrophic, non-depressional thinking, and the lesion were conditional for weekly PA sessions.
Those who participate in regular activities need more support in terms of negative perception of pain, distinguishing the differences between chronic pain and the feeling of discomfort of normal physical movement.
The view, or ability to see, depends on the ability of the mouse sensors on the visual system or the eye.
There are many different constructions of eyes, which vary in their complexity depending on the needs of the body.
The different constructions have different capacities, are sensitive to different wave frequencies and have different degrees of accuracy. In addition, they need different processings to understand the input and different numbers to function optimally.
A population is the set of organisms of a particular species in a given geographical area.
When all individuals in a population are identical to a particular phenotype, it is known as monomorphic.
When subjects show several variants of a phenotype they are polymorphic.
The colonies of humble warriors also go and thrive in extreme phases.
In the nomadic phase, an army of ants marches at night and stops to camp in the daytime.
The colony begins a nomadic phase when the food available decreases. In this phase, the colony makes temporary nerds that change every day.
Noun of these nomadic hares or marches last about 17 days.
What is a cell? The cell word comes from the Latin word "cell" which means "small room" and uses it for the first time a researcher who observed the structure of the body.
The cell is the basic unit of all living things, and all organisms are composed of one or more cells.
In fact, cells are so basic and important for the study of life that they are often called "life thieves".
The nervous system keeps homeostasis sending nerve impulses across the body to keep the flow of blood well and without problems.
These nerve impulses can be sent so quickly through the body that they help keep the body safe and any potential threat.

Maybe one day your grandchildren come to a planet with alien life and wonder about their origins.
The animals are closed by many cells, they eat things and they tell them inside. Most of the animals can move.
Only animals have brains (even not all animals have them; aquatic animals, for example, do not have them).
The animals are found all over the earth. They were on the earth, swimming in the oceans and flying in the sky.
The cell is the smallest structural and functional unit of the organisms.
Cell comes from the Latin word cell, which means fourth little.
If you notice someone alive with a microscope, you'll see that they're closed by quadrilaterals or platinums.
Robert Hooke, an English biologist, saw small paintings in the barn with a microscope.
It was the first person to see the dead cells.
Elements and compositions can move from one state to another without changing.
The nitrogen in gaseous state has the same properties as the liquid nitrogen. The liquid state is denser but molecules are identical.
The water is another example. The water compound is formed by two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen.
They have the same molecular structure in gaseous, liquid, or solid state.
Although your physical state may change, your chemical state is maintained.
The time is something that surrounds us and affects everything we do. It's hard to understand anyway.
The time has been studied by religious, philosophical and scientific scholars for thousands of years.
We experience the time as a series of events that cover the future, the present, and the past.
The time is also how we compare the duration of events.
You can observe the time step by itself when you observe the repetition of a cyclic phenomenon. A cyclic phenomenon is something that happens once and for all regularly.

Most of the 19th and 20th centuries thought that the Maori were the first inhabitants of New Zealand; they hunted giant birds, months.
The theory then established the idea that the Maori people emigrated from Polynesia into a large fleet and brought New Zealand from the moratoriums, setting up an agricultural society.
However, nine evidence suggests that the Moriori were a group of Maori from the continent that emigrated from New Zealand to the Chatham Islands, developing their own peaceful culture.
There's also another tribe in the Maori-born Chatham Islands to emigrate from New Zealand.

By listening to people share their individual, family and organizational stories, we get a valuable view of the past and of some of the personalities that influenced, for good or for bad, the culture of the organization.
Even knowing your own history does not imply understanding your culture, it makes people aware of which part of the organization they are.
As they check out the manifesto and note the errors, individuals and all those involved will better discover the values, missions and what moves the organization.
Thus, recalling previous examples of initial behavior and the resulting successes, they helped people to open up to new changes and guidelines for local lysis.

The objective of this position is to speed, logic and precision, in addition to identifying closes, replication of existing technologies and finding information.
The most important thing in this mindset is that there is only one possible answer. You only think about two answers, that's correct or wrong.
This type of thinking is associated with certain procedures, scientific or normal.
People with this kind of intelligence have a logical thinking, they can wake up from patterns, solve problems, and work in scientific studies.
Humans are often the most talented species in reading the minds of others.

The IRM is based on a physical phenomenon named nuclear magnetic resonance (RMN), which he discovered in 1930 Felix Bloch (who worked at Stanford University) and Edward Purcell (from Harvard University).
In this resonance, magnetic fields and radio waves make atoms emit tiny radio signals.
In 1970, Raymond Damadian, a scientist and researcher, discovered the image of magnetic resonance as a tool for medical diagnosis.
Four years later a patent was issued, which was the first patent issued in the RMI field.
In 1977, Dr. Damadian completed the construction of the first MRI scanner of "body-integrity", which he called "indomitable".
