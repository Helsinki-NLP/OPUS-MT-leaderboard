Cumulative rapidly progressive incidence of coronary disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of cases of coronary disease (COVID-19) shows similar trends in the European Union/Economic Area countries and the United Kingdom, confirming that, although it is at a different stage depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is moving rapidly across all countries.
Based on Italy's experience, countries, hospitals and ICUs should prepare themselves more for an outbreak of patients with COVID-19 who will need care and, above all, intensive treatment.
On 31 December 2019, a portion of cases of unknown etiology pneumonia was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Center for Control and Prevention of China’s Diseases informed the cause agent as being a new coronavirus, now referred to as coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The evidence so far is that 80% of people with COVID-19 develop a mild form of the disease, that is, an infection of respiratory treatment with or without pneumonia, and most of them recover.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 evolves into a more serious disease, requiring hospitalization, while 6% of the remaining cases evolve into a critical disease, requiring intensive treatment.
The mortality of hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 is 4%.
In this study, we evaluated trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each country of the European Union/Economic Area (EU/EEA) and in the United Kingdom and compared them with those of the Province of Hubei, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom with Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
Cases of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
After China, COVID-19 spread geographically, and the dynamics of COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world are now following that country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic.
The edition of 5 March 2020 of Eurosurveillance, Spiterie et al., reported the first cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Europe, according to the WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 in people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 15 March 2020, the cases of COVID-19 had already been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom, and between 31 December 2019 and the date mentioned above 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths had been reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths only in Italy.
Obtaining cumulative numbers and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the number of reported cases of COVID-19 in each country of the world, obtained only from official sources, such as the Ministry of Health of the countries, national and regional health authorities and WHO, is updated every day at 8 a.m.
These data were used to assess the trends of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom and to compare them with those of Italy.
As an approximation of the prevalence of active cases of COVID-19, we calculate the cumulative truncated incidence of 14 days of COVID-19 cases, taking into account, therefore, the natural evolution of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and in the United Kingdom between 1 January and 15 March 2020.
We also present the cumulative number of reported cases from each country until 15 March 2020 at 8 p.m. and compared with Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Trends in COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
Trends in the cumulative truncated incidence of 14 days of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom generally followed those of the Province of Hubei in China (Figure 1).
In general, for the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to increase by around 21 February and significantly increased by around 28 February 2020 (additional material).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in cases reported in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom have shown similar increases in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (additional material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom compared to Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
It notes that by 15 March at 8 p.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom had already reported a total number of cases comparable to Italy 3 weeks or less ago.
Our results indicate that the number of reported cases of COVID-19 is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom.
The trends observed in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is progressing at a similar rate in all countries.
This is true even though countries are at different stages, variations in the actions of national public health systems and possibly different definitions of cases in countries and different protocols for the selection of patients that should be tested for confirmation of COVID-19, including testing for update.
In early March 2020, doctors in affected regions of Italy described a situation in which 10% of patients with COVID-19 needed intensive treatment, and the media reported that hospitals and intensive treatment units in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on hospitalization by COVID-19 in a hospital and/or ICU are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (data not shown).
However, they should be collected in a systematic way to complement current surveillance data with focus on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A study conducted between 2010 and 2011 showed a huge variation in the availability of ICU beds and semi-intensive units in Europe, ranging from 29.2 beds in Germany to 4.2 beds in Portugal for every 100,000 people.
This means that countries can have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 UTI beds and semi-intensive treatment for a population of 100,000 between 2010 and 2011).
Modelled scenarios related to the capacity saturation of the health system, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and for the United Kingdom of the prevalence of COVID-19 hospitalization cases associated with a risk greater than 90% of the capacity for intensive treatment beds, are provided in the sixth update of the ECDC's rapid risk assessment on COVID-19.
In view of the fact that cases have so far concentrated in certain EU/EEA and UK countries, and hospitals and intensive treatment units generally address a defined regional population, information on cases and intensive treatment beds should preferably be made available in the Nomenclature of territorial units for statistical purposes 2 (NUTS-2).
Italy's example and trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly progressing in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom.
Countries, hospitals and ICUs should therefore prepare themselves for a community-supported transmission scenario of SARS-CoV-2 and for an increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 who will need medical care, especially intensive treatment, as is the case in the affected regions of Italy.
As highlighted in the rapid risk assessment of ECDC, a quick, proactive and comprehensive approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with a change in the retention approach to a mitigation approach, since the rapid increase expected in the number of cases may not provide sufficient time for decision-makers and hospitals to understand, accept and adapt their actions appropriately, if not implemented in advance.
The rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the epidemic.
There is a small window of opportunity during which countries have the possibility to intensify their control initiatives to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure on the health system.
If these initiatives fail, it is likely that the health systems of other EU/EEA countries will have an abundance of patients who will need intensive treatment in the coming days or weeks.
The epidemic of coronavirus disease in 2019 (CVID-19), caused by coronavirus 2 disease (SARS-CoV-2) of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), has already killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80 000 in China and the rest of the world, resulting in a population catastrophe.
Similar to your homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could also be transmitted from the bites and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has less severity and mortality than SARS, but it is much more transmissional, and affects older people than young people, and more men than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on the new disease, this article seeks to provide a current and comprehensive assessment of the research object, which is being developed quickly.
We will discuss the basic principles of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and disease prevention.
Although many questions still need answers, we expect this study to help understand and eradicate this hostile disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 became a unique and unforgettable memory for all Chinese who were forced to remain confined to the entire holiday and for several weeks thereafter due to the epidemic of a new viral disease.
The virus is very similar to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused a severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic (SARS) in 2003; therefore it was called SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020, and its disease was called CoV-19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and spread rapidly throughout the country and almost 50 other countries around the world.
By March 2, 2020, the virus had resulted in more than 80,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases, with more than 40,000 recovered patients and more than 3,000 dead patients.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is the "public enemy number one" and is potentially more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 articles were published on COVID-19, including its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report on 7 January 2020, which determined the sequencing of the isolated virus of several patients.
This article seeks to summarize the progress of research in this new area of rapid development.
Whenever relevant, we will compare COVID-19 to SARS and the other disease caused by CoV, the respiratory syndrome of the Middle East (MERS, an epidemic of 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far about the prevention and prognosis of the disease, as well as other urgent issues.
CoVs are traditionally considered non-lethal pathogens to humans, mainly causing about 15% of the common colds.
In the meantime, in this century, we found two highly pathogenic human CoVs, which are SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, causing an epidemic originating in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and which then spread to several other countries with frightening morbidity and mortality.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 is CoV's third epidemic in the documented history of the human being.
As demonstrated in Fig. Fig.1.1, a portion of cases of pneumonia with unknown origins was initially reported in Wuhan on 31 December 2019 to the National Health Commission of China.
Seven days later, the sequence of the CoV was published.
On 15 January 2020, Wuhan's first fatal case was reported.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to neighboring cities, provinces and countries.
On 20 January, the health professionals' contagion was reported, suggesting that the transmission between people was possible.
On 23 January, Wuhan's city was confined, with all its public transport interrupted.
On 24 January, the first clinical study on the disease reported that 41 patients with confirmed cases only 21 had direct contact with the Wuhan Sea Fruit Market, which was considered the starting point of the infection by an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, WHO declared the epidemic a global health emergency.
Until the time of this report, the disease has already spread to China and to almost 50 other countries around the world (Fig.
As the situation rapidly deteriorated, the final size and severity of the epidemic should still be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a study of several centres with 8,866 patients, including 4,021 patients confirmed with COVID-19, presented a more up-to-date illustration of the epidemic, as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, mainly in the 30-65 age group.
Almost half (47.7%) of those infected were over 50 years old, some were under 20 years old, and only 14 were under 10 years old.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 spread into groups, mainly in Hubei and its environment.
COVID-19 received an average of 5 (2 to 9) days for diagnosis based on the occurrence of symptoms.
The mean incubation period was 4.8 (3.0 to 7.2) days.
The mean time of death based on the onset of symptoms was 9.5 (4.8 to 13) days.
The baseline reproduction number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51 to 4.05) and the adjusted R0 was 2.23 to 4.82.
The number of infected persons increased exponentially before January 23, 2020, corresponding to the time of mass transport before the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality rate in confirmed patients was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10% to 1.86%) and the adjusted mortality rate for all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02% to 4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 are gender (male), age (over 60 years) and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a subfamily of large and encapsulated viruses that contain a single chain of RNA with a certain meaning.
They can be divided into four genres: alpha, beta, gamma and delta, which are known to infect human beings by alpha-coronavirus and beta-coronavirus.
Glycoprotein spike (S) of the envelope joins its cell receptors of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ECA2) and dipeptidel peptidease 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV respectively, and consequently the fusion of membranes occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released into cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, the genomic RNA accompanied by encapsulated glycoproteins and nucleocapsidium proteins forms vesiculars containing virions, which join the plasma membrane and release the virus.
The first sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 genome was reported on 10 January 2020.
It was discovered that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of betacoronavirus with more than 99.98% genetic identity among 10 sequenced samples collected from the same original place of origin, the Huaan Sea Fruit Market, in Wuhan.
SARS-COV-2 is genetically similar to SARS-COV than MERCS-COV.
Through the electronic transmission microscope, the SARS-CoV-2 particles were discovered in ultrafine sections of the epithelium of human airways.
It was discovered that human ECA2 is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, SARS-CoV-2 S protein binds to ECA2 human protein in a weaker way than SARS-CoV protein, which coincides with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes a less severe infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein encoded by orf3b and a secreted protein encoded by orf8.
SARS-CoV-2 orf3b may play a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibit IFNβ expression; however, the orf8 does not contain any known functional domain or reason.
On 18 February 2020 Zhou, et al., reported the cryo-EM structure of ECA2 of total human length to resolution of 2.9 Å in a complex with the carrier of amino acids B0AT1.
It was discovered that the complex, which had open and closed compositions, was grouped as a dam, and the ECA2-B0AT1 complex can combine two S proteins, which provides evidence for the recognition and infection by CoV.
B0AT1 may become a therapeutic target for the selection of medicines to eliminate the infection by SARS-CoV-2.
The host of origin and the intermediary
It is known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated from bites and were transmitted to human beings through civilians and camels, respectively.
Through a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, bites were considered native hosts of SARS-CoV-2, since the new virus is 96% identical to two coVs of bites similar to SARS called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
Meanwhile, the midwife who helped the virus cross the barriers to species and infect human beings remains unknown, and the transmission route still needs to be discovered.
Ji, et al., suggests that the cobras transport the virus from the bites to human beings, which involved a homologous recombination in protein S.
According to one study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, suggested that pangolins, prolonged focin mammals that feed on ants and are often used in traditional Chinese medicine are the potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2, based on the genetic homology of 99% between a coV discovered in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a 1% difference in two genomes is a great difference; therefore, final results for concrete evidence are being expected (Figure 33).
The physical-chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are largely unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days below 20 °C with humidity of 40% to 50%.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 was reported to be sensitive to ultraviolet rays and to the heat of 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, ethanol 75%, disinfectant with chlorine, peracetic acid, chloroformium and other organic solvents, but not chlorhexidine, are effective in deactivation of the virus.
In general, the entire human population does not have immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore susceptible to the new virus.
Currently, no detailed study was reported in relation to the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only consult previous studies on other CoVs, mainly on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. (Figure 4).4).
In general, after a virus invades the host, it is first recognized by the host's immune system through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including lectine type C receptors, Toll type receptor (TLR), NOD type receptor (NLR) and RIG-I type receptor (RLR).
Through different routes, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells and the synthesis of Type I interferons (IFNs), which limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, SARS-CoV protein N can help the virus escape from immune responses.
In a short time, the immune adaptive response joins in the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in the defence.
T CD4+ cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies, and T CD8+ cells directly kill the cells infected by the virus.
The collaborating T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to help defend the cells.
However, CoV can inhibit the functions of T cells by inducing the apoptosis of T cells.
Humorous immunity, including supplements such as C3a and C5a antibodies, is also essential for combating viral infection.
For example, isolated antibodies from a recovered patient neutralized the MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an exacerbated reaction of the immune system generates a large number of local free radicals that can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs and, in the worst case, multiple organ failure, and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by the occurrence of symptoms in a group of people, affects the elderly with comorbidities and pregnant women more.
It is common that people exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune system is compromised have a greater chance of being infected than other people.
The estimated average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is from 1 to 14 days and, most of the time, from 3 to 7 days, based on a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period was 3 days, on average, and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, shows that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0 to 7.2) days, based on the demographic of 8.866 cases.
It is essential that the health authorities adjust the effective quarantine time based on the most accurate period of incubation, thus preventing infected people who do not have symptoms from transmitting the virus to others.
As a current practice, individuals exposed to or infected by the virus usually need to stay in quarantine for 14 days.
Should the quarantine period be extended for 24 days?
The fever is usually the initial and main symptom of COVID-19, which can come alone or accompanied by other symptoms, such as dry cough, lack of air, muscle pain, vertigo, headache, throat pain, corsis, chest pain, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients had dyspnoea and/or hypoxaemia one week after the onset of symptoms of the disease.
In severe cases, patients rapidly evolved to acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and acute fever, even without abnormalities in the diagnosis of the lung, should pass through screening for the virus in order to receive an early diagnosis.
A demographic study at the end of December 2019 showed that the percentages of symptoms were 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for dyspnoea and 3% for diarrhoea; 8% of patients needed ventilation support.
Similar results were reported in two recent studies of a family group and a group with transmission of an asymptomatic individual.
In comparison, a demographic study in 2012 showed that patients with MERS-CoV also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnea (55%) as main symptoms.
However, 80% of patients needed ventilatory support, much more than the patients in COVID-19, which consisted of the highest mortality of COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and throat pain (21%) were also observed in patients with MERS.
In patients with SARS, it was demonstrated that fever (99% to 100%), dry cough (29% to 75%), dyspnoea (40% to 42%), diarrhoea (20% to 25%) and throat pain (13% to 25%) were the main symptoms, and ventilation support was needed for approximately 14% to 20% of patients.
By 14 February, the mortality rate of COVID-19 was 2%, when confirmed cases in the world reached 66,576.
Comparably, the mortality of SARS until November 2002 was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, based on a June 2012 demographic study, mortality was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases.
A more recent study reported that the baseline number R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was up to 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (IC), 5.71 to 7.23, while the SARS-CoV R0 ranged from 2 to 4, only.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MRS-CoV and SARS-CoV with respect to its symptoms, mortality and R0 is presented in Table 1.1.
The figures above suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher propagation capacity than MERCS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is less lethal than these two last.
Therefore, it is a much greater challenge to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV epidemic.
Symptoms appear in a group of people usually occur in the same family or in the same agglomeration or vehicle as a cruise ship.
Patients usually have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan or other affected areas, or contact with individuals or patients infected within two weeks of the onset of symptoms.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus for more than two weeks without showing symptoms, and the cured patients who have received high from the hospitals can counter the virus again, which generates an alarm to prolong the quarantine period.
Patients have a normal or reduced number of white blood cells in the peripheral blood (mainly lymphocytes) at the initial stage.
For example, lymphopenia with white blood cells count below 4 x 109/L including lymphocyte count below 1 x 109/L, and high levels of aspartate aminotransferase and viraemia were detected in 1,099 patients with COVID-19.
The levels of enzymes and myoglobins in the muscles and liver were increased in the blood of some patients, and C-reactive protein and red blood cell sedimentation were increased in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the D-Dimero-D level, a product of fibrin degradation present in the blood, was high, and lymphocyte count presented progressive reduction.
Anomalies in thorax radiography are present in most patients with COVID-19, and have bilateral irregular shadows or opacity in dark glass in the lungs.
Patients generally developed atypical pneumonia, acute lung damage and acute respiratory discomfort syndrome (SDRA).
When SDRA occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis seriously compromise the exchange of gases.
Dysfunction of Type I and Type II pneumatics decreases the surface surface level and increases the surface tension, thus reducing the capacity of the lungs to expand, and increasing the risk of pulmonary collapse.
Therefore, the most serious results of thorax radiography generally correspond to the most serious form of the disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated the decomposition of pneumatics, the formation of the hyalin membrane, the infiltration of interstitial lymphocytes and synthetic cells in the lungs of a patient who died of the disease, which is consistent with the pathology of viral infection and SDRA, and similar to the pathology of patients with SARS and MERS.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA through the polymerase chain reaction – reverse transcriptase (RT-PCR) was used as the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false negatives, which may accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for the diagnosis (which did not occur only from RT-PCR) in China on 13 February 2020.
A similar situation also occurred with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of the history of the disease, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological results is essential and essential to an effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, Feng Zhang described a SHERLOCK-based technique protocol to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic RNA fragments of SARS-CoV-2 in 20 x 10-18 mol/L to 200 x 10-18 mol/L (10 to 100 copies per microlitre of input) using a measuring rod in less than an hour, without the need for a complex instrumentation.
We hope that the new technique can dramatically increase sensitivity and convenience, if verified in clinical samples.
Due to the lack of experience with the new CoV, physicians may provide palliative treatment for patients with COVID-19, while trying a variety of therapies that were used or previously proposed for the treatment of other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERCS-CoV and other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapies include current and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma of cured patients, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
Up to the plasma of patients who recovered was suggested as treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are running against time to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 mainly attacks the lungs at the beginning and probably also attacks, to a lesser extent, other ECA-expressed organs2, such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.
However, respiratory dysfunction and organ failure are the main threats to patients and the main causes of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is essential to relieve symptoms and save lives, and includes general oxygenation therapy, high flow oxygenation, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need to receive extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified cardiopulmonary alternative technique used to treat severe heart failure or respiratory failure.
In addition, the maintenance of electrolyte balance, the prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, and the protection of the functions of vital organs are also essential for patients with SARS-CoV-2.
It is known that cytokine cascade results from an exacerbated reaction of the immune system in patients with SARS and MERS.
The cytokine cascade is a form of systemic inflammatory response, characterized by the release of a series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNA, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune system cells to release a large number of free radicals, which are the main cause of SDRA and multiple organ failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine shells, mainly in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, are being used to treat cytokine cascade.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokine cascade include the modulation of the immune response to T cells; the blocking of IFN-y, IL-1 and TNF; the inhibition of JAK, blinatumomab; cytokines 4 suppressor; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, such as immunosuppressants, were widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high-dose steroids were not beneficial for severe pulmonary injury in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
They may cause serious side effects, mainly avascular osteonecrosis, affecting dramatically the prognosis.
However, short periods of treatment with corticosteroids at low to moderate doses were recommended for careful use in patients with severe COVID-19.
At the time this article is written, no effective antiviral therapy was confirmed.
However, intravenous administration with reddesivir, a nucleotide analogue, was found to be effective in an American patient with COVID-19.
Reddesivir is a new antiviral drug developed by Gilead, originally intended for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Later, remdesivir also demonstrated a possible inhibition of other single-fat RNA viruses, including mers and SARS viruses.
Based on this, Gilead provided the compound for China to perform some tests in individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are being very expected.
In addition, baracitinib, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin were suggested as potential therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions may occur after combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other drugs used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma of cured patients and generation of antibodies
The blood collection of patients who have been treated with a contagious disease to treat other patients suffering from the same disease, or to protect healthy individuals from contracting the disease has a long history.
In fact, cured patients usually have a relatively high level of antibodies in the blood against the pathogen.
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (lg) produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign bodies, and they recognize unique molecules in the pathogens and neutralize them directly.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who were treated with COVID-19, and was injected into 10 patients in serious condition.
Its symptoms improved within 24 hours, with reduced inflammation and viral load, and improved oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and elucidation are necessary in order to propose the large-scale use of the method prior to the development of specific therapies.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some adverse reactions associated with plasma should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can exacerbate the immune response and cause cytokines release syndrome, which is potentially fatal.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the demand for plasma is large to treat patients in severe conditions.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies with sufficient speed to combat an epidemic of global proportion.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from treated patients and identify the genetic codes that encode effective antibodies or make a screening for effective antibodies against essential proteins of the virus.
Thus, we can rapidly increase the production of antibodies.
Traditional Chinese Medicine, MTC, has been used for thousands of years to treat a variety of diseases in China.
However, its effects depend heavily on a combination of multiple components in a formula that varies depending on the diagnosis of a disease based on MTC theories.
Most effective components remain unknown, or are vague, since it is difficult to extract and verify these components or their optimal combinations.
Currently, due to the lack of specific and effective therapies for COVID-19, MTC has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild or moderate symptoms, or for patients who recovered from severe stages of the disease.
For example, it was found that Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules are effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
The best treatment rates in patients with COVID-19 were observed in several provinces in China that used MTC in 87% of patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei Province, which used MTC in only about 30% of patients with COVID-19, obtained the lowest cure rate (13%).
However, this is a difficult comparison, since many impact factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of the disease, should be included in the evaluation.
On 18 February 2020, Boli Zhang and his colleagues published a comparative study between the exclusive treatment with Western medicine and the combined treatment of Western medicine with MTC.
It was discovered that the times necessary for the recovery of body temperature, for the disappearance of symptoms and hospitalization were significantly lower in the group treated by Western medicine and the MTC than in the group treated by Western medicine alone.
The worsening rate of symptoms (from mild to severe) was significantly lower for the group treated by Western medicine and MTC than for the group treated only by Western medicine (7.4% versus 46.2%), and mortality was lower in the group treated by Western medicine and MTC than in the group treated only by Western medicine (8.8% versus 39%).
However, the effectiveness and safety of the MTC are still waiting for more properly controlled tests on larger scale and in more centres.
It would also be useful to characterize the action mechanisms and explain the effective components of the MTC treatments or their combinations, if possible.
Patients confirmed with COVID-19 or suspected of disease generally feel a great fear of highly contagious disease and can be fatal, and people in quarantine also feel understanding, lonely and irritated.
In addition, symptoms of infection, such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as adverse effects of treatments, such as short-term insomnia, may increase anxiety and psychological suffering.
In the initial phase of the SARS epidemic, several psychiatric morbidities, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitement, symptoms of psychosis, delirium and even suicidal tendencies were reported.
The tracking of contacts and the mandatory quarantine, as part of the public health system's actions against the COVID-19 epidemic, can make people more anxious, and they can feel guilty about the effects of the infection, the quarantine, and the stigma imposed on their families and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to patients with COVID-19, to people with suspected disease and to people who have had contact with them, as well as to the general population, who are in need.
Psychological support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communication with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and treatment plans, and the use of professional devices and electronic applications to avoid direct contact between people.
Effective vaccines are essential to interrupt the transmission chain of animal reservoirs and people infected with susceptible hosts, and are generally complementary to antiviral treatment in the control of epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Initiatives were taken to develop S-based vaccines to generate powerful and durable neutralising antibodies and/or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Vaccines were evaluated in animal models for SARS.
However, the in vivo efficacy of these vaccine candidates in older individuals and models of lethal challenge and their protection against zoonotic virus infection still need to be determined before a clinical study is started.
This is probably due to the fact that SARS has disappeared for 17 years and no new cases have been reported since then.
On the other hand, sporadic cases and MERS focus continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to other regions due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies were developed for MERS using inactive viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, particles similar to viruses and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for non-immune individuals is an urgent and essential task for the control of the current epidemic.
However, it is a challenge to overcome the difficulty due to the long period (18 months, on average) necessary for the development of a vaccine and the variations in the dynamics of the CoVs.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has just begun to manifest its complete clinical evolution, reaching thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients recovered gradually without sequelae.
However, in the same way as SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, building a model of prognosis for the disease is essential for health agencies to prioritise their services, especially in areas with scarce resources.
Based on clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 (Table 33):
Age: age was the most important factor for SARS prognosis, which also applies to COVID-19.
COVID-19 affects mainly people between 30 and 65 years of age, with 47.7% of patients over 50 years of age, in a study of 8,866 cases, as described above.
Patients who needed intensive treatment were more likely to have underlying comorbidities and complications, and were significantly older than patients who did not need intensive treatment (with an average age of 66 years versus 51 years), suggesting that age is a prognostic factor for the health outcome of patients with COVID-19.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infected more men than women (0.31/100,000 men and 0.27/100,000 women), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: patients with COVID-19 who need intensive treatment are more likely to suffer acute heart injury or arrhythmia.
Cardiac episodes were the main cause of death in patients with SARS.
It was reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also join positive ECA2 colangiocytes, which may lead to hepatic dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.
It is important to note that the age and underlying diseases have strong correlation and may interfere with each other.
abnormal laboratory results: the level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and was proposed as a potential prognosis factor for the disease, response to therapy and final recovery.
The correlation of the CRP level with the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 was also proposed.
In addition, lactate hydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and elevated creatinine (CK) may also assist in predicting the result.
These enzymes are expressly present in several organs, mainly in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
Therefore, they are traditional markers for cardiac or hepatic dysfunction.
Main clinical symptoms: chest X-ray and temporal progression of clinical symptoms should be considered together with other issues to predict the outcomes/complications of COVID-19.
Use of steroids: as described above, steroids are usually used immunosuppressants as an add-on therapy for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Given that a high dose of corticosteroids was widely used in patients with severe SARS, many survivors suffered from avascular osteonecrosis, with permanent and low quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used at a low dose and for a short period in patients with COVID-19.
Psychological stress: as described above, during the epidemic of COVID-19, many patients suffer from high stress, as they go through long periods of quarantine and uncertainty, and witness the death of loved members of the family and other patients.
It is essential to provide psychological advice and lasting support to help these patients recover from stress and restore normal life.
According to demographic studies so far, COVID-19 seems to have different epidemiological characteristics of SARS.
In addition to replication in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can be replication efficiently in the upper respiratory tract and does not cause symptoms at the initial stage of infection (or cause only mild symptoms), similar to other coVs that cause common colds.
Therefore, patients infected in the initial phase or incubation period may produce a large amount of the virus during their daily activities, causing a great difficulty in controlling the epidemic.
However, it was considered that the transmission of SARS-CoV occurs when patients are seriously ill, with most of the transmissions not occurring in the initial phase.
Therefore, the current epidemic of COVID-19 is much more serious and difficult to control than the SARS epidemic.
Large efforts are currently being made in China, including the bordering of Wuhan and neighbouring cities, and the continued quarantine of almost the entire population, in the hope of interrupting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these actions have dramatically affected the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is decreasing, indicating the remission of the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that the epidemic ends by March, and the deceleration phase lasts between 3 and 4 months.
However, other specialists are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., believed that COVID-19, which appears to be substantially more infectious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., established a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 can infect two thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the throat and the mean cornet scratches of patients who recovered and received high from the hospital in the previous 2 weeks, indicating that the new virus identified may become a cyclical episode similar to the influenza.
However, promising indicators occurred in China based on the decline in the number of new cases, indicating that current strategies could be working.
Originally, Ebola was expected to cause up to one million cases, with half a million deaths.
However, with the quarantine and rigid isolation, the disease was kept under control, at last.
It is possible that SARS-CoV-2, in the same way as SARS-CoV, can become weaker as regards its infectivity and, at some point, become a less pathogenic virus co-existing with human beings.
A comparison of the epidemic of COVID-19 with that of SARS and MERS is below (Fig. (Fig.55)).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissionable by cough and spruce and possibly by direct contact with materials contaminated by the virus.
The virus was also found in faeces, which creates a new possibility: that of oral-feetal transmission.
A recent study in 138 cases reported that 41% of cases were possibly caused by nosocomial infections, including 17 patients with underlying diseases and 40 health professionals.
Therefore, greater caution should be taken to protect people, especially health professionals, social workers, family members, workmates and people with direct contact with patients or infected individuals.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is the use of facial masks; the use of surgical masks and N95 breathing masks (series n° 1860s) helps control the spread of the virus.
Surgical facial masks prevent fluid drops of a potentially infected individual from being transported in the air or being attached to the surfaces of the objects, where other people can be infected.
However, only the N95 masks (series n° 1860s) protect against the inhalation of viruses of size from 10 nm to 80 nm, with only 5% of the viruses being able to penetrate it completely; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size, and the two have approximately 85 nm.
Since particles can penetrate up to five surgical masks together, health professionals in direct contact with patients should use the N95 masks (series No. 1860s), but not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health professionals should use insulation clothing to further reduce contact with the virus.
The viruses also infect an individual through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor was infected by SARS-CoV-2, although he was using a mask N95; the virus could have entered his body through his inflamed eyes.
Therefore, health professionals should also use transparent facial protections or protective glasses when treating patients.
For the general public in affected or potentially affected areas, it is highly recommended that everyone wash hands with disinfectant soap more often than usual, try to stay at home in isolation and limit contact with potentially infected people.
A meter is considered an appropriate distance to stay away from a patient.
These actions are effective methods to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as a new human virus, its high homology to SARS-CoV, as reported on 7 January 2020, should have caused a major warning to China, based on its recent history with the SARS epidemic in 2003.
However, only on 19 January 2020 the director of the Wuhan Disease Control Centre calmed the citizens, saying that the new virus has a low rate of infection and limited reproductiveity among human beings, and that it was not difficult to prevent and contain the disease.
This message left the most relaxed people, especially when the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the critical period for keeping the disease in Wuhan on a minimum scale was lost.
Disease control agencies in China can take advantage of this hard lesson and make crucial improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should: (1) be more careful when making public statements, since everything they say is absorbed by citizens and can influence their attitudes and decisions; (2) be more sensitive and responsive to unusual information from hospitals rather than waiting for formal communications from doctors and authorities; (3) be more restrictive to contain a potential epidemic in their initial stage, rather than trying to comfort the public; and (4) issue more often targeted and effective simulations to raise public awareness of epidemic diseases and test and improve the response system of society periodically.
The COVID-19 epidemic caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus started at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, she spread across China and almost 50 other countries around the world at the time of writing this text.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV, and the symptoms are also similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the epidemic of COVID-19 generated a feeling of return from SARS.
However, there are significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential for the retention of the epidemic and the treatment of patients.
COVID-19 affects the elderly more than the young, and more men than women, and the severity and rate of mortality are also greater in the elderly than in the young.
SARS has greater mortality than COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
Patients with COVID-19 transmit the virus when they do not have symptoms, while patients with SARS generally transmit it when they are seriously ill, which makes it more difficult to contain the spread of COVID-19 than of SARS.
This explains, in part, because SARS-CoV-2 spreads much faster and affects more regions than SARS-CoV.
Regular RNA testing for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some patients with COVID-19.
On the other hand, healed patients can receive a positive test for the virus again.
These results dramatically increase the risk of virus spread.
Given the rapid progress in the research on COVID-19, several crucial issues still need to be resolved, as follows:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although a 96% genetic homologist has been found between SARS-CoV-2 and two CoVs of bites similar to SARS, we still cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 originated in bites.
What animal was the intermediate species that transmitted the virus from the original host, from the morse, say, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to questions Nos 1 and 2, we cannot cut transmission efficiently, and the epidemic may have a recurrence at any time.
Although molecular modelling and biochemical tests have shown that SARS-CoV-2 joins ECA2, how exactly does the virus enter the respiratory tract cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Is the virus also bound to ECA2-expressed cells in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot get a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How is the virus developing genetically during the transmission of human beings?
Will it become a global pandemic, will it disappear like SARS or will it have seasonal recurrence, like flu?
It is essential, but it may take some time to search for answers to the above questions and to so many others.
However, no matter what effort is needed, we have no choice but not to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to our normal lives.
Zoonotic origins of human coronation
The mutation and adaptation stimulated the co-evolution of the coronavirus (CoVs) and its hosts, including human beings, for thousands of years.
Before 2003, it was known that two human CoVs (HCoVs) caused a mild disease, such as a common cold.
The epidemics of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) changed what was thought about the CoVs and revealed how much an HCV infection can be lethal and devastating.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 put the CoVS again in focus and surprised everyone with its high transmissionability and reduced pathogenicity compared to its SARS-CoV brother.
HCoV infection is zoonotic, and understanding the zoonotic origins of HCOVs is enormously useful.
Most of the HCVs originated from bites, in which they are non-pathogenic.
The intermediate reservation hosts of some HCVs are also known.
The identification of animal hosts has direct implications for the prevention of diseases in human beings.
The investigation of coV host interactions in animals can also provide important information on the pathogenesis of coV in human beings.
In this study, we present a general view of the existing information about the seven HCVs, with a focus on the history of their discovery, as well as their zoonotic origins and interspecies transmission.
An important analysis is that we make comparison and contrast between different HCVs from a perspective of the evolution of the virus and the recombination of the genome.
The current epidemic of disease by CoV 2019 (COVID-19) is discussed in this context.
Furthermore, the requirements for effective transition between hosts and the implications of the evolution of the virus in the severity of the disease are also highlighted.
Coronavirus (CoVs) belongs to the Coronaviridae family, which includes a group of encapsulated viruses, positive polarity and simple fit RNA.
These viruses that present the largest genome, between 26 and 32 kilobases, between RNA viruses were called "CoVs" because of their corona morphology when observed in electronic microscope.
As for the structure, CoVs have non- segmented genomes that share a similar organization.
Approximately two thirds of the genome contain two open-ended reading structures (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into polyproteins to replicate pp1a and pp1ab.
Polyproteins are transformed again and generate 16 non-structural proteins, named nsp1 to nsp16.
The remaining portion of the genome contains ORFs for structural proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
Some specific lineage accessories are also encoded by different CoVs lines.
Based on the difference in protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four genres (alphaCoV, betaCoV, gammaCoV and deltaCoV), including the betaCoV genre containing most HCVs and is subdivided into four lines (A, B, C and D).
Phylogenetic evidence has shown that bites and rodents serve as a genetic source for most alphaCoVs and betaCoVs, while birds are the main reservoir of gammaCoVs and deltaCoVs.
For thousands of years, CoVs have constantly crossed the barriers of species, and some have become relevant human pathogens.
Up to now, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) are known.
Among them, HCV-229E and HCV-NL63 are alphaCoVs.
The other five betaCoVs include HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1 and HCV-NL63 viruses usually cause mild symptoms such as common cold and/or diarrhoea.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and newly identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic and cause severe respiratory tract infection in a relatively higher number of patients, with a high chance of developing acute respiratory discomfort syndrome (SDRA) and extrapulmonary manifestations.
The first strain of HCV-229E, B814, was isolated from the corset of patients with common cold in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been accumulated through extensive studies on HCV-229E and HCV-OC43, both of which cause autolimiting symptoms.
In fact, the concept that HCV infection is generally harmless was widely accepted until the SARS epidemic.
The SARS epidemic that occurred in 2003 is one of the most devastating of the present and infected more than 8,000 people, with a gross mortality rate related to confirmed cases of approximately 10%.
Ten years later, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) epidemic resulted in a persistent epidemic in the Arab Peninsula, with sporadic spread to the rest of the world.
The new HCV 2019 (2019-nCoV), which was subsequently renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the agent responsible for the current epidemic of the 2019 coronary disease (COVID-19), which took more than 3,120 lives and infected more than 91,000 people until 3 March 2020.
The alarm is sounding, and the world needs to prepare for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic that is coming.
All seven HCVs are of zoonotic origin in slaughterhouses, mice or domestic animals.
Multiple lines of evidence corroborate with the evolutionary origin of all HCVs from the bites, where viruses are well adapted and not pathogenic, but demonstrate great genetic diversity.
The epidemic of COVID-19 presents huge medical, scientific, social and moral challenges to China and the rest of the world.
The tracing of the zoonotic origins of HCVs provides a structure to understand the natural history, the driving force and the restrictive factors of the migration of the virus to other species.
This can also guide and facilitate the search for spare, intermediate and amplifier hosts of SARS-CoV-2, with important implications for the future prevention of viral migration between species.
In this article, we present a general view of zoonotic origins, interspecies transmission and HCV pathogenesis.
In particular, we highlight and discuss the common theme that HCV parental viruses are generally non-pathogenic in their natural reservoir hosts, but they become pathogenic after the interspecies transmission to a new host.
We also review the trend of HCV evolution, in which the increase in transmissibility is usually accompanied by a decrease in pathogenicity.
The outcome of the current SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is also discussed in this context.
The CoVs of animals have been known since the end of the 1930s.
Prior to the first isolation of HCV-229E strain B814 from the common cold corset of patients, different CoVs had been isolated in several infected animals, including Peru, Camundong, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
In recent decades, seven HCVs have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of HCV discovery in chronological order (Table 1) would be informative and instructive.
The first HPOV-229E strain was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966, and was subsequently adapted to growth in pulmonary cell lines WI-38.
Patients infected with HCV-229E had common cold symptoms, including headache, hives, nausea and throat, with fever and cough present in 10% to 20% of the cases.
Subsequently, in 1967, the HCV-OC43 was isolated from the culture of organs and subsequent serial passage in the brains of mice during lactation.
The clinical characteristics of HCV-OC43 infection appear to be similar to those caused by HCV-229E, which are symptomatically indistinguishable from infection by other respiratory tract pathogens such as influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses.
HCV-229E and HCV-OC43 are distributed globally, and tend to be transmitted predominantly during the winter season in temperamental climates.
Generally, the incubation period of these two viruses is less than one week, followed by the disease for approximately 2 weeks.
According to a study with human volunteers, healthy individuals infected by HCV-229E developed a common cold brand.
Only some immunocompromised patients showed a serious infection of the lower respiratory tract.
SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia", was the first documented pandemic caused by HCV in the history of the human being, and the etiological agent is SARS-CoV, the third discovered HCV.
The first case of SARS dates back to 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 reported cases of 774 deaths, spread by several countries and continents.
With the exception of "superconductors", it was estimated that each contaminated person can contaminate about two others, with an incubation period of 4-7 days, and with the appearance of peak viral load on the tenth day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially have myalgia, headache, fever, malaster and calafria, followed by subsequent symptoms of dyspnoea, cough and respiratory discomfort.
Lymopenia, hepatic dysfunction and high creatinine are the common abnormalities of SARS in laboratory tests.
Dyspnoea alveolar, epithelial cell proliferation and increased number of macrophages are also observed in patients with SARS.
Approximately 20% to 30% of patients need intensive treatment and mechanical ventilation at some point.
In addition to lower respiratory treatment, several organs, including gastrointestinal treatment, liver and kidneys, may also be affected in these severe cases, usually with the occurrence of a cytokine cascade, which can be lethal, especially in immunocompromised patients.
The virus was first isolated in a lung biopsy of a relative of a zero patient traveling from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, enormous efforts have been devoted to research on HCV.
The HCV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
It was initially discovered that the virus was prevalent in small children, elderly and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
The symptoms of corsis, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis are common in the disease caused by HCV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus of an 8-month-old baby with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it has been identified in the Netherlands, it is scattered throughout the world.
It was estimated that HCV-NL63 corresponds to approximately 4.7% of the common respiratory diseases, and its peak incidence occurs in winter, spring and early summer.
The HCV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as crustaceans.
In the same year, the HCV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to pneumonia and acquired Community-style bronchiolite, it was reported that HCV-HKU1 was associated with acute asthma exacerbation.
Like HCV-NL63, HCV-229E and HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1 was found worldwide, causing mild respiratory diseases.
All these four HCVs acquired in a Community way have been well adapted to human beings and are usually less likely to undergo mutation and cause highly pathogenic diseases, although accidents have occurred for unknown reasons in the rare case of a more virulent HCV-NL63 subtype, which has recently been reported as a cause of serious respiratory infection in China.
In general, when these HCVs acquire the ability to be transmitted efficiently and to remain continuously in human beings, they also become less virulent and less pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lung of a 60-year-old patient who developed acute pneumonia and renal failure in Saudi Arabia.
While most cases confirmed by laboratory originate in the Middle East, cases with occasional secondary spread to close contacts have been reported in several European countries and Tunisia.
Another secondary epidemic occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to those of SARS, characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also develop acute renal failure, which is therefore very special for MERS, among the diseases caused by HCV.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
By 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 confirmed cases by laboratory were reported with a high mortality rate related to confirmed cases of 34.4%, which made the MERS-CoV one of the most devastating viruses of human knowledge.
From half to the end of December 2019, groups of patients with pneumonia, which were retrospectively known to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, were detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization declared the continuing epidemic of infection of lower respiratory tract caused by SARS-CoV-2 a public health emergency of international importance and also appointed the COVID-19 disease.
Until March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases were confirmed in the world, with a gross mortality rate related to confirmed cases of 3.4%.
It is noted that the lethality related to confirmed cases in Hubei, China, is 4.2%, while the lethality outside this city is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infection, like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, with presence of fever, cough and dyspnea.
Some patients also have diarrhoea.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can rapidly develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to the high homology of 82% in the nucleotide sequence, they are grouped into different branches in the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 appears to be less pathogenic, but is more transmitable compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 were reported, and they can contribute to the rapid spread of the virus in the world.
The comparison and contrast of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCVs reveal similarities and differences of great relevance.
Firstly, the incubation period and the duration of the evolution of HCV disease are very similar.
In this sense, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCVs.
Secondly, the severity of the symptoms of COVID-19 is between the severity of SARS-CoV and the severity of the four HCVs acquired in a Community manner (HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection has characteristics that are more observed during infection with HCVs acquired in a Community way, including the presence of non-specific, brandy or no symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subset of serious cases of COVID-19 can also be observed, as in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Thirdly, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting patterns, both in the HCVs purchased in a Community way and in the SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as the HCV acquired in the community.
On the other hand, it should be confirmed whether the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after passing to human beings, as in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, in the same way as the other HCVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in faeces.
It still needs to be clarified in future studies if the gold-fetal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role, as in the case of SARS-CoV, at least in some circumstances.
It is also of great interest to find out whether SARS-CoV-2 can show seasonality, as in the case of HCVs acquired in a Community way.
In any event, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustainable propagation after its transition to human beings, will influence the outcome of the current epidemic of COVID-19.
All HCVs acquired by the Community that cause mild symptoms have been well adapted to human beings.
From another perspective, it can also be true that human beings have adapted well to these four HCVs.
In other words, the two could be the survivors of old HCV pandemics.
The HCVs that cause serious diseases in human beings and people who develop serious HCV diseases have been eliminated.
In order for this to happen, the HCVs need to replicate themselves in human beings to a sufficient extent in order to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that neutralise the restriction factors.
In this sense, the greater the duration of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, the more people will be infected, and the greater the chance that the virus will adapt to human beings.
If adaptation is appropriate, its transmission to human beings would be difficult to control with quarantine or other infection control measures.
A number of years ago, the four CoVs acquired in a Community way flow into human populations, causing a common cold in immunocompetent individuals.
These viruses don't need an animal reservoir.
On the contrary, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, highly pathogenic, did not adapt well to human beings, and their transmission between human beings cannot be sustained.
They need to stay and spread in their zootic reservoirs and take advantage of the chance to migrate to susceptible human targets, possibly through one or more intermediate hosts and amplifiers.
SARS-CoV-2 has characteristics similar to SARS-CoV, MERCS-CoV and the four HCVs acquired in a Community way.
It is highly communicable, in the same way as the HCVs acquired in a Community way, at least until now.
However, it is more pathogenic than HCV acquired in a Community and less pathogenic manner than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
It still needs to be discovered if it will fully adapt to human beings and circulate between us without a reserve or intermediate pet host.
Before discussing the animal origins of the HCVs, it would be useful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the evolutionary, natural, reservoirs, intermediates and amplifiers of the HCVs.
An animal serves as the evolutionary host of an HCV if it hides an ancestral of direct relationship, sharing high homology at the level of the nucleotide sequence.
The ancestral virus is generally well adapted and not pathogenic in this host.
Similarly, a reserve host covers the HCV in a continuous and lasting manner.
In both cases, the hosts are naturally infected and are the natural hosts of the HCV or its parental virus.
On the other hand, if the HCV is newly introduced to an intermediate host shortly before or near its introduction to human beings, it does not adapt appropriately to the new host, and is usually pathogenic.
This intermediate host can serve as the zoonotic source of human infection and perform the function of an amplifier host, allowing the virus to replicate in a transient way and then transmit it to humans and increase the scale of human infection.
An HCV may have the infection interrupted if it is unable to sustain its transmission to the intermediate host.
On the other hand, the HCVs can also adapt to the intermediate host and establish long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes the natural reserve host.
Epidemiological data revealed that the SARS zero patient had a history of contact with hunting animals.
Subsequent studies of seroprevalence indicated that animal traders had a higher prevalence of IgG antiSARS-CoV compared to that of the general population.
Masked palm civets (Paguma larvata) and a can-guaxinin in live animal markets were initially identified as vectors similar to SARS-CoV.
The identification was indirectly corroborated by the fact that no other SARS was notified after the slaughter of all civilians on the market.
However, it was reported that wild or unexposed wild palm civets were highly negative for SARS-CoV, suggesting that masked palm civets could only be the amplifying intermediate host, but not the natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
It is noted that 80% of the different animals on the markets in Guangzhou have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies; the possibility that several species of small mammals can serve as intermediate hosts amplifiers of SARS-CoV cannot be excluded.
All these animals seem to be final hosts of SARS-CoV.
The subsequent search by the natural animal host of SARS-CoV revealed a close-relationship coV, named CoV HKU3 of the SARS related to the SARS (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which exists in the Chinese ferret.
These bites are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and for the genomic sequence of SARSR-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
This and other bite CoVs share 88% to 92% homology with SARS-CoV in the nucleotide sequence.
These studies formed the basis for the new concept that mosquitoes are the host of emerging human pathogens.
Several CoVs similar to SARS (SL-CoVs) were also identified in bites, but no CoV, except designated WIV1, can be isolated as live virus.
It is known that the human angiotensin 2 (ECA2) converter enzyme is the SARS-CoV receptor.
It was demonstrated that WIV1 derived from faecal samples of bites uses ECA2 from bites, civets and human beings as a receptor for entry into cells.
It is intriguing that the sister of patients convalescent from SARS was able to neutralize WIV1.
Until now, WIV1 represents the ancestral with closer relationship to SARS-CoV in bites, sharing 95% of homology in the nucleotide sequence.
Despite the high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the direct parental virus of SARS-CoV, and that the bites are not the immediate reserve hosts of SARS-CoV.
The phylogenetic analysis groupes the MERS-CoV in the same group as the CoV-HKU4 of pieces and the CoV-HKU5 of pieces.
The CoV-HKU4 of bites and the MERS-CoV use the same host receptor, dipeptide-peptidase 4 (DPP4) for the entry of the virus.
Sequences of polymerase of RNA dependent RNA of MERS-CoV are philogenetically closer to beta-coVs counterparts identified in Europe and Africa.
So far, no live MERS-CoV has been found in wild pieces.
The MERS-CoV and its closest relative, the CoV-HKU25 of the bites, share only 87% of homology in the nucleotide sequence.
Therefore, the morgues may not be the immediate reserve host of the MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that dromedaries are seropositive for MERS-CoV-specific neutralization antibodies, in the same way as Middle East camels in several African countries.
The live Mers-CoV, identical to the virus found in human beings, was isolated from nasal snorkeling, increased the evidence that the camels serve as the legitimate reserve host of the Mers-CoV.
It is also worth noting that symptoms usually mild, but with massive transmission of the virus, were observed in experimentally infected camels with MERS-CoV.
It is notable that infected camels transmit the viruses not only through the respiratory route, but also through the fecal-ornal route, which is also the main route of transmission of viruses into bites.
However, there are still no answers, as many confirmed cases of MERS do not have a history of contact with camels prior to the onset of the symptoms, which may be attributed plausiblely to the transmission between persons or transmission routes involving unidentified animal species covered by MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% of nucleotide homologies with a CoV RatG13 bite, isolated from Rhinolophus affinis bites.
As with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the difference in the sequence between SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 is very large to assign a parental relationship.
In other words, bites may not be the immediate reserve hosts of SARS-CoV-2 unless CoVs almost identical bites are discovered in the future.
It is assumed that hosts of intermediate animals of SARS-CoV-2 should be listed among wild species sold and slaughtered in the Huaan Sea Fruits Market, to which many of the initial cases of COVID-19 have been associated, indicating a probable event of transmission of animals to human beings.
Several recent studies based on metagenological sequencing suggested that a group of small endangered mammals known as pangolins (Javanica Manis) could also shelter betaCoVs ancestral related to SARS-CoV-2.
These new pangolim CoV genomes share 85% to 92% of homology in the nucleotide sequence with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are also, in the same way, directly related to RatG13, with approximately 90% of identity at the level of nucleotide sequence.
They are grouped into virus sub-links similar to SARS-CoV-2 in the phylogenetic tree, one of which shares a receptor-linked domain (DLR) with SARS-CoV-2, with 97.4% identity in the amino acid sequence.
In a huge contrast, SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 DLRs are more divergent, although they present a high degree of sequential homology throughout the genome.
A recent study on patients with pangolins also reported the detection of viral sequences of lung samples, which are closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopted different methods of configuration and manual healing to generate a partial genetic sequence, corresponding to about 86.3% of the viral genome in the total size.
We cannot rule out the possibility that pangolimus is one of the intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, currently there is no evidence to confirm the direct origin of the pangolim SARS-CoV-2 due to the differences in the sequence between the SARS-CoV-2 and betaCoVs related to the SarS-CoV-2 of the pangolins.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 is even lower than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and betaCoVs related to SARS-CoV-2 of pangolins.
The evolutionary route of SARS-CoV-2 in bites, pangolins and other mammals still needs to be clarified.
While the highest sequential homology was found in the DLRs between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolim, betaCoVs related to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the highest broad genetic sequential homology.
It is highly speculative that the high degree of similarity between betaCoVs DLRs of pangolins related to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 is the convergence-mediated evolution of selectivity.
A different argument is in favour of the recombination between the betaCoV of pangolins related to SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 in the third wild animal species.
As a driving force in evolution, the recombination is quite present in betaCoVs.
The immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 remains under investigation.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCVs, the zoonotic origin of HCV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCV-NL63 and HCV-HKU1 viruses has also been studied.
Phylogenetic evidence indicated that both HCV-NL63 and HCV-229E could have originated from bites CoVs, while parental viruses of HCV-OC43 and HCV-HKU1 were discovered in rodents.
It was reported that a CoV of bites called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) detected in the North American tricolor torpedoes had a direct relationship with HCV-NL63.
On the other hand, the HCV-229E was genetically related to another Morcego CoV, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, and there is also a suspicion that the chameleons are their intermediate hosts.
For greater clarity, the current knowledge of known HCoVs animal origins is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
The phylogenetic analysis provided evidence for interspecies transmission events of the HCVs throughout history.
When HCV-OC43 crossed the species and infected human beings from domestic animals around 1890, a respiratory infection pandemic was recorded.
The interactive transmission history of the HCV-229E is less clear.
AlphaCoVs of bites closely related to HCV-229E were discovered.
Among them, there's an alphaCov of alpacas.
Several lines of evidence corroborate the direct transmission of the mosquito virus to human beings.
First, human beings, but not alpacas, may have contact with the bites in a shared ecological niche.
On the contrary, human beings have direct contact with the alpacas.
Second, HCV-229E-related morgue-related alphaCoVs are diverse and non-pathogenic in morgues, while alpaca-related alphaCoVs caused an epidemic of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, the alphaCoV of alpacas was not found in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility of alpacas being acquired from human beings from the HCV-229E-related alphaCOV cannot be excluded.
In fact, the mosquitoes are the direct source of pathogenic viruses for human beings, including rave virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it is not surprising that bites transmit HCV-229E directly to human beings.
As an alternative, while alphaCoVs serve as a genetic pool of HCV-229E, alpacas and dromedaries can serve as intermediate hosts that transmit the viruses to human beings, just as in the case of MERS-CoV.
The MERS-CoV serves as an excellent example of interspecies transmission of bats to dromedaries and dromedaries to human beings.
The evolutionary origin of the MERS-CoV from the bites is known in its initial identification and was corroborated by subsequent results.
It is obvious that the bites provide a rich pool of viral species for the exchange of genetic fragments and interspecies transmission.
Longevity, high-density colonies, close social interaction and high flight capacity are all favourable conditions for the bites to be the ideal "viral propagator".
On the other hand, the introduction of MERS-CoV in the dromedaries dates back to decades.
He is well adapted to these camels, and he migrated from an intermediate host to a natural and stable reserve host.
MERS-CoV is the cause of a very mild disease and supports a relatively low rate of mutation in these animals.
Its sporadic transmission to human beings is an accident, and human beings remain terminal hosts of the MERS-CoV, as its transmission cannot be sustained.
In contrast to the role of the camels in the transmission of the MERS-CoV, the role of the pangolins, if any, in the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2, is different.
Specifically, pangoline betaCoVs are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
They may be a terminal host for betaCoVs related to SARS-CoV-2, similar to civilians, in the case of SARS-CoV.
Several possibilities for the interspective transmission of SARS-CoV-2 animals for human beings need to be confirmed or discarded in future studies.
First, the bites could be the reservoir host of a SARS-CoV-2-related virus, almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Human beings could share the ecological niche with the bites through the abatement or coal mines.
Secondly, the pangolins could be one of the amplifier intermediate hosts, in which a SARS-CoV-2-related virus had been newly infused.
Human beings contract the virus through slaughter and consumption of hunting meat.
Many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
A research on antibodies produced by domestic and wild animals is necessary.
Thirdly, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could have occurred in a third species that has had contact with both bites and pangolins.
The search for the animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 is still active.
In addition to the different types of animal hosts, three main factors in the virus are important in facilitating CoVs to cross the barriers to species.
First, its relatively high rate of mutation in RNA replication.
Compared to other simple fita RNA viruses, the estimated exchange rates of CoVs can be considered "moderate" to "high" with an average replacement rate of approximately 10-4 substitutions per year, on a local basis, depending on the phase of adaptation of CoV to new hosts.
The CoVs have exorribonuclease with a review mechanism, whose exclusion results in excessive mutation and attenuation, or even inviability.
It is interesting that the nucleotide analogue reddesivir suppresses the replication of the CoV by inhibiting this exorribonuclease and RNA-dependent polymerase.
Reddesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents tested in clinical trials.
However, CoVs' mutation rates are almost a million times higher than those of their hosts.
In addition, the rate of mutation is generally high when CoVs are not well adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV, which has a high rate of mutation, the exchange rate of SARS-CoV-2 is apparently low, suggesting its highest level of adaptation to human beings.
Presumably, he has already adapted himself to another host who keeps in touch with human beings.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to the MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to the drummers.
In theory, it is unlikely that a genetic change would quickly render vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective.
Secondly, the large genome of RNA in CoVs exercises an extra plasticity in changing the genome for mutations and recombinations, thus increasing the probability of interspecies co-evolution, which is beneficial for the emergence of new CoVs when conditions become appropriate.
This is corroborated by the abundance of unique reading frames and encoded protein functions in relation to the last three inches of the extremities of the genome.
Third, CoVs randomly and frequently exchange models during RNA replicating through a single "copy selection" mechanism.
In a host serving as a mixing container, the exchange of tapes occurs frequently during the transcription of the CoV RNA.
Highly homologous and subgenomic long RNAs can be recombined to generate new CoVs.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination was found in both HCV-HKU1 and HCV-OC43 as well as in animal coVs, as well as the SL-CoV of the bites and batCoV-HKU9.
Host virus interaction in relation to transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, the viral interaction with the host receptor is another key factor that influences interspecies transmission.
Here, the recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example, which also showed evidence of positive selection during interspecies transmission events.
Based on the comparative analysis of SARS-CoVs isolates of human beings and civilians, it is believed that SARS-CoV passes through a rapid adaptation in different hosts, mainly with mutations in the DLR of protein S.
In general, the DLR in the S protein of a CoV interacts with the cellular receptor and is extensively selected by the host antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, DLR is in the amino acids 318 to 510 in the S1 fragment, which is linked to human ECA2, as well as its receptors for viral entry.
SARS-CoV DLR is capable of recognising ECA2 receptors from several animals, including bats, civets, mice and guajinins, allowing interspecies transmission of the virus.
In fact, it was observed that only six amino acid residues were different from human viral isolates and civets in the DLR, and four of them are located in the reason of connection to the receptor for interaction with the ECA2 receptor.
Citizen SARS-CoV has K479N and S487T mutations in its DLR, which could increase the affinity of the protein spike interaction with the human ECA2 receptor.
In other words, these two substitutions of amino acids could be critical for viral adaptation in humans.
It is worth noting that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cell receptor with SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 protein unit implies that the affinity of its S protein to human ECA2 could have been altered.
In fact, a study with electronic cryomicroscope indicates an affinity of 10 to 20 times that of this relationship than between human ECA2 and SARS-CoV protein S.
It will also be useful to determine whether any other rectifier may be necessary for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
It is intriguing that HCV-NL63 is also linked to ECA2, but with a different part of protein S.
There are several other HCV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCV-229E and 9-O-acetylated silica for HCV-OC43.
They could also respond to the effective adaptation of these CoVs to human beings after the interspective transmission of their animal hosts.
In addition to cellular receptors, the result of the interspecies transmission of HCVs is also governed by other factors of restriction and dependence with the host.
The differentiation of these host proteins between human beings and the natural reserve hosts of HCVs such as bats, rudders and rodents could constitute a barrier to interspecies transmission.
The HCoVs need to absorb the dependency factors with the host and to subvert the host restriction factors for effective interspecies transmission.
In this sense, molecular determinants in this important area of host virus interaction still need to be identified and characterized.
A non-volatile selection with a range of genome levels of host dependence and restriction factors for SARS-CoV-2 using modern CRISPR technology can produce good results.
New HPoVs leak: back to zero
The diversity of the CoVs of bites provides broad possibilities for the emergence of new HCVs.
In this sense, the CoVs of bites serve as a genetic pool of the HCVs.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also stimulate the evolution of HCV and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein coding genes has the potential to dramatically modify viral phenotypes.
Among SARS-CoV accessory proteins, it is believed that ORF8 is important in its adaptation to human beings, since the SARS-CoV-related bite viruses have been isolated, but they have been found to encode different ORF8 proteins.
A characteristic of the exclusion of nucleotide 29 from SARS-CoVs was discovered in isolated strains at the beginning of the human epidemic.
The exclusion divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and it is believed that it is an adaptive mutation that promotes host alternating.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a possible recombination history with alphaCoVs and gammaCoVs, where a large number of smaller recombinant regions were identified in RNA-dependent polymerase.
Recombination sites were also identified in nsp9, mostly nsp10 and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, it was demonstrated that the epidemiological MERS-CoV passed through recombination events between different lines, which occurred in dromedaries in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events were also observed in other HCVs, where HCVs are recombined with other animal coVs in their non-structural genes.
It should also be warned that artificial selection can contribute to unwanted changes in viral genomes, which are likely to result from the relief of the selected virus pressure, such as the host’s immune system pressure.
An example of these effects is the loss of a long ORF4 in the HCV-229E prototype strain due to the exclusion of two nucleotides.
While intact ORF4 can be observed in HCV-229E-related mosquitoes and camels, alpaca alfaCoV has a simple insertion of nucleotide, resulting in a change in the picture.
Finally, but no less important, the evolution of new HCVs is also driven by the selection pressure in its reserve hosts.
The absence of symptoms or only mild symptoms were detected in bites when they were infected with CoVs, indicating the mutual adaptation between CoVs and bites.
It is likely that the bites are well adapted to the anatomical and physiological CoVs.
For example, defects in activation of the pro-inflammatory response in the bites effectively reduce the pathology triggered by the CoVs.
In addition, the activity of natural extermination cells in the morgues is removed due to the adaptation of the natural extermination receptor inhibitor NKG2/CD94 and the low degree of expression of Class I molecules of the main histocompatibility complex.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen species (ERO) generated from the high metabolic activity of the bites can eliminate the replication of the CoV as well as affect the review by exorribonuclease, thus providing selective pressure for the generation of highly pathogenic virus strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic CoV strains could also evolve by recombination, leading to the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics to adapt the host.
Therefore, it is not the case that three new HCVs have emerged in the last two decades.
CoVs are non-pathogenic, or cause, as much as possible, mild symptoms in their reservoir hosts, such as bites and camels.
They replicate immensely without causing a high immune response from the host.
This document contains explanations of the detection of asymptomatic carriers and the cause of serious cases of human infection.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to the hyperactivation of the immune response and of the citidine cascade, in which the greater the immune response, the more severe the damage to the lungs.
On the other hand, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response was switched off from the CoV replica.
The same immune response elimination strategy could have beneficial effects on anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
Interferon response is specifically strong in bites.
Therefore, the administration of type I interferon in the initial phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of the inflammatory NLRP3 in the bites is defective.
Following this reasoning, inhibition of the inflammatory NLRP3 with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the same principles by which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV emerged.
While betaCoV was found to share 95% of nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV, there is a coV of bites that shares 96% of nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although it has been found that civilians and other animals on the markets are carrying the same viruses to SARS-CoV, the mid-term hosts for SARS-CoV-2 have not been identified.
BetaCoVs of pangolins, with high homology with SARS-CoV-2, were discovered, indicating that pangolins can serve as one of the intermediate hosts, or betaCoVs of pangolins can contribute with genetic fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although the questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is produced by an accidental or intentional man.
The CoVs returned to global attention due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
The study of CoVs in molluscs and other animals has dramatically changed our perception of the importance of the zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs of the HCVs in the transmission of human beings.
Wide dissemination evidence shows that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originate in the morgue and are transmitted to people through intermediate hosts.
Since SARS-CoV infection originated from contact between human beings and civilians on the markets, the closure of wet markets and the slaughter of civilians on these markets could have put an end to the SARS epidemic.
Following the same reasoning, pangolins should be removed from wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission, in view of the discovery of multiple betaCoVs of pangolins closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, it should still be clarified in future studies if SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to human beings through pangolins and other mammals, and how this is transmitted.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV exists in dromedaries for a long time.
These camels serve as an important means of transport, and are an essential source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the local community.
They are widely distributed in the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is impossible to sacrifice all camels for the control of MERS, as was done in the markets of wild animals in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to stop the recurrent epidemics of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV for camels, in combination with other control measures for infection.
Since we have not been able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes may arise and cause epidemics.
A variety of zoonotic CoVs circulate in nature.
Specifically, the CoVs of bites with zoonotic potential are very different.
There are several possibilities that these zoonotic CoVs evolve and recombinate, resulting in the emergence of new CoVs that are more transmitable and/or lethal to human beings in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some places in China must be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the crisis of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better response and preparation plan should be adopted.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a long time.
They stay in their natural reservoirs until there is a chance of migration to another species.
Although mosquitoes have many features that favor the spread of the virus, the chance that people are in contact with mosquitoes and other wild species can be minimized if people are taught to stay away from them.
Continuous surveillance in mammals is necessary for a better understanding of the ecology of the CoVs and their natural hosts, which will prove useful in preventing the transmission of animals to human beings and future epidemics.
To conclude, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonoses is for people to stay away from the ecological niches of the natural reservoirs of zoonotic viruses.
Several parts of the puzzle of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 are still missing.
First, if the bats transmit an ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus to the pangolins, it is important to find out under which circumstances the bats and pangolins could share the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if the bites play a more direct role in the transmission to human beings, it should be determined how people come into contact with the bites.
Thirdly, if a third mammal has the role of the true intermediate host, it must be clarified how he interacts with the different species, including human beings, morgues and pangolins.
Finally, since several mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and experimental infection should be performed.
If it is a bite, pangolimus or other mammal, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its parental viruses that are almost identical are identified in their natural hosts in the future.
Continued research in this area will highlight the evolving route of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in human beings.
It is necessary to update the criteria for diagnosis of "suspect case" and "confirmed case" of COVID-19
On 6 February 2020, our team published a quick guidance guide for the diagnosis and treatment of the new coronavirus infection of 2019 (2019-nCoV). This guide conveys our experience and is a good reference to combat this global pandemic.
However, the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) is new. Our understanding and knowledge gradually increase based on the constant findings of research and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
In this letter, we responded to a comment on our guide and provided the latest diagnostic criteria of "suspect case" and "confirmed case" according to the latest diagnostic and treatment guidelines of COVID-19 (seventh version) published by the National Committee for Health of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new 2019 crown virus (2019-nCoV) caused a rash, which is now officially called the 2019 crown virus disease (COVID-19), and the virus is called severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO classified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick guide published online in Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
He has attracted excellent attention since the publication.
However, he notes that COVID-19 is a new disease. Our understanding and knowledge gradually increase based on the constant findings of research and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
For example, the CVID-19 Diagnosis and Treatment Guides published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020 have a total of seven editions with substantial changes in the context of some.
Our guide now received a comment from Zhou et al., who presented a simple score proposal based on his clinical experience.
This work has added new evidence to our guide and also makes valuable references to this global pandemic.
We carried out his important work and expressed our gratitude.
However, your work also needs to be updated according to the latest CVID-19 Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines (Seventh trial version) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), in order to confirm the suspected case, it is necessary to combine an item of epidemiological history with two items of clinical manifestations to perform a comprehensive analysis, or it is necessary to perform three items of clinical manifestations if there is no clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) a history of travel or residence in the city of Wuhan and in nearby areas or other communities where cases of COVID-19 were reported in the last 14 days before symptoms occurred; (2) a history of contact with infectious cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with positive nucleic acid test); (3) a history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from the city of Wuhan and from nearby areas or other communities where cases of COVID-19 were reported in the last 14 days before symptoms occurred; (4) a history of contact with confirmed cases (greater or equal to two cases with fever and/or respiratory symptoms occurring within 2 weeks in small spaces, such as home, office, classroom, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with diagnostic resources due to the infection by COVID-19; (3) count of total white blood cells exhibiting normal, reduced or reduced count of lymphocytes in the initial onset of symptoms.
The diagnosis of the confirmed case should be based on a suspected case of any of the following serological or pathogens: (1) positive PCR examination for SARS-CoV-2; (2) sequencing of the complete viral genome exhibiting high homogeneity in relation to the new known coronavirus; (3) positive for IgM and IgG-specific antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 in serum examination; or any change in the specific IgG-specific antibody for SARS-CoV-2 of negative for positive or increased title greater than or equal to four times in the recovery phase above that in the acute phase.
We can note that the real-time PCR test for nucleic acid in blood or respiratory treatment samples was added to the second and third editions (from 18 and 22 January 2020, respectively).
The pathogenic blood sample detection was added to the fourth and fifth editions (27 January 2020 and 8 February 2020 respectively), and the serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These changes are based on the ongoing work of researchers in the search for an ideal nucleic acid detection kit for rapid diagnosis and on samples of respiratory treatment, including blood sampling, which increased the availability of different specimens and helped to bring the positive result of specific antibodies to the confirmed criteria.
In addition, there is increasing evidence that we are reminded to pay attention to symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.
Therefore, the Zhou et al. fluxogram should be updated, as the person without clinical symptoms should be classified as "low risk".
The score system also needs to be verified in more clinical studies and practices.
To conclude, we expect more direct evidence to emerge and we ask readers to provide their comments.
For the diagnosis of "suspect case" and "confirmed case", we suggest that they check and obey the latest guidelines of their countries of origin.
Our team will also update our guide on time to offer help.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths due to COVID-19, higher daily number
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths due to COVID-19 on the day.
This is the largest number of deaths in one day due to the virus.
On yesterday's date, the Institute for Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research in Bangladesh (IEDCR) reported that the number of confirmed cases included 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases remaining at home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
In an online newsletter, the director of the IEDCR, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said that the deaths included four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases were more than 60 years old, two were between 51 and 60 years old and one was between 41 and 50 years old.
She also said that two of the victims were Daca.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 pandemic on 11 March.
One hospital agent told Anadolu Agency, a local news agency, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengali Anti-Corruption Commission, which was treated at the Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video release, the Minister of Road Transport and Bridges Obaidul Quader said public transport would be paralyzed for longer than originally planned until next Saturday.
This public transport paralysis began on 26 March and was planned to end on Saturday, 4 April.
The transport of essential products (medical products, fuel and food) was still allowed.
The first incidents of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh were recorded on 8 March, in two people who returned from Italy and also in the wife of one of them.
On 19 March, the three had already recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 exceeds a million infections worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of cases of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 infections in the world passed by a million, reported data from the University of Johns Hopkins.
At least 52,000 deaths were related to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
This framework came the same day that Malawi confirmed its first coronary infection and Zambia had its first virus-related death.
North Korea stated that until Thursday it was one of the few remaining countries free of coronavirus infections.
Until yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,05635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases 24 hours before 10 a.m. at the Central European Time (0800 UTC) on 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244 000 cases of coronavirus were reported, at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News reported, quoting data from the University of Johns Hopkins, that there were more than 1,000 deaths in the United States caused by coronavirus infections on Wednesday.
In the world, countries have announced more stringent measures to inhibit the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow's mayor Sergei Sobyanin extended the city's total blockade until 1 May.
In the national sphere, President Vladimir Putin stated that the Russians would continue to be paid without appearing at work by 30 April.
The Portuguese Parliament voted to extend the national state of emergency within 15 days; the vote was adopted by 215 votes to ten, with one abstention.
Saudi Arabia extended for the whole day the duration of the touch to be collected in the sacred cities of Mecca and Medina. Previously, this duration was only from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m.
Thailand plans to implement a pick-up point from 22 a.m. to 4 p.m.
Ohio governor Mike DeWine announced that the state had extended the order to stay home until May 1.
Stores in Australia reduce health paper limits by transaction
On Saturday night and Sunday, Australia's Woolworths and Cole's stores network reduced the purchase restrictions on hygiene paper, respectively, for two packages and a transaction package in all the country's stores.
On Monday, ALDI also implemented a package limit.
These limitations were communicated by messages in the boxes and on the Facebook pages of the networks.
For fear of COVID-19, buyers were allegedly stockpiling in case there was a need to isolate.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited purchases of sanitary paper with delivery at home for a package on request.
These changes came after the previous restriction of four packages by transaction implemented by Woolworths and Coles on 4 and 5 March, respectively.
Coles, in his press note of 8 March, reported that even with the restriction of four packages, "many stores are still exhausting stocks within an hour after delivery" and called for "without precedents", while ALDI called it "unexpected" in a Facebook post on Tuesday.
Sales had a "cented increase" last week, according to a spokesperson from Woolworths.
Costco store in Camberra also limited the quantity allowed for two packages last week.
To alleviate even more scarcity, Coles ordered larger packages from the suppliers and increased delivery frequency, Woolworths ordered extra stock, while ALDI previously made stock of a planned promotion for Wednesday.
Russel Zimmerman, Executive Director of the Australian Association of Varyjists, said that Varyjists are trying to increase stocks, but that restrictions of the local board regarding the frequency of truck deliveries make this difficult.
It expects high production costs, since suppliers are trying to meet demand, and less promotions.
On Tuesday, the ALDI announced that, after the early release of the stock, some shops will not be able to carry out the promotion of Wednesday.
In a report from News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a specialist at the University of Technology University of Queensland, said that stores rest the stock every night.
He stressed that the hygiene role is an item with low stock numbers in terms of quantity, and that, when exhausted, leaves many empty spaces in the plates, increasing the feeling of scarcity.
Coles and Woolworths have the opinion [of] that if there was an abundant quantity in the plates, if products like hygienic and antiseptic roles could be [bought] and were there in quantities, you would probably reduce the panic," Russel Zimmerman told ABC News.
The recycled health paper manufacturer Who Gives Crap said on the last Wednesday that they would be without stock.
Kimberly-Clark, who produces Kleinex's hygiene role, and Solaris Paper, who produces Sorbent, stressed that they were working 24 hours a day 7 days a week to keep supply, according to News.com.au report.
The real estate site domain.com reported that some real estate sellers were offering free hygiene role to the first auctioneers in Melbourne, when fewer auctioneers were being made with buyers entering strike at the end of the extended week of Work Day.
The Thursday edition of NT News, a daily Darwin print, included an eight-page insert to be cut and used as a toilet paper.
Initially, the stores were reluctant to impose restrictions, according to a report by ABC Australia on 3 March, in which they said they had no plans to implement restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also with high demand, such as masks, antiseptics, dry products, hand soaps and flour.
As in Australia, on Sunday night, the British on-line supermarket Ocado limited the purchases of Andres's hygiene paper for two 12-wheel packages.
The World Health Organization states the pandemic of COVID-19
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that the current occurrence of COVID-19 — the disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 — is a pandemic.
Although the word "pandemia" only indicates the degree of spread of a disease, not how dangerous the specific cases are, WHO stressed the need to encourage governments to act:
All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries are able to detect, test, treat, isolate, track and mobilize the population for a response, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of WHO, said.
We are very concerned about the alarming levels of dissemination and gravity and the alarming levels of lack of action.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it is a pandemic "without precedents".
In comments published by CNN in February, he stated that "out of influence, no other respiratory virus was monitored from the onset to the continuous global spread".
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar position, saying that "we had never seen a pandemic initiated by a coronavirus".
And it went on "and we never saw a pandemic that could be controlled at the same time."
The new pandemic status follows the WHO's January decision to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.
The director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said that the outcome, "in short, will get worse".
On Thursday, the Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide, with more than 4,600 deaths.
The pandemic of coronavirus 2019–20 is a continuous pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, an international public health emergency of international concern was declared on 30 January 2020 and recognised as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
By 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million COVID-19 cases had been reported in 210 countries and territories, with approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people recovered.
The mortality rate is estimated to be 4% in China, while overall it varies from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and lack of air.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is about five days, but it can vary from two to fourteen days.
There is no known specific antiviral vaccine or treatment.
Primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. Recommended prevention measures include washing hands, covering the mouth when coughing, keeping people away and monitoring and isolation of people with suspected infection.
The authorities around the world responded with the implementation of travel restrictions, quarantines, collection touches, risk controls at the workplace and closure of establishments.
The pandemic caused a severe global socio-economic interruption, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events and the widespread shortage of supplies exacerbated by panic shopping.
Schools and universities closed at national or local level in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4% of the world's student population.
Disinformation about the virus spread online and occurred incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people, people with East and Southeast Asian descent and appearance and other people in areas with significant cases of the virus.
Due to the reduction of travel and the closures of the heavy industry, there was a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Wuhan health authorities in China (the capital of Hubei) reported a group of cases of pneumonia for unknown cause on 31 December 2019 and an investigation was initiated at the beginning of January 2020.
Most of the cases were linked to the Huaanan Sea fruit market and therefore it is believed that the virus is of zoonotic origin.
The outbreak causing virus is known as SARS-CoV-2, a virus recently discovered and that has close links to the crown viruses of the morcego, the pangolimus and the SARS-CoV. The first person with symptoms of knowledge got sick on December 1, 2019 and did not have visible connections with the post-market group of seafood.
From the initial group of cases reported in December 2019, it was found that two thirds had a link to the market.
On 13 March 2020, an unverified report from South China Morning Post suggested that a case pointed out by 17 November 2019, in an individual 55 years from Hubei Province, which may have been the first. On 26 February 2020, the WHO reported that, as the new cases reported decreased in China, but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had exceeded the number of new cases from China for the first time.
There may be a significant sub-notification of cases, especially among people with milder symptoms.
By February 26, relatively few cases had been reported among 19-year-olds or less, accounting for 2.4% of cases worldwide. UK’s leading scientific consultant Patrick Vallance estimated that 60% of the British population should be infected until an effective collective immunity could be achieved.
Cases refer to the number of people who were tested for COVID-19 and whose tests were confirmed positive in accordance with official protocols.
By March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and several countries adopted official policies not to test people with only mild symptoms such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March found that 86% of COVID-19 infections were not detected in China until 23 January and that these undocumented infections were the source of infection of 79% of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of people infected in Italy was considerably higher than the reported cases.
The initial estimates of the baseline reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who have not recovered, the time from the onset of symptoms to death has been between 6 and 41 days, being 14 days the most common.
By 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths were attributed to COVID-19.
In China, up to 5 February, approximately 80% of deaths occurred in people over 60 years of age and 75% had pre-existing medical conditions, including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. The official count of deaths due to COVID-19 pandemic usually refers to people who died and who had a positive test for COVID, according to official protocols.
The actual number of deaths by COVID-19 may be much higher, since it may not include people who died without having done the test, for example, who died at home, in homes of rest, etc.
Italy's partial data showed that the additional number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official count of deaths by COVID by a factor of 4-5x.
A spokesperson for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged that "we know that [the number of official deaths] is underestimated", a statement corroborated by episodes of sub-notification in the U.S.. This underestimation often occurs in pandemics, such as the H1N1 swine influenza epidemic in 2009. The first confirmed death occurred in Wuhan on 9 January 2020.
The first death outside China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on 14 February.
On 28 February, outside China, more than a dozen deaths had already been recorded in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
On 13 March more than forty countries and territories had reported deaths, in all continents except Antarctica. Several measures are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary according to the region and over time and are influenced by the volume of tests, quality of the health system, treatment options, time since the start and characteristics of the population, such as age, sex and general health. The fatality coefficient represents the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed at a given interval.
Based on statistics from the University of Johns Hopkins, the global fatality rate is 6.0% (97.039/1.617.204) until 10 April 2020.
The number varies according to the region.
In China, the mortality rate estimates fell from 17.3% (in people with early symptoms from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for people with early symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other measures include the mortality rate (CFR), which represents the percentage of people diagnosed with disease deaths, and the rate of fatality of infection (IFR), which represents the percentage of infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die due to the disease.
These statistics are not static over time and follow a specific population of infection by resolving the case.
Some academics have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The Medical Center based on Oxford University Evidence estimates that the fatality rate of infection for pandemic is generally between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The higher estimate of this interval is compatible with the results of the first random test for COVID-19 in Germany and with a statistical study that analyzed the impact of the tests on CFR estimates.
WHO claims that pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and maximum length of the exit are uncertain and can change according to the location.
Maciej Boni, from the University of Pennsylvania State, said that "without due control, infectious epidemics usually reach their height and then enter decline when there are no more hosts available for the disease.
But it is almost impossible to make any proper projection at the moment about when this will happen."
The senior medical adviser of the Chinese government, Zhong Nanshan, argued that "may end until June" if all countries mobilize to follow the WHO recommendations on measures to prevent the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, declared that SARS-CoV-2 "probably will continue to operate for a year or two".
According to the study of Imperial College, led by Neil Ferguson, physical distance and other measures will be necessary "until a vaccine is available (potentially within 18 months or more)".
William Schaffner, from Vanderbilt University, declared: "It is unlikely that this coronation will disappear completely, since it is highly communicable" and "that it may become a seasonal disease, reappearing every year".
The virulence of reappearance will depend on group immunity and the extent of the mutation.
Symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively non-specific and infected people may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
The less common symptoms include fatigue, respiratory secretion production (catarro), loss of olfactory sensation, lack of air, muscle and joint pain, throat pain, headache, calafrios, vomiting, haemoptysis, diarrhoea or cyanosis. WHO states that approximately one in six people is seriously ill and has difficulty breathing.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the United States list that emergency symptoms are the difficulty in breathing, pain or pressure in the persistent chest, sudden confusion, difficulty in walking and face or lips with blue coloring. It is advised to seek medical help if these symptoms are present. The evolution of the disease may cause severe pneumonia, acute respiratory discomfort syndrome, because, septic shock and death.
Some of the infected people may be asymptomatic, without clinical symptoms, but with results from the tests that confirm the infection, researchers recommend that those who were in close contact with a person with confirmed infection be monitored and examined closely to discard the infection.
Chinese estimates of the asymptomatic ratio vary from some to 44%.
The usual period of incubation (time between the beginning of infection and symptoms) varies from one to 14 days, but usually it is five days. As an example of uncertainty, the estimate of the fraction of people with COVID-19 who lost the morphative sensation was initially 30% and later fell to 15%.
Some details about how the disease spread are still being determined.
It is believed that this disease is spread mainly by close contact and by small drops produced during the act of coughing, breathing or talking, and the close contact is considered 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have found that coughing without covering the mouth can make the gouts reach 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some people suggested that the virus can also be transmitted by gouts that remain for longer periods in the air, which may have been generated during a conversation. Respiratory gouts can also be produced during the expiry, including when speaking, although the virus is not normally suspended.
The droplets can be put in the mouths and noses of people close to them or may be inhaled by the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may cause the nebulization of respiratory secretions, resulting in air propagation.
The spread can also occur when someone touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then it touches the eyes, nose or mouth.
Although there is concern that it may spread through the faeces, it is believed that the risk of this happening is low.
The government of China has denied the possibility of the SARS-CoV-2 gold-fetal transmission. The virus is more contagious during the first three days after the onset of the symptoms, although the transmission may be possible before the symptoms appear and in later stages of the disease.
There were positive tests for the disease up to three days before the onset of symptoms, suggesting that transmission is possible even before the development of significant symptoms.
There are only a few reports of asymptomatic cases confirmed by laboratory, but the asymptomatic transmission was identified in some countries during contact tracking investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) stipulates that although it is not fully clear the ease with which the disease spreads, a person is usually infected with two to three other people.
Specifically, it was found that the virus is detectable for up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel 304, for one day in paper and up to four hours in copper.
This, however, varies according to humidity and temperature. Estimates and other animals have already tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can pass the virus to humans. However, the British authorities advise that they wash their hands after contact with animals, as well as after contact with surfaces that infected people may have touched.
The coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, isolated for the first time from three people with pneumonia connected to a set of acute respiratory disease cases in Wuhan.
All features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are similar to those of coronavirus related in its nature. Outside of the human body, the virus dies by domestic soap, which dissolves its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is intimately associated with the original SARS-CoV.
It's believed to be of zoonotic origin.
The genetic analysis revealed that the coronavirus is genetically associated with the genus Betacornavirus, subgena Sarbecovirus (line B). Two strains of this same line are derived from pieces.
It has 96% similarity, throughout the genome level, to other samples of coronavirus coming from bites (BatCoV RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only one amino acid of difference in certain parts of the sequences of genome between the pangolins virus and that of humans.
The comparison of the whole genome has so far found at most 92% of the genetic material sharing between the pangolime coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove that the pangolins are the intermediate host.
The virus infection can be temporarily diagnosed on the basis of symptoms. However, the final confirmation is the reverse transcription followed by a reaction in the polymerase chain (rRT-PCR) of infected secretions or by computerized tomography (TC).
A study conducted in Wuhan, comparing rRT-PCR to TC suggested that TC is significantly more sensitive, although less specific, with many of its image characteristics matching other pneumonias and pathological processes.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "the TC is not used for screening or as a front line test for the diagnosis of COVID-19".
WHO published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on 17 January.
The test uses reverse transcription followed by reaction and polymerase chain (rRT-PCR) in real time.
The test may be performed in respiratory or blood samples.
The results are usually available from a few hours a day.
Generally, this test is carried out in nasopharyngeal squeezing, although the throat squeezing is also used. Several laboratories and companies are developing serological tests capable of detecting antibodies.
On 6 April 2020, none of these had been shown to be sufficient to be approved for general use.
A serological test developed by Cellex, in the United States. was approved to be used in an emergency character only by certified laboratories.
The particularities of the images of radiographs and computed tomography (TC) of symptomatic people include opacitys in asymmetric peripheral glass and absence of pleural spills.
The Italian Radiological Society is gathering an online international database of image results in confirmed cases.
Due to the overposition with other infections such as adenovirus, images without confirmation of PCR are limited in the identification of COVID-19.
A large study in China compared the results of TC thoracic to PCR and showed that, although the image is less specific to the infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting its consideration as an investigation tool in epidemiological areas.
Convolutional neural networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed to detect the characteristics of images of the virus with radiography and with CT.
Strategies to prevent the transmission of the disease include keeping a good personal hygiene in general, washing your hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth without washing your hands, coughing or breathing on a paper lens and putting this lens directly into a waste container.
It is advised who has already been infected to use a surgical mask in public.
Physical remoteness measures are also recommended to avoid transmission. Many governments have restricted or disadvised non-essential travel to or from countries and areas affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached the stage of Community spread in vast regions of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities and that some members of the community do not know where or how they were infected. It is recommended that health professionals take care of individuals who may be infected to use standard precautions, contact precautions and eye protection. The tracking of contacts is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and to prevent subsequent transmission.
The use by location data governments from cell phones for this purpose has raised issues of privacy, with the International Anistia and more than 100 other organizations issuing a statement requesting limitations on this kind of surveillance.
Several mobile applications have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use. On April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups are working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record the proximity of a user to other mobile phones.
Users then receive a message if they were in close contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19. Some misconceptions about how to prevent infection have circulated, such as nailing the nose and gagging with colutures, which has already proved ineffective.
There is no vaccine against COVID-19. However, several organizations are working for the development of one.
Washing hands is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with water and soap for at least 20 seconds, especially after using the toilet or when hands are visually dirty. You should also wash your hands before eating and after drying your nose, coughing or breathing.
This is because, outside the human body, the virus is killed by domestic soap, which breaks its protective layer.
The CDC also recommends the use of alcohol-based hand hygiene with a minimum volume of 60% of alcohol, when there is no soap and water readily available.
WHO advises to avoid touching eyes, nose or mouth without washing hands.
Surfaces can be decontaminated with various solutions (up to one minute exposure to the disinfectant for a stainless steel surface), including ethanol to 62–71%, isopropyl alcohol to 50–100%, sodium hypochlorite to 0.1%, hydrogen peroxide to 0.5% and iodopovidone to 0.2–7.5%.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that in case of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 at a site such as an office or a crèche, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common areas, electronic equipment shared as tablets, touchscreens, keyboards, remote controls and electronic boxes used by patients should be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend covering the mouth and nose with a folded coat or a paper sheet by coughing or sneezing, as well as immediately discarding any sheet.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who may be infected, since using a mask can limit the volume and distance of displacement of expiratory drops when speaking, breathing or coughing.
WHO published instructions on when and how to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at Leeds University, "The use of masks can reduce the propensity of people to touch their faces, which is one of the greatest sources of infection without the proper hygiene of their hands." The use of masks by caregivers of people who may have the disease has also been recommended.
WHO recommended the use of masks by healthy people only when they are at high risk, such as caregivers with COVID-19, although they also recognize that using masks can help people not to touch their own face.
In several countries, the use of masks for public faces in general has begun to be encouraged.
In the U.S., the CDC recommends the use of non-medical mask for the face made of cloth. China specifically recommended the use of medical masks that are discarded by healthy people in general, especially when in close contact with another person (remain 1 meter or less away).
In Hong Kong, the use of surgical mask is recommended when using public transport or staying in crowded places.
The health authorities in Thailand are encouraging people to make facial clothing masks at home and wash them daily.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, it is prohibited to go out in public without using a mask or covering the nose and mouth.
On 16 March, Vietnam asked everyone to use facial masks when going out in public areas to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government demanded that all who enter supermarkets should use a mask for the face.
In Israel, all residents were asked to use masks for public face.
Taiwan, which has produced ten million masks a day since mid-March, demanded that passengers on inter-municipal trains and buses use masks for the face from 1 April.
In Panama, it is mandatory to use mask for face when going out the street. At the same time, it was recommended to produce masks at home for those who could not buy.
Face masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distance (also known as physical distance) involves infection control actions aimed at slowing the transmission of the disease by reducing the close contact between individuals.
The methods include quarantines, travel restrictions and school closures, workplaces, stadiums, theatres or shopping centers.
Social distance methods can be applied by everyone while staying at home, limiting their travels, avoiding crowded areas, using uncontacted greetings and keeping away from others.
At the moment, many governments are forcing or recommending social exclusion in regions affected by the epidemic.
The maximum number of people gathered recommended by the U.S. government bodies and health organizations was rapidly reduced by 250 people (if there is no knowledge of COVID-19 transmission in one region) to 50 people and then to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public meetings of more than two people. Older adults and those with underlying diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension and compromised immune systems face greater risk of serious diseases and complications, being advised by the CDC to stay at home as much as possible in areas of the Community epidemic. At the end of March 2020, WHO and other health authorities began to replace the use of the term "social distance" by "physical distance", to clarify that the aim is to reduce physical contact by maintaining social connections, whether virtual or distance.
The use of the term "social distance" led to the implications that social isolation was needed completely instead of encouraging contact by other alternative means. Some authorities published sexual health guidelines during the pandemic.
These recommendations include having sex only with someone you live with, who does not have the virus or symptoms.
Self-insulation at home was recommended for those diagnosed with COVID-19 and for those suspected of being infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-insulation. Many governments have demanded or recommended self-quantity for entire populations living in affected areas.
The most incisive self-quantence instructions were issued to those in high-risk groups.
It was advised that individuals who may have been exposed to others with COVID-19 and who have recently traveled to a country or region with a wide range of transmissions that make 14 days of self-quantity since the last possible exposure.
The strategies for control of a leak are retention or suppression and reduction.
Containment is carried out in the preliminary stages of an outbreak and aims to track and isolate the infected, as well as to present other measures to control the infection and vaccines that prevent the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
When containing the spread of the disease is no longer possible, efforts are being made to reduce: the measures taken now serve to reduce the spread rate and reduce its adverse effects on the health system as well as on the population.
Containment and mitigation measures may be taken at the same time, in combination.
The removal requires more extreme measures in order to reverse the pandemic to a basic reproductive rate below 1. The management of an outbreak of infectious disease, in part, has to do with trying to reduce the peak of the epidemic.
Thus, the risk of overloading health services is reduced, giving more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.
Interventions that are not pharmaceutical and that may administer the outcome include personal preventive measures such as hand hygiene, the use of facial masks and self-quantity; Community measures aimed at physical distance, such as closing schools and canceling events that lead to agglomerations; Community involvement, in order to stimulate acceptance and participation in these interventions; and environmental measures such as cleaning of contact surfaces. More drastic actions to contain the outcome were taken in China when the severity of the event became clear. Whole cities, for example, remained in quarantine and travel bans.
Other countries have taken various measures to ensure that the spread of the virus is limited.
South Korea, for example, presented the mass screening and the quarantines located. In addition, the government issued warnings about the movement of infected people.
In Singapore, the infected received financial support when they performed the self-quantennial and, for those who did not do so, severe fines were imposed.
In Taiwan, there was an increase in the production of masks for the face and those who stored medical supplies were punished. simulations conducted in the United Kingdom and the United States show that the reduction (the decrease in the rate of infection, without stopping the spread of the epidemic) and the suppression (i.e. the reversal of the growth of the epidemic) are major challenges.
Ideal reduction policies can reduce demand for health services in 2/3 and deaths in half. Still, this would result in hundreds of thousands of deaths, overloading health systems at the same time.
The removal may be the best alternative, but it must be maintained while there is movement of the virus by the human population or even the availability of a vaccine, if this happens before. On the contrary, the transmission again occurs as soon as the measures are relaxed.
A long-term intervention to eliminate pandemic brings with it social and economic costs.
There is no approved antiviral medicine that is specific to COVID-19. However, there are efforts to develop medicines, including the existing drug test.
The use of medicines for refrigerating that do not require medical prescription, drink fairly liquid and rest may help relieve the symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the case, use of oxygen therapy, intravenous insertion of fluids or respiratory aid may be necessary.
The use of steroids can worsen the condition.
Various compounds previously approved to treat other viral diseases are under investigation to be used in the treatment of COVID-19.
The World Health Organization also stated that some "home and traditional" medications can alleviate the symptoms caused by the SARS-CoV-19 virus.
WHO describes the increased capacity and adaptation of health care to the needs brought by COVID-19 as basic measures to combat the outbreak.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, ECDC, and the WHO Office in Europe have issued guidelines for primary health care hospitals and services to move their resources at various levels, including the concentration of laboratory services for the testing of COVID-19, the cancellation of non-compulsory procedures and the separation and isolation of patients with positive testing for COVID-19, in addition to the increased capacity for intensive care through staff training and the increase in the number of beds and ventilators available.
There are several theories about the occurrence of the first case (the so-called zero patient).
The first case known as the new coronavirus was dated 1 December 2019 in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China.
In one month, the number of cases of coronavirus in the region gradually increased.
These cases were largely linked to the Huaanan Sea fruit market. The market also sold live animals, which led to the theory that the virus came from one of these animals. In other words, it was believed to have a zoonotic origin. On 26 December, a group of patients were observed and treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian at Hubei's Provincial Hospital. On the following day, the doctor informed Wuhan Jianghan's Prevention and Control Center.
On December 30, a group of doctors from Wuhan's Central Hospital warned their colleagues about a SARS-type coronavirus.
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were arrested by the police for spreading false news. Another doctor, Ai Fen, was arrested by his superiors for having given the alarm.
On 31 December, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission made a communication to the population and informed WHO.
Sufficient cases of unknown origin pneumonia had already been reported to Wuhan's health authorities to generate an investigation at the beginning of January. During the first stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled every seven and a half days, approximately.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread through other provinces of China, facilitated by the migration of the new Chinese year and by Wuhan being a transport centre, as well as a major railway connection point.
On January 20, China reported about 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzen.
Later official data show that 6,174 people had already developed symptoms by 20 January 2020. On 26 March, the United States exceeded China and Italy, with the largest number of cases confirmed worldwide. On 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases were reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people died, and more than 364,000 were recovered.
About 200 countries and territories have already had at least one case.
According to the pandemic in Europe, many countries that are part of the Schengen Treaty have restricted free movement and established border controls.
The country's reactions included detention measures, such as quarantines (also known as home bordering orders, house arrest orders or lockdown) and pick-up attacks. On 2 April, about 300 million people (almost 90% of the population) are in some way confined in the United States, more than 50 million people are in the Philippines, around 59 million people are in the South Africa and 1.3 million people are in India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people around the world were already in some form of lockdown, which increased to 2.6 billion people two days later, about a third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was registered in Wuhan on 1 December 2019. An unconfirmed report suggests an earlier case of 17 November.
Dr. Zhang Jixian observed a group of patients with pneumonia for unknown causes on December 26th. His hospital informed Wuhan Jianghan's Center for Disease Prevention and Control on December 27th.
Initial genetic tests, on 27 December 2019, in samples taken from patients indicated the presence of a SARS-type coronavirus.
A communication to the population was issued by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on 31 December.
WHO was informed on the same day.
When these notifications occurred, Wuhan's doctors were warned by the police that they would "tell rumors" about the outcome.
The National Health Commission of China initially claimed that there was no "clear evidence" of transmission between human beings.
At the end of January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign, later described by the Secretary General of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, as a "war of the people", to contain the spread of the virus.
In what was described as "the largest quarantine of mankind's history", a health cord was announced on January 23 to interrupt travel from or back to Wuhan, which was extended by 15 cities in Hubei, reaching about 57 million people in total.
The use of private vehicles was prohibited in the city.
The celebrations of the new Chinese year, on 25 January, were cancelled in various locations.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Hospital Huoshenshan, which was completed in 10 days.
Another hospital, Leishenshan, was later built to care for more patients.
Along with the newly built hospitals, China converted 14 other Wuhan establishments into temporary hospitals, such as convention and stadium centres. On 26 January, the government launched more measures to contain the release of COVID-19, including the issuance of health statements for travellers and the expansion of the spring festival holiday.
Universities and schools in the whole country were also closed.
The Hong Kong and Macao regions took various measures, particularly with regard to schools and universities.
Remote work measures were taken in many regions of the country.
Travel restrictions were made in Hubei and outside it.
Public transport was modified, and museums throughout China were temporarily closed.
The control of the movement of the public was applied in several cities, and it was estimated that about 760 million people (more than half the population) went through some kind of restriction of exits. After entering their global phase in March, the Chinese authorities took strict measures to avoid the "importation" of the virus from other countries.
Pequim, for example, imposed a mandatory 14-day quarantine for all international travellers arriving in the city. On 23 March, continental China had only one case of domestic transmission in five days, in that case, through a traveler who returned to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On 24 March 2020, the Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang reported that the spread of domestic transmission cases had been basically blocked and that the outflow had been controlled in China.
On the same day, travel restrictions were reduced in Hubei, except in Wuhan, two months after the lockdown was imposed. The Minister of Foreign Affairs of China announced, on 26 March 2020, that the entry of individuals with visa or residence permit would be suspended from 28 March, without specific details of when this policy will be closed.
Anyone wishing to enter China will need to apply for visas in Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Chinese government encouraged companies and factories to reopen on March 30, giving financial incentives packages to companies. The Council of State declared one day of mourning, starting with a moment of three minutes of silence in the whole country, on April 4 at 10 a.m., coincided with the Qingming Festival. However, the central government asked families to pay their praise online, observing the physical distance to avoid a new exit from COVID-19.
On 20 January 2020, the spread of COVID-19 from China to South Korea was confirmed.
The national health agency of the country reported a significant increase in the cases confirmed on February 20, largely attributed to a meeting in Daegu of a new religious movement, known as the Church of Jesus of Shincheonji.
It is suspected that the devotees of Shincheonji who visited Daegu coming from Wuhan were the source of the outbreak.
On 22 February, among the 9,336 church followers, 1,261, or about 13% of them, reported symptoms. South Korea declared maximum alert level on 23 February 2020.
On 28 February, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported, reaching 3.150 on 29 February.
All the military bases of South Korea were placed in quarantine after tests confirmed that three soldiers were positive for the virus.
The schedule of the airlines was also affected and modified. South Korea presented what was considered the world's largest and most well-organized program in terms of population screening for the virus. The country also isolated infected people and tracked and placed in quarantine those who came in contact with them.
The screening methods included the individual mandatory report of symptoms for those arriving from international travel through a mobile application, a drive-thru virus test, with results available the following day, as well as an increase in the testing capacity, which allowed up to 20,000 people per day to be tested.
South Korea's programme is considered a success in south control, although it has not put entire cities in quarantine. South Korean society was divided initially as to the response to the crisis given by President Moon Jae-in.
Many Koreans signed requests requesting Moon's impeachment under the alleged mismanagement of the exit, or raising their response.
On 23 March, it was reported that South Korea had the total number of cases lower in four weeks.
On 29 March it was announced that from 1 April all new arrivals from abroad should enter quarantine for two weeks.
Through media reports on 1 April, South Korea received requests to help with the testing of the virus from 121 different countries.
Iran confirmed its first cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection on February 19 in Qom, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two people died that day.
Early measures announced by the government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural events, sporting events, and religious events on Fridays, the closure of universities, higher education institutions, and schools.
Iran had five trillion Rials to fight the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani said on 26 February 2020 that there were no plans for the quarantine areas affected by the outbreak, and only individuals would be placed in quarantine.
Plans to limit travel between the cities were announced in March, although a heavy traffic between the cities before the New Year was continuing.
Shiite shrines in Qom remained open to pilgrims until 16 March 2020. Iran became the center of the spread of the virus after China during February.
More than ten countries have tracked their cases related to Iran on 28 February, indicating that the extent of the case could be more serious than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government until that date.
The Iranian Parliament was closed, with 23 of its 290 members with a positive test for the virus on 3 March.
On 12 March, the Human Rights Watch strongly requested the Iranian prison authorities to unconditionally release human rights defenders detained for peaceful dissidentity, and also to temporarily release all eligible prisoners.
The body stated that there is a greater risk of the spread of the virus in closed institutions as detention centres, which also suffer from lack of medical care.
On 15 March, the Iranian government reported 100 deaths on a single day, the largest number since the outbreak in the country.
At least 12 politicians in practice or retired and government officials died as a result of the disease until 17 March.
By March 23, Iran had 50 new cases per hour and a new death every ten minutes due to the Coronavirus.
According to a representative of WHO, there should be five more cases in Iran than is being reported.
It is suggested that US sanctions imposed on Iran may be affecting the country's financial ability to respond to the viral pandemic.
The High Commissioner for Human Rights has requested that economic sanctions be alleviated to the nations most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
The exit was confirmed as having spread to Italy on 31 January, when two Chinese tourists tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome.
Cases began to rise abruptly, which led the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare state of emergency.
A group not associated with the cases of COVID-19 was subsequently detected, starting with 16 cases confirmed in Lombardy on 21 February. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers announced a decree to contain the outbreak, including the quarantine of more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, "In the outing areas, people's entrances and exits are prohibited.
The suspension of work activities and sporting events had already been determined in these areas. "On March 4, the Italian government applied for the total closure of all schools and universities throughout the country when Italy reached 100 deaths.
All major sports events, including the series A football matches, had to be held at closed doors until April, but on March 9, all sports events were suspended completely for at least one month.
On 11 March, Prime Minister Conte requested the closure of almost all commercial activities, except supermarkets and pharmacies. On 6 March, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resurrection and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published recommendations on medical ethics regarding screening protocols that could be used.
On 19 March, Italy passed to China as the country with the most deaths related to Coronavirus in the world after reporting 3,405 deaths related to pandemic.
On 22 March, it was reported that Russia sent nine military aircraft with medical supplies to Italy.
As of 5 April, there were 128,948 confirmed cases, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 recovered in Italy, with most of these cases occurring in the Lombardy region.
A CNN report indicated that the combination of an elderly population in Italy and the inability to test all who had the virus until then may have contributed to a high mortality rate.
The United Kingdom's response to the virus first emerged as one of the most marked of the affected countries, and by 18 March 2020, the British government had imposed no form of social exclusion or mass quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the government received criticism of the recognized lack of diligence and intensity of its response to the problems faced by the population. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made a statement recommending the interruption of all non-essential travel and social contact, suggesting that people work at home as much as possible and avoid locals as bars, restaurants and theatres.
On 20 March, the government announced that all leisure establishments, such as pubs and academies, should be closed as soon as possible, and committed to paying 80% of workers' wages up to a limit of 2,500 pounds per month to avoid unemployment during the crisis. On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced more severe social distance measures, preventing agglomerations with more than two people and restricting travel and outdoor activities to the minimum necessary.
Different from the previous measures, these restrictions were reinforced by the police through the issuance of fines and the dispersion of agglomerations.
Most of the business received orders to close, with exceptions for business considered "essential", including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware stores, gas stations and office cars.

WHO commended the efforts of the Chinese authorities to manage and contain the epidemic.
WHO observed the contrast between the occurrence of SARS 2002-2004, where the Chinese authorities were accused of omitting data that hampered prevention and detention efforts, and the current crisis, where the central government "provided regular updates to avoid the panic near the festivals in the new month".
On 23 January, in response to the decision of the main authorities to implement a ban on transport in Wuhan, the representative of WHO Gauden Galea observed that "that was certainly not a recommendation from WHO" and was also "a very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic in the area where it was most concentrated". On 30 January, after confirming the transmission between humans outside China and the increase in the number of cases in other countries, the WHO declared the outbreak as the International Public Health Emergency (PHEIC), the sixth PEIC since the measure was first invoked during the 2009 swine influenza pandemic.
WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom said that PHEC was invoked because of the "risk of global dissemination, especially in low- and medium-income countries without robust health systems.
In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tedros stated that "there is no reason for measures that have unduly interfered with international and trade travel" and that "the WHO does not recommend limiting trade and displacements."
On 5 February, WHO called on the global community to contribute $675 million to finance strategic preparation in low- and medium-income countries, citing the urgency to assist these countries that "do not have systems in place to detect people who have contracted the virus, and even if it occurs".
Tedros made subsequent statements indicating that "we are as strong as our weakest bond" and asked the international community to "invest now or they will have to pay later". On 11 February, WHO established COVID-19 at a press conference as the name of the disease.
On the same day, Tedros declared that the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Antonio Guterres, had agreed to provide the "power of the entire United Nations system as a response".
The United Nations Crisis Management Team was activated as a result, allowing the coordination of the entire response of the United Nations, which the WHO declares will allow them to "focus on the health response while other agencies can enter with their experience in the social, economic and development implications resulting from the outbreak".
On 14 February, a Joint Mission Team of WHO with China was enabled to provide international experts and WHO on land in China with assistance in domestic management and to assess "the severity and transmission of the disease" through workshops and meetings with the main national institutions and field visits to assess "the impact of response activities at provincial and municipal levels, including urban and rural panoramas". On 25 February, WHO stated that "the world should do more to prepare for a possible pandemic of Coronavirus", declaring that, although it was too early to declare a pandemic, countries should establish "a stage of preparation".
In response to an outflow in Iran, WHO sent a Joint Mission Team to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO officials said that the assessment of the global threat of Coronavirus would be high from "high" to "very high" is the highest level of alert and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, executive director of the health emergency program, warned in a statement that "This is a statement of reality for every government on the planet: Agree.
This virus can be on its way and you need to be ready," insisting that correct response measures could help the world avoid "the worst."
Ryan also stated that the current data did not allow public health officials to declare a global pandemic, saying that such a statement would mean that "we are essentially accepting that every human on the planet will be exposed to this virus."
On 11 March, the WHO declared the outbreak of Coronavirus a pandemic.
The Director General said that WHO was "deeply concerned with alarming levels of spread and severity and alarming levels of inaction". WHO faced many criticisms as an inadequate management of the pandemic, including the late declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
The response included a request to the Director General of WHO, Tedros Adhanom to submit his resignation, signed by 733 000 people on 6 April.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of United Nations human rights experts emphasized respect for the rights of each individual during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The expert group stated that everyone has the right to intervene to save life and that the government is responsible.
The group stressed that the lack of resources or health plan should never serve as a justification for discrimination against a specific group.
Experts highlighted that each individual has the right to health, including people with disabilities, minorities, elderly people, people with mental problems, deprived people living in extreme poverty, arrested people, as well as refugees and other unspecified groups who need government assistance.
International government organizations are addressing the economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.

The Chinese government was criticized by the United States, by the UK Cabinet Minister Michael Gove, and by the son of the president of Brazil Jair Bolsonaro, Eduardo Bolsonaro by the management of the pandemic, which started in the Chinese province of Hubei.
Administrators at the province level of the Communist Party of China (CPC) were dismissed on the basis of their approach to efforts related to the quarantine in Central China, a sign of discontent in the response of the political establishment to the outbreak in these regions.
Some commentators believe that this action was intended to protect the secretary-general of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping from public wrath in relation to the outbreak of Coronavirus.
Some Chinese officials, e.g. Zhao Lijian, rejected an early recognition of the occurrence of Coronavirus that began in Wuhan, favoring conspiracy theories about the COVID-19 originating in the USA or Italy.
The administration of the United States of Donald Trump referred to the Coronavirus as the "Chinese Virus" or "Wuhan Virus" saying that China's censorship "superconducted a virus that now became a global pandemic", which in turn was condemned by some critics such as racism and "a way of diverting the failure of administration to contain the disease".
Daily Beast achieved a detailed communication strategy with apparent sources in the National Security Council, with a strategy cited as "This all has to do with China.
It was advised that we should try and get these messages in any way, including press conferences and television shows. "Canals such as Politician, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg indicated that China's efforts to send assistance to countries affected by the virus are part of a global campaign for global influence.
European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned that there is "a geopolitical component including an influence struggle through a trendy and 'generative policies'.
Borrell also said that "China is aggressively spreading the message that unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner."
China also requested the United States to suspend its sanctions to Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while allegedly sending assistance to those countries.
Jack Ma's 100,000 mask donation to Cuba was blocked by US sanctions on 3 April.
The United States authorities were also accused of diverting aid from other nations to their own country.
And hear disputes related to masks related to other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland; and the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey has confiscated hundreds of fans for Spain.
At the beginning of March, the Italian government criticised the lack of solidarity between the European Union and those affected by the Coronavirus in Italy.
Maurizio Massari, Italian Ambassador to the European Union, said "Only China responded bilaterally.
Of course, this is not a good sign of European solidarity."
On 22 March, after a telephone call with Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin prepared the Russian military army to send military doctors, special disinfectants, and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa, quoted an anonymous "high-level political source" that 80 percent of Russia's supplies were "useless or of little use for Italy".
The source accused Russia of embarking on an offensive "geopolitical and diplomatic".
The president of the Lombardy region, Attilio Fontana, and the Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs Luigi Di Mayo gave the media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a cargo plane with medical supplies to the United States.
Kremlin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said that "by offering help to American colleagues, [Putin] assumes that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and materials are at a good stage, they would also act reciprocally if necessary."
The planned NATO military exercise "Defender 2020" in Germany, Poland and the Baltic States, NATO's largest military exercise since the end of the Cold War, will be kept on a reduced scale.
The Secretary-General for the Nuclear Disarmament Campaign, Kate Hudson, criticised the exercise Defender 2020: "In the current public health crisis, this puts lives at risk not only of the US troops and of the various European countries that are participating, but of the inhabitants of the countries in which they operate." The Iranian government was strongly affected by the virus, with about a dozen members of the infected parliament, as well as fifteen political figures in the exercise or ex-political.
Iran's President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter to the world's leaders, asking for help on 14 March 2020, saying that his country is having difficulties fighting the outbreak due to the lack of access to international markets as a result of United States sanctions against Iran. The outbreak led the United States to adopt common social policies in other developed countries, including universal health care, universal child care, paid family leave, and high levels of funding for public health.
Political analysts predict that this may negatively affect Donald Trump's chances of re-electing himself as president in the 2020 elections. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have worsened due to the pandemic.
South Korea has criticised the ambitious and passive efforts of Japanese quarantine, after Japan announces that anyone coming from South Korea would be placed in a forty-two weeks in places designated by the government.
South Korean society was initially polarized over President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions requesting Moon's impeachment in relation to those they called out for inadequate management, or praising their response. The pandemic allowed countries to pass emergency laws as an answer.
Some commentators expressed concerns that this could allow governments to strengthen their control over power.
In Hungary, Parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to rule by decree indefinitely, suspend Parliament as well as elections and punish those considered to have spread false news about the virus and crisis management by the government.
The outbreak of Coronavirus has been blamed for several cases of shortage of supplies, resulting from increased use of equipment in a global way to combat outbreaks, panic-motivated purchases, and disruption of operations in factories and logistics.
Food and Administration of the United States has issued warnings about the lack of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumption and interruptions of the supplier.
Several locals also experienced the event of panic-motivated purchases that led to empty dishes of essential products such as food, hygiene paper, bottled water, including lack of supplies.
The technology industry in particular has warned about delays in sending electronic products.
According to WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment rose 100 times.
This demand led to an increase in prices of up to twenty times the normal price and also led to delays in the supply of medical items for four to six months.
This also caused a shortage of personal protection equipment around the world, with the WHO's warning that this would put workers' health at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic provided a new opportunity for Chinese buyers to sell Australian products in China.
The activity created a shortage of formulae for babies in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and in the Wuhan region, and the consequent high demand for food, both areas were spared a sharp shortage of food.
Measures taken by China and Italy against illegal storage and trade in essential products have been successful, avoiding the lack of food that was provided for in Europe as well as in North America.
Northern Italy with its significant agricultural production did not notice a large reduction, but prices may increase according to industry representatives.
Empty dishes were found only temporarily, even in the city of Wuhan, and Chinese government officials released pig meat reserves to ensure sufficient food for the population.
Similar laws exist in Italy, requiring food producers to keep reserves for such emergencies.
A damage to the global economy was felt in China: according to a report by the media on 16 March, the economy in China was very affected in the first two months of 2020 due to government measures to cut the spread of the virus, and sales in the market fell 20.5%.
As Continental China is a large economy and manufacturing center, the viral output was seen as a major threat destabilizing to the global economy.
Agathe Demarais of The Economist's intelligence unit predicted that markets will remain volatile until a clearer image emerges on possible results.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the global growth epidemic could exceed the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak.
An estimate of a specialist at the University of Washington in St. Louis indicated an impact of $300 billion on the supply chain of the world that could last up to two years.
The Organization of Oil Exporting Countries (OPEC) allegedly 'confused' after an accentuated decline in oil prices due to a low demand from China.
Global stock markets fell on 24 February due to a significant increase in the number of cases of COVID-19 outside Continental China.
On 27 February, due to the growing concerns about the emergence of the Coronavirus, several indices of the US bag including NASDAQ-100, S&P 500, and the Dow Jones industry average showed its most expressive decline since 2008, with Dow falling by 1,191 points, the biggest drop in one day since the 2007-08 financial crisis.
All three other indices ended the week with a lower than 10%.
On 28 February, Scope Ratings GmbH claimed China's sovereign credit rating, but maintained a negative outlook.
The actions fell again on the basis of the concerns with the coronavirus, the largest fall on March 16.
Many consider a likely economic recession.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the timely emergency measures of the central states and banks.
The central banks are reacting faster than they did to the financial collapse of 2008.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors due to travel restrictions, closure of public places including tourist points, and the recommendation by governments against any travel around the world.
As a result, many airlines cancelled their flights due to low demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines, and Qantas, while the British Flybe regional airline collapsed.
The impact on the cruise sector was from a level never seen.
Several train stations and balsa ports were also closed.
The epidemic coincided with Chunyun, a large travel station associated with the New Year's Chinese holiday.
Several events involving large crowds were cancelled by national and regional governments, including the New Year's annual festivals, with private companies also independently closing their shops and tourist attractions such as Disneyland in Hong Kong and Shanghai.
Many New Year's events of Lunar and tourist attractions were closed to avoid mass agglomerations, including the Forbidden City in Beijing and traditional temple events.
In 24 of the 31 provinces of China, municipalities and regions, the authorities extended the New Year's holiday to 10 February, instructing most of the workplaces not to be reopened until this date.
These regions accounted for 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong has increased its level of response to infectious disease to the highest level and declared an emergency, closing schools until March and canceling its New Year's celebrations. The gambling sector has been globally affected, with reductions in the schedules of stores or temporary closures.
Visits to resellers in Europe and Latin America fell by 40%.
The North American and Middle East resellers observed a drop of 50-60%.
This also resulted in a 33-43% fall in pedestrian traffic to shopping centers in March compared to February.
The operators of Shopping Centers around the world have imposed additional measures, such as greater cleaning, the installation of thermal scanners to check buyers' temperature, and the cancellation of events. According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, it is estimated that the recession caused by the pandemic could leave between 14 and 22 million people in extreme poverty in Latin America than would occur in situations without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the peak of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of China's 300 million migrant rural workers were left at home in inner or captive provinces in Hubei Province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and asked for government assistance.
The rise of the Coronavirus could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate could reach 32%, according to estimates from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The border in India has left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (who are paid by daily pay) unemployed. A survey by the Angus Reid Institute found that 44% of Canadian families have been through some kind of unemployment. Nearly 900,000 workers lost their jobs in Spain since the country adopted the border in mid-March 2020.
During the second 15th of March, 4 million French workers applied for unemployment assistance and 1 million British workers applied for a universal credit scheme. Nearly half a million companies in Germany placed their workers under reduced-time work programmes subsidized by the government known as Kurzabeit.
The German reduced-time wage programme was adopted by France and Britain.
The performatic art and cultural heritage sectors were deeply affected by the pandemic, affecting the operations of organizations as well as people - both employed and independent - worldwide.
The arts and culture organizations have tried to maintain their mission (often publicly funded) to provide access to cultural heritage for the community, to maintain the safety of their employees and the public and to help artists when possible.
In March 2020, by the world and at various levels, museums, libraries, performance sites, and other cultural institutions were permanently closed with their cancelled or delayed exhibitions, events and performances.
In response, intensive efforts were made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and highly accelerated impact of the disease is the abolition of religious services, major sporting events, and other social events such as music festivals and concerts, technological conferences and fashion events.
The film sector also experienced a interruption. The Vatican announced that the rites of the Holy Week in Rome, which would take place during the last week of the Christian Quarresma period, had been cancelled.
Many dioceses recommended that elderly Christians stay at home than attend Mass on Sundays; some churches provided church services via radio, streaming to live online or by television while others offer drive-in cults.
With the Catholic Diocese of Rome closing its churches and chapels and the square of St. Peter emptys without Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also canceled the services and limited public agglomerations in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras.
The Ministry of Health of Iran announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak and shrines were subsequently closed, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims, as well as its residents in sacred places in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic caused the most significant interruption in the world sports calendar since World War II.
Most of the main events were cancelled or postponed, including the UEFA Champions League 2019-2020, the Premier League 2019-2020, the 2019-2020 NBA season, and the 2019-2020 NHL season.
The event interfered with the plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, originally scheduled to begin at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event would be "redesigned for a date after 2020, but not after the summer of 2021". Casinos and other venues of games around the world were closed and presence poker tournaments were also delayed or cancelled.
This led many players to play online, with various online games sites reporting significant increases in their new registration rates. The entertainment industry was also affected, with several music groups suspending or canceling their tournaments.
Many big theaters like Broadway's also canceled all the shows.
Some artists have explored ways to continue to produce and share their work on the Internet as an alternative to traditional live presentations, such as live broadcast shows or creating "festivals" online for artists to present, share and disseminate their work.
On-line, several memes on the Internet about the coronavirus are propagated, as many seek humor and entertainment in the midst of uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia and racism aimed at people of Chinese or Asian descent, and against people from areas of focus in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Fear, mistrust, and hostility have been observed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Pacific region.
Results from February (when most of the cases were still restricted to China) recorded racist feelings expressed in various groups around the world about the Chinese people to deserve the virus or to be receiving a fair punishment for what they provoked.
Some countries in Africa also identified an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many Wuhan and Hubei residents reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
This has been supported by Chinese, both online and offline, and is addressed to those in areas affected by the virus.
After the rise in new countries of focus, the citizens of Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a serious rise in COVID-19, could also be subject to mistrust and xenophobia. Citizens of countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed requests by pressuring the Chinese entry ban in their countries in an attempt to contain the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan went to the Trending Topics of Twitter.
The Chinese people, as well as other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States, reported increasing levels of racist insults as well as attacks.
The president of the United States, Donald Trump, was the target of criticism of the crown virus as the "Chinese virus", a term considered by critics as racist and anti-Chinese.
Demonstrations in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and aliens evacuated from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students from northeastern India, who are bordering China, and students in large cities in India allegedly suffered persecution related to the outbreak of coronavirus.
The president of the unit in the state of Bharatiya Janata Party in Western Bengala, Dilip Ghosh, said that the Chinese destroyed nature and "that is why God turned against them".
The comments were then condemned by the Chinese consulate in Calcutta, who called it "misconstituted". In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese inhabitants were inflamed by the pandemic, with foreigners called "foreign trash" and targets of "disposal".
Many newspapers with paid access removed them from some or all the coverage on the crown virus.
Several scientific editors have provided scientific articles related to exit with open access.
Some scientists have chosen to share their conclusions as early as possible on preprint servers, such as bioRxiv.
Efficient infectious diseases — Efficient infectious diseases of emerging pathogens, often unreported as the extent or mode of transmission of the exit
Globalization of the disease — Overview of the globalization and transmission of the disease

Laboratory analyses for the respiratory disease of coronavirus 2019 (CVID-19) and the associated SARS-CoV-2 virus include methods that detect the presence of the virus and those that detect antibodies produced in response to the infection.
The presence of the virus in samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the coronary RNA.
This test is specific and developed only to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
Antibody detection (sorology) can be used for diagnosis and population monitoring.
Antibody tests reveal how many people had the disease, including those whose symptoms were very mild to be reported or who were asymptomatic.
A precise rate of mortality of the disease and the level of herd immunity in the population can be determined from the results of this test.
Due to limited testing, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population in March 2020.
On 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there were considerable variations in the number of tests carried out in countries.
This variability is probably still substantially affecting the mortality rates of registered cases, which can be significantly overestimated in some countries.
Using the polymerase chain reaction with real-time reverse transcription (rRT-PCR), the test may be carried out in breath samples obtained by various methods, including nasopharyngeal spleen or saline sample.
The results are usually available within a few hours or within 2 days.
The RT-PCR test performed with frying of the flour is reliable only in the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus may disappear in the throat as it continues to multiply in the lungs.
For infected persons tested in the second week, as an alternative, the sample material may be removed from the bottom of the respiratory tract by suction catheter or material emitted by expectation (secretion) may be used.
One of the first PCR tests was developed in Charité, Berlin, in January 2020 using the polymerase chain reaction with real-time reverse transcription (rRT-PCR), and serves as a base for 250,000 kits for distribution by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom also developed a test on 23 January 2020. The South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical type, a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on PCR (PowerCheck Coronavirus) on 28 January 2020.
He looks for the gene "E" shared by all beta coronavirus, and the gene RdRp, specific to SARS-CoV-2. In China, the BGI group was one of the first companies to receive the approval for emergency use of the National Medical Products Administration of China for the SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on PCR. In the United States, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is distributing its innovative diagnostic panel for the Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) of RT-PCR in real time for public health laboratories by the International Reagent Resource.
One of the three genetic tests in older versions of test kits generated inconclusive tests based on fail-responents, and an obstacle to testing in the CDC in Atlanta; this resulted in an average of less than 100 samples per day being successfully processed throughout February 2020.
Tests using two components were not considered reliable until 28 February 2020, and only since then local and state laboratories were allowed to initiate the tests.
The test was approved by Food and Drug Administration under an emergency use permit. Commercial laboratories started the tests in early March 2020.
From 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the national availability of the COVID-19 test based on RT-PCR.
Quest Diagnostics has also made tests for COVID-19 available nationally from 9 March 2020.
No quantity restriction has been announced; the collection and processing of samples shall be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the State Research Centre in Virology and Biotechnology, VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Surveillance Service. On 12 March 2020, Mayo Clinic claimed to have developed a test to detect the infection by COVID-19. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received an FDA approval for a test that could be performed within 3.5 hours on a wide scale, allowing a machine to process approximately 4,128 tests within a 24 hour period.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorisation (USA) for Abbott laboratories for a test in the Abbott m2000 system; the FDA previously issued an authorisation for Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid also received an FDA U.S. for a test of approximately 45 minutes.
The FDA approved a test using isothermic nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Since it does not require a series of temperature-alternating cycles, this method can generate positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these machines in the U.S. and Abbott hopes to increase production to provide 50,000 tests per day. A test using a monoclonal antibody and binding it in particular to the protein of the nucleocapidium (protein N) of the new crown virus is being developed in Taiwan, with the expectation of providing results in 15 to 20 minutes such as a rapid flu test.
A literature review in March 2020 concluded that "thorax radiographs have a lower diagnostic value in the initial stages, while CT findings, computed tomography, may be present even before symptoms occur".
Typical features in TC include multi-lobar opaques in dark glass with a posterior, peripheral and asymmetrical distribution.
Subpleural domination, mosaic flooring and consolidation evolve according to advanced disease.
A study comparing PCR to TC in Wuhan at the origin point of the current pandemic suggested that TC is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, with many of its aspects of image matching with other pneumonias and pathological processes.
From March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "TC should not be used for screening or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19". Since March 2020, the CDC recommends PCR for an initial check.
Part of the immune response to infection is the production of antibodies including IgM and IgG.
These may be used to detect infection in individuals who started 7 days ago or shortly after the onset of symptoms, to determine immunity, and to monitor the population. The tests may be performed in central laboratories (CLTs) or through remote laboratory tests (POCs).
Automated high-performance systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these tests, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For CLT, a single peripheral blood sample is commonly used, although numerous samples can be used to monitor the immune response.
For PoCT, a single blood sample is usually obtained by skin puncture.
Unlike PCR methods, the collection phase is not necessary before the test. On 26 March 2020, the FDA indicated 29 entities that notified the agency, as required, and from now on are able to distribute their antibody tests.
From 7 April 2020, only one test was approved by the FDA with an emergency use authorisation. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approvals for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies for the virus in blood samples.
The test capacity is of several hundred samples in question for hours and therefore much faster than conventional PCR tests of viral RNA.
The antibodies are usually detected 14 days after the start of the infection. At the beginning of April, the United Kingdom considered that none of the test kits of acquired antibodies were adequate to be used.
Hong Kong has organized a system in which the suspected patients may stay at home, "the emergency department will give a sample tube to the patient", they must expel salt into the tube, send it back and get a result soon afterwards. British NHS announced that it is coordinating a system to test the suspected cases at home, which eliminates the risk of a patient to infect others if they are in hospital or the need to disinfect an ambulance if anything is used. In the drive-thru tests for COVID-19 in suspected cases, a health professional collects samples taking appropriate precautions.
Drive-thru centers have helped South Korea perform some of the fastest and most comprehensive tests in a country. In Germany, the National Association of Health Insurance Statutory Medicals claimed on 2 March that it had the capacity for about 12,000 tests per day in outpatient care, while 10,700 had been tested in the previous week.
The costs are borne by health insurance when the test is requested by a doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity for 160 thousand tests per week.
Since 19 March, drive-in tests have been offered in several large cities.
Since 26 March 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany remains unknown, since only positive tests are recorded.
The first research laboratory revealed that since the 12th week of 2020 a total of, at least, 483.295 samples were tested until the 12th week of 2020 and 33,491 samples (6.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers from the Technion and Rambam hospitals developed and tested a method to test samples of 64 patients simultaneously, collecting samples and carrying out additional tests only if the combined sample was considered positive. In Wuhan, an improvised laboratory of 2000 m2 for emergency detection called "Huo-Yan" (Chinese: ), or "Fire Eye" was opened on 5 February 2020 by BGI, which can process more than 10,000 samples per day.
With the construction supervised by the Founder of BGI, Wang Jian, and over 5 days, the modeling revealed that the cases in Hubei would have been 47% higher and the corresponding cost to deal with the quarantine would have doubled if this testing capacity had not had an online access.
Wuhan laboratory was promptly followed by Hua-Yan laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai in a total of 12 cities across China.
On 4 March 2020, the total daily income was 50 thousand tests per day. Multiple open-source models released by Origami Assays were launched as testing capacity up to 1,122 patients samples for COVID-19, using only 93 tests. These balanced models can be executed in small laboratories without the need for robotic manipulating liquids.
In March, the lack or insufficient amount of reagent became an obstacle to mass testing in the European Union, the United Kingdom and the United States.
This led some authors to study the sample preparation protocols that involve the heating of samples at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release the genomes of the RNA for additional tests. On 31 March, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates are now making more tests per capita for their population to the Coronavirus than other countries, and would be on the way to increase the testing level and reach most of the population.
This was due to a combination of drive-thru capacity, and the acquisition of a mass-processing laboratory for population scale groups 42 and BGI (inspired by their emergency detection laboratories "Huo-Yan" in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory is able to conduct tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first of this scale world to operate outside China.
Various methods of testing for different components of the genetic profile of the crown virus were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted Germany's method of manufacturing sent kits for low-income countries that do not have the resources to develop their own.
The German method was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the United States Disease Control Centre was not available until 28 January, there was a delay in the tests provided for the United States and for China and the United States faced problems with the reliability of test kits well at the beginning of the outbreak; moreover, these countries near Australia have not been able to provide sufficient kits to meet demand and testing recommendations made by health professionals.
On the contrary, experts say that the wide availability of South Korea for testing has helped to reduce the spread of the new crown virus.
The testing capacity, mostly in the private sector laboratories, has been consolidated over many years by the South Korean government.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization indicated the strengthening of the testing programmes as the best way to delay the advance of the COVID-19 pandemic. The high demand for tests due to the widespread spread of the virus caused the delay of hundreds of thousands of tests in US private laboratories, and the supply of cotton and chemical reagents was affected.
In March 2020, China reported problems with accuracy in its test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDC presented "failures"; the government then removed the bureaucratic barriers that prevented the particular tests. Spain acquired test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but considered the inaccurate results.
The company explained that incorrect results could be the result of a failure in sampling or wrong use of kits.
The Minister of Spain said that he would cancel the wrong results-generating kits and replace them with a different test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test kits that the Czech Republic bought from China produced wrong results. Slovakia acquired 1.2 million China test kits considered inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovic suggested that they would be dumped in Danube. Ates Kara of the Ministry of Health of Turkey said that Turkey's test kits purchased from China had a "high error rate" and that they would not "use them". The United Kingdom acquired 3.5 million test kits from China, but in early April 2020 announced that they were not useful.
The test, followed by the quarantine of those who tested positive and the monitoring of those with whom positive people for SARS-CoV-2 had contact, had positive results.
The researchers who work in the Italian city of Vó, the location of the first death by COVID-19 in Italy, conducted two testing steps for the entire population of approximately 3,400 people, with a period of about ten days.
About half of the people who tested positive had no symptoms, and all discovered cases were placed in quarantine.
With the move to the restricted municipality, this completely eliminated new infections.
With aggressive contact monitoring, travel restrictions to the country, testing and quarantine, the crown virus pandemic in Singapore in 2020 has progressed much slower than in other developed countries, and without radical restrictions such as compulsory closure of restaurants and sales establishments.
Many events were canceled, and Singapore began to seriously advise residents to stay at home on March 28, but the schools reopened within the planned holiday on March 23.
Many other countries have also administered the pandemic with aggressive contact monitoring, travel restrictions to the country, testing and quarantine, but with less aggressive lockdowns such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study identified that countries that performed more tests compared to the number of deaths had lower mortality rates, probably because these countries are more able to detect those with no or little symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that have no testing capacity and have national laboratories with limited experience in COVID-19 send their five first positive samples and the 10 first negative samples to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmatory tests.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 are in Europe, 2 are in Africa, 1 are in North America and 1 are in Australia.
In the following table, the column "positive in % of tests" is influenced by country testing policy.
A country that tests only hospitalized people will have a higher percentage of positive tests than a country that has tested all citizens, whether they present or not, the other characteristics are equivalent.
The washing of hands (or cleaning of hands), also known as hand hygiene, is the act of washing hands in order to remove dirt, fat, microorganisms, or other undesirable substances.
The washing of hands with soap constantly in certain "critical moments" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted by gold-fetal route.
People may also be infected with respiratory diseases such as flu or a common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching the eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes).
The five crucial moments during the day when washing hands with soap are important include: before and after the defection, after cleaning the baby's bumblebee or changing the branches, before feeding a child, before meals and before and after preparing the food or handling meat, free or raw fish.
If water and soap are not available, the hands can be cured with ashes. The World Health Organization recommends the hygiene of the hands:
Before, during and after preparing the food.
Before and after taking care of a sick person.
After changing branches or cleaning a child who used the bathroom.
After squeezing your nose, coughing or sneezing.
After touching animals, rations or animal waste.
The clinical hygiene of the hands refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Washing hands before administering medicines or medical care may prevent or minimize the spread of diseases.
The main goal of washing hands is cleaning the hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that may cause diseases) and chemicals that may cause damage or diseases.
This is particularly important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
Hand washing has many benefits for health, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
and reducing the infant mortality rate in births made at home.
A 2013 study revealed that best hand washing practices can cause small improvements in the growth of children under five years of age.
In developed countries, infant mortality rates related to diarrhea and respiratory diseases can be reduced by simply introducing behavioral changes, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple attitude can reduce the mortality rate of these diseases by almost 50%.
Interventions that promote hand washing can reduce diarrhea episodes in about a third, which is comparable to providing clean water for areas with no need.
48% of the decreases in diarrhoea episodes can be associated with the washing of hands with soap. Washing hands with soap is the most effective and economic way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (IRAs), such as automatic behavior in homes, schools, and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, the main IRA, is the first cause of mortality among children under five years of age, taking the lives of estimated 1.8 million children per year.
Diarrhoea and joint pneumonia are responsible for almost 3.5 million deaths of children annually.
According to UNICEF, changing the washing of hands with soap before eating and after using the bath as a rooted habit can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, reducing diarrhea deaths by almost half and acute respiratory infections in one room.
Hand washing is usually associated with other health interventions as part of water, sanitation and hygiene programs (WASH).
The washing of hands also protects against the strain that is transmitted by direct physical contact.
A less significant negative effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can cause skin lesions depending on skin drying.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hands washing can cause a condition of skin relaxation and irritation known as hand eczema or dermatitis, which is particularly common among health system workers.
The frequent washing of hands is also perceived as one of the symptoms of compulsive obsessive disorder (TOC).
There are five crucial moments during the day when washing hands with soap is important to reduce the fecal-oral transmission of diseases: after using the bath (miction, defection), after cleaning a child's bumblebee (steak change), before feeding a child, before eating and before/after preparing a meal or handling meat, fish or crust.
Other situations when the correct technique for hand washing should be practiced in order to prevent the transmission of diseases include the first and after treatment of a cut or injury; after sprinkling, coughing or scratching the nose; after touching animal waste or dealing with animals; and after touching trash.
In many countries, there is a reduced rate of hand washing with soap.
A study on hand washing in 54 countries in 2015 found that on average 38.7% of families had the habit of washing hands with soap. A 2014 study revealed that Saudi Arabia had the highest index of 97%; the United States was close to the average of 77%; and China with the lowest index of 23%. Several methods for behavioral changes are currently in place to increase acceptance of hand washing with soap during critical periods. Collective washing of hands for children in schools in certain periods of the day is an alternative in developing countries to injecting hands washing in children’s habits.
The "Essential Health Services Program" implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of a large-scale action to promote children's health and education.
The disparity twice a year, supplemented by the washing of hands daily with soap, brushing of teeth daily with fluoride, are at the centre of this national programme.
It was also successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of skin microorganisms is strengthened by adding soaps and detergents to the water.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce barriers to solution, and increase solubility.
The water itself is an inefficient cleaning agent for the skin, because fats and proteins, organic dirt components, are not easily dissolved in water.
Cleaning, however, is facilitated by a reasonable flow of water...
The bar soap, depending on its reusable nature, can retain the accumulated bacteria from previous uses.
A small number of studies that analyzed the bacterial transmission of a contaminated soap concluded that transmission is unlikely since bacteria are embalmed with foam.
The CDC repeats "liquid sabonette with automatic dosing commands is preferable".
Antibacterial soaps were widely disseminated to the public consciously in terms of health.
Up to now, there are no indications that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants may lead to the selection of naturally resistant antibiotics.
However, antibacterial soap contains common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which has an extensive list of resistant strains of organisms.
Thus, even though antibiotics resistant strains are not selected by antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as they are released.
In addition to surfactants and skin protection agents, complex formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as pH regulator, active antimicrobial benzoic acid and other moisturizers for the skin (aloe vera, vitamins, mentol, plant extracts).A comprehensive analysis of the University of Oregon School of Public Health indicated that common soaps are as effective in preventing diseases and removing bacteria from the hands as antibacterial soaps for the final consumer containing triclosan.
Hot water that is comfortable for hand washing is not hot enough to kill the bacteria.
The bacteria grow faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, hot water with soap is more effective than cold water with soap to remove the natural oily that retains dirt and bacteria.
Unlike popular belief, however, scientific studies have revealed that using hot water is not effective to reduce the microbial load in the hands.
A hand hygienic or antiseptic agent is a non-aquatic base hand hygienic agent.
At the end of the 1990s and the beginning of the 21st century, non-aqueous basic hands hygiene agents (also known as hand hygiene product for alcohol, hand hygiene product for antiseptics, or hand hygiene) began to gain popularity.
Most are made on the basis of isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulated with a thickening agent, such as carbomer (polymer or acrylic acid), in gel, or a moisturizer, such as glycerin, in liquid, or in foam to facilitate the use and reduce the effect of alcohol drying.
The addition of hydrogen peroxide increases antimicrobial activity. Hand hygieneists with a minimum of 60 to 95% of alcohol kill germs with efficiency.
Alcohol-based hygienics kill bacteria, multi-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol-based hygieneists containing 70% of alcohol kill 99.97% (reduction of 3.5 logarithms, similar to 35 dropouts) of the bacteria in their hands, 30 seconds after their application and 99.99% to 99.99% (reduction of 4 to 5 logarithms) of the bacteria in their hands 1 minute after their application. Hand hygieneists are more effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Hand-based alcohol-based hygieneists are almost completely ineffective against the norovirus virus (or Norwalk), the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis. Antiseptics for hands or alcohol-based hygieneists can be used to wash or cover both hands well.
The back and palms of the hands, between their fingers and their limbs are crushed for approximately 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel is dry.
The fingertips should also be thoroughly washed, being rubbed with both palms. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing with hand healers, especially when hands are visually dirty.
The increasing use of these agents is based on their ease of use and rapid extermination against microorganisms; however, they should not replace the proper washing of the hands unless soap and water are available.
The frequent use of alcohol-based hand hygiene agents may lead to skin redistribution, unless emulsifiers and/or skin moisturizers are added to the formula.
The effect of alcohol drying may be reduced or eliminated by the addition of glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, hand-to-hand hygiene containing emolytes caused significantly less irritation and dryness in the skin than antimicrobial soaps or detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or the additives present in hand-based alcohol-based hygiene rarely occur.
The lower tendency to cause irritative contact dermatitis became an attractive compared to washing hands with water and soap.
Despite its effectiveness, non-aquatic base agents do not clean the hands of organic matter, they just disinfect them.
That is why hand hygieneists are not as effective as water and soap for the prevention of the spread of many pathogens, since pathogens are still in their hands.
The effectiveness of handless alcoholics is extremely dependent on substances and formulation, and historically it has remained very watery of alcohol and alcohol-based healthists.
More recently, formulations using Benzalconium chloride revealed continuous and cumulative antimicrobial action after application, unlike alcohol, which revealed its reduced efficacy after repeated use, probably due to the increasing adverse reactions in the skin.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford a soapette and instead use ash or land.
Grey or soil can be more effective than pure water, but can be less effective than soap.
One concern is that if soil or ashes are contaminated with microorganisms, the spread of the disease may increase rather than decrease.
Like soap, ashes are also a disinfectant, since in contact with water it forms an alkaline solution.
WHO recommends ashes and sand as an alternative to soap when there is no soap.
The correct technique for hand washing recommended by the U.S. Disease Control Centre to prevent disease transmission includes the following steps:
Swallow your hands with cold or hot running water.
It is recommended that running water as fixed washbasins may be contaminated, while the water temperature does not appear to be relevant.
Swallow your hands, frying them with a generous amount of soap, including the back of your hands, the space between your fingers and under your nails.
The soap removes the germs from the skin, and studies reveal that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when soap is used instead of clean water.
Squeeze for at least 20 seconds.
The act of squeezing generates friction, which helps to remove the germs of the skin, and squeezing for a longer time removes more germs.
Swallow well with running water.
Washing on a foot can recontaminate your hands.
Dry with a dry towel or let dry in the open air.
Wet or wet hands are more easily recontaminated. The most commonly forgotten areas are thumbs, wrists, areas between fingers and under nails.
Artificial and loose enamels can cover microorganisms.
moisturizing lotion is often recommended to keep the hands hydrated; dry skin can cause skin lesions capable of increasing the risk of transmission of infection.
Several low-cost options can be made to facilitate hand washing where there is no running water and/or soap, for example, to pour water from a gallon or cook with appropriate roots and/or use ashes if necessary in developing countries. In situations with limited water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to store water, such as "improvised towers" and other low-cost options.
An improvised tournament is a simple technology that uses a chain-suspended jar, and a foot-screwing to clear a small amount of water in the hands and a sand bar.
The effective drying of hands is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but there is a discussion about the most effective way to drying in public baths.
A growing volume of research suggests that toilet paper is much more hygienic than hand dryers found in many bathrooms.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, and sponsored by the Toalha paper industry, European Tissue Symposium, to compare the levels of hygiene presented by the Toalha paper, hand dryers with warm air and the most modern hand dryers with air jet.
After washing and drying hands with hot air dryer, the total number of bacteria was considered, on average, 194% higher in the palm area close to the fingers and 254% higher in the rest of the palm.
Drying with air jet dryers caused an increase in the total number of bacteria, on average, of 42% in the palm area close to the fingers and about 15% in the rest of the palm.
After washing and drying hands with toilet paper, the total number of bacteria was reduced on average by up to 76% in the palm area near the fingers and up to 77% in the rest of the palm. Researchers also conducted tests to determine whether there was a potential cross-contamination between other users and the bathroom environment as a result of each type of drying method.
The air jet dryer, which projectes air out of the unit at specified speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), was able to expel microorganisms from the hands and the unit by potentially contaminating other users of the bathroom and the environment up to 2 meters away.
The use of hot-air hand dryer spreads microorganisms up to 0.25 meters of the dryer.
The toilet papers did not present a significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Product and Umwelt, different methods for drying the hands were evaluated.
The following changes in bacterial count after drying the hands were observed:
There are many manufacturers of different hand dryers, and hand dryers were compared to drying with toilet paper.
Washing hands with hand-washed washers is an alternative to lack of soap and water during travel.
Hand-to-hand hygiene should contain at least 60% of alcohol.
The clinical wash of the hands became mandatory much after Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing diseases in the hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind the hospital team of washing hands when they forget.
One study found that infection rates decreased with their use.
The clinical washing of the hands is for a minimum of 15 seconds, using generous amounts of soap and water or gel to savor and rub all parts of the hands.
The hands should be rubbed simultaneously with the interlocking of the fingers.
If there are residues under the nails, a brush can be used to remove them.
As germs can stay in the water in their hands, it is important to swallow well and dry with a clean towel.
After drying, the toilet paper must be used to close the tower (and open the door if necessary).
This avoids hand contamination by these surfaces.
The aim of hand washing in the medical care environment is to remove pathogen microorganisms ("germes") and avoid transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the lack of hand washing remains at unacceptable levels in most medical environments, with a large number of doctors and nurses forgetting to wash their hands constantly before touching patients, thus transmitting microorganisms.
One study revealed that proper hand washing and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of blood flow infections related to catheter in 66 percent. The World Health Organization published a bulletin demonstrating the pattern of hand washing and friction in the health system sectors.
The organization's hand hygiene orientation project can also be found on this site for comments.
An applicable review was carried out by Whitby et al.
Commercial devices may measure and validate hand hygiene if the demonstration of regulatory compliance is required.
The World Health Organization defines "Five moments" for hand washing:
after exposure to body/blood fluids
before an ascetic task, and
the addition of antiseptic chemicals to the soapet (medical or antimicrobial soaps) gives an exterminating action to a hand washing agent.
Such exterminating action may be desirable before performing surgery or in situations where antibiotics-resistant organisms are predominant. To "clean" hands for a surgical operation it is necessary to have a tournament that can be opened and closed without touching hands, some chlorhexidine or iodine antiseptics, sterilized towels to dry hands after washing, and a sterilized brush for cleaning and other sterilized tools for cleaning under the nails.
All jewelry must be removed.
This procedure requires the washing of hands and forearms up to the elbows, usually 2-6 minutes.
A very long time of cleaning (10 minutes) is not necessary.
At the time of washing, the water in the forearms must not flow into the hands.
After washing the hands be finished, the hands are rubbed with a sterilized towel and the surgical bat is dressed.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for your hands before and after treating a sick person.
For the control of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that there was a greater benefit of hand cleaning in the first 20% of washing, and a small additional benefit was obtained when the rate of cleaning exceeded 35%.
Wash with soap more than triples the rate of infectious bacterial diseases transmitted to food compared to washing with an antibacterial soapet. Comparing hand hygiene with an alcohol-based solution with hand washing with an antibacterial soap for an average time of 30 seconds for each revealed that the hand hygiene on alcohol-based alcohol reduced bacterial contamination by 26% to more than an antibacterial soapet.
However, soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based hand healers to reduce influenza A virus, H1N1, and bottlenecks of Clostridium hard in the hands. The interventions to increase hand hygiene in hospital environments may involve the awareness of the team on hand washing, increased availability of hand healers on the basis of alcohol and verbal warnings and written warnings to the team.
There is a need for more research on which interventions are more effective in different health institutions.
In developing countries, washing hands with soap is considered an essential economically viable tool for good health and even better nutrition.
However, the absence of reliable water sources, soap or resources for washing hands in people's homes, schools and workplaces makes this a challenge for the conquest of the universal practice of washing hands.
For example, in most rural Africa, hand washing tournaments near any public or private bathroom are rare, although there are cheap options for the construction of hand washing stations.
However, low hand washing rates may instead be the result of rooted habits rather than of the absence of soap and water.
The incentive and defence of hand washing with soap can influence political decisions, lead to awareness of the benefits of hand washing and cause a long-term change in behaviour of the population.
For this to work effectively, monitoring and evaluation are required.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches are effective for increasing hand washing in low- and medium-income countries, while social marketing campaigns are less effective. An example for promoting hand washing in schools is UNICEF's "Three-Star Approach" that encourages schools to take simple and cheap steps to ensure students wash their hands with soap, among other hygiene requirements.
When a minimum level is reached, schools can go from one to three maximum stars.
Construction of hand-washing stations can be part of the promotional hand-washing campaigns carried out to reduce diseases and child mortality.
The world day for hand washing is another example of awareness campaign that tries to achieve a change in habit. As a result of the 2019-2020 crown virus pandemic, UNICEF has published the adoption of an emoji for hand washing.
Few studies considered the overall cost/benefit ratio of hand washing in developing countries in relation to the DALY classification.
However, an analysis suggests that promoting the washing of hands with soap is significantly more profitable than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of washing hands for human health — especially for people in vulnerable circumstances such as mothers who have just given to the light or wounded soldiers in hospitals — was initially recognized in the mid-19th century by two precursors of hand hygiene: Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the English "founder of modern nursing".
At that time, people still believed that the infections were caused by unpleasant odors called myasmas.
In the 1980s, outbreaks of food origin and infections associated with health care led the United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention to more actively encourage hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infections.
The outbreak of swine influenza in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 have led to increased awareness in many countries of the importance of washing hands with soap to protect themselves from such infectious diseases.
For example, posters with "techniques for the proper washing of hands" were hung close to the feet for washing of hands in public bathrooms and in bathrooms of offices and airports in Germany.
The expression "to wash hands" means to declare the reluctance to take responsibility or to be convivial with something.
It originates from the biblical passage in Matthew, where Pontius Pilate washed his hands of the decision to cross Jesus Christ, but became a more general use phrase in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to wash her hands compulsively in an attempt to clean up an imaginary stain, representing her guilty conscience regarding the crimes she had committed and led her husband to commit.
It was also verified that people tend to wash their hands more often than others after remembering or presenting anti-ethical acts, and usually give more importance to hand washing equipment.
Moreover, those who can wash their hands after such a vision are less likely to perform other "cleaning" compensatory acts such as volunteering.
Religions prescribe the washing of hands for hygienic and symbolic purposes. The symbolic washing of hands, using water, but not soap, to wash hands is part of a ritual washing of hands characteristic in many religions, including Baha'í faith, Hinduism, tevilah and netilat yadayim in Judaism, the washing of Christianity, and ablution in Islam. Religions also indicate the hygienic washing of hands, especially after some actions.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam authorize the washing of hands after the use of the bathroom.
And Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism and Islam allow the washing of hands before and after meals.
Hazard control at the workplace for COVID-19
Hazard control at work for COVID-19 is the application of health and safety methodologies at work for risk control for the prevention of coronavirus disease in 2019 (COVID-19).
Appropriate risk controls at the workplace depend on the workplace and the work itself, based on the risk assessment of the exposure sources, the severity of the disease in the community, and the risk factors of individual workers, which may be vulnerable to the contraction of COVID-19.
According to the Department of Health and Safety at Work (OSHA), the functions with a lower risk of exposure have minimal occupational contact with the public and other workmates, for which basic measures for infection prevention are recommended, including washing hands, encouraging staff to stay at home if they are sick, keeping a respiratory label and routine of cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
Functions with a mean risk of exposure include those requiring frequent or direct contact with persons who are not known to be contaminated or suspected of contamination by COVID-19, but may be infected due to current Community transmission or having traveled abroad.
This includes workers who keep in touch with the general public, such as in schools, high-density working environments, and in the wholesale market.
Risk controls for this group, in addition to the basic prevention measures for infection, include ventilation using high-efficiency air filters, protective coatings and the provision of individual protection equipment if a person is confirmed with COVID-19.
OSHA considers that workers in the health and necroterium system who are exposed to people with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 are at high risk of exposure, which increases the risk of exposure to very high if workers perform procedures in people with confirmed COVID-19 or suspected generation of aerosols and collect or handle specimens of these persons.
Appropriate hazard controls for these workers include engineering controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and individual protection equipment suitable for the work performed.
The epidemic of COVID-19 can have several effects on the workplace.
Workers may leave work because they are sick, because they have to look after other people or because of a possible exposure.
Trade patterns may change, in terms of which products are in demand as well as the means of purchasing these products (such as buying out of peak time or by delivery or drive-thru services.
Finally, sending items from areas seriously affected by COVID-19 can be interrupted. A plan of action and preparation for infectious disease can be used to guide protective actions.
The plans address the risk levels associated with the various workplaces and tasks, including exposure sources, risk factors occurring at home and in the community, and risk factors for individual workers such as advanced age or chronic medical conditions.
They also define the controls necessary to address these risks, and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of epidemics.
Action and preparation plans for infectious diseases may be subject to national or regional recommendations.
The objectives of action for an epidemic include reducing the transmission among employees, protecting people who are at greater risk of developing health complications, maintaining business operations and minimising the adverse effects on other entities in supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community, where the company is located, affects the actions taken.
The hierarchy of hazard controls is a widely used structure in health and safety of work to group the hazard controls by efficiency.
When the dangers of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administrative controls and, finally, individual protective equipment.
Engineering controls involve the isolation of workers from work-related hazards, regardless of the employee's behaviour, and may be the most economical implementation solution.
Engineering controls are changes in the labour policy or procedures that require the worker's or employer's action.
Individual protection equipment (EPI) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but can help prevent certain exposures.
All types of EPI shall be selected on the basis of the hazard to the worker, adjusted appropriately as necessary (e.g. breathers), used in an appropriate and continuous manner, inspected regularly, stored and replaced as necessary, and removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of appropriately to avoid contamination.
According to the Department of Health and Safety at Work of the United States (OSHA), low-risk work has minimal occupational contact with the public and other work colleagues.
Basic prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include frequent and methiculous washing of the hands, incentives for workers to stay at home if they are sick and the use of the respiratory label, including clogging and coughing, preparation of containers for lenses and for common garbage, preparation for teleworking or for scaled shifts, if necessary, the disincentive of the use of tools and equipment of other workers and the maintenance of a routine of cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
The rapid identification and isolation of potentially infected individuals is an essential step in the protection of workers, customers, visitors and other people at the workplace.
The United States Disease Control and Prevention Centre (CDC) recommends that employees who have acute respiratory disease symptoms remain at home until they have no more fever, fever signs or any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without using medication to reduce the fever or relief of other symptoms, and also recommends that sickness leave policies be flexible, allow employees to stay at home to care for a sick member of the family, and that they have knowledge of these policies.
According to OSHA, work at average risk of exposure includes those who require frequent or direct contact of 6 feet (1.8 m) with people who are not known whether they are confirmed or suspected with COVID-19, but may be infected by SARS-CoV-2 due to the current Community transmission at the site of the company, or because the individual has a recent history of travel abroad, in a country with high transmission of COVID-19.
These include workers who have contact with the general public as in schools, high-density working environments and some high-volume retail stores. Engineering checks for this group and for higher-risk groups include installation of high-efficiency air filters, expansion of ventilation, installation of physical barriers, such as the establishment of transparent plastic toilets and installation of a drive-thru window for customer service. Administrative checks for this group and higher-risk groups include the incentives for workers to stay at home, the replacement of meetings for participants by virtual communication, establishment of extended turns, cancellation of non-essential travels for sites with current epidemic of COVID-19, development of communication plans, termination, including a forum to respond to the doubts of the employees, the removal of workers, the establishment of manuals and removal of hospitals.
Workers in this risk group rarely need respirators.
If a person becomes sick on a plane, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include the isolation of the patient from the other person for a distance of 6 feet, with the appointment of a crew member to serve the patient and offer her a facial mask, or ask the patient to cover the mouth and nose with languids by coughing or breathing.
The crew should use removable medical gloves when using a patient or touching potentially contaminated body fluids or surfaces and possibly additional individual protection equipment if the patient has fever, persistent cough or difficulty breathing.
Luggage and other waste items should be disposed of in a bag for biological risk residues, and contaminated surfaces should then be cleaned and disinfected. For commercial transport, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, risk controls include delaying travel by the patient, self-insulation and immediate communication to the medical centre on board if someone has fever or other symptoms during the journey.
The ideal is that there is medical follow-up in the cabin of the isolated person. For schools and childcare centres, the CDC recommends temporary closure for cleaning and disinfection if an infected person was present in the building, regardless of the spread of the virus in the community.
When there is a minimum Community transmission to moderate, social distance strategies can be implemented, such as cancellation of field trips, assemblies, and other large groups such as physical or coral education classes, or meals in a lanchonet, increasing the space between tables, times of arrival and more stringent departure, limiting non-essential visitors and using a separate place of health care for children with flu symptoms.
When there is a significant transmission in the local community, in addition to social exclusion strategies, prolonged school exemptions can be considered. For law enforcement authorities carrying out daily activities, the risk to immediate health is considered low by the CDC.
It is recommended that police officers who contact individuals suspected of COVID-19 or confirmed disease follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including the use of appropriate individual protective equipment.
If the direct contact occurs during the arrest, workers must clean and disinfect their belt and other accessories before using them again using a common household cleaning spray or cloth and follow the standard operating procedures for the storage and disposal of used EPI and for the storage and washing of clothes.
OSHA considers certain health and necroterium workers to be in high or very high risk categories.
High-risk functions include the delivery of medicines, medical care, laboratories and medical transport workers, who are exposed to patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19.
The risk of exposure becomes very high if workers perform aerosol generation procedures in patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, or collect or handle specimens of these patients.
Aerosol generation procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and examinations or invasive collection of specimens.
Work in high-exposure necroteriums includes workers involved with the preparation of human bodies with confirmed COVID-19 or suspected of disease at the time of their death; the risk of exposure becomes very high if they perform autopsy. Additional engineering controls for these risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with confirmed COVID-19 or suspected of disease, including when aerosol generator procedures are performed.
Specialized ventilation of negative pressure may be appropriate in some necroterium scenarios and in the health area.
Specimens should be handled with care of Level 3 biosafety.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients entering the hospital be separated in two different waiting areas depending on whether they are a suspected case for COVID-19. In addition to other EPIs, OSHA recommends respiratory respirators for professionals working at a distance of 6 feet from patients with confirmation or suspicion of infection by SARS-CoV-2, and for professionals conducting aerosol generation procedures.
In the United States, facial respirators with N95 particulate filtering, approved by NIOSH or higher quality respirators, should be used in the context of a comprehensive and written respiratory protection program that includes adjustments, training and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide protection and improve the worker’s comfort. WHO does not recommend the use of monkeys, since COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, and is not transmitted by non-respiratory body fluids.
WHO recommends only one surgical mask for screening staff at the point of entry.
For professionals who collect respiratory specimens, treat or transport patients with COVID-19 without aerosol generation procedures, WHO recommends a surgical mask, protective or facial glasses, surgical avental and gloves.
If an aerosol generation procedure is carried out, the surgical mask shall be replaced by an N95 or FFP2 breather.
Since the overall supply of EPIs is insufficient, WHO recommends minimising the need for EPIs through telemedicine, physical barriers such as clear windows, allowing only those involved in direct care to patients to enter a coma with a patient with COVID-19, using only the necessary EPI for the specific task, continuous use of the same breather without removing it while treating several patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the chain of supply of EPI and destimulating the use of masks by asymptomatic individuals.

ASSOCIATION: [Covid-19] Attenuation of problems and preparation for the future
Date/Date of dispatch: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
LICENCE: CC0: No rights reserved
We are in unusual circumstances this month.
The epidemic of COVID-19 is something that makes our global human connection clear and our responsibilities towards the other.
Its challenges have no precedents, but we know that our best actions go together with the global empathy, cooperation and the creation of communities, which are the foundations of this organization.
Companheirism and the concern we have seen among all our colleagues through e-mails, links and conversations is a remarkable validation of the incredible human beings we have the privilege of working with.
I am very grateful and proud to have all of you as workmates.
Last week, someone shared their appreciation for our work with me.
This person reminded me of how important it is for the world to be able to access Wikipedia now, and how powerful a symbol this essential resource continues online and available to everyone.
Your work makes it possible, because you keep the workplaces active, pay our workmates and keep the safety of our communities.
The world needs the information Wikipedia provides, more than ever.
This is a moment when not only what we do but how we do it will have a significant impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and its role in it, we will make important adjustments to the way we work with each other, starting next week.
Adjustments to our work and schedules
As Robyn mentioned earlier, Team C met last night to discuss our approach and schedules for the next days and months.
At this meeting, we consider what we think is an appropriate action to which we are experiencing and the best way to keep the organisation sustainable during this period.
We want to end the stress and support our mission in the long term.
If you need to leave for a while, you have no problem.
For all employees, service providers and contract workers:
our daily work expectations will be 4 hours, or 20 hours a week, until otherwise agreed.
We're not declaring a holiday. If you can work on the normal schedule, it can be useful for our mission.
However, the world is unpredictable now, and if you need to take care of loved ones, buy maintenance or go to the doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We're not monitoring your schedules.
If you're sick, don't work.
That rule should not be expressed, but we have decided to declare it.
You do not need to be certified or paid. Just inform your manager to help your team review the schedule and schedules to ensure that the key areas of the work are handled.
(If you are diagnosed with COVID-19, inform Bryan of the training and certification sector so that its sector can help you and ensure that your situation receives appropriate management attention).
The staff working per hour will receive the full payment.
We have said that before, and we are committed to honouring our commitment to our employers and employees who work per hour.
All will receive their salaries based on their normal work record under normal circumstances.
Salaries whether you are sick or unable to work.
If you want to work, we give total support to you.
Many people see work as a way to channel stress due to the current situation in the world.
The work we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially in times like these.
Remembering that your well-being is more important.
We just ask you to communicate with your manager, so that we know what to expect and can help the activities properly.
Some functions are considered essential.
There are activities that we must continue to perform.
The sites, HR, Reliability and Security and Funding Engineering teams (including others) carry out essential activities that may need additional support.
We will start a process with all departments to evaluate the current objectives and change our focus to support what is essential to our mission.
There is a lot to be done for all of us, and we will focus our efforts on the most essential projects.
Disabling now will not harm us in the future.
We don't intend to "double work to recover lost time" after the pandemic has ended.
You will not be expected to work extra hours to meet deadlines that are now impracticable.
We accept that the circumstances have changed, and we will work to define new targets and deadlines, as appropriate.
What will happen to the annual Planning?
To adjust to our new reality and expectations of working hours per day, we intend to adjust the timetable for the delivery of our annual plan 2020-2021.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan, which will provide more time for the budget, and that employees give priority to essential work, personal care and care for loved ones, while we accommodate those who need or want to work on a reduced day in the coming weeks.
The length of the schedule greatly reduces the current planning workload and pressure across the organization.
We will present our proposal to the board next week and update representatives and teams on the next steps as soon as we have confirmation.
We thank the Annual Planning Team for its leadership in this process.
Office status, exhibition and cleaning
Last week, we learned that one of our colleagues from São Francisco may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
In view of this situation, by caution, we use an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces in the office of San Francisco.
They used a special antiviral solution for hospitals to disinfect all the surfaces, as well as the entrance sajun and all the lifts that give access to our walk.
The building is using its own care duty protocol using products that are safe for its participants.
We are relieved by the fact that the office will be properly prepared for when we decide to return.
Our Washington office is located in a WeWork, which shared its protocol with us and with all Washington officials.
Last week, our office in Washington changed to a completely remote configuration, in line with the guide shared with St. Francis.
As some of our colleagues in New York know, we are also discussing the location of an office in Brooklyn.
These discussions continue to take place, but they may suffer a delay.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our colleagues who have been working remotely for a long time know that it can be an adjustment, and they would like to offer some advice:
They shall limit the duration of meetings to a maximum of one or two hours.
If longer-term sessions are necessary, they are considered to be divided into several days.
They define the meeting, have a programming and send material to read in advance.
Use videos as a standard, with tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate real-time collaboration and connection.
They have a leader to facilitate meetings, someone to monitor the questions in the chat and the list of participants, and someone to help make notes (or collaborative notes).
Send an e-mail to the technical support if you need comfortable earphones.
Use your emergency aid to buy chains.
Participate in the #remotes channel to talk to your colleagues about remote work
The HR Operations Team is researching ergonomics guides in the context of the webinar to help increase remote work in the Foundation.
Last week, we asked all community aid recipients to cancel public events funded by Wikimedia, such as the edition marathons, until WHO declared the end of the pandemic.
We warned you that we understood that our request for cancellation and other restrictions could make it impossible to complete their agreed grant activities, and that no one would be punished for extending or modifying their goals.
In the coming week, we will continue with additional guidance on Wikimania and other regional and thematic conferences for the community.
The general feeling in the world community seems to be of sadness with paralysis, but also of relief with the clarity and ability to keep the focus on their own communities, on Wikimedia and in other situations.
The communication resource team is working on creating a page on Meta-Wiki to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and receive our communications to it.
Keeping updated on issues related to COVID-19
We will send an invitation to your calendars for the next Thursday at 14:00 UTC/ 07:00 PT for a special meeting with the staff.
We will use this time to share additional updates, answer your questions and spend some time connecting with each other.
We're in this together and we're gonna help with what we need.
Meanwhile, you can continue to find the information of this e-mail and all other information related to COVID-19 on the company's wiki.
The communication resource team will update these pages and all information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with officials who live in countries that are significantly affected today.
If you have any question about travel, events, a main workflow, or the coverage challenge, or anything else you may need help with, do not stop noticing it and working with the communication resource team.
We are here to help provide support and collaboration as necessary.
If you have a confidential or sensitive matter, send an e-mail to Bryan Judah, Director of Global Operations of HR.
None of these changes should be seen as abandonment of our work and obligations.
They are, however, a recognition that, at this point, our work and our obligations will probably need to be adapted in a way that we have not adapted in the past.
These are the steps that we believe are needed as support at this time, so that we can continue working, providing our movement with the support they need and providing the world with the service it depends on.
Our planned work will be ours when the time comes.
Meanwhile, it is time to support one another and create space for the important work that will be done in the weeks, and probably next months.
We need all of you to do this, so we need everyone to take care of yourself and your family so that they are in their best condition when necessary.
Wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, a communications resource team (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S), and the rest of the leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robin A, Ryan M and Toby N).
Angiotensin type 2 (ECA2) converting enzyme is an enzyme attached to the outer surface (cell membranes) of the cells of the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ECA2 neutralizes the activity of the related angiotensin converting enzyme (ECA) by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and raising Ang (1-7), becoming a promising medicine for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ECA2 also acts as an entry point in the cells for some coronavirus.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hECA2.
The type 2 angiotensin convertor enzyme is a metaloenzyme containing zinc located on the endothelial surface and other cells.
The ECA2 protein contains a peptide M2 N-terminal domain and a C-terminal domain transporter of amino acids and collectrine in the renal system.
ECA2 is a single-pass type 1 membrane protein with its enzymatically active domain exposed to the surface of the cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ECA2 is bonded from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as sheddase, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and finally excreted into the urine.
ECA2 is present in many organs: ECA2 is attached to the cell membrane of the main pulmonary alveolar cells of type II, enterocytes of the thin intestine, arterial endothelial cells and veins and arterial smooth muscle cells in most organs.
The expression of the ECA2 mRNA is also found in the brain cortex, strutted body, hypothalamus, and brain trunk.
The main function of the ECA2 is to act as a counterweight for the ECA.
ECA stimulates Type I angiotensin hormone in Type II angiotensin causing vasoconstriction.
ECA2 in turn stimulates phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-He-Pro-Phe) and hydrolysis in angiotensin vasodilator (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-Gist-Pro-OH).
ECA2 also raises various other peptides, including [des-Arg9]- bradycin, apelin, neurotensin, dinorphine A, and grelline.
ECA2 also regulates the transport by the membrane of the neutral amino acid carrier SLC6A19 and was involved in Hartnup’s disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ECA2 acts as the main point of entry into the cells for some coronavirus including HCV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, the binding of the spice protein S1 from SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 to the enzyme domain of ECA2 on the cell surface results in endocytosis and transplantation of the virus and enzyme into endosoms located within cells.
This entry process also requires the preparation of protein S by the serum-protease host TMPRSS2, whose inhibition is under investigation as a potential therapy. This led some to raise the hypothesis that reducing ECA levels2, in cells, may help in the fight against infection.
However, several professional companies and regulators recommended to continue with the inhibitory pattern of ECA and ARB therapy.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012 found that "the use of ECA inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia in relation to controls".
In addition, "the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients treated with ECA inhibitors who presented a high risk of contracting pneumonia, especially those with AVC and heart failure.
The use of ECA inhibitors was also associated with the reduction of pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were less robust than the overall risk of pneumonia."
It is believed that human recombinant ECA2 (rhACE2) is a new therapy for acute pulmonary injury, and it appeared to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in pigs with an acute respiratory distress syndrome induced by lipopolysaccharide.
The half-life of rhACE2 in human beings is approximately 10 hours and the onset of action is 30 minutes after the temporal evolution of the 24 hour effects.
Many findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising medicine for those with intolerance to classical renin-angiotensin inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or in diseases in which angiotensin II is high in circulation. Infused rhACE2 has been evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Applications for COVID-19 are mobile software applications to help monitoring in response to coronary pandemic 2019-2020, i.e. the process of identifying people ("contacts") that may have come into contact with infected individuals.
Numerous applications have been developed or proposed, with official government support in some territories and jurisdictions.
Several structures to create contact monitoring applications were developed.
Privacy issues were raised, especially on systems based on the tracking of the geographical location of the users of the application.
Less intrusive alternatives include the use of Bluetooth signals to record the user's proximity to other cells.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would integrate functionality to support such Bluetooth-based applications directly to their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, together with Alipay, implemented an application that allows citizens to verify whether they were in contact with a person carrying COVID-19.
It is in use in over 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, an application called TraceTogether is being used.
The application was developed by the local IT community, released as an open source and will be given to the government. North Macedonia launched the "StopKorona!", an application based on Bluetooth to track exposure to potentially infected people and provide a quick response to health authorities.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communication and Technology and by the Ministry of Health.
Since 14 April 2020, the app has been waiting for approval by Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government declared that the contact tracking application was in an advanced stage of development and would be available for distribution in weeks.
Australia and New Zealand provide applications based on the Singapore TraceTogether application and the BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to implement a geographical delimitation application for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 living in Moscow, designed to ensure that they do not leave home.
Ross Anderson, professor of safety engineering at Cambridge University, listed a number of potential practical problems with application-based systems, including false positives and the potential lack of effectiveness if the application's acceptance is limited to only a small portion of the population.
In response to concerns about the spread of false or harmful "coronavirus" applications, Apple sets limits for the types of organizations that can add applications related to the coronavirus to its App Store, limiting them only to "official" or otherwise respected organizations.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy defenders expressed their concern about the implications of mass surveillance using coronavirus applications, especially if the surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be dismantled when the threat has passed.
International Anistia and more than 100 other organizations have issued a communication requesting limits for this kind of surveillance.
The organisations declared eight conditions for government projects:
surveillance should be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
extensions of monitoring and surveillance should have suspension clauses;
the use of data should be limited for the purposes of COVID-19;
the security and anonymity of the data should be protected and presented as protected on the basis of evidence;
digital surveillance should avoid the deterioration of discrimination and marginalisation;
any data sharing with third parties should be provided for by law;
there should be safeguards against abuse and citizens' rights to respond to abuse;
the significant participation of all "relevant interested parties" would be required, including those of experts in public health and marginalized groups. The Chaos Computer Club (CCC) of Germany and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter without Borders) (RSF) also published checklists.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple intends to deal with the persistent surveillance problem by removing the tracking mechanism of your operating device systems when it is no longer necessary.
Some countries used network-based location tracking instead of applications, eliminating the need to download an application and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking was approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data have considerable potential privacy problems.
However, not all systems with central servers need access to personal location data; a series of systems that preserve privacy were created to use central servers only for intercom (see section below).
In South Korea, an application-based system was used to run the contact tracking.
Instead of using an exclusive application, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including data on tracking mobile devices and transaction data with a card, combining them to generate warnings via text messages to potentially infected individuals.
In addition to using this information to alert potential interlocutors, the government has also made publicly available location information, which is allowed due to the changes in the confidentiality laws of the information after the outbreak of MERS in the country.
This information is available to the public through a number of applications and sites. Countries, including Germany, consider using both the privacy and centralized system.
By 6 April 2020, the details had not yet been disclosed.
The tracking of contact preserving privacy is a well-defined concept, with a significant body of scientific bibliography raising to, at least, 2013. Since 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups have worked on solutions that respect privacy, with the use of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to record the proximity of one user to other mobile devices.
However, the PEPP-PT is a coordination effort covering centralized and decentralized approaches, and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include the Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracking (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN, fka Contact Event Numbers, CEN) Privacy Sensitive Protocols and Mechanisms for Mobile Contact Tracking (PACT) and others.
In these protocols, identifiable personal data never comes out of the device, and any combination is made on the device.
The Privacy Group at MIT Media Lab has developed Safe Paths, a platform for the use of privacy conservation techniques during the collection and use of location data or cross-roads data to track the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on the research from the technical publication "Applications play dirty: maintaining personal privacy in an epidemic" released in March 2020. Another similar effort is the SafeTrace platform of Enigma MPC, a push that develops privacy technologies and originally founded on the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and responsible ones, without compromising the privacy of these data.
On 5 April 2020, the TCN Global Coalition was founded by groups that joined around what was essentially the same approach and largely with protocol overlap, with the aim of reducing fragmentation, and allowing the global interoperability of alert and tracking applications, a key aspect of the achievement of general adoption.
On 9 April 2020, the Government of Singapore announced that the BlueTrace Protocol, used by the official application of the government, became an open source.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple, companies that control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative for contact tracking, in which they claimed to preserve privacy, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and encryption for privacy preservation.
They have also published specifications of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system provides for implementation in three stages:
development of tools to allow government to create official coronavirus tracking applications by preserving privacy
integration of this functionality directly into iOS and Android; Google and Apple plan to face persistent and assumed surveillance problems by first distributing the system by updating operating systems, and later removing it in the same way as the threat ends.
Medicinal product subject to medical prescription (also known as a drug re-proposal, re-perfiling, re-allocation or therapeutic substitution) is the re-proposal of a medicinal product approved for the treatment of a medical condition or disease other than that for which it was originally developed.
This is one of the scientific research lines that are currently being adopted to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other research directions include the development of a convalescent plasma transfusion and vaccine for COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 drugable proteins, each with multiple binding points.
Analysis of these binding points provides the reasonable development of effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
Among the most important targets of SARS-CoV-2 are papain-like protease, RNA polymerase dependent on RNA, helicase, S protein and ADP ribophosphate.
Hussein A. A., et al., studied several candidate compounds that later improved and analyzed their structural similarities with more similar approved drugs in order to accelerate the development of a potent drug against SARS-CoV-2 in their preclinical study to be recommended for a clinical study design.
Chloroquine is a medicine against malaria that is also used against some autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs studied as part of the Solidarity clinical trial.
The governor of New York Andrew Cuomo announced that tests with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine of the state of New York would begin on 24 March. On 28 March, the FDA authorised the use of hydroxychloroquine sulphate and chloroquine phosphate by means of an Emergency Use Authorisation (EUU).
The treatment was not approved by the FDA clinical trial process and is authorised by the EU only as experimental treatment for emergency use in hospitalized patients who cannot receive treatment in a clinical trial.
The CDC said that "the use, dose or duration of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" has not yet been established.
Doctors said they're using the drug when "there's no other option".
In Istanbul, a Turkish research team is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Major studies are underway at Duke University and Oxford University.
The NYU Langone School of Medicine is conducting a safety and efficacy study on the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen have shown that favipiravir was "clearly effective".
In Shenzhen, 35 patients tested negative within 4 days on average, while the duration of the disease in the 45 patients who did not receive it was 11 days.
In a study conducted in Wuhan with 240 patients with pneumonia, half were treated with favipiravir, and half were treated with umifenovir.
The Italian Pharmaceutical Agency reminded the population that the evidence to base the medicine is scarce and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy Japan's medicine to stock it and use the army to deliver it to university hospitals, where it would be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has created openings for Trump administration on the purchase of the medicine. The medicine may be less effective in serious cases of the disease when the virus has already multiplied.
Your use may not be safe for pregnant women or pregnant women trying to get pregnant.
A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of the antivirals lopinavir and ritonavir, concluded that "no benefit has been observed".
The drugs were developed to inhibit the replication of HIV by binding to protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify drugs to find a compound that binds to SARS-CoV-2 protease. There are criticisms in the scientific community about directing resources to recommend drugs developed specifically for HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international solidarity test.
Reddesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections. Gilead Sciences discovered after remdesivir presented antiviral activity in vitro against wire, pneumonia, paramix and coronavirus.
One of the problems with antiviral treatment is resistance developed by mutations, which may cause more serious transmissions or diseases.
Some initial pre-test studies suggest that reddesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. There are several ongoing clinical trials, including two conducted by University Hospitals in Cleveland, one for people with moderate disease and one for those with more serious disease.
There are three clinical trials with intravenous vitamin C occurring in people hospitalized and seriously ill with COVID-19: two of them are controlled by placebo (in China and Canada), while the other one does not have control group (Italy).
The state of New York began testing with azithromycin, an antibiotic, on 24 March 2020.
Japan's National Center for Health and Global Medicine (NCGM) is planning a clinical test of Alvesco (cyclesonida), by Teijin, which is an inhalable corticosteroid for asthma. The goal is to treat pre-symptomatic patients infected with the new coronavirus.
Phase II of a study with a type of angiotensin 2 converting enzyme is in progress with 200 patients, to be recruited among the serious cases hospitalized in Denmark, Germany and Austria to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
Currently, researchers at the Heart Institute in Canada are investigating the function of colchicine in reducing pulmonary complications and inflammations in patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, called COLCORONA, is recruiting 6,000 adults over 40 years of age, diagnosed with COVID-19 and with mild symptoms, which did not need to be hospitalized.
Women who are breast-feeding or are not using effective contraception were not included in the pregnancy tests.
Several anticoagulants are tested in Italy.
Heparin, of low molecular weight, is being widely used in the treatment of patients, which led the Italian Medicines Agency to publish guidelines on use.
A multicentre study, with 300 patients, is analyzing the use of sodium enoxaparin in prophylaxis and therapeutic doses. The study was announced on 14 April in Italy.
Due to the fact that SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, the attention of the scientific community has been considerable to give new purpose to approved and developed antiviral medicines for the treatment of previous outbreaks such as those of MERS, SARS and the West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19, according to the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Umifenovir: Umifenovir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19, according to the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Some antibiotics have been identified as being able to receive a new purpose for the treatment of patients with COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (anti-IL-6 receptor): approved in China.
There are also tests in Italy and China. See Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
The vaccine for COVID-19 is a hypothetical vaccine against coronavirus disease in 2019 (COVID-19).
Although there is no vaccine with the clinical tests completed, there are several ongoing attempts to develop it.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said not to wait for a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, a virus causing the disease, available in less than 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates were in phase I of the safety studies in April.
The COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major spread of the outbreak occurred in 2020, leading to considerable investments and research activities for the development of a vaccine.
Several organisations are using published genomes for the development of possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
The initiative of the Innovation Coalition in Epidemic Preparation, CEPI, stated in April that the need for vaccine development is the speed, manufacturing capacity, large-scale development and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported 10 different technology platforms being researched and developing during the beginning of 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The objectives of the major platforms that have advanced for Phase I safety studies include:
nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) (phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Modern, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (phase I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologicals, adenovirus type 5 vector)
According to CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are in the initial stages of development, with 78 of them confirmed as active projects (79 according to the Milken Institute). Other 37 were announced, but with little information available to the public (considered to be planned or being designed).
A Phase I-II test performs the preliminary safety and immunogenicity test. It is typically randomized, controlled by placebo and multicentre, at the same time as determining more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III tests typically involve more participants in a control group. They test the effectiveness of the vaccine in preventing the disease while monitoring adverse effects on the ideal dose.
Of the 79 candidates for active developmental vaccine (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 had not yet received an evaluation in human beings (following preclinical research).
On January 24, 2020, in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it is investigating the potential of a vaccine with a molecular lump, which would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate an immune reaction.
On January 24, 2020, in Canada, the International Vaccines Centre (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan, I announced the beginning of work in a vaccine, with the aim of testing in human beings in 2021.

in the development and manufacture of a vaccine.
The partners subsequently announced plans for pre-clinical testing and Phase I of clinical studies in July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Ministry of Health of India announced that they are working with 11 isolates and, even at an accelerated step, would take at least between one and half years and two years to develop a vaccine.
On 12 March 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, reported the development of a particle similar to the Coronavirus under partial funding from the Canadian Institutes for Health Research.
The vaccine candidate is being researched in the laboratory, with the human tests planned for July or August 2020.
At the beginning of that week, The Guardian stated that the President of the United States, Donald Trump, offered CureVac "great sums of money for exclusive access to the Covid-19 vaccine" under protest by the German government.
On 17 March 2020, the pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech to develop together a vaccine based on mRNA.
BNT162, a candidate vaccine based on mRNA, currently in pre-clinical testing, with clinical tests expected to begin in April 2020.
In Italy on 17 March 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company announced that it would have results from preclinical tests in April 2020 and its final vaccine candidate could leave for human tests in autumn.
In France, on 19 March 2020, the Innovation Coalition for Epidemiology (CEPI) announced an investment of $4.9 million in a vaccine research consortium for COVID-19 involving the Institute Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria), and the University of Pittsburgh, leading the total investment of CEPI in the development of the vaccine for COVID-19 to $29 million.
The other CEPI investment partners for the development of the vaccine for COVID-19 are Modern, Curevac, Inovo, Novax, University of Hong Kong, University of Oxford, and University of Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health authorities announced that scientists started testing in animals of six different vaccine candidates.
The researchers at Imperial College in London announced on 20 March 2020 that they are developing an autoamplifier RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of receiving the China sequencing.
At the end of March, the Canadian government announced C$ 275 million in funding for 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against COVID-19, including several vaccine candidates in Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago and the initiatives of the University of Saskatchewan.
Almost in the same period, the Canadian government announced C$ 192 million specifically to develop the vaccine for COVID-19, with plans to establish a national "bank of vaccines" of several new vaccines that could be used if other Coronavirus outbreaks occurred.
On 2 April 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh Medical School reported the PittCoVacc test, a possible vaccine against COVID-19 in rats, declaring that "The MNA delivered vaccines from the S1 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 that produced powerful responses of specific antibodies to antigens [in the mouse] that were evident two weeks after immunization."
In Canada on 16 April 2020, the University of Waterloo Pharmacy School announced the development of a DNA-based vaccine candidate as possibly a nasal spray.
Using bacteria, DNA will be planned to replicate within a human bacteria to produce harmless particles similar to the virus, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the US government, industry and three universities pooled resources to access IBM supercomputers, combined with Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google cloud computing.
Some vaccines have heterological effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they can benefit beyond the disease she prevents.
A later randomized test in Australia is looking for 4,170 health workers.
Developing vaccines may not be safe or effective.
Initial studies to evaluate the effectiveness of the vaccine using animal-specific specimens for COVID-19, such as the ACE2-transgenic mouse, other laboratory animals and non-human primates, indicate a need for level 3 biosecurity conservation measures to manipulate live viruses, and an international coordination to ensure standard safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have already been tested in specimens of non-human animals.
In 2020, there is no cure or vaccine that protects against SARS that has proved safe and effective in humans.
According to research documents published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medications to treat SARS was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world. There is also no proven vaccine against MRS.
When MERS became predominant, it was believed that the existing SARS research could provide a useful model for the development of vaccines and therapeutic treatment against the infection of MERS-CoV.
As of March 2020, there was a measles vaccine (based on DNA) that completed phase I of clinical studies in humans, and three others in progress, all of which are virus-vectored vaccines, two with adenovoral vector (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one with MVA-vectored (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media publications promoted a conspiracy theory claiming that the virus behind COVID-19 was known and that a vaccine was already available.
The patents cited by several social media publications indicate existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other Coronavirus strains such as Coronavirus SARS.
Betacoronavirus 2019 disease (CVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a severe acute respiratory syndrome of Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhoea, throat pain, loss of breath and abdominal pain.
The time of exposure to the onset of symptoms is about 5 days, but it can vary from two to fourteen days.
Although most cases result in mild symptoms, some develop into viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases had been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568 thousand people have already been cured. The virus is spread among people mainly during direct contact, usually through drops produced by cough, spruce or speech.
Although these drops are produced when they expire, they usually fall to the ground or remain on surfaces rather than remain infectious at long distances.
People can also get infected by touching contaminated surfaces and then touch the eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is more contagious during the first 3 days after the onset of the symptoms, although the spread may be possible before the symptoms appear and in later stages of the disease. The standard diagnostic method is by reaction in the chain of polymerase of the reverse transcription in real time (rRT-PCR) of a nasopharyngeal Swab.
The use of masks is recommended for people with suspected virus and people responsible for their care.
Recommendations for the use of mask by the general population vary, where some authorities recommend non-use, some recommend use and others require use.
Currently, there is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
The local transmission of the disease was recorded in most countries in all six WHO regions.
Virus infected people may be asymptomatic or develop symptoms similar to flu, cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, pain or persistent pressure in the chest, confusion, difficulty in keeping awake, face or blue lips.
Less common, symptoms of upper respiratory tract such as spleen, nose running or throat pain can be seen.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea were observed in different percentages.
Some cases in China initially presented only open to the chest and palpitations.
In some cases, the disease may develop into pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and death.
This is the so-called incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually six days, but can vary from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop symptoms will develop them within 11.5 days of infection. Reports indicate that not all infected will develop symptoms.
The function of these asymptomatics in transmission is not yet fully known; however, a preliminary evidence suggests that they can contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of people with no symptoms is currently unknown and is being studied, and the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that 20% of all confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during their stay in the hospital.
The National Health Commission of China began to include asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on 1 April; of the 166 infections on that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
The scarf and salt can carry large viral loads.
Speaking high frees more gothics than speaking normally.
A study in Singapore found that coughing without covering your mouth can make the gouts reach 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not usually transported by air, the National Academy of Science suggested that the transmission by bioaerosol may be possible and air collectors positioned in corridors outside people's rooms contain positive samples for a viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (RCP), can generate respiratory secretions that will be aerosolized and therefore transmitted by air.
While there is concern that it may be transmitted through the faeces, it is believed that the risk is low. The virus is more contagious when people are symptomatic. Although it is possible to have transmission before the symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that although it is not completely clear the ease with which the disease is spread, a person usually infects one or two people.
Specifically, it was found that the virus was detectable for one day in paper, up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) and up to four hours in copper 99%.
This, however, depends on humidity and temperature.
Sand and detergent are also effective if they are used correctly. Products with sand degrade the lipid protective envelope of the virus, disabling it, as well as eliminating it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective. In a study conducted in Hong Kong, salt samples were collected on average two days after the start of hospitalization.
In five of the six patients, the first sample presented the highest viral load, while the sixth patient presented the highest viral load on the second day tested.
The acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus that was first isolated in three people with pneumonia who had a relationship with a group of acute respiratory diseases in Wuhan.
All features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in nature, in related coronavirus.
Outside of the human body, the virus dies in contact with domestic soap, which breaks its protective layer. SARS-CoV-2 is closely linked to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19 because the virus accesses host cells through the angiotensin 2 (ACE2) converting enzyme, which is more abundant in the lung type II alveolar cells.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called "spicula" (peplomer) to connect to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
Acute heart injury was observed in 12% of the infected people who were hospitalized in Wuhan, China, and is more frequent in severe disease.
The rate of cardiovascular symptoms is high due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease evolution, but acute myocardial injury may also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.
The ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in the cardiac function.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) was found in ICU patients with COVID-19 infections and may be related to poor prognosis. Necropsias of people who died due to COVID-19 showed diffuse alveolar damage (ADD) and inflammatory infiltrates containing lymphocytes in the lungs.
Although SARS-CoV-2 has tropism for epithelial cells of respiratory tract that express ACE2, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, it was demonstrated that the pathogenic T cells secreting GM-CSF have a correlation with the recruitment of IL-6 secretive inflammatory monocytes and severe lung pathology in patients with COVID-19.
Symcytic infiltrates have also been reported in necrosis.
WHO has published several test protocols for the disease.
The standard test method is the polymerase chain reaction via real-time reverse transcription (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually carried out in respiratory samples obtained by means of a nasopharyngeal Swab, however, a nasal Swab or catarro sample may be used.
The results are usually available within a few hours up to two days.
Blood tests may be used, but for this it is necessary to collect two blood samples with two weeks of difference and the results have little immediate value.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate a strain of coronavirus and publish their genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world could independently develop polymerase chain reaction tests (PCR) to detect virus infection.
As of 4 April 2020, antibodies (which can detect active infections and if a person has been infected in the past) were developing, but have not yet been widely used.
The experience of the Chinese with the test showed that their accuracy is between 60% and 70%.
The U.S. FDA approved the first remote laboratory test on 21 March 2020, for use at the end of that month. The diagnostic guidelines released by Hospital Zhongnan at Wuhan University suggest methods to detect infections based on clinical resources and epidemiological risk.
Opaques in dark glass multilobar bilateral with peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution are common at the beginning of the infection.
Subpleural domination, mosaic flooring (septs thickened with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation may appear as the disease progresses.
There are few data available on microscopic lesions and physiopathology of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings during autopsys are:
Macroscopy: pleurisia, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary oedema
Four types of viral pneumonia severity may be observed:
mild pneumonia: pulmonary oedema, pulmonary hyperplasia, large atypical pneumonia, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyte infiltration and formation of multinucleated giant cells
severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (ADD) with diffuse alveolar exudates.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA) and severe hypoxia.
treated pneumonia: organization of exudates in alveolar cavities and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: distributed intravascular coagulation (CID); leukoerythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the chance of infection include staying at home, avoiding places with many people, often washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, practicing good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching eyes, nose and mouth with hands without washing.
The CDC recommends that the mouth and nose be covered with a tossing or spraying lens, as well as close the mouth with the inside side of the elbow if the lens is not available.
The proper hygiene of the hand after coughing or breathing is encouraged.
The CDC recommended the use of clothing masks in public places, partly to limit transmission by asymptomatic individuals. Social distance strategies aim to reduce the contact of people infected with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel and canceling large public meetings.
The distance guidelines also include that people stay at least 1.8 meters (6 feet) away from each other.
No effective remedy for the prevention of COVID-19 is known. Since the vaccine should not be launched before 2021, a key point for the control of COVID-19 is to try to reduce the peak of the epidemic, also known as "curve loss".
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash their hands frequently using soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom or when the hands are visually dirty, before eating and after drying the nose, coughing or breathing.
It also recommends using alcohol-based antiseptics for hands with at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not readily available. For places where antiseptics for commercial hands are not readily available, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In these formulations, antimicrobial activity is given by means of ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; it is not "an active substance for hand asepsis".
Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
People are treated with palliative care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support and support for other affected vital organs.
The CDC recommends that people who suspect they are with the virus use a simple facial mask.
The oxygenation of the extracorporeal membrane (ECMO) was used to treat the problem of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being analysed.
Personal hygiene and healthy lifestyle and diet are being recommended to improve immunity.
Support treatments can be useful for those with mild symptoms and early stages of infection. WHO and the National Health Commission of China published recommendations for the care of people hospitalized with COVID-19.
U.S. Intensive and Pneumologists gathered recommendations for the treatment of several agencies in a free remedy, the IBCC.
Until April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some health professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofen for first-line use.
Caution should be taken to minimise the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in the health environment, when conducting procedures that may generate aerosols, such as intubation and manual ventilation.
For health professionals caring for people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends placing the person in rooms with isolation of air-borne infections (SIIA) as well as taking the standard precautions, contact precautions and air precautions. The CDC summarizes the guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (EPI) during the pandemic.
The recommended equipment is: EPI blanket, breathing or facial mask, visual protection and medical gloves. When available, it is preferable to use breathing machines instead of facial masks.
N95 Respirators are approved for industrial environments, but the FDA has authorized masks for use under Emergency Use Authorisation (U.S.).
They were designed to protect against air particles such as dust, but their effectiveness against a specific biological agent is not guaranteed for undeclared uses.
When masks are not available, CDC recommends the use of facial shields or, as a last resort, home masks.
Most COVID-19 cases are not serious enough to require mechanical or alternative ventilation, but a percentage of cases are.
The type of respiratory support for individuals with respiratory impairment related to COVID-19 is being studied for people in hospitals, with some evidence that intubation can be avoided with a high-flow nasal channel or positive airway pressure at two levels.
If either of them brings the same benefits to people who are seriously ill, it is not known.
Some doctors prefer to stay with invasive mechanical ventilation when it is available because this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles, compared to the high flow nasal cannula. Serious cases are more common in elderly people (those over 60 years and especially over 80 years).
Many developing countries do not have per capita hospital beds in sufficient quantity, which limits the ability of the health system to deal with the sudden escalation in the number of cases of serious COVID-19 enough to require hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5% were admitted to intensive therapy units, 2.3% needed ventilation mechanical support and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of the people in the hospital with COVID-19 were eventually taken to the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex as acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA) develops in COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes increasingly difficult.
Fans that have pressure control mode and high PEEP levels are needed to increase oxygen delivery while minimising the risk of pulmonary lesions and pneumothorax associated with ventilation.
A high level of PEEP may not be available in older fans.
The research for potential treatments started in January 2020 and clinical trials are being carried out with various antiviral drugs.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although new medicines may take up to 2021 to be developed, several of the medicines tested have already been approved for other uses or are in an advanced phase of testing.
Antiviral medicine can be tested in people with various diseases.
WHO recommended that volunteers participate in the effectiveness and safety tests of potential treatments. The FDA granted temporary authorisation for plasma use of convalescent people as treatment in cases where life is serious and immediately threatened.
The clinical studies necessary to demonstrate their safety and effectiveness against the disease have not yet been conducted.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application to deal with the outbreak of the disease.
Users are asked to report their name and ID number.
The application can detect the "close contact" using monitoring data and thus the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends quarantine as well as alerts local health authorities. Big data data analysis, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are being used to track infected people and the people with whom they contacted in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government authorised security agencies to track data on mobile phones of people who are allegedly with coronvirus.
The measure has been taken to strengthen the quarantine and protect the people who can get in touch with infected citizens.
Even in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared aggregate data on telephone location with the German federal government agency Robert Koch Institute to investigate and prevent the transmission of the virus.
Russia has implemented facial recognition technology to detect who does not comply with the quarantine.
The Italian Regional Health Commissioner Giulio Gallera said he had been informed by mobile operators that "40% of people are still circulating anyway".
The German government conducted a 48-hour hackaton at the end of the week with over 42,000 participants.
In addition, the president of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, made a global appeal for creative solutions against the spread of the crown virus.
Individuals may experience difficulties in quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of infection in themselves.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying: "The increase in social isolation, solidarity, medical anxiety, stress and economic crisis are a perfect storm to harm people's mental health and well-being."
The disease may have a slight evolution, with few or no symptoms, seemingly other common diseases of the upper respiratory tract, such as refrigerated.
Light cases usually recovered within two weeks, while those with serious or critical disease may take from three to six weeks to recover.
Women who are pregnant may have a higher risk of serious infection of COVID-19, according to data from other similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but lack data from COVID-19. In some people, COVID-19 may affect the lungs, causing pneumonia.
In those most severely affected, COVID-19 can progress rapidly to adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), causing respiratory failure, septic shock or multiple organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, coagulation disorders and heart, kidneys and liver damage.
Coagulation disorders, specifically the increase in prothrombin time, were described in 6% of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, while renal failure was seen in 4% of this group.
Approximately 20-30% of people with COVID-19 have high liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the median between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, with five hospitalization.
However, patients transferred to an ICU had a median of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In a study with early cases, the median onset of early symptoms until death was 14 days, with a total interval of six to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China, men had a 2.8% mortality rate, while women had a 1.7% mortality rate.
Histopathological examinations of post-pulmonary death samples show diffuse alveolar damage with exudated cell fibromyxides in the two lungs.
Viral cytopathic alterations were observed in the pneumocytes.
The lung image examination appeared to be acute respiratory discomfort syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of the deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, heart damage was detected due to high levels of troponin or cardiac arrest.
According to March data in the United States, 89% of the hospitalized had pre-existing comorbidities. The availability of medical resources and socio-economic factors in a region may also affect mortality.
Mortality estimates for comorbidity vary due to these regional differences, but also due to methodological difficulties.
Sub-notification of mild cases may lead to overestimation of the mortality rate.
However, the fact that death is the result of cases contracted in the past may mean that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 and about 2.4 times more likely to require intensive treatment or to die compared to non-smokers. Concerns about long-term disease sequelae were raised.
Hong Kong hospital authority found a 20% to 30% decrease in lung capacity in some people who recovered from the disease, and lung tests indicated damage to the body.
This can also lead to intensive post-care syndrome after recovery.
Until March 2020, it was not known whether past infections would give effective and lasting immunity to people who recovered from the disease.
Immunity is considered likely based on the behaviour of other coronaviruses, but cases have been reported where the recovery of COVID-19 was followed by positive tests for coronavirus on a later date.
These cases are believed to be the worst of a prolonged infection rather than a reinfection.
It is believed that the virus is natural and has animal origin through transshipment infection.
The real origin is unknown, but from December 2019 the spread of the infection has become almost entirely driven by human transmission.
A study with the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 at The Lancet, revealed that the oldest date of onset of symptoms was December 1, 2019.
Official WHO publications reported the oldest date of onset of symptoms as of 8 December 2019.
Several measures are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary by region and over time and are influenced by the volume of tests, quality of the health system, treatment options, time elapsed from the initial onset and population characteristics such as age, sex and health in general.
At the end of 2019, WHO assigned the Emergency Disease Codes CID-10 U07.1 for SARS-CoV-2 infected deaths confirmed in the laboratory and U07.2 for COVID-19 deaths with clinical or epidemiological diagnosis, without SARS-CoV-2 confirmed in the laboratory. The mortality rate reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a certain time interval.
Based on the statistics of the University of Johns Hopkins, the overall mortality rate was 6.9% (153,822/2.240.191) on 17 April 2020.
Other measures include the rate of fatality per case (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed individuals who die from a disease, and the rate of fatality per infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected individuals (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from a disease.
These statistics are not limited to time and follow a specific population from infection to case resolution.
Although not all infected people develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies may provide information about how many people have been infected.
In the outbreak epicenter in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600, 80 (1.7%) had already died.
In Gangelt, the disease was spread by Carnival festivals and spread among younger people, causing relatively lower mortality, and not all deaths by COVID-19 should have been formally registered as such.
Moreover, the German health system was not overloaded.
In the Netherlands, approximately 3% may have antibodies, as verified in blood donors.
69 (0.004% of the population) had confirmed death by COVID-19.
The impact of pandemic and its mortality rate are different for men and women.
Mortality is greater in men in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The greatest risk for men is in the 50s, with the difference between men and women approaching only at 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women.
The exact reasons for the gender difference are not known, but genetic and behavioral factors may be the reason.
Immunological differences due to sex, lower prevalence of smoking women and development by men of comorbidities as hypertension at a lower age than women may have contributed to greater mortality among men.
In Europe, 57% of infected individuals were men, and 72% of those killed by COVID-19 were men.
By April 2020, the U.S. government was not tracking data on sex-related COVID-19 infections.
Research showed that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women in different ways.
A higher percentage of health workers, mainly nurses, are women, and they have more chances of being exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease was "COVID-19".
The head of WHO, Tedros Adhanon Ghebreyesus, explained that "CO" is "coron", "VI", "virus", "D", disease, and "19" is from when the outbreak was identified: December 31, 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location (e.g.: China), animal species or group of people, in accordance with the international recommendations of nomenclature to prevent stigmatization. The virus that causes COVID-19 was called acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses "COVID-19 virus" and "COVID-19 virus" in public communications.
Both the disease and the virus are commonly called "coronavirus".
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and the disease were commonly called "coronavirus" and "coronavirus of Wuhan".
In January 2020, WHO recommended "2019-nCov" and "acute respiratory disease by 2019-nCOV" as interim names for the virus and the disease, according to the 2015 orientation against the use of sites in names of diseases and viruses.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were published on 11 February 2020.
Due to capacity limitations in the standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing health material, such as nasopharyngeal scratches and breathers parts.
In one example, when an Italian hospital urgently needed a breather valve, and the supplier was unable to deliver the necessary chronogram, a local startup made reverse engineering and printed the 100 necessary valves from one day to the other.
After the initial appearance of COVID-19, theories of conspiracy, misinformation and misinformation about the origin, size, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease emerged, which quickly spread over the Internet.
Apparently, humans are able to transmit the virus to some other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, rats and chickens.
No medicinal product or vaccine has been approved for the treatment of the disease.
International surveys on vaccines and medicines for COVID-19 are under way in government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization initiated the "SOLIDARITY Trial" to assess the effects of treatment with four existing antiviral components with more likely efficacy.
There is no vaccine available, but several agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is being used because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the ACE2 receptor to enter human cells.
There are three vaccination strategies being investigated.
First, researchers intend to develop a vaccine with the integral virus.
The use of this virus, whether it is inactive or dead, aims to cause a rapid immune response from the human body to a new infection of COVID-19.
A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this research focuses on the mirror protein that helps the virus enter the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
A third strategy is that of nuclear acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new technique for creating vaccines).
Experimental vaccines of any of these strategies should have tested safety and efficacy. On 16 March 2020, the first clinical test of a vaccine started with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains an inoffensive genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease. The antibody-dependent improvement was pointed out as a possible challenge for the development of a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, but this is controversial.
There are more than 300 clinical trials in progress since April 2020.
Seven tests evaluated treatments already approved for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
The redirection of antiviral drugs consists mostly of Chinese research, with nine clinical tests in phase III of reddesivir in several countries due to a report at the end of April.
A dynamic analysis of the clinical development of drug and vaccine candidates for COVID-19 was ongoing in April 2020. Various existing antiviral drugs are being evaluated for treatment of COVID-19, including reddesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir combined with interferon beta.
There is an attempt to prove the effectiveness of remdesivir since March 2020.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with remdesivir for compassionate use.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the USA, China and Italy. The chloroquine, already used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
However, there are requests for peer review of the research.
Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Virology Institute, while recommending a daily dose of one gram, warns that the double dose is highly dangerous and can be lethal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA published an emergency authorisation for the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the criteria of physicians treating people with COVID-19. The 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines also includes interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir for use against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are required to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide was recommended to be studied more in vivo after demonstrating a low inhibitory concentration of SARS-CoV-2. Studies showed that the protein of the initial mirror in preparation for serum transmembrane protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
Studies on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have major limitations that have prevented the medical community from adopting these therapies without further studies. oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known function in the treatment of COVID-19.
The storm of cytokine may be a complication in the later stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have anti-tempestade properties of cytokine. Tocilzumab was included in the guidelines for treatment by the National Health Commission of China after completion of a small study.
A non-randomized test is under way at national level 2 in Italy, after demonstrating positive results in people with severe disease.
Combined with a serum ferritin blood test to identify cytokine storms, it is expected to neutralize these developments, which are considered due to the death of some affected people.
Interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA based on retrospective case studies on the treatment of refractory cytokines syndrome induced by a different cause, CAR T cell therapy in 2017.
Up to now, there is no controlled and randomized evidence that tocilzumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
The transfer of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune system from whom it recovered from COVID-19 to people who need them is being investigated as a non-vaccinal method of passive immunization.
This strategy was tested for SARS, with inconclusive results.
Viral neutralisation is the expected mechanism of action by which passive antibody therapy can mediate a defense against SARS-CoV-2.
Other mechanisms, however, such as cellular cytotoxicity dependent on antibodies and/or phagocytosis, may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example using monoclonal antibodies manufactured, are developing.
Convalescent serum production, which consists of the liquid portion of the blood of recovered patients and contains specific antibodies to this virus, could be increased for faster implementation.
Coronavirus diseases, a group of highly related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, who later contracted and died from COVID-19 after being aware of the spread of the virus.
