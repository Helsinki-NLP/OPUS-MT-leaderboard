Members of the Assembly of the Country of Wales anxious to "pass for puppets"
Galois elections are held by a proposal to replace their title by the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Gallois Parliament).
This proposal stems from the draft amendment to the name of the Assembly, which would become the Gallois Parliament.
In the political sphere, Members of the Assembly believe that this could be the subject of railways.
One employee elected said that his group was concerned that the sign "twp and Pwp" were "twp".
For non-originating readers in Wales: in gallois, twp means stupid, and pwp means crotte.
According to one of its members, Plaid Cymru (Party of Wales) is not "satisfied" and has proposed other formulas.
The conservative party would be "open" to a name change, but noted that between MWP and Muppet (marionnet), the distance is narrow.
In this context, in gallois, the letter w is pronounced as the u letter in English in the Yorkshire region.
The Commission of the Assembly, which is currently preparing legislation introducing the change of name, noted that "the final decision on the appointment of members of the Assembly is returned to the latter".
The Law 2007 on the Government of Wales (Government of Wales Act 2017) empowers the Gallois Assembly to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposal to appoint the Assembly as a Gallois Parliament, which was also widely supported.
On the issue of membership, the Commission is thinking in favour of Members of the Gallois Parliament (or WMP); however, a large majority of Gallois prefers MWP.
It seems that the members of the Assembly are making other suggestions, but the effort to reach a consensus could be a real blow to Elin Jones, the President of the Assembly, who should submit a bill on change of name in the coming weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes to the functioning of the assembly, including rules on the exclusion of members and the design of the committee system.
Members of the Assembly will take the final decision on the issue of the name during discussions on the draft law.
Macedonia: referendum on the change of country name
The Macedonians will decide on Sunday whether their country should now bear the name "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was organized in an attempt to resolve a happy age of decades between the country and its Greek neighbour, for whom Macedonia is the name of one of its provinces.
For a long time, Athens has insisted on the fact that Macedonia's name is a claim on its territory and has repeatedly imposed its veto on its country's accession to the European Union and NATO.
The Macedonian President, Gjorge Ivanov, opposed the referendum, indicated that he would not take account of the results.
However, participants such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev maintain that the change of name is only a small price to pay to join the EU and NATO.
Harlem: churches in difficulty, Saint Martin bells reduced to silence
"The old people I discussed with say that traditionally there was a bar and a church at every corner of the street," says Mr. Adams.
"There is no more of it today."
According to him, it's normal for bars to be refurbished.
Today, "we don't get used to the same way anymore, he explains.
"Before, we went to the bar like his neighbor, but that's no longer the case."
As for the churches, the funds from the sale of buildings will be exhausted well before those responsible imagine it and worry about it: "Before long, they will return to the home."
He adds that churches could be replaced by condominium complexes, inhabited by individuals who will not help maintain the last shrines in the neighborhood.
"People who buy condominiums in these buildings will be mostly Whites who will rush the closing of all churches, because they are unlikely to become members of them," he worried.
Before Harlem became a black metropolis, white congregations built the two churches: Metropolitan Community in 1870, and Saint Martin 10 years later.
The initial White Methodist Congregation will leave places in the 1930s.
A black congregation, preaching to the surrounding area, took possession of the building.
The church of Saint Martin was taken back by a black community under the direction of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who initiated a boycott of the 125th Street shops, one of the main shopping streets in Harlem, where the Blacks were reluctant to use or obtain promotion.
In 1939, a fire destroyed the building, but Father Johnson's parishioners prepared to rebuild and command a new carillon,
that the son and successor of Father Johnson to the direction of the Church of Saint Martin, the Reverend David Johnson, proudly called the "clocks of the poor."
Tiffany Ng (University of Michigan), the professional who played it in July, gave him another name: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
She also mentions that this is the first carillon in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who, 18 years ago, took place in front of the largest carillon of the Riverside church.
Mr. Merriweather says Saint Martin didn't replace him.
Over the past months, there has been a lot of question about the removal of architects and entrepreneurs, caused by the secular elite of the church on the one hand, and the episcopal diocese on the other.
In July, the parish council, a governing body made up of lay officials, informed the diocese that he was concerned that the latter wanted to impose the costs on him, although he did not participate in the recruitment of the professionals.
Some parishioners have regretted the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
California: a 13-year-old teenager injured by a shark during a part of lobster fishing
According to the authorities, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old on Saturday while he was fishing on lobster in California on the day of the season's opening.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near the Beacon beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV, San Diego's television channel, that he had been drowning with friends since a half-hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and had to pay up to him to get him out of the water.
At first, Chad thought that the young boy was pushing joyful screams of joy to have had a seizure, and then he realized that in reality he
had been bitten.
As he got close to the young man, Hammel noticed that he had an open fracture of the clavicle.
"I was screaming for everyone to get out of the water: There's a shark!" explains Chad.
The boy was evacuated to the Children's Council Hospital in San Diego, where he is still in critical condition.
The species of shark at the origin of the attack is unknown.
At a press conference, the rescue chief Larry Giles reported that a shark had been spotted a few weeks earlier, but that it was not a dangerous species.
He added that the victim suffered from traumatic injuries on the upper part of the torso.
The authorities have closed access to the Ponto Beach beach in Casablanca to the Swami beach in Ecinitas for 48 hours to conduct an investigation and for security reasons.
Giles indicated that there are more than 135 species of sharks, but that most are considered non-hazardous.
Sansbury's offensive plans in the British aesthetics market
Sansbury's hands down on Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams and the rails similar to those of supermarkets, full of aesthetic and cosmetic products and managed by specialists in the field.
As part of a major breakthrough in the British aesthetics market of 2.8 billion sterling books, which continues to grow while sales of fashion and home items are falling, more extensive beauty products will be tested in 11 stores and applied to others if the experience is conclusive.
Supermarkets today invest in the beauty market in order to re-use the space previously occupied by televisions, microwaves and other household items.
Sainsbury's indicated that it would increase the volume of its offers to 3,000 cosmetic articles, which will include for the first time such brands as Revlon, Essie, Tweeterman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybellline and Burt's Bees will also have more space in sectors similar to shops such as Boots.
The supermarket also launches its Boutique makeup line to offer a majority of untested products on animals, an increasingly important criterion among young consumers.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop perfume seller will test concessions in two Sansbury's shops, the first opened last week in Croydon, South London, and a second whose opening is expected in the current year in Selly Oak (Birmingham).
Supermarket leaders need to raise their heads to attract consumers, who increasingly tend to make online purchases and go to nearby shops for daily food.
Mike Coupe, Director General of Sainsbury's, said that sales points will be more and more like large surfaces, because the supermarket chain tries to counter discount Aldi and Lidl stores by offering more services and non-food products.
Sansbury's set up Argos sales points in hundreds of stores and also opened the doors of several Habitat stores, since the purchase of the two chains two years ago, which, according to the group, enabled the sale of current consumer goods and the cost of acquisitions.
The previous attempts to restructure the sections of pharmaceutical and cosmetic articles in the British chain were unsuccessful.
At the beginning of the 2000s, Sansbury's attempted a partnership with Boots, but it ended with a discussion about the distribution of benefits from medicines installed in supermarkets.
It was after 3 years that it sold 281 pharmacies for an amount of 125 million pounds in Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds pharmaceutical chain, that the new strategy was implemented.
Lloyds was supposed to play a role in 4 stores to introduce a wide range of high range of skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director of Sainsbury's, announced that the appearance of beauty product rays has been modified to improve the customer framework.
"We have also invested in training so that our staff can offer advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet all kinds of needs and, thanks to the beauty of our rays and the ideal situation of our establishments, our domination of the cosmetics market is now undisputed and changes the purchasing habits," Mills-Hicks added.
Anger of Peter Jones after the withdrawal of Holly Willoughby from an agreement of £11 million
The star of the Dragon's Den TV program, Peter Jones, after announcing the withdrawal of the Hollywood Willoughby an 11 million £ contract linked to its home decoration brand, to dedicate to its new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time to deal with the interior decoration brand and accessories True.
The activity of the two protagonists was compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
At the age of 37, this morning's animator announced on Instagram that she was retired.
Holly Willoughby made Peter Jones angry, the Dragon's Den star, withdrawing from their fruitful textile activity and interior decoration at the last minute, to dedicate himself to his new exclusive contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was angry when the cute TV child discovered, at a meeting that took place under pressure in the seat of the Dragon's Den Star's Star in Marlow (Buckinghamshire), that his new contracts, at the height of 1.5 million pounds of sterling, no longer allowed him to deal with True, their brand of decoration and interior accessories.
The True brand was assimilated to that of the actress Gwyneth Paltrow, Goop, and could double the value of the worth of the animator estimated at £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37 years old, announced on Instagram that she was leaving True, Jones jumped into his private jet to join one of his secondary residences outside Britain.
According to one source, "Truly was one of Holly's priorities far away
and to ensure its future for the next two decades.
His decision left everyone without a voice.
No one could imagine what was going to happen on Tuesday, the launch was so close.
The Marlow headquarters is full of products ready to be sold."
Experts believe that the departure of this Morning animal, which is one of Britain's most "bankable" celebrities, could cause millions of people to lose to society, due to important investments in products that go from cousins or beauties, to interior clothing or articles, and the risk of delayed launch.
In addition, this could end a long friendship.
Willoughby and his husband Dan Baldwin, parents of three children, have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for 10 years.
Holly Willoughby created True with Capp in 2016; Jones, 52 years old, joined the group as president in March of the same year.
Couples shared vacations together and Peter Jones holds 40% of Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby should become the brand ambassador for M&S and will take the place of Anton McPartlin as an animator of I'm A Celebrity of ITV.
A close source from Jones said last night that he did not want to comment on his business activities.
The debate was open, but we finally fell in love.
Trump laughed at the media who criticized him for his comment that some thought he was "innocent of a president", and to show that he was so positive about the North Korean leader.
"Why did President Trump give up so much?"
Railla-t-il, taking a TV journalist's voice.
"I didn't give up anything at all."
He indicated that Kim Jong-one had proved to be in favour of holding a second meeting, after Trump qualified for the first one, which took place in Singapore in June, from a large step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations on this denuclearization are at a dead end.
More than 3 months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho said on Saturday to the world leaders, at the United Nations General Assembly, that there was no "response" in the United States of America to the first disarmament measures of North Korea.
He regretted that, on the contrary, the United States continued to impose sanctions to maintain the pressure.
In his speech on the Trump assembly, he offers a much more optimistic perspective.
"It's all right with North Korea," says the North American President.
We broke the armed conflict.
“ Millions of people would have been killed.
We now have an excellent relationship."
According to Trump, his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim have resulted in positive results: the end of missile testing, the release of hostages and the remains of North American soldiers to their families.
He also justified his little-known approach to the relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to play the president's role, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to access this arena full of cracking, there's hardly more than 200 standing in front of me," he criticized the crowd with the finger.
Tsunami: a devastated island and hundreds of deaths in Indonesia
After the earthquake that struck Lombok, foreign NGOs' aid was not necessarily necessary.
More than 10 per cent of the Lombok population have been displaced, but no state of national disaster has been identified, a condition required for the launch of international aid.
"Unfortunately, they have repeatedly made it clear that they did not want international help, which makes things a little complicated," said Ms. Sumbung.
While Save the Children set up a team to go to Palu, she still does not know if work on the ground will be allowed.
The spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency, Mr. Sutopo, indicated that the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to determine whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to humanitarian aid.
Despite the constant droughts, the country is severely lacking the means to cover its natural habitats.
There were shelters in Aceh, but they are rare in other coastal areas.
Although a warning has been issued, no alarm siren has been held in Palu, which has undoubtedly contributed to human losses.
Even under ideal conditions, moving from one Indonesian island to another is not a simple thing.
Natural disasters complicate the use of transport.
A hospital ship that had been posted to Lombok to care for the victims is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least 3 days to reach the places of the new catastrophe.
The Indonesian President, Joko Widodo, placed the infrastructure reform at the centre of his electoral campaign and spent considerable amounts to state railways and roads.
However, the lack of funds has been undermined by Mr. Joko's government, who was called to represent himself before the voters next year.
The Indonesian head of state is also under pressure from the persistence of interethnic tensions in the country, where members of the Islamic majority practice their faith more conservatively.
More than a thousand Indonesians have lost their lives and tens of thousands have been chased out of their homes, on the basis of clashes between Christians and Muslims, armed with machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.

"I saw Kante approaching to control and without really much thought I decided to shoot."
Chelsea drove 1 to 0 at halftime after a target of the Belgian star Eden Hazard at 25 minutes.
The Blues attacker scored a pass in the direction of Mateo Kovacic, before rowing towards the middle of the field and sprinting beside Liverpool.
Kovacic realizes a fast go-and-come in the middle of the ground,
then made a magnificent deep shot that leads Hazard into the surface.
Hazard crossed the defense and ended his race in the second pole, with a left foot shot behind the Liverpool gate, Alison Becker.
Liverpool will face the Napolitians in the group phase of the League of Champions, Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the San Paolo de Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in Europe UEFA League at 3 p.m. this Thursday in London.

Parliament: Cromwell's statue, the last victim of an attempt to rewrite history
His prohibition would be the just return of things, given the acts of destruction, of countless religious and cultural property of England, committed by its Puritan supporters, such as fanatic Taliban.
However, the Cromwell Society considers Mr. Crick's proposal "unreasonable" and called it "revisionist attempt".
The president of the Cromwell Society, John Goldsmith, said that "in view of the current debate about the withdrawal of the statues, it was obvious that Oliver Cromwell's one raised before the Palace of Westminster was not to be spared.
Cromwell did not order or execute the iconoclasm during English civil wars.
It is likely that his person was sacrificed for his actions by his ancestor Thomas during the previous century.
The wonderful representation of Cromwell, sculpted by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, testifies to the consideration of him in the 19th century and belongs to the history of a personality that many of us still celebrate."
Mr. Goldsmith said in Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more by the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, I mean of course the monarchy.
Whether this representation is precise or not is a continuous historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict that erupted in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a particularly recognizable figure that represents a side of the fracture.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be highlighted and commemorated."
China: a cock kills a goat
According to local media, a farmer was attacked and killed by a cocoon in a South-East China market.
Identified as M, Yuan, the man was found dead, the blood-stained artery and covered near a Porcherie on the market in Liapanshui in the province of Guizhou, reported the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig breeder prepares to inject swine vaccines into a pig breed, on May 30, 2005 in Xining in Qinghai Province, China.
He would have traveled with his cousin from the nearby province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that a door to the neighboring piggy was open.
He claims that a huge male pig was inside and that blood was flowing out of his mouth.
A medical-legal report confirms that the animal weighing 250 kg has mutated the lift to death.
According to Guiyang Evening News, Mr. Wu, the farmer's cousin, said that "his legs were broken and covered with blood".
The security cameras show Mr. Yuan arriving on the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his animals.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
The pig at the origin of Mr. Yuan's death did not belong to the lift or his cousin.
A market manager has entrusted Evening News with the fact that the animal was incarcerated to avoid any other incident and to allow the police to collect evidence.
The family of Elevator Mr. Yuan and the market leaders would be negotiating compensation.
Although the facts are rare, pigs attacks against persons have already been reported.
In 2016 in a Massachusetts farm, a pig attacked a woman and her husband, seriously hurting the latter.
Ten years earlier, a 395 kg pig started a gallois lift on its tractor before his wife managed to remove it.
In 2012, while an Oregon climber had just been eaten by his cocoons, a Manitoba farmer claims to CBC News that this is not in principle an aggressive animal, but that the taste of blood can cause this kind of behavior.
“These are animals rather than players,
Very curious guys... they have no intention of doing any harm.
It is enough to show them the respect they deserve," he said.
The remains of the Rosa hurricane should cause severe precipitation in the south-east of the United States
According to forecasts, the Uuragan Rosa weakens as it moves above the coldest waters on the northeast coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will lead to warnings in the north-east of Mexico and the south-west of the United States in the coming days.
The winds were blowing at 135 km/h (category 1 hurricane) since 5 a.m. in the morning, hours from the east on Sunday, while Rosa was 620 km south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
The hurricane should move to the North on Sunday.
During this time, depression begins to form above the Pacific Ocean and circulates to the east, west coast of the United States. As it approaches the Basse-California peninsula on Monday in the form of a storm, Hurricane Rosa will result in intense tropical humidity to the north, in the south-west of the United States.
It will drop up to 25 cm of rain in regions of Mexico this Monday.
Then the tropical humidity combined with the approaching depression will create widespread coastal rains in the southwest in the coming days.
At the local level, precipitation between 2.5 and 10 cm will result in sudden, dangerous storms, torrents of debris and potential landslides in the desert.
Warnings will reach a rate of 5 to 7.5 cm per hour per place, especially in the south of Nevada and Arizona, due to the intensity of tropical humidity.
It should fall between 5 and 10 cm of rain in regions of the southwest, including a large part of Arizona.
Dispersed tropical rains may cause sudden floods and rapid deterioration of conditions.
It is strongly advised to take advantage of the desert on foot because of the threat of tropical precipitation.
Heavy rains could turn the canyons into desiccant rivers and hurricanes will produce wind flares and dust turbines by location.
The approaching depression will result in abundant local rains in some southern regions of the country, on the Californian coast.
The rainy totals can reach more than 1.3 cm, which could lead to low-flowing dust and make the shoe slip.
This could be the first rains of the dry season in the region.
Dispersed tropical warnings will reach Arizona at the end of Sunday and early Monday morning, then intensify later Monday and Tuesday.
There will be heavy rainfall at the four corners of the country on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
Significant changes in temperature are expected for the month of October through the United States due to the Arctic's cooling, but the tropical climate will remain warm,
which sometimes causes a radical change of time over short distances.
The central region of the United States, which will be subject to considerable temperature differences on Sunday, is a perfect example.
Between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, or even between Saint Louis and Des Moines (Iowa), the difference is almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, a constant summer heat will try to infiltrate and intensify again.
A major part of the centre and the east of the United States is expected to start a hot month, with temperatures running around 26 degrees above the plains of the south and other regions of the north-east.
Mercury could reach 26 degrees in New York on Tuesday, about 10 degrees above the average season.
Forecasts over several days indicate that temperatures should be higher than the average in the east of the United States during the first 15th of October.
Brett Kavanaugh's trial attracts more than 20 million viewers
Transmitted on 6 television channels Thursday, Brett Kavanaugh's arresting hearings, a candidate for the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused her of having sexually assaulted her in the 1980s, were followed by more than 20 million people.
While the political impasse persists, the broadcasting services interrupted their usual Friday program to announce a playoff: an agreement imagined by Jeff Flake, the Senator of Arizona, to allow the FBI to conduct an investigation into the charges for a week.
In front of the Senate Judicial Commission, Christine Ford made sure 100% that Kavanaugh, under the influence of alcohol, had been exposed to attacks on his person and had tried to get his clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a passionate drive, also claimed to be certain to 100% that this had never happened.
According to a report by Nielsen, the trial probably reached an audience of over 20.4 million.
The company calculated the number of viewers of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers of other channels spreading the process, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen is not always able to estimate the number of people watching TV at the office.
As a comparison, the trial attracted as many people as a football match or Oscars.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose animators have largely supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was the most popular channel on the day of hearings, with an average of 5.69 million viewers.
ABC held second place with an audience of 3.26 million.
CBS (3.1 million), NBC (2.94 million), MSNBC (2.89 million) and CNN (2.52 million), always according to Nielsen.
The interest did not weaken once the hearing was completed.
Flake was at the center of the drama playing on Friday.
After the office of the moderate Republican had issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras had released a scene in which the senator was taking part by demonstrators while he was trying to take the elevator to the hearing of the Judicial Commission.
Flake lowered his eyes for several minutes, while CNN retransmitted the sequence of live interference.
"Don't look elsewhere, look at me," says one of the women.
"Do you really think he's telling the truth?
You hold power while so many women are lost. ”
Before the elevator doors were referred to, Flake indicated that his office had issued a statement and that he would say more at the committee meeting.
All cabled and broadcast network chains would cover the meeting on-line a few hours later, while the Judicial Commission was preparing to vote on the procedure to advance the appointment of Kavanaugh throughout the Senate.
Flake indicated, however, that a one-week investigation should first be conducted by the FBI on charges against the candidate, what minority Democrats claimed.
Flake was partly convinced by discussions with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
He made his decision after being interviewed with Coons and several other senators afterwards.
His choice weighed heavily in the balance, as the Republicans would not have actually obtained the votes to approve Kavanaugh's appointment without a prior investigation.
President Trump authorized the FBI to investigate Brett Kavanaugh's allegations of sexual assault.
Great Britain: May accuses Brexit's opponents of making the "small policy"
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused the detractors of leaving the European Union, of making the "small policy" to the detriment of the future of Britain and national interest.
May arrived at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In another trade with the newspaper, which published a photo of Theresa May in cover, his former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson continued his attacks on his plans called Chequers, claiming that the proposal for free trade between Britain and the European Union was "really ridiculous".
Wayde Sims: Police arrest Dieteon Simpson, suspected to be at the origin of the LSU player's death
The police arrested a suspect of the fatal shot that led to the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dieteon Simpson, also 20 years old, was stabbed and charged with second-degree murder, reported the Red Baton Police Service.
The authorities published a video of the clash between Sims and Simpson, and the police indicated that Sims had lost his glasses during the altercation.
Found at the crime scene, Simpson's DNA was the subsidiary of the CBS group, according to WAFB.
During his interrogation, Simpson admitted to the police to be responsible for Wayde's death.
According to his lawyer, his bail was set at $350,000.
The medical office of the Baton-Red parish published a preliminary report on Friday, which determines that death was caused by a wound by a bullet that went through the head and lodged in the neck.
The police service recognizes the assistance received by the Refugee Task Force of Louisiana State, the medical and legal laboratory of the state police, the Southern University police, as well as citizens, in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU's sports director Joe Aleva thanked the Order's forces for their "commitment and demand for justice".
Yeah, he was only 20 years old.
1.98 m for 98 kg, the player grew up in Baton-Red, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at the LSU.
On average, it scored 5.6 points and performed 2.6 rounds per match during the last season.
On Friday morning, Will Wade, LSU basketball coach said the team was "damaged and shocked" after Wayde's death.
"We're going through this kind of thing all the time," said Wade.
Mexico : a rock volcano of ashes
From the ashes escape from the Volcano Popocatepetl reached the southern quarters of the capital of Mexico.
On Saturday, the National Disaster Prevention Centre recommended Mexicans to get away from the volcano, after recording a peak of activity in the crater, with 183 gas and ashes emissions within 24 hours.
The centre monitored several soils and earthquakes from Popocatepetl.
On social networks, images showed fine ascent layers covering the car bristles in Mexico City districts, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicians have observed an increase in volcanic activity at 72 km of the capital since a 7.1 earthquake hit the center of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, named Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Catalonia: Cops and separatists confronting the independent voter's anniversary
On Saturday, six arrests took place in Barcelona following clashes between independent protesters and the anti-emission police, while thousands of opponents joined protests to mark the first anniversary of the referendum that divided Catalonia.
Before being re-caught by anti-emetic policemen, masked separatists threw out their eggs and colored powder, creating dust clouds in the streets, which usually do not meet tourists.
Heaters also exploded later in the day, while the police used mattresses to contain the clashes.
For several hours, groups in favour of independence that were "forgetting, and not forgiving" have faced unionist parties calling for "long life in Spain".
14 demonstrators who had minor injuries were cared for, according to the local press.
One year after the 1st October referendum, which was considered illegal by Madrid but celebrated by Catalans in favour of separation, tensions remain in the independent region.
A overwhelming majority of voters have chosen independence, despite a low rate of participation, against the secession that has largely boycotted the referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to prevent Catalans from accessing poll offices in the region.
Independent groups had camped on Friday night to block a national police support demonstration.
This was all the same place, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated with his wife in the separatist demonstration, said he no longer had any hope for Catalonia's independence.
"We were witnesses last year of a great time.
My parents would be happy to be able to vote, but now we are in an impasse," he laments.
Despite their capital victory, although it is false to the regional elections last December, independent Catalan parties have had a hard time keeping the momentum this year, many popular leaders being exiled or detained waiting to be judged for holding the referendum and declaring Catalonia's independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, who is filming the demonstration of police support on her phone, believes that politicians are responsible for blocking the situation, on the one hand and on the other.
"Tension only makes you climb," he regrets.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the 9 Catalan leaders in prison awaiting a trial since last year, announced his intention to submit his candidacy to the European Parliament's elections next year.
"This is the best way for me to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression of the Spanish government," he added.
Arrest in Londonderry : Men beat a house in a car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after having repeatedly sunk on a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 a.m.
Police captain Bob Blemmings indicated that the doors and walls were damaged.
The car would also have received arrows.
Livingstone wins the match 1 to 0 against Rangers thanks to Menga
The first goal of Dolly Menga ensures the victory of Livingston
Recently mounted, the Livingston team surprised the Rangers by imposing a second 18-game win at Steven Gerrard, the current coach of the Ibrox club.
The goal of Menga made all the difference and allowed Gary Holt's team to place themselves in 2nd position of ranking, equal to Hibernian.
Gerrard's men are deprived of victory outside the Premiership league this season, and must face the Hearts team on Sunday, which has 8 points.
But first, the Rangers will meet the Vienna Rapid on the occasion of the European League this Thursday.
With regard to the Livingston team, she has continued her six matches in the division, and her main coach Holt, who has been replacing Kenny Miller since last month, may have noticed that she has not lost the least meeting yet.
Livingstone missed an opportunity to face angry opponents
Holt's team could have made progress well before marking, because their direct approach was challenging for Rangers.
Scott Robinson tried to hunt down but remained entwined in front of the goal; followed a late intervention by Alan Lithgow, on a headway by Craig Halkett.
The Livingstone team let Rangers have the balloon, knowing that it could generate them thanks to the tactics they worked with.
That's where the ultimate goal is.
The Rangers gave a free shot and the Livingston tried to open it; Declan Gallagher and Robinson allied themselves to join Menga, which took a touch and entered a goal in the field.
At this stage, the Rangers dominated the game but faced an impenetrable defense and the goalkeeper Liam Kelly was rarely concerned.
The second half knew the same pace, although Alfredo Morelos had forced Kelly to stop.
The Rangers' guard Allan McGregor stopped at the foot a hit by Scott Pittman, while Lithgow managed to play one of the Livingston's plans.
The Livingston guard rejected all attempts and protected his cage, while two sentences were denied by the arbitrator, one for the provocation of Halkett directed against Glenn Middleton and the other for a mistake.
Livingston's " phenomenon" - Analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland, Tony Macaroni Arena
A performance and exciting results for Livingston.
They have all been excellent and continue to exceed expectations of this ascending slope.
Their style and composition of the team have practically not changed since their return to the summit, but the merit comes largely to Holt to have a team motivated since its arrival
who has many big players.
The defense of Captain Halkett was great and beautifully organized, and Menga was able to hold Connor Goldson and Joe Worall in a dress all the time of the match.
Unfortunately, the Rangers were not inspired.
Despite a good level reached with Gerrard, they were not at the height of their past talent.
They missed a last chance and managed to get the opposite side only once; this is a warning for the Rangers, which is in the middle of the table.
Mitigated home of President Erdogan in Cologne
On Saturday 29 September, Turkish and German leaders met around a breakfast in Berlin in a relaxed atmosphere.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany to improve relations between NATO allies.
Several issues have been addressed, such as human rights, freedom of the press or Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then flew to Cologne for the inauguration of one of the largest mosques.
One of the most important Turkish communities abroad lives in this city.
Invoking security reasons, the police prevented 25,000 protesters from meeting in front of the building, while many participants were able to approach to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, mostly Kurdish, made their voices heard, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to host it in its country.
The escalation that emerges from the protests reflects this double view of Erdogan: a visitor welcomed in heroes by some Germans of Turkish origin and qualified as self-crate by others.
Road accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies after a collision with a car
In London, a cyclist died in a collision involving a car.
The accident occurred at around 10 a.m. local time, near the junction between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a frequent road from Deptford to the southeast of the city.
The driver of the vehicle stopped, the rescues arrived on site, but the man died at the locations of the accident.
This accident occurred several months after the death of a cyclist on Childers Street, about 1.5 km from the accident that took place on Saturday.
The London police reported that officers were doing their best to identify the individual and prevent his or her relatives.
Roads have been closed and bus deviations have been established. Motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: 6 officers injured during an escape
The prison warden for high-security men said that six prison officers had been injured during a riot.
The leak started in the Long Lartin HMP prison, located in Worcestershire, at 0930 hours local this Sunday. It is still not under control.
Specialized anti-emission agents were sent to unlock the situation, involving 8 detainees and contained in a prison wing.
Instead, the officers were cared for for minor facial injuries.
A spokesperson for the prison management said: "The specially trained personnel were deployed to restore the order in the HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six officers have been cared for for for injuries.
We will not tolerate violence in our prisons, and those responsible will have to respond to the police authorities and be able to see their sentences extended."
More than 500 prisoners, including the most dangerous criminals in the country, are incarcerated in the HM Long Lartin prison.
In June, the director of the prison was hospitalized as a result of an assault by a prisoner.
In October last year, anti-emission agents were sent to prison to cause serious disturbance: prisoners had attacked staff with billiard bullets.
Uuragan Rosa: Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City threatened by sudden storms (which could be beneficial for areas affected by drought)
It is rare that tropical depression affects Arizona, but this is undoubtedly what will happen at the beginning of next week. Uuragan Rosa is heading toward the south-west desert with what remains of energy. This region could be affected by sudden storms.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday west of Arizona, south and east of Nevada, southeast of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa should head directly to Phoenix on Tuesday, with announced rains from Monday night.
The national weather service based in Phoenix said in a tweet that “only ten tropical cyclones have preserved the stage of depression or tropical storm in a perimeter of 300 km around Phoenix since 1950!
The Hurricane Katrina (1967) was arrested 64 km from the Arizona border."
The latest estimates of the National Hurricane Center include 5 to 10 cm of precipitation, and up to 15 cm per place in the Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Other areas of the southwest desert including the central area of the Rocheuses and the Grand Bassin should record between 2.5 and 5 cm of precipitation, with total isolated measures that can reach 10 cm.
The rains of Rosa could be life-saving for regions affected by drought that are not exposed to the risks of sudden harshness.
Although the flood risk should not be taken lightly, the rain could be beneficial for the southwest region, given the current drought situation.
According to the United States drought monitoring system, some 40% of Arizona had at least one extreme drought, the second most severe drought,” weather.com reported.
The Uuragan Rosa begins its way on the coasts, in the Lower California peninsula.
Still with a great power Sunday morning and generating winds that can reach 135 km/h, Rosa was located 620 km from Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and moved north at a speed of 20 km/h.
The storm meets the cold waters of the Pacific and thus loses its strength.
It should reach the Mexican coast with the force of a hurricane Monday afternoon or Monday evening.
In some regions of Mexico, precipitation could be massive and pose a risk of flooding.
"In total, between 7.5 and 15 cm of precipitation are expected from Lower California to the northwest of Sonora and can reach up to 25 cm," weather.com said.
Rosa will then cross Mexico to the north, with the strength of a tropical storm, and reach the Arizona border Tuesday morning, as a tropical depression. She will cross Arizona and the South Utah in the Tuesday evening.
"Torrent rains are expected in Basse-Californie, northwest of Sonora and in the south-west desert and are the main danger," explained the National Hurricane Center.
It is estimated that these precipitations will result in potentially deadly storms and floods in the arid areas, as well as landslides in the mountainous areas.
Attack at Midsomer Norton: four arrests for attempted murder
Three adolescents and a 20-year-old man were arrested for attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found trapped in the Somerset.
The adolescent was found in the Excelsior Terrace district of Midsomer Norton, Saturday at 4 a.m. local time.
He was sent to the hospital. His condition is currently stable.
The Avon and Sommerset police reported that they had arrested the four young people (aged 17, 18 and 20) on the night of Radstock.
The agents called on people who could have filmed the scene with their phone.
Trump states that Kavanaugh has been the victim of the evil and anger of the Democrats
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the impotent and scandalous methods of the democratic party," Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling in West Virginia.
Trump stated that Kavanaugh had been the victim of the evil and the anger of the Democrats throughout his appointment process.
Kavanaugh expressed himself on Thursday before Congress, with energy and emotion rejection of Christine Blasey Ford's allegations, which accused her of having sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified during the hearing.
The president said Saturday that "the American people have witnessed Kavanaugh's intelligence and courage" this day.
"A vote in the sense of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote in the sense of one of the most accomplished lawyers, with a brilliant career in public service," he explained to the crowd of participants gathered in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the appointment of Kavanaugh when he referred to the importance of the participation of Republicans in the mid-term elections.
"We are five weeks from one of the most important elections in our lives.
I am not a candidate, but I am more involved than ever," he said.
"That's why I fight on all fronts for tremendous candidates."
Trump stated that the Democrats were in the mission of "resistance and obstruction".
The first final vote in the Senate for the appointment of Kavanaugh should take place by Friday, following the statement of a collaborator of the Republican Party to CNN.
Indonesia: a earthquake and tsunami make hundreds of victims, the balance sheet continues to grow.
On Saturday, the authorities stated that at least 384 people had died, most of them were driven by huge waves that hit the beaches while an earthquake, followed by a tsunami, hit the Indonesian island of Celebes.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in Palu, when waves of six metres above sea level submerged the beach at the fall of the night. They led many lives and destroyed everything on their way.
The earthquake, of a magnitude of 7.5, preceded the tsunami.
"When the threat of tsunami arose yesterday, everyone was still on the beach. People had not fled immediately, it cost them their lives," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for the National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB), said at a press conference in Jakarta.
"Tunami didn't come alone. He brought cars, wooden pieces, dwellings, he carried everything with him," Nugroho explained, stating that the tsunami had moved in the full sea at 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people were able to save their lives by climbing to the trees, adding.
Nearly 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The aerial images published by the disaster management agency show destroyed buildings and shops, deformed and destroyed bridges, as well as a shell surrounded by water.
The replicas continued to drain the coastal city on Saturday.
Earthquakes were felt by 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Implementation (BPPT) stated that the energy released by the Friday earthquake was 200 times higher than the power of the atomic bomb launched on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographical location of the city, which borders a long narrow bay, could have increased the size of the tsunami, she explained.
According to Nugroho, damage is considerable; thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels have collapsed.
Bodies were found lying under the ruins of buildings in ruins, he added, stating that 540 people were injured and 29 were still missing.
Nugroho said that human and material losses could be more important than 300 km north of Palu, a region called Dongala, the nearest epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications were "completely paralyzed" since Dongala, Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there," said La Croix Red in a communiqué, adding that her staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
"The situation is dramatic and could get worse," she added.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticised for not spreading the information that a tsunami had touched Palu, although agents said the waves had arrived at the time the alert was issued.
An amateur video shared on social networks shows a man on the floor of a building that creates frenziedly to passersby in the street that a tsunami approaches.
A few minutes later, a water wall lay on the coast, carrying with it buildings and cars.
Reuters could not authenticate immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a general electricity panel that cut all communications in Palu. It was therefore difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
The army began to seek help from Jakarta aircraft and other cities, according to the authorities, but the evacuated people still need food and other basic needs.
The city's airport has returned in relief operations, but will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was due to visit Palu's evacuation centres on Sunday.
Indonesia: The Tsunami victim's balance has been reached, with more than 800 deaths.
It's a tragedy.
The members of World Vision staff from Dongala arrived healthy and except in Palu, where they found refuge in shelters established in the court of their offices. On the way they discovered scenes of devastation, explains Mr. Doseba.
"They told me they had seen many destroyed houses," he explains.
It's a tragedy.
When relief groups began to bring relief to the victims, some complained that very experienced foreign humanitarian workers had not had the right to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funds, food and foreign personnel can only enter the territory if the affected site is declared a national disaster zone.
And that's not the case yet.
"This disaster is always considered regional," explains Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government declares that it is a national disaster, international assistance can intervene, but we are still waiting."
When the second night after the earthquake and Friday's tsunami fell on Palu, the relatives of the missing people were still waiting for a miracle.
On Saturday, a little boy was found in the shackles.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who had been away from bed for two days near her mother's body.
The coach of the national Indonesian parachute team, Gendon Subandano, had prepared two of the missing athletes for the Asian Games, which took place a few days earlier in Indonesia.
Other of his students were trapped in the Roa Roa hotel, Mr. Mandadi added.
"As an elder in parachute discipline, I have lived my own dramas," he explains.
In the hours that followed the announcement of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel in the parapet community, Mr. Gendon reported that he had desperately sent messages to athletes in Palu who participated in the festival on the beach.
His messages were left unanswered.
"I think they've never received my messages."
At Newport on the Levee, stealers subtilize $26,750 when recharging an automatic distributor
On Friday morning, the thieves knocked out $26,750 to a Brink's agent who recharged an automatic distributor at Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from Newport Police Service.
The driver of the vehicle lived a distributor in the entertainment complex and prepared to feed it, says Inspector Dennis McCarthy in the communiqué.
While he was busy, a man appeared behind Brink's employee and stole a bag of money for the distributor.
Witnesses would have seen many suspects leave, but the police did not specify the number of persons involved in the incident.
Any person who has information about their identities is requested to contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: the rapper changes his name and becomes Ye
The Kanye West rapper is now calling himself Ye.
To announce the news on Twitter Saturday, he wrote: "Old known as Kanye West."
At the age of 41, West, who has been known as Ye for some time, used this nickname as a title for his eighth album, released in June.
The rapper made this change just before going to the Saturday Night Live show, where he should present his new album, Yandhi.
His participation replaces that of Ariana Grande, who cancelled his coming for "emotional reasons", explained the emission creator.
In addition to the abbreviation of his current professional pseudo, this nickname also has a religious meaning for West.
"I think "Ye" is the most used word in the Bible, where it means "you," explained West earlier this year, referring to the title of his album with his guest Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am us.
I have passed from Kanye, which means “the only one, ” to Ye - it reflects good, evil, confusion, at all.
This album is a reflection of who we are."
West is not the only rapper known to change his name.
Sean Combs was named Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has worked with West in the past, has also played on union and majescules.
In Mexico, AMLO states that it will never use military force against civilians.
Mexican elected president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised never to use the military force against civilians, almost fifty years after bloody reprisals of the forces of the order against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday on Tlatelolco's place never to "use military force to repress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the troops opened the fire during a peaceful demonstration, killing 300 people when student movements took root throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador committed himself to supporting Mexican youth by granting monthly student grants and opening more free public universities.
According to him, unemployment and lack of educational opportunities force young people to join criminal gangs.
The United States should double funding in the field of artificial intelligence
While China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double its research funding in this sector, according to the investor and artificial intelligence expert Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These statements occur after several U.S. government actors made announcements about the IA, while an official IA strategy fails in the United States.
In parallel, China presented its road map last year: it plans to become the innovation leader IA by 2030.
"Double research funds in the field of IA would be a good start, because all other countries have a long way ahead of the United States, and we are looking for the next major discovery in IA," Lee explains.
Double funds could double the chances that the next key step in the field of IA comes from the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the Sinolution Ventures PDG, which invested in one of China's most important companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an IA system that beat U.S. Othello's best-class player. He then joined Microsoft Reasearch's management team and became president of the Chinese Google branch.
Lee has already participated in technological competitions organized by the U.S. government, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency, and has asked when the next competition would take place to identify the visionaries.
According to Lee, American researchers often have to work hard to obtain government funding.
"It's not China that suits academic leaders, it's companies," says Lee.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technological companies have recruited large academic names to work on the IA.
Lee added that the changes in immigration policies could also support the efforts of the United States in the field of IA.
"I think green cards should be automatically granted to researchers in IA," he said.
The State Council of China has revealed its plan to develop artificial intelligence for a new generation in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences of China grants funding to members of academic institutions, as well as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower," Lee explained.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which must involve industry and academic partners. The House-Blanche announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
The NSF currently invests more than $100 million a year for research in the IA.
In parallel, American legislation that is working to establish a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not taken any action for several months.
Macedonians participate in the referendum on their country's name
On Sunday, Macedonians made their voice heard during a referendum on the change in the name of their country for the Republic of North Macedonia. This change would resolve an old dispute of decades with Greece, which had blocked Macedonia's application for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, one of the provinces called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbour represents a right in its territory and opposed its veto at its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, both governments signed an agreement based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the change would affect the ethical identity of the slave population of Macedonia, the majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov announced that he would not vote in the referendum and that a boycotting campaign had raised doubts about obtaining a minimum participation of 50% required to validate the referendum.
The question of the referendum was: "Are you for joining NATO and the EU under the terms of the agreement signed with Greece?"
According to the participants in the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, this is the price to pay to join organisations such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, saved from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I have come today to vote for my country's future, for Macedonia's youth, so that she can live freely under the yoke of the European Union. This means a safer life for each of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, enough Members of Parliament have stated that they would follow the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
The change of name would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Electoral Commission announced that no irregularities had been detected at 1 p.m.
However, participation was only 16%, while it reached 34% at the same time during the last parliamentary elections in 2016, which had mobilized 66% of the voters who were registered at the end of the vote.
"I have come to vote for my children. Our place is in Europe," says Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko participated in the referendum and voted for the change of name in order to open the voice to join NATO and the European Union, Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
At the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54 years old, prepares a small scene and has seats in front of tents installed by those who will boycott the referendum.
"We want to enter the EU and NATO, but we want to enter it through the big door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not want us as Macedonia, we can turn to China and Russia and participate in the Eurasian integration."
According to Prime Minister Zaev, NATO accession will allow Macedonia to benefit from the necessary investments.
"I think a large majority will be favourable, as more than 80% of our citizens want to join the EU and NATO," said Zaev after submitting his bulletin.
He added that a "yes" would be a "confirmation of our future".
According to a poll published on Monday by the Institute for Policy Research in Macedonia, between 30 and 43% of voters would intend to participate in the referendum, which is lower than the expected participation rate.
Another survey, organized by the Macedonian Telma chain, estimated participation to 57%.
70 per cent of the voting participants said they would vote "yes".
In order for the referendum to be valid, 50 % of the votes must be cast and one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first hard hit on the pro-Western government's policy since it took power in May last year.
Decisive Action: Sergio Aguero, from Manchester City, spreads a path through Brighton's defense to mark
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defeated the defenders of Brighton in Manchester and won the 2-0 match on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
Aguero's goal, at the 65th minute, seemed to be the world's simplest action for the player.
The Argentine butter received the balloon in the middle of the field, at the beginning of the action.
He ran between three Brighton defenders before diving on the ground.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green beads.
He surrounded a defender before he defeated the others close to Brighton's goal.
Then he passed the ball to Sterling on his left.
The English front took advantage of this to return the balloon to Aguero, who used his right foot to deceive Brighton's guardian, Mathew Ryan, with a right-hand shot of the rope.
"Aguero has some problems with his feet," explained Pep Guardiola, team coach, to journalists.
"We said he would play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We had the chance that he had marked at this time."
But it was Sterling who had given the first advantage to the Skyblues during the First League game,
29th minute.
Aguero received the balloon directly on Brighton's field.
He sent it on the left to Leroy Sane.
Sane made a few moves before taking Sterling to the second pole.
The front of the Skyblues sent the balloon into the nets just before sliding out of the ground.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group at 1255 hours on Tuesday at the Rhine-Neckar Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play the parties against the Rockies
Since the Nationals team was eliminated from the playoff race, there was no reason to start a new match.
But Scherzer, very competitive, hopes to play Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only in the event of an elimination match for the Rockies, true legends against the Los Angeles Dodgers of the Western National League Division.
The Rockies took him 5-2 in front of the Nationals on Friday night, but they are still trying to secure their first division title.
"Even though this game has no problem, we want to dig the ground in Denver, with this atmosphere, with the crowd, and face a team that will probably play at the highest level I will have to face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to participate?"
The Nationals still have to announce a launch on Sunday, but they would be inclined to leave the scene in Scherzer, in this situation.
Scherzer, for whom it would be the 34th departure, will be training Thursday and will launch during his usual rest day, Sunday.
The Washington director is 18-7 with an average score of 2.53 and 300 withdrawals on 220 marches and two thirds this season.
Trump's interventions in West Virginia
The President referred to the situation that led to his support for Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court, referring to the importance of the participation of Republicans in the mid-term elections.
“ All our actions will have an impact in November.
We are five weeks from one of the most important elections in our lives.
This is a major issue. I am not a candidate, but I am more involved than ever. That is why I fight all the fronts for formidable candidates," he said.
Trump continued: "You see this radically horrible, really horrible group of democrats, you see it at work.
And they are determined to regain power by all means. See their wickedness.
They care who they hurt, who they tear to take power and control. This is what they want, power and control, and we will not give them."
Democrats are engaged in "resistance and obstruction".
"You can see it in the last four days," he added, before qualifying the democrats of people "in anger, evil and lying."
He referred to the Judicial Committee of the United States Senate and the Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, which he deserved to be avoided by the public.
"Do you remember his answer?"
Did you publish the document?
Ha ha, of course.
No, no. I'm waiting for one. It was a very bad body language, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer the great community that it was.
It is not tolerant to those who express their ideas
When activists of the Momentum movement from my local party voted to censor me, it was not a surprise.
After all, I am the last of a line of parliamentarians of the Labour Party who are considered not to be welcome.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, received the same treatment because she was raised against anti-Semitism.
As far as I'm concerned, I was censored because I disagreeed with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe. Ironically, these are subjects for which Jeremy himself was in disagreement with the previous leaders.
The notification for the Nottingham East Labour assembly said on Friday: "We want the assembly to be inclusive and productive."
That is exactly what the general assemblies of Friday night were for my eight years as a parliamentary member of the Labour Party.
Unfortunately, today is not the case of many meetings and the promise of softer and more respectable policies has been forgotten for a long time if it has never been taken into account.
It has become clear that the contrary opinions are no longer tolerated within the party. Each opinion is considered to be acceptable by the party's leaders.
This began shortly after Jeremy took power. The colleagues with whom I was thinking about sharing the same political vision began waiting for me to return to my dress and for me to take positions against my beliefs, whether regarding national security or the internal market in the EU.
Every time I spoke in public, and no matter what I said, I was following an abuse of social networks, calling for withdrawal, denouncing the policies of the centre, saying that I should not be a party member.
And it's not just my experience.
Furthermore, I am more likely than some of my colleagues, because the comments I had addressed were political.
I am admiring the professionalism and determination of these colleagues, who face a disparity of sexist or racist talk every day, but who do not lower their arms.
One of the most despicable things in the current policy is the normalization of various forms of abuse.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said that the Labour Party should encourage a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer this large community and that the party is limited to the range of challenging motions and changes in the selection rules.
I've been given a lot of advice in the last two years: lowering your eyes, not expressing my ideas so strongly, and everything would be fine.
But it's not about acting like I'm doing politics.
I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolgirl, because thatcher's government neglect had led to the collapse of my classroom. Since then, I have wanted to work for better public services for those who need it most, whether as a local adviser or as a government minister.
I have never hidden my political ambitions, even in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East was disturbed by my political positions and my disputes with the party's current leaders.
All I would like to say to those who have defended the Friday motion, is that the country is going to a Brexit that will affect homes, businesses and public services. I think it is not really time to waste time and energy by discussing my loyalty to the party leader.
My only message is not for Nottingham Momentum, it is for my voters, whether they are workers or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that no threat of withdrawal or opportunism will prevent me from acting for the reasons I defend, which are your interests to all.

Father 38 - 17 Melrose: Father remains invincible
Two late tests may have faked the final result, but no doubt above: Ayr deserved this triumph following the intense day match of the Scottish Rugby Championship at XV.
The team now occupys the top of the ranking and becomes the only invincible team of the championship.
In the end, it is the superiority of their defense and the way they have seized the opportunities that enabled them to open the score. Coach Peter Murchie can congratulate himself on this match.
"So far, we have been tested. But we remain invincible, so I must love myself!" he said.
Robyn Christie, from Melrose, congratulated Ayr: “Bravo to them, they were more effective than us and managed to seize opportunities.”
Grant Anderson's test, at the 14th minute, transformed by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in a good position, but a yellow card for the Scottish Rory Hughes, released for the Warriors match, allowed Melrose to speak the figures. Jason Baggot got away from an unprocessed test.
Climate worsened the situation for Ayr with a penalty, before, just in the middle. He marked and transformed a solo test to raise the score to 17-5 for Ayr at break.
Melrose well started the second half and Patrick Anderson's test, transformed by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
A long wait followed because of a serious injury by Ruarid Knott, who left the field on a cemetery. During the resumption, Ayr took the front again with a trial by Stafford McDowall transformed by Climo.
Blair Macpherson, an Acting Captain of Ayr, then received a yellow card and, again, Melrose tried his chance with an unprocessed trial by Bruce Colvine, who created a palpable tension.
But the home team got back in hand and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card to have hit the Climo while he didn't have the balloon, since the penalty, MacPherson touched the back of the Ayr Maul, who was progressing.
Climate changed the test, as almost every time since the resumption, after Kyle Rowe gathered David Armstrong's kick box and sent Gregor Henry to the far end for the team's fifth home test.
The Star of Still Game launches in the restaurant
Ford Kieran, the Still Game star, decided to make a career in the restaurant. The comedian was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old man incarnates Jack Jarvis in the famous BBC show, which he writes and coanimes with his long-standing partner, Greg Hemfill.
The duo announced that the ninth show will be the end of the show, and Kiernan seems to be preparing for the next Craiglang.
According to official records, he is Director of Arigingmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this story, although a source of the Scottish Sun revealed that Kiernan wanted to get involved in the "flowering environment of the restoration" in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, blocked, hopes that the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
Marines are patrolling a craft in the Naval General's La Paz district.
Public buildings take off a blue flag like the ocean.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the naval bases show the following bike: "The sea returns to us from the right.
Recovery is a duty."
Throughout Bolivia blocked, the memory of a lost coast to Chile during a bloody 19th century resource conflict is always well present. Like the desire to navigate the Pacific Ocean, once again.
This hope has not been so palpable for decades. Bolivia is indeed awaiting a decision by the International Court of Justice, which will be delivered on 1 October after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the will, a spirit of unity and serenity, and of course awaits a positive result," explains Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow the decision of the International Court of Justice on a wide-screen basis throughout the country, hoping that the Hague court will take a decision in favour of the Bolivian request. Bolivia wishes Chile to negotiate the agreement of a sovereign transition to the Bolivian ocean after decades of sporadic negotiations.
Evo Morales, the indigenous charismatic president of Bolivia (who faces a controversial fight for re-election next year), also has much to say about the decision that will be made on Monday.
"We are so close to being able to return to the Pacific Ocean," he said at the end of August.
But some analysts think there is little chance that the court will vote in favour of Chile and that there will be little change, even in the case of a positive decision.
The United Nations Dutch-based forum did not have the power to agree on a Chilean territory and stipulated that it would not determine the outcome of the possible talks.
The fact that the International Court of Justice renders its decision six months after the last arguments shows that the case "was not complicated", explains Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And far from promoting the cause of Bolivia, the last four years may have even caused damage to Bolivia.
"The problem of access to the sea was diverted by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
The war rhetoric of Morales has saved all the good Chilean will that remained, has it suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to exchange, but after that, it will be very difficult to organize talks.
The last exchange of ambassadors between the two countries took place in 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representing Bolivia in Haye, rejected the idea that the Court's decision was abnormally rapid.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end 139 years of conflicts with mutual benefits", he said.
Calzadilla also contested the fact that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, used the maritime problem as a political bacific.
"Bolivia will never abandon its right of access to the Pacific," he added.
"The Court's decision is an opportunity to see that we must abandon the past."
North Korea claims that nuclear disarmament will take place only when it can trust the United States
Ri Yong Ho, Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea, stated that his country would not use its nuclear weapons until he had confidence in Washington.
Ri expressed himself at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to respect the promises made at a summit in Singapore between the leaders of the two countries.
He expressed himself when the United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared to be about to resume nuclear diplomacy in the impasse more than three months after Singapore's summit with Kim Jong One, current North Korea leader.
Ri states that it is "chimeric" to think that the maintenance of the United States' sanctions and opposition to a declaration that will end the Korean war will make North more likely.
Washington is reluctant to accept the declaration in the absence of significant disarmament measures on the part of Pyongyang.
Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But Pyongyang's serious rejection of an arsenal that the country considers to be the only guarantee of its security is being debated.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Parisian fashion parades reveal the latest trends in cover, perhaps soon available in your stores
If you want to add XXL pieces to your hat collection or protect yourself from the sun at 100%, don't search anymore.
The creators Valentino and Thom Browne presented their collections of oversized hats that were dazzled during a PE19 show that honored the fashion week of Paris.
More and more extravagant hats each other have invaded Instagram this summer, and the creators have decided to integrate their delirious pieces into the parades.
Valentino's lighthouse was an eccentric beige hat decorated with a broad edge that evoked a pen, which covered the head of the mannequins.
The other oversize accessories included jewelry-shaped pastes, a razor hat and even an pineapple. But these pieces have not been imagined to keep you warm.
Thom Browne also presented a collection of original masks. Just in time for Halloween.
Most of the masks had their lips twisted and spoke more Hannibal Lecter than the High-Couture.
One creation was like a diving equipment, with tuba and glasses, while another thought like a deep ice cone.
And if you follow fashion trends, then you have a chance.
According to style observers, caps may come to your shopping streets.
The XXL hats follow the silage of the "Bomba", the large-scale straw hat that the stars pull, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand that markets this difficultly portable hat that has flooded the social networks has presented another of its pharaoh creations on the podium: a beach bag in straw almost as large as the bathrobe that carried it.
The burnt orange rafia bag, decorated with rafia fries and a white leather handle, was the master piece of the show PE19 La Riviera de Jacquesmus during the Fashion Week in Paris.
Celebrities Stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: "I expect to see the great hats and beach bags arriving in the shops for the next summer. The creator has so marked the minds that it is obvious that there will be an application for surplus accessories."
John Edward: Competences in languages are essential to the citizens of the world
The independent schools of Scotland maintain a school excellence file. This trend continued in 2018 with new excellent results of examinations strengthened by collective and individual success in sports, art, music and other community activities.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) strive to provide the best level of service to students and their parents.
Independent schools work to prepare their students for higher education, the career they have chosen and their place as citizens of the world.
As an education sector capable of designing and establishing an over-the-counter school programme, we find that contemporary languages remain popular and desirable in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, you speak to his head.
If you speak to him in his language, you speak to his heart."
This reminds us that we cannot rely on English to create relationships and establish a trust relationship with the people of other countries.
If you look at the excellent results of the exams this year, you can see that languages are above the ranking, with the most important success rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 per cent of students who studied foreign languages received the highest score, A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS schools show that 72% of students received the highest grade, A, in Mandarin, as well as 72% of students who studied German, 69% of students who studied French and 63% of students who studied Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills for children and young people in the future.
Now, languages as materials are organized as well as science, technology, engineering and mathematics in programs of independent schools and other schools.
A survey by the British Commission on Employment and Skills conducted in 2014 reveals that 17% of the difficulties encountered by employers in recruiting candidates are related to skills in insufficient languages.
Language skills are therefore increasingly vital to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more job offers requiring languages, these skills are essential in our globalised world.
No matter how much you choose your career, a person who speaks a second language will benefit from a real advantage in the future thanks to this sustainable competence.
Being able to communicate directly with foreigners will automatically place the multilingual person in front of its competitors.
According to a 2013 YouTube survey of 4,000 adults living in the United Kingdom, 75% of them did not control a foreign language enough to hold a conversation. French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage (15%).
That is why investing in language learning is important for children today.
By speaking several languages, including those of emerging economies, children will be better able to find a gratifying job.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Several of them will focus on traditional contemporary languages, while others will teach languages considered important for the United Kingdom in the 2020 perspective, including Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's preferences, several languages will be available in independent schools, with a specialist staff in the field.
Scottish independent schools want to offer a learning environment that will prepare children and give them the necessary skills to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
It is clear that at present, in a global commercial environment, languages remain of major importance for the future of the country, which must be reflected in education.
Modern languages must be considered as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to Scottish youth.
It's a good thing to do.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will make its beginnings with the Lakers Saturday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans who watch LeBron James' beginnings at the Lakers of Los Angeles.
Luke Walton, the Lakers coach, announced that James would play Sunday, in the pre-season opening, against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But we don't know how many minutes he'll play.
"More than one, less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
The reporter of the Lakers Mike Trudell tweeted that James would probably play for a few minutes.
After training, earlier in the week, James was asked for his projects for the pre-season program, which includes six matches.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need pre-season games to be ready."
Campaign of Trump and West Virginia (Caine YouTube)
President Donald Trump starts a series of campaign meetings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Other steps, including in states such as Tennessee and Mississippi where the President is popular, are envisaged.
The vote to confirm the vacancy at the Supreme Court is postponed, Trump seeks to collect support for the mid-term elections to come and to prevent Republicans from losing control of Congress during the vote in November.
What time is the Trump meeting in West Virginia tonight and how to watch it online?
The Trump meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. (East Time) this evening, Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can follow it online below, live on YouTube.
Trump should address the question of the hearings of the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, accused of sexual assault, which took place this week. Kavanaugh's confirmation vote in the Senate should be postponed until one week during the FBI investigation.
But this series of meetings is primarily aimed at helping Republicans win the field for the November elections.
According to Reuters, the President of the United States said in his campaign that the five meetings were intended to "encourage volunteers and participants while the Republicans are trying to protect and extend the majority they hold in the Senate and the House of Representatives".
"Congress control is such an essential element of its programme that the president will become in as many States as possible at the beginning of this election campaign," Reuters said a spokesperson for the Trump team, who refused to be appointed.
According to West Virginia Metro News, this evening's meeting, scheduled for the Wesbanco Arena of Wheeling, could bring together participants from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, and draw the attention of the Pittsburgh media".
On Saturday, this will be the second visit in a month of Trump in West Virginia, a state he won in 2016 by more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate in the West Virginia Senate, who is on the train in the polls.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must come to try to relaunch it in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a specialist in political science at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018 : The United States team is ready to fight to keep hope for the simple approach of Sunday
After three simple, Saturday afternoon fursomes could well represent what was missing from this Ryder Cup.
The movement of balance of the elephant is a sport concept invented of all parts but to which players sincerely believe, and more than ever during tournaments such as this.
Where, then, would they place the elan now?
"They were running with six points ahead and now four, so this gives us some wings," Jordan Spieth said while he was leaving for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, with four points ahead and twelve others to play.
The Americans, according to Spieth, feel a little bit of wind in the doll and have every reason to be encouraged, especially by Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and can aim to have each three points in four.
Spieth proved to be extremely effective from tea to green and set an example.
The screams of energetic joy intensified as his game progressed. A crucial dick allowed him to equalize the fourth part while Thomas and he were driven down two after two holes.
His dick, thanks to which they won the match at the 15th hole, caused a similar scream, of those who tell you that he believes the American team is still in high school.
“We really need to stay determined and focus on his game, ” Spieth said.
That's all that's left of each of these players right now.
18 holes to get rid of.
The only players who have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas during the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, as the story of the Ryder Cup attests.
The strange but adorable European pair won four matches in four and did not have the right to make a mistake.
Not only "Moliwood" were the only ones not to realize a Saturday afternoon bogey, but they also escaped there Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and at the last nine doors Friday morning.
This series, the way their energy seems to circulate between them and the crowd by delegating them as the players to battle Sunday, and there is no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari to win a potential European victory while the sun is lying on the National Golf.
The two are preferably at the same time at different holes.
But speaking of European glory remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly beat Sergio Garcia, the morning fourball hero, while he was teaming with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first nine times sent Spain and Sweden into a hole they could never emerge.
On the other hand, Sunday nobody is here to help you.
The furballs and fursomes are so fascinating to observe from close to the interaction between the pairs, the advice they give and those they do not give, and the way in which a strategy can bask in an eyelid.
Europe has been better teamed up so far and has made considerable progress over the last day, but this foursome session has also proved that the Americans have the courage to fight, some of which were doubtful, especially in the country.
Europe takes 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will enjoy a solid advantage in the last day of the Ryder Cup after winning 10-6 on the United States during Saturday's and Saturday's fairs.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari took charge with two victories on a Tiger Woods in distress, which allowed them to score four points so far.
Well decided to preserve the title she had lost in Hazeltine two years ago, the European team of Thomas Bjorn made the difference by requiring 3-1 in the morning fourballs, faced by a disorganized American team.
The United States has demonstrated greater resistance in the fursomes and won two victories, but they have not managed to overcome the gap.
The men of Jim Furyk must necessarily drop eight points on Sunday 12 at simple times to preserve the trophies.
Fleetwood is the first European recruit to drop four points, while Molinari and he, named Molliwood after a failed weekend, are only the second pair in Ryder Cup's history to get four points during their first four matches.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed during the fourballs, they beat the pair of American beginner Bryson Dechambeau and a Woods already tired of 5 and 4 even more categorically.
Woods, who was betrayed during the two Saturday matches, shined a few times, but now he lost 19 of his 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes, and seven fans.
Justin Rose, well-restrained for the morning fourballs, teamed with Henrik Stenson in the foursomes, winning victory 2 to 1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, respectively number one and three in the world ranking.
Europe was not spared during the tournament that took place in southwestern Paris, in a fresh but relaxed time.
The triple winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas established the reference for Americans by marking two points on Saturday.
They won a well-deserved 2-1 victory against the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and again beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the foursomes, who lost the first two holes.
Twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, a team recovered from a four-point gap in simple, although the Furyk team, which held the crown, had no more than to make a zero match to preserve its trophy.
After having been a second for two days, however, they could not give up a Sunday counterattack.
North Korea states that "no case" disarmament cannot be done unilaterally without confidence.
On Saturday, the North Korean Minister for Foreign Affairs told the United Nations that maintaining sanctions would strengthen his confidence in the United States and that it would be impossible for his country to give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under those circumstances.
At the annual General Assembly of the World Organization, Ri Yong Ho stated that North Korea had last year taken "significant measures of good will" such as stopping nuclear and missile testing, decommissioning of the nuclear testing site and its commitment not to proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we do not see any corresponding responses from the United States," he regretted.
In the absence of confidence in the United States, we will fear for our national security and, under such circumstances, we are excluded from being the first to disarm ourselves unilaterally."
While reiterating the well-known complaints of North Korea regarding Washington's opposition to a "step-by-step" denuclearization approach that North Korea would be rewarded if it took steps, its statement was important that it did not reject the idea of unilateral denuclearization as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong One and Donald Trump, made on 12 June in Singapore at the first summit between an American president in exercise and a North Korean leader, when Kim committed to working for a "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised to ensure the security of North Korea.
North Korea is seeking to officially put an end to the Korean war (1950-1953), but the United States stated that Pyongyang should first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington also refused requests to alleviate severe international sanctions against North Korea.
The United States insists that North Korea should first proceed to denuclearization and stress pressure by imposing sanctions to achieve its goal in a coercive manner, even opposed to "the declaration of the end of war".
“Those who think that these sanctions can make us suffer do not know us.
The problem is that maintaining sanctions increases our confidence."
Ri made no comment about the second summit between Kim and Trump launched before the United Nations by the US leader earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, and added: "If the party concerned by the issue of denuclearization was South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be in such an impasse."
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri's speech was radically different from that of last year, when he stated before the United Nations General Assembly that it was inevitable to point North Korean missiles on North American territory after President Trump qualified Kim as a "mission man" in a suicide mission.
Trump, who had threatened last year in front of the United Nations to "completely destroy" North Korea, did not commend this year on the courage with which Kim applied measures for disarmament, but added that there was still much to be done and that sanctions would not be lifted until North Korea was disarmed.
Wednesday, Trump said that no time limit had been set. "It can take two years, three years or five months; it doesn't matter," he said.
China and Russia support that the United Nations Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said last Thursday to the United Nations Security Council that: "The implementation of the Security Council's sanctions must be firmly and systematically maintained until total, final and verified denuclearization."
The Security Council has consistently strengthened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in order to stifle the financing of Pyongyang nuclear programmes and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met Ri on the side of the United Nations General Assembly and then announced that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit.
This year Pompeo has already gone to North Korea three times, but his last trip was a bit disastrous.
In July, he left Pyongyang, claiming that progress had been made, but in the hours that followed, North Korea denounced its "gangster methods".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea committed itself to dismantle a missile site as well as a nuclear complex if the United States took "equivalent measures".
According to the South Korean President, Kim claims the security guarantees promised by Trump in Singapore, and efforts to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard: Students take rest classes
This year, Harvard University has established a new course that allows all first-cycle students to sleep more and fight the growing masquerade trend that involves studying caffeine consumption all night.
One professor noted that most students from the best university in the world do not know how to take care of them
This course, designed by Charles Cheisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, is said to be the first of the kind in the United States.
It was after giving a conference on the effects of sleep deprivation on the learning that the idea came
At the end, a student approached me and said, "Why are you telling me this only last year?"
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
Spended for the first time this year, this course explains to students the need to adopt good sleep habits to improve their school and physical performance, as well as their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Director General of University Health Services, said that the university had decided to introduce the course after finding that students suffered from a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The course time consists of various interactive exercises.
One of the sections presents the picture of a dormitory containing various objects (café cups, dishes, basketball, books...) on which students click to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on their physical performance and the importance of integrating a routine before bed.
In another section, participants learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, AVC, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus with interactive icons then invites participants to reflect on their daily routine.
"We know that this will not change students' behavior instantly.
However, we believe that they have the right to know this information - in the same way as you have the right to know what the effects of smoking on health are," added Professor Cheisler.
According to him, the culture of pride of "during a white night" still exists, and it adds that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students make the lack of sleep a growing problem.
Having sufficient sleep and good quality should be the "secret weapon" of students to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety, has he said - even to avoid taking weight, because the lack of sleep makes the brain in iniquitous, making them hungry forever.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian chemistry and physical biology student, helped Professor Cheisler design this course after being one of his students last year, during his first year at Harvard.
He said that this course had opened his eyes and moved him to insist that it be offered to the whole campus.
He hoped that the next step would be to propose to all third-cycle students to follow a similar programme of studies before joining the institution.
Professor Cheisler recommends that students provide both for bedtime and wake-up time and for awareness of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED light, which can disrupt their circadian rhythm and cause sleep disorders.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers : The goal of Menga causes the men of Gerard to fall
The Rangers came up with a new blow outside, the Dolly Menga attack that led Steven Gerrard's disarmed team in Livingstone to a 1-0 defeat.
Ibrox's team was hoping to record its first move victory since its 4-1 triumph in St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team attacked Gerrard in his second defeat in 18 matches as a coach, leaving his team at the draw, eight points behind the Hearts, teachers of the Ladbroke Premiership.
Menga hit seven minutes before the mid-time and the Rangers team, short of inspiration, failed to equalize.
While the Rangers are now falling in sixth place, Livingston stands in third position, right behind Hibernian on the goal difference.
And other difficulties could be felt for the Rangers, the arbitrator Calum Spence who had to be cared for for a head injury following the throwing of an object from the opposite side.
Gerrard made eight changes in the team, which scored Ayr in the semi-final of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, regarding him, chose the same Livi 11 that picked a point at the Hearts last week and would have been delighted to see his well-trained team pushing his opponents on each turn.
The Rangers may have mastered the balloon, but Livingston did more.
They should have marked in two minutes, when Menga's first shot sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the field environment let his chance pass.
Keaghan Jacobs then shot a powerful blow in the direction of Captain Craig Halkett, but his co-sponsor Alan Lithgow could only reach the second pole
The Rangers managed to take control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he should have been given a penalty after the frank blow when Steven Lawless and he got into conflict with him, but Arbitrary Steven Thomson dismissed Colombia's requests.
The Rangers only took advantage of two shots in the first period, but the former guard of Ibrox, Liam Kelly, was barely disturbed by Lassana Coulibaly and an Ovie Ejaria hit.
If the opening of the score by Livi at the 34th minute was registered against the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it by their hard work.
Once again, the Rangers failed to face Jacobs' stopped kick.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher gave the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his cold blood to choose Menga for a simple end.
Gerrard reacted in the mid-term by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the exchange failed to have an immediate impact when the oil was presented to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly rushed to block.
Livingstone continued to push visitors to play exactly the type of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett dancing long balls on long balls.
Holt's team could have taken advantage in the last few moments, but McGregor got along well to push Jacobs off before Lithgow gets past the target.
The Rangers' replacement, Glenn Middleton, once again claimed a penalty at the end of the game while he was in custody with Jacobs, but Thomson ignored it again.
Germanach : The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, a page by our German "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and THE COMPUTER TOURNE... was born by the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm " Hans" Geiger, Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity; an invention that subsequently gave birth to the device known as Geiger Count.
Since then, Count Geiger has also become fundamental in pop culture, as can be seen in the 1950's Bells of Coronado, with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, two unlikely scientists:
One man said, "What is this?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, it's used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
Thanks to these listeners, you can really hear the effects of atoms released into the minerals by radioactivity."
Evans said, "Well, that's right, that's right!"
“ Hans ” Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd anniversary.
But the invention that bears his name remains.
A new cancer vaccine allows the immune system to "discover" cancer cells
A new cancer vaccine allows the immune system to "discover" cancer cells and kill them
During treatment, the vaccine indicates to the immune system how to recognize cancer cells
This technique is to extract immune cells from a patient and modify them into a laboratory
They can then "detect" a protein that is common to many cancers, and are then re-injected
An experimental vaccine shows encouraging results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who received the vaccine, whose goal is to learn from the immune system to recognize cancer cells, has seen her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method is to extract immune cells from a patient and modify them into laboratories so that they can detect HER2 protein, common to many cancers, and finally inject them again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Institute of Cancer based in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
According to Professor Berzofsky, HER2 protein "makes an increase in several types of cancer", including breast, ovaries, lung and colorectal cancer.
A similar approach, consisting of the collection of immune cells to "learn" them to target cancer cells, has shown evidence in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Caffeinated with a MAGA casket, Kanye West launched itself into a Pro-Trump diatribe after its passage to the SNL.
That didn't happen.
Kanye West moved on to the platform after a run-off performance during which he praised US President Donald Trump during a Saturday Night Live and announced that he was going to present himself to the 2020 elections.
After his third piece, Ghost Town, that he sang by wearing a Make America Great Again, West took it to the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“Sometimes I talk to Whites and they say, “How can you love Trump? He’s a racist!”
"Well, if racism was bothering me, I would have left America for a long time," he said.
The SNL issue started with a sketch by Matt Damon in which the Hollywood Vedet mocks Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate's Judicial Committee on the allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it had not been disseminated, the recording of the West Diatribe was released on social media by comedy Chris Rock.
We don't know if Rock was gonna make fun of West with this publication.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had spent a bad quarter of an hour in the hives because of his helmet.
“They pressured me.
They told me not to come with this helmet on my head.
They put pressure on me!
And then they say I'm in a holster," he says, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see him, houfre?" and said that he would wear his superman's coat, because no one can dictate his actions.
Try love."
His comments drew him bones at least twice on the public side and the members of the SNL seemed embarrassed, Variety reports. On-the-spot person said to the magazine: "A silence of death fell on the entire board."
West had been called to replace the last minute singer Ariana Grande, whose former little friend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
West has disarmed a lot of people by singing song I Love it in a Perrier bottle suit.
West received the support of the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who published the following tweet: "To one of the bravest spirits: Thank YOU FOR HAVING THE FOULE."
But Karen Hunter, the show's animator, tweeted that West was just "loyal to himself, and that it's absolutely wonderful."
"However, I choose not to reward someone (by buying his music, his clothes, or by supporting his art) who, in my opinion, adopts and rejects a harmful ideology for my community.
He's free.
And so did we," she added.
Before the show, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and claimed that he was now "officially known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows Diddy's tracks, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The rapper Snoop Dogg bore the name of Snoop Lion and of course the legendary Prince fire, who changed his name into a symbol, then that of the artist previously known as Prince.

Kit Harington, the Vedette of the Game of Thrones series, takes it to the toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for its fine blade role, Jon Snow in the Game of Thrones, the fantastic HBO's violent medieval series.
But the 31-year-old actor took it to the stereotype of the macho hero, claiming that this kind of role on the screen often brings young boys to play for cooking hard to respect.
In an interview with Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he said "something is wrong" and addressed the issue of toxic masculinity at the time of #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married Rose Leslie, covette of Game of Thrones, also aged 31, admitted that he had "firmly" to address this issue.
“ Personally, I think deeply that we have abused masculinity.”
"What lessons have we learned from young men who become adults compared to the problem now?"
According to Kit, television could be partly responsible for increasing male toxicity due to its very male characters.
He continued: "What behavior is inborn, what behavior has been conceived?
What do television and street teach young boys who encourage them to think they have to behave like that to be a man?
I believe that this is really one of the fundamental issues of our time - how can we change this?
There is obviously something that is belligerent."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not do prologues or sequels when the series would end next summer, claiming to have ended with "the battlefields and horses".
As of November, Kit will see a resumption of True West, Sam Shepard, who tells the story of a film producer and his brother, a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that the meeting with his wife Rose was for him the best thing that ever happened to him in Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in this series, so she offered me my future family and my life ahead," he says.
Rose interpreted Ygritte, the character lover of Kit, Jon Snow, into the fantastic series that won an Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 in Scotland, in the family area of Leslie.
HIV / AIDS: China reports an increase of 14 per cent of new cases
China reported an increase of 14 per cent of its HIV and AIDS population.
According to the Chinese health authorities, more than 820,000 people are involved.
Nearly 40,000 new cases were reported during the second quarter of 2018.
Most patients were contaminated during sexual intercourse, which is a new fact.
Historically, the virus spread rapidly in certain regions of the country following contaminated blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV has been reduced to virtually zero, according to the Chinese health authorities at a conference held in Yunnan Province.
However, from one year to the next, the number of HIV-positive and AIDS-affected persons in China increased by 100,000.
In the Chinese LGBT community, the transmission of HIV through sex is a serious problem.
Homosexuality was criminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community remains widespread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70 to 90 per cent of homosexuals end up marrying a woman.
Many cases of transmission are due to inadequate sexual protection.
As part of its efforts to combat this problem, the Chinese Government has since 2003 promised universal access to HIV drugs.
Maxine Waters argues that an employee of the GOP has disclosed information about senators, and denounces "dangerous lies" and "theory of conspiracy".
On Saturday, American Republican Maxine Waters denounced the allegations that a member of his team would have published personal information about three republican senators on the Wikipedia page for legislators.
The Los Angeles Democrat stated that these statements were supported by "extremely right" experts and websites.
"Frequent lies, lies, and still lies" Waters responded in a statement on Twitter.
It would appear that the information disclosed included US senators' address and phone numbers. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was posted on Thursday by an unknown person in Capitol Hill during the Senate meeting on allegations of sexual assault against the candidate at the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
The escape took place some time after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
According to Hill, conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState indicated that the IP address identifying the source of the messages was associated with the Waters office and disclosed information from a Waters staff member.
According to Waters, "this unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie".
"The member of my team, whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised by these false and false allegations, is in no way responsible for the escape of this information."
"This false claim is completely false and a true lie."
Waters' statement quickly provoked online criticism, including on Ari Fleischer's side, the former press attached to the White House.
"This disgrace is from anger," he wrote.
"This indicates that she does not have the temperament needed to be a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of something she has not done, she must not be angry.
She shouldn't be provocative.
She must not question the accused's motives.
She has to stay calm and calm. ”
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to the democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, accused of being too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate at Waters headquarters during the mid-term elections, also shared his thoughts on Twitter.
"If it's true, it's huge," he wrote on Twitter.
In his statement, Waters indicated that his office had warned "the authorities and services responsible for the implementation of the laws concerned" about these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that the guilty are exposed," she added, "and that they are held responsible for all their destructive and dangerous acts for all members of my team."
Johnny English hit again. Parody of Rowan Atkinson, Deputy Spy
It has now become a tradition to search for the scope of Brexit in any new British film and this seems to apply to this resume of the Johnny English action comedy, which started in 2003 with Johnny English and resurfaced in 2011 with Johnny English, the return.
Will the ironic self-satisfaction on the issue of the evidence of our insignificance represent our country's new export opportunity?
In all cases, the incompetent Johnny English, with her head up and her rubber face, has seen her license renewed for the second time in a confused context - this name indicating first of all that this is a great comic creation designed for a non-anglophone film audience.
Of course, he is the stupid secret agent who, despite his suspicious attempts of glamorous charmer, has a bit of Clouseau, a suspect by Mr Bean and a good dose of the type that runs a small note in Les Chariots at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympic Games.
Originally, he is also inspired by the traveler and man of international mystery that Atkinson once played in the television ads Barclaycard, now forgotten, leaving chaos behind him.
The last Johnny English has one or two pleasant moments.
I loved Johnny English as he approached a helicopter while he was wearing a medieval armor and the rotor blades hit his helmet briefly.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is appreciated, although humor is rather insufficient and strangely superfluous, especially at a time when "serious" licenses like 007 and impossible Mission are composed in full trust with comedy.
Humour seems to be more focused on children than on adults and, for me, Johnny English's dazzling measles are less creative and less targeted than Atkinson's moving filmgags in Bean's character.
The perpetuity of news is that Britain has serious problems.
A computer pirate has infiltrated the British spy super-secret web network, revealing the identity of all British agents on the ground, to the great development of the agents in service - a very strong role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the drop that makes the vase pour out for a prime minister who is a pumping character on the edge of the crisis and who already suffers from political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives the best of herself with this almost-Teresa-May character, but there's no big deal to put himself under the scene.
Its advisors are informed of the information that each active spy who has been compromised must bring out one of its retirees.
This means that Johnny English himself must be disturbed, who is now employed in a chic institution as a school teacher, but who secretly teaches lessons about how to become a secret agent: some beautiful farce here, because English offers a high-school scholarship like Rock Academy.
English returned to Whitehall for an emergency information meeting and found Bough, his former long-haired partner, again camped by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, connected to a submarine commander, a fun hockey baton role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
Thus, Batman and Robin, who create great sorrows to His Majesty's secret services, go back to action and meet Olga Kurylenko, the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletin.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister is dangerously under the leadership of the technological billionaire charisma, which is said to be capable of solving Britain's computer problems: the Jason Volta disaster, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough launch their odyssation of dazzling jokes: under the decoy of servers, they light up a French restaurant; they create chaos by faking on Volta's luxurious sailing; and English launches a real anarchy when he tries, with a helmet of virtual reality, to get familiar with the interior of Volta's house.
All arrests are secured for this last sequence, but despite all this, there are no bad things for children in all of this.
A rather moderate movie.
I couldn't stop thinking, as for Johnny English's other films: can't the British film industry offer Rowan Atkinson a role that will really enhance his talent?
The Working Party has refused to draw up a plan for the British to work for four days but to be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's working party must consider a radical plan that will allow the British to work four days a week - but to be paid for five.
Apparently, the party wants business leaders to benefit workers from the economies generated by artificial intelligence (IA) by giving them an additional day of leave.
This would allow employees to enjoy a weekend of three days, while still touching the same salary.
According to some sources, the idea would be consistent with the party's economic programme and plans to guide the country in favour of workers.
The four-day shift was approved by the union congress as a means for workers to benefit from economic change.
An important source within the Labour Party stated in Sunday Times: “A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.”
"This will not happen overnight, but a four-day work week is a goal that will match the party's approach to rebalancing the economy for workers as well as its overall industrial strategy."
The Working Party would not be the first to support this idea, as the Green Party was committed to a four-day work week during its 2017 general election campaign.
However, this aspirations are not currently supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A spokesperson for the Labour Party said: "A four-day work week is not a party policy and is not envisaged by the party."
Deputy Chancellor John McDonnell took advantage of the last week's labour conference to give details of his vision of a socialist economic revolution.
Mr. McDonnell stated that he was determined to regain the power of "anonymous administrators" and "profit-makers" in public utility companies.
The plans of the deputy chancellor also provide that current shareholders of the water companies may not recover all of their deployment as the labour force could operate "deductions" due to alleged conduction gaps.
It also confirmed its employee integration plan in corporate boards, as well as the creation of an inclusive shareholder fund that will pay 10% of the capital of private companies to employees, which will cover up to £500 dividends per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy trust "60 minutes" if the FBI's investigation on Kavanaugh could change their views.
The final vote on Brett Kavanaugh's appointment to the Supreme Court was postponed at least one week after the FBI's investigation into the charges against him and raised the question of whether the Office's findings could encourage Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In a public interview on Sunday, Scott Pelley, the correspondent of the "60 Minutes" program, asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find out anything that would lead them to change their mind.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
“ Of course, ” says Kennedy.
"When I went to the hearing, I said I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, when these allegations were made, and I asked him, "Did you do this?"
He was resolved, determined, without any doubt."
However, Graham's vote appears to be engraved in the stone.
"I made my decision about Brett Kavanaugh and it would take an explosive charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett categorically denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And the people she named couldn't verify it.
It's a 36-year-old case.
I can't see anything else that changes."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event with a very impressive palmaret of stars and an equally impressive mission: to end poverty in the world.
The Global Citizen Festival, now in its seventh edition, will see tens of thousands of people heading to the Great Lawn in Central Park to not only benefit from the performance of artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real objective of the festival, namely to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, whose first edition took place in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international group of defenses that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people who actively fight it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you are ready to pay a VIP ticket), spectators had to perform a series of tasks, or "actions", such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, calling or making any other effort to raise awareness of poverty.
But to what extent can the Global Citizen organization still achieve its objective in the 12 years that remain?
Is the idea to reward people with a free concert really allowing them to persuade them to demand a call for action, or is it just another example of "clickivism" - a situation in which people really intend to make the difference by signing a petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has recorded more than 19 million "actions" on the part of its participants, which advocates many different goals.
According to the organization, these actions have helped to encourage global leaders to make commitments and adopt policies of more than $37 billion that should change the lives of more than 2.25 billion by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and announcements arising from its actions, with a tranche of at least $10 billion already being disbursed or raised.
The group believes that the guaranteed funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Among the main commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a British partnership of investors and executives who committed themselves to "helping children develop their full potential", while promising to help Rwanda 35 million pounds of Sterling to end malnutrition in this country after receiving over 4,700 messages from Global Citizens.
"Thanks to the support of the British government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a bottom note in history," said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition at a concert held in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that following more than 5,000 actions to seek to improve nutrition for mothers and children in the United Kingdom, the government announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will benefit 5 million women and children in nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on his website, "What makes you think it is possible to end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen said: "The way to get there will be long and difficult, sometimes we will fall and fail.
However, like the major civil rights defence movements and the fight against apartheid before us, we will get there, because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists that will take place this year in New York, where Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman will host the show.
The United States could call on the Navy to create a "block" to prevent Russian energy exports - Secretary-in-Office
In order to prevent Russian energy from entering the markets, including in the Middle East, Washington can "if necessary" appeal to the US Navy, Ryan Zinke, the US Secretary of the Interior, quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke said that Russia's presence in Syria - particularly where it operates at the request of the legitimate government - is a pretext that enables it to explore new energy markets.
"I think they are in the Middle East in order to negotiate energy as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern centre of Europe," he would have said.
According to the official representative, there are ways to remedy it.
"The United States can, with our Marine, ensure that the maritime routes are open and, if necessary, obstruct them in order to ensure that their energy is not placed on the market," he added.
Zinke addressed participants to the event held by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that is defined as the "power consumers' spokesperson" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, stressing that they are actually identical.
"As regards Iran and Russia, the economic option is more or less in the exploitation and replacement of fuels," he said, while referring to Russia, saying that it has "more than one string at its arc" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump administration has committed itself to boost the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia with a much less expensive solution for European consumers.
To do this, the representatives of the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, tried to convince Germany to leave the "inappropriate" project of the North Stream 2 pipeline, which, according to Trump, makes the city of Berlin "prisoner" in Moscow.
On several occasions, Moscow stressed that North Stream 2 pipeline worth $11 billion, which should double the current capacity to reach 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is simply motivated by economic reasons and is an example of disloyal competition.
In a speech delivered in September in Moscow following a meeting with Rick Perry, the US Energy Secretary, Russian Energy Minister Alexandre Novak said, "I think we share this opinion that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers."
The position of the United States has led to negative reactions on the part of Germany, which reaffirmed its involvement in the project.
The main German industrial organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), called on the United States not to become involved in European energy policy or in bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have an enormous problem when a third country interferes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, director of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putine.
Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider presenting himself to the 2020 presidential elections, says the Senator of Massachusetts
The Senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that she would seriously consider presenting herself to the presidential elections following the mid-term elections.
At a public assembly in Holyoke, in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would dream of presenting herself.
"The time has come for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and for this, a woman must be at the top," says The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will seriously consider presenting my candidacy to the presidents."
Warren said what she thought of President Donald Trump at the public meeting, saying he was "leading this country in the wrong direction".
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren was frank in his criticism of Trump and of the candidate to the Supreme Court of this one, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, in a Twitter message, Warren said: "Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren's voters do not feel that they should present themselves in 2020.
According to a survey by the Political Research Centre of the University of Suffolk and Boston Globe, 58% of the "probable" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not appear.
32% were in favour of such a campaign.
The survey revealed that former Governor Deval Patrick was more supported, with 38% in favour of a potential campaign and 48% against it.
Among the other names of democrats very much mentioned for a potential campaign in 2020 are former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden said he would take an official decision by January.
Sarah Palin calls the PTSD of Track Palin during Donald Trump's meeting
Track Palin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after his enrolment in September.
On Monday evening, he was arrested and accused of domestic violence.
"What my own son is experiencing right now, what he feels when he comes back, I can relate it to other families that feel the consequences of the PTSD and some of the injuries that our soldiers are returning with," she said to the public at the Donald Trump meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin described his arrest as "the subject of taboo" and said about his son and other former combatants that "they are becoming a little different, tough, wondering whether they respect what their friends and members of the Air Force, and each other military, have given to the country."
According to Dan Bennett, a spokesperson for the Wasilla police service, he was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of assault and marital violence on a woman, which interferes with a report of marital violence and possession of a drunken weapon.
18 States and the District of Colombia are in favour of a judicial challenge to the new asylum policy
18 States and the District of Colombia are in favour of a judicial challenge to the new U.S. policy that refuses asylum for victims of gang violence or domestic violence.
On Friday in Washington, representatives of the 18 States and the district filed a memorandum in favour of an asylum seeker who challenged this policy, NBC News reported.
The complainant's full name in Grace v. Sessions opened in August by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy was not disclosed.
She stated that her partner "and her sons, members of violent gangs", had attacked her, but the American authorities decided to reject her application for asylum on 20 July.
She was arrested in Texas.
The prosecutors of States supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generated a large number of asylum applications in the United States, such as countries facing widespread gangs and marital violence.
The new U.S. policy on asylum was annulled by the Immigration Appeals Council in 2014, which authorized clandestine immigrants fleeing marital violence to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, the District Attorney General of Columbia, said on Friday in a statement that the new policy “neglects decades of state, federal and international law”.
"The federal law stipulates that all asylum applications must be examined on the basis of the particular facts and circumstances of the application, and such a prohibition violates this principle," said the curiae friend in his memory.
Lawyers have also supported in the memory that the policy of refusal to enter immigrants nights in the US economy, arguing that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and to "provide the necessary work".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing marital violence and gang violence.
"The asylum is granted to those who leave their country of origin because of persecution or fear for reasons of race, belief, nationality, belonging to a particular social group or political convictions," said Sessions, on 11 June, in its announcement of that policy.
"The asylum has never been designed to alleviate all the problems -- even the most serious -- that people meet every day in the world."
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu while the number of double deaths in the race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is becoming more and more dramatic.
"I feel very inclined," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old family mother, comforting her little feverish boy in Palu, in a waste city evacuation center.
"At every moment, an ambulance brings bodies back.
The clean water is rare."
Residents were seen going to their ruined homes, collecting property and trying to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by magnitude 7.5 earthquake were submerged.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Harris, who suffered from a fracture from the back and shoulders, lay in front of the Palu military hospital, where the patients were treated outside due to strong persistent replicas.
The tears filled his eyes when he told how he had felt the violent earthquake that shook the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I was smashed into the ruins of the wall, I believe," Haris entrusted to Associated Press, stating that his family was in town for a marriage.
"I heard my wife call for help, but after silence.
I don't know what happened to him or my child.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. Ambassador accuses China of "intimacy" through "advertising advertising"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published four pages of advertisements featuring the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China in an American daily, the US Ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to the supplement paid by China Daily in the Des Moines Register - the most sold newspaper in Iowa - after accusing China of trying to interfere in the US parliamentary elections of 6 November, an accusation that China rejects.
By accusing Beijing of wanting to join the U.S. elections, Trump noted what US officials told Reuters to be a new phase in a growing campaign carried out by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently paralyzed in a growing trade war that has led them to apply reciprocal tariffs to their imports.
At the beginning of the trade war, China's tariff measures were aimed at hitting State exporters such as Iowa, who supported the Republican Party of Trump, said Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and former Iowa long-standing governor, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said that Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad writes in an opinion article published in the Des Moines Register Sunday, "is in the process of doubling its intimidation by publishing propaganda in our own free press".
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the American tradition of freedom of expression and freedom of the press by introducing paid advertising in the Des Moines Register," Branstad writes.
"On the other hand, in Beijing's press outlet, you will find little contestant voice and will not see the true reflection of the divergent views that Chinese may have on the Chinese economic trajectory, because the media is firmly obeying the Chinese Communist Party," he writes.
He added that "one of China's most important newspapers has avoided publishing" his article, without saying which newspaper.
Analysts warn that Republicans attract electricians to the mid-term elections due to the failure of Kavanaugh
While many high-ranking Republicans defend Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court in a context of allegations of sexual aggression, analysts have warned that a negative reaction, especially in women, could occur during the next mid-term elections.
The feelings surrounding this case have been extremely intense, and most Republicans have already publicly shown that they wanted the vote to take place.
In an article published on 29 September in The Hill, Grant Reeher, professor of political sciences at Maxwell University School of Syracuse said "we cannot go back".
Reeher added that he doubted that the last minute's efforts by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) in favor of an FBI investigation were sufficient to calm down voters' anger.
According to Karine Jean-Pierre, National Chief Advisor and spokesperson for the Progressive Group MoveOn, "Women will not forget what happened yesterday; they will not forget it tomorrow, nor in November," she said last September 28 according to the Washington newspaper.
On Friday morning, Mic's report, the protesters sang "The month of November is coming!" in the course of the Senate, while the Republicans of the Judicial Committee chose to advance Kavanaugh's appointment despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
"The enthusiasm and democratic motivation will be measured," said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst.
"People say it's already high, it's true.
But this could be even higher, especially in the electors of the banlieus and young voters from 18 to 29 years of age who, even if they don't like the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public statement explaining in detail the allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court's appointment, analysts suggested that the reaction might be alive if Republicans were to advance confirmation.
According to NBC News, former president of the Republican National Committee, Michael Steele, said at the beginning of last week that "It has become a confused disorder for the GOP".
"This is not only the vote of the committee or the final vote, nor the appointment of Kavanaugh. It is also the way the Republicans managed the situation and the way they dealt with it," said Guy Cecil, Director of the United States Priorities, a group that helps elected Democrats in the television newspaper.
However, following the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, the Americans appear to be divided about the credibility of the two parties, a small majority focusing on the latter.
A new YouTube survey revealed that 41 per cent of the people consulted believed absolutely or probably in Ford's testimony, while 35 per cent claimed to believe absolutely or probably Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 per cent claimed that Kavanaugh had probably or absolutely lied during his testimony, while only 30 per cent claimed the same thing about Ford.
According to The Guardian, the FBI investigates allegations made by Ford and at least another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, after Senator Flake's pressures.
Ford testified under oath last week in front of the Senate Judicial Committee that she had been assaulted by Kavanaugh while he was drunk at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that when they studied Yale in the 1980s, the candidate at the Supreme Court would have shown him his genital parts during a party.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a New Internet to deface Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a new company that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that takes advantage of the free platform Solid de Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored as well as persons authorized to access such information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee said in a joke that Inrupt intended to "dominating the world".
"We have to do it now," he said about the launch.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own "personal data store online" or DPL.
This may include contact lists, task lists, a calendar, a music library as well as other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available at the same time on a single browser.
The particularity of the online personal data store is that it belongs entirely to the user to decide which type of information can be accessed.
The company calls this "personal responsibility through data".
According to the company's PDG, John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is that the company provides appropriate resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers working on the project and a voluntary coder community.
As of this week, technological developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralised applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that his team and his team are not yet in a discussion with " Facebook and Google" to know whether or not to operate a complete change where all their business models are completely camouflaged in a moment.
"We do not ask for their permission."
In a Saturday article on Medium, Berners-Lee writes that "the [inrupt] mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem in order to protect the integrity and quality of the new website built on Solid".
In 1994, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by creating the World Wide Web Consortium.
Over the last few months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on network neutrality.
Although he has launched Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely optimistic about this new era of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of an ecclesiastical of World War I decorated by the Victoria Cross
The only ecclesiastical of the Church of England to have received the Cross of Victoria during World War I as a fighter was celebrated in its hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann won this distinction on September 29, 1918, during the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by an elite shooter four days later and ignored that he had obtained the highest British military distinction.
His two grandsons opened a memorial stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, last Saturday.
Michael Vann, one of his grandsons, said he was "bright symbolic" to reveal the stone exactly 100 years after his grandfather's exploitation.
According to London Gaza, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion on the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a very thick fog and under the violent shot of cannons and machine guns".
Later, he rushed on the shooting line and, with the "greatest bravery", guided the line before making a cannon jump to him alone and snatch three soldiers from the detachment.
On October 4, 1918, a German elite shooter killed Lieutenant-Colonel Vann, a little over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "a thing at the height of which I will never be, but that makes me humble".
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also filed a crown after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann confided that he felt "very honored to be part of the parade" and added that "the courage of an authentic hero is reflected in the support that will be given to him by many people".
The fans of mixed martial arts stayed awake all night to watch Bellator 206. Instead, they had Peppa Pig
Imagine that, you spent all night looking at a well filled Bellator 206, but you couldn't see the main event.
In San José, the event had 13 fights, including six on the main record, and was broadcast live throughout the night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6:00 in the morning, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were ready to face, the United Kingdom TV viewers were seated when the broadcast changed for Peppa Pig.
Some were unhappy to be awake until the early hours of the morning, especially for combat.
A Twitter supporter described the passage to an animated drawing for children as "a kind of bad joke".
Regarding the transmission, the chief marketing and communications vice-president of Bellator, Dave Schwartz, said that "the government regulation provides that at 6 a.m. this content was not adapted, so they had to bask on children's emissions."
"Peppa the Pig," yes. "
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said they were going to work on their programming in order to include British television viewers in the future.
“I think that when I think about the redistribution, I think we can probably find a solution,” Coker said.
“However, it is six o’clock in the morning one Sunday and we will not be able to find a solution before Sunday’s hour, or Monday’s hour.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program went off, there were lots of messages in both ways and they weren't all friends.
We tried to repair, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't a problem, it was a government issue.
I can assure you this won't happen next time.
We will limit ourselves to five fights instead of six - as we do as usual - and we have tried to give more for the fans and we have failed everything.
It's a sad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "less" on sexuality
The Olympic swimmer Tom Daley claims to have grown up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality - but this has given him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old man said he didn't realize before going to high school that "everybody wasn't like me."
As part of the first broadcast of Radio 4 Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he had talked about the issue of the rights of homosexuals to give others the "hope".
He also said that becoming a parent made him less interested in winning the Olympics.
The usual broadcaster, Kirsty Young, took a few months leave because of her illness.
As a shipmate in Laverne's first show, Daley confided that he felt "less than" all the other children growing up because "it was not socially acceptable to love boys and girls".
He said, "Even today, these feelings of being inferior and different are the real things that gave me the power and strength needed to succeed."
In order not to disappoint everyone when they finally learned the truth about his sexuality, he wanted to prove that he was "something," he continued.
The double Olympic bronze medallion is now a renowned LGBT militant and has benefited from his participation this year in the Commonwealth Games in Australia in order to demand a greater number of countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he was speaking because he felt that he was able to live openly without ramifications and that he wanted to give “hope” to others.
The world's triple champion said he "did not expect" to fall in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, met in 2013
Daley married Oscar's 20-year-old winner last year, but he said the age difference was never a problem.
"When we saw so many things at such a young age" - he participated in his first Olympic Games at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said he trusted that it was difficult to find a person of the same age who knew the same height and bottom.
In June, they became parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that "all his prospects" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, I just thought of winning a gold medal," he said.
"You know what, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic Gold Medal is Robbie."
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 years from the onset of brain cancer.
Daley confided that his father did not accept that he was going to die and that one of the last things he asked him was whether they had already their tickets for London 2012, because he wanted to be in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him, "Dad, you won't be there anymore to be in the first row," he said.
"I held him by the hand when he stopped breathing and he had to stop breathing and die to finally recognize that he was not invincible," he added.
The following year, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"That's all I've dreamed of my whole life - diving in front of a crowd at home at the Olympics, there's nothing better," he said.
In addition, this inspired his first song - Heather Small's Proud - which accompanied him in preparations for the Olympics and always gave him chicken meat.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11.15, BST.
A Mickelson out of shape on the Ryder Cup bank Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will record this Sunday by playing his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to recover to avoid this is an unfortunate step.
Mickelson, who participated in the two-year competition for the twelfth time, a record, was dismissed by Captain Jim Furyk of the football and football on Saturday.
Instead of being at the heart of the action, as it has so often been for the United States, the fifth major champion shared his day between the role of supporting and paupering his game at the stand in order to remedy his ills.
He was never the biggest of the teachers, even at the top of his career. At 48 years of age, he was not the most suitable for the difficult Golf National, where the long rough systematically penalizes the severed blows.
And as if the course wasn't quite reductible in itself, Mickelson, during the ninth Sunday match, confronts Francesco Molinari, British Open winner, who teamed up with Tommy Fleetwood this week to win their four matches.
If the Americans, four down at the beginning of the 12 simple games, take a good start, the Mickelson match could be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed his confidence in his man, but he couldn't say anything else.
"He fully understood the role he had to play today, gave me a tape in my back, put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has great confidence in him.
It's a legendary champion and he's added so many things to these teams in the past, just like this week.
I probably didn't see him playing two games.
I expected more, but that's how it happened and that's how we thought we should do it.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else."
Sunday, Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record of the biggest number of meetings of the contested Ryder Cup.
This could mark the end of a career at the Ryder Cup that has never completely reached the heights of its individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 defeats and seven casualties, although Furyk has claimed that his presence has brought concrete elements to the team.
He's funny, sarcastic, spiritual, he likes to mock people, and he's a great guy to have in the team room," he explained.
“I think the younger players enjoyed measuring themselves to him this week, which was fun to see.
He does much more than play. ”
European Selection Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the advance could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European Captain, knows from experience that an unforgivable advance before the simples of the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a painful course.
The Danois competed in his first match in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team whose captain was Seve Ballesteros had five front points on the Americans, but finally jumped in the head of the ranking with the lowest possible distance on the finish line, with 1411⁄2-1311⁄2.
"You don't stop remembering that we were taking to Valderrama widely; we had a big advance in Brooklyn, where we failed, as well as Valderrama, where we won, but of justice," said Bjorn, after observing the 2018 ranking win 5-3 at both Friday and yesterday at the National Golf to take 10-6.
The story will prove to me and all the members of this team that this is not the end.
Go to the bottom of it tomorrow.
Go and do whatever it takes.
It's not over until you have the points on the table.
We have a goal, that is to try to win this trophy, and that is where we need to stay focused.
I have always said to focus on the 12 players in our camp, but we are very aware of what is happening on the other side - they are the best players in the world."
Ravi’s performance on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never go forward on this point.
Tomorrow, it's another pair of sleeves.
Tomorrow, these are the individual performances that will be presented and it goes otherwise.
It's great to be with a team when things go well, but when you're there alone, you're tested to the height of your full capacity as a golfer.
Here's the message to get to the players, it's to get the best of you tomorrow.
When we leave his partner behind, he must go get the best of himself, too."
Unlike Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will seek to ensure that his players get better results individually than as teammates, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have won three points on four.
Furyk himself knew the two extremes of these returns the last day, after being part of the winning team in Brooklyn before losing at the end of the "Miracle de Médinah", where Europe has won the victory.
"I remember every word," he explained in answer to the question of how Captain Ben Crenshaw, in 1999, had done to rally his players the last day.
"We have 12 important meetings tomorrow, but you would like to take this quick departure as you saw it in Brooklyn, as you saw it in Medina.
This dynamic, when it goes in a sense, puts a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We have established our training accordingly and put the guys as we plan to do it, we're trying to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas has been assigned the task of counter-attacking and will face Rory McIlroy in the first-class duel, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the highest half of the ranking.
"I accompanied this group of guys in this order because I think it covers the entire course," Bjorn said about his selections in simple.
The new warship of Germany is still being postponed
According to local media, the new German Navy fleet should have been put into service in 2014 to replace warships dating from the cold war, but it will not be in service until at least next year due to defective systems and exponential expenditures.
According to Die Zeit newspaper, which cites a military spokesman, the implementation of the "Reinland-Pfalz", the Admiralship of all the new Bade-Wurtemberg frregates, was postponed to the first half of 2019.
The ship should have integrated the Navy in 2014, but the worrying problems that occurred after delivery have compromised the fate of this ambitious project.
The four ships of the Bade-Wurtemberg class that the Navy ordered in 2007 will replace the old-fashioned Breme fleets.
It is certain that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a range of anti-air and anti-navir missiles, as well as some furtive technologies, such as radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to deploy the most recent fractals for a period of up to two years outside the access ports.
According to Die Zeit, however, the continuous delays mean that warships - which should allow Germany to design its extra-sea force - will already be obsolete when they are put into service.
Last year, the F125 cursed flag made big titles when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into service and sent it back to the shipyard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
It was the first time that the Navy returned a ship to a shipbuilder after its delivery.
The reasons for this return were not known, but the German media mentioned a number of "software and material defects" that would render the warship useless in the event of deployment in a combat mission.
The weaknesses of the software were particularly important as the Bade-Wurtemberg class ships would be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, which corresponds to half of the old Bremen class frigate crews.
In addition, it appears that the ship is considerably overloaded, which reduces its performance and reduces the capacity of the Navy to make future improvements.
The "Reinland-Pfalz" of 7,000 tonnes is estimated to weigh twice as heavy as the German-based similar-class ships used during the Second World War.
In addition to the failures of the computer system, the cost of the project as a whole - including the training of the team - also becomes a problem.
It is said that it has reached the astronomical amount of €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion), compared with $2.2 billion at the start.
The problems associated with the new fregats are of particular importance in the light of recent alerts that the German naval force decreases.
Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Commission, earlier this year acknowledged that the Navy is in fact "short of capable of deploying".
The manager stated that the situation had had a snowball effect over time, as the old ships had been decommissioned but no replacement ships had been designated.
He regretted that none of the Bade-Wurtemberg class frregates could have joined the Navy.
The National Trust oversees the secret life of the mice
New research carried out in an area of the Scottish Highlands is seeking to reveal how the mice use the landscape in their search for food.
It is hoped that the observations will shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and guide future conservation activities.
The study of researchers from the National Trust for Scotland will follow common and soprano pipelines as well as long-eared brown-haired chauves and Daubenton in the Inverewe garden in Western Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed in key locations around the property to monitor the activities of mice throughout the season.
NHS personnel and volunteers will also conduct mobile studies using portable detectors.
A professional analysis of the sound will determine the frequency of the storms and the activities of the different species.
A map and a habitat report will be prepared to draw up a detailed picture of their behaviour at the territorial level.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation advisor for the NTS, hopes that the results will reveal the most important habitat areas for mice and how they are used by each of these species.
This information will determine the benefits of habitat management such as the creation of prairie and the best way to preserve forests for mice and other related species.
In Scotland and the United Kingdom, the slum populations have decreased considerably over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affect the perch and lead to the loss of their habitat.
The windmills and lighting can also pose a risk, as can the rubber paper and certain chemical treatments of the construction materials, as well as the attacks of the company chats.
The mice are not really blind.
However, given their nightly hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated echolocation techniques to detect insects and obstacles on their flight route.
Responsible for the protection of over 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, the NTS takes the mice very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly carry out surveys, searches and sometimes rescues.
The organization has also established the first and only reserve of Scotland’s silhouettes on the Thrave site in Dumfries and Galloway, which covers eight of the ten species of Scottish silhouettes.
David Thompson, the domain manager, says that the site is the ideal territory for them.
"Here, in Thrave, we have an ideal place for the nuns," he said.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and all the good habitat.
But there is still much to learn about the mice, so much so that the work we do here and elsewhere will help us better understand what the mice need to thrive."
He stressed the importance of verifying the presence of mice before the maintenance of the properties, because by destroying without the will of a single motherhood nest, 400 women and young women could be killed, even the disappearance of a whole local population.
The rats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, disturb them, or destroy their perch.
Elizabeth Ferrell, the Scottish head of Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our mice and about many of our species, we don't know what's going on in their populations for the moment."
Ronaldo rejects allegations of rape while his lawyers prepare to prosecute a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described rape charges against him as "false information", and claimed that people "want to get to know themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are ready to continue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The attacker of Portugal and Youth was accused of violating an American named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He would then have paid $375 000 to keep the incident silent, Der Spiegel said last Friday.
Addressing her 142 million fans in an live video on Instagram, a few hours after the allegations were spread, Ronaldo, 33 years old, described this information as “false information”.
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false information," the fifth winner of the Gold Ball said to the camera.
“ They want to make the pub by using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but it's part of the job.
I am a happy man and everything is fine," the player added smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are prepared to continue Der Spiegel on these allegations, which they have described as "inadmissible denial of suspicion in the field of privacy".
Counsel Christian Schertz said that the player would seek compensation for "moral damage of an amount proportionate to the severity of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious violations of the human rights of the last few years".
The alleged incident would have taken place in June 2009 following the hotel-casino le Palms, in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a box at night, Ronaldo and Mayorga appear to be back in the player's room, where an anal rape would occur, according to documents filed with the Clark County Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and assured him to be a "good guy" to "99%", but he did not know what was going on with the remaining "1%".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had had sexual relations but that they were consented.
Mayorga also claimed that she had gone to the police and that photos of her injuries had been taken in a hospital, but that she had subsequently accepted a regulation to the friend because she felt "feared by reprisals" and feared "to suffer a public humiliation".
This 34-year-old woman says she is now seeking to cancel this regulation because she remains traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join the Real Madrid by leaving Manchester United at the time of this alleged aggression, and this summer he joined the Italian Juve giant under a 100 million euros contract.
Brexit: The United Kingdom would "never regret" the departure of car manufacturers.
According to Greg Clark, the State Secretary for Trade, the United Kingdom would "never regret it" if it had lost its world-leading post-Brexit.
He added that it was "anxious" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that it would temporarily stop production in its factory in Burnaston, near Derby, if Britain withdrew from the EU without an agreement.
"We need an agreement," Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer indicated that the impact of delays at the border in the possibility of a Brexit without agreement could cost jobs.
The Burnston plant, which manufactures Toyota Auris and Avensis vehicles, built nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the other countries of the European Union.
"I consider that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production will stop in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, expressed their fear of leaving the EU without agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW indicates that it will close its Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are that car manufacturers qualify for risks for the supply chain in the case of Brexit without agreement.
Toyota's production line is operated in "tenduary flow", which comes every 37 minutes from UK and EU suppliers for vehicles manufactured on command.
If, on 29 March, the United Kingdom leaves the EU without agreement, there could be disturbances at the border which, according to industry, could result in delays and lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep the inventory for more than one day at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and production would be stopped.
According to Clark, the Theresa May Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid these checks at the border".
"We need an agreement. We want the best agreement that will allow, as I said, not only to benefit from the current success but also to seize this opportunity," he said in BBC Radio 4's Today.
"The evidence, not only of Toyota but of other manufacturers, is that we must be absolutely able to maintain what has become an excellent set of supply chains."
If Toyota was unable to specify how long the production would have been stopped, however, it warned that in the longer term, additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and end up costing jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, the coordinator of the United trade union at the factory and who has been working for 24 years in Burnaston, said that his members were increasingly concerned: "After my experience, once these jobs are gone, they never come back."
A spokesperson for the government said, "We have proposed a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU."
The White House announces that the Trump and Rosenstein meeting could still be delayed
According to the announcement made on Sunday by the White House, the meeting, which presents important issues, between Donald Trump and Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "refused for one week", while the struggle for the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh continues.
Rosenstein oversees Robert Mueller's work, the Special Adviser to Investigate Russian interference in the elections, the links between Trump and Russia's collaborators and the possible obstacles to the President's justice.
The question of whether Trump will return to the Deputy Attorney General, and thus endanger Mueller's independence, has been feeding the rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had spoken of carrying a micro in order to record talks with Trump and the possibility of eliminating the president by Amendment 25.
Rosenstein has denied these claims.
On Monday, however, he introduced himself to the White House, while he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, then in the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would "do better not" to refer Mr. Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed in order to avoid a confrontation with the hearing of the Senate Judicial Commission before which Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford testified, one of the women who accused him of sexual assault.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation into complaints against Kavanaugh, delaying the Senate's vote.
Sunday, Trump's press associate, Sarah Sanders, made an appearance at Fox News.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "No date has been fixed for this, it could be this week, I could see if we can rest another week given all the other things that happen to the Supreme Court.
But we will see and I like to keep the press informed."
The statement would be challenged by some journalists: Since September 10, Sanders has held no press conference at the White House.
Animator Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the rareness of conferences was not due to an aberration for "demagogic" television reporters, although she said, "I have nothing against the fact that they are breaking up the gallery."
Then she got to know that the direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
Without quoting any evidence, she added that "the President participates in more questions-response sessions than any other President before him": "We have verified the figures."
Press conferences will always take place, Sanders said, but "If the press has the chance to question the President of the United States directly, it is much better than talking to me.
We're trying to do it often, you've seen it well over the last few weeks, and this will take place at a press conference where you can talk to the President of the United States."
On a regular basis, Trump answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public meetings or press conferences with dignitaries.
It is rare that there are press conferences on the ground.
This week, in New York, the president may have shown why, by making an uncontracted appearance and at times a strange appearance in front of the assembled journalists.
On the concerns about Brexit, the Secretary of Health wrote to EU workers in NHS Scotland
The Secretary of Health wrote to EU officials working within the Scottish NHS to express their gratitude for the country and to wish to remain in office after Brexit.
Scottish Parliamentarian Jeane Freeman sent a letter within a period of less than six months before the United Kingdom withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to covering the cost of status applications for European citizens working in its decentralised public services.
Freeman wrote in his letter: "In the summer, negotiations on withdrawal continued between the UK and the EU and should come to an end this fall.
But the British government has also intensified its preparations in the event of a lack of agreement.
I understand that this period must be very disturbing for each and every one of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate to what extent I consider the contribution of each member of staff, whatever his nationality.
Members from all over the EU and beyond provide valuable experience and skills that consolidate and improve the work of health services and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is entirely your home and we really want you to stay here."
After having suffered a head injury, Christian Abercrombie undergoes an emergency surgery
Sselon Mike Organ, of Tennessee State, Christian Abercrombie, the second of the Tennessee Tigers, was urgently operated after a Saturday head injury in the defeat of the Vanderbilt Commodores 31-27.
Rod Reed, the head coach of Tennessee, told reporters that the injury had occurred just before the mid-term.
"It came on the touch line and collapsed there," Reed said.
Trainers and medical personnel have given oxygen to Abercrombie on the touch line before placing it on a Civic and taking it to another test.
A representative from Tennessee told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was out of the Vanderbilt Medical Center operating room.
Harris stated that there was "not yet any clarification of the type or extent of the injury" and that the State of Tennessee was trying to determine when the injury had occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year athlete, is in her first season with the State of Tennessee after her transfer from Illinois.
He had five plates in total on Saturday before leaving the game, which led to his total from season to 18 plates.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp right if they purchase property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp rights if they buy property in the United Kingdom and additional money will be used to help homeless people under the new conservation regimes
This measure will cancel the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters
The increase in stamp duty will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Treasury expects to collect up to 120 million Sterling books a year to help homeless people.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp tariff if they buy a property in the United Kingdom - additional money will help homeless people, Theresa May will announce today.
This measure will be seen as an initiative to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters by committing themselves to providing more affordable housing and targeting high-income people.
The increase in stamp law will be imposed on individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and additional money will be used to strengthen government efforts to help homeless people.
This surplus - which is added to the current stamp law, including the higher levels established two years ago on secondary residences and rentals - could reach 3%.
The Treasury expects the project to collect up to 120 million Sterling books per year.
About 13% of London's new buildings are purchased by non-residents in the United Kingdom, which increases prices and prevents the first-person access to a place on the housing market.
Many rich areas of the country - particularly in the capital - have become "phantom cities" because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
This new policy occurs only a few weeks after Boris Johnson has demanded a reduction in stamping rights in order to help more young people acquire a first home.
Accused by the large construction companies to maintain the real estate prices at a high level by cutting land without using them, she invited May to give up quotas on affordable housing in order to settle the "immobilisation" that is operating in the United Kingdom.
Mr. Corbyn presented an attractive series of reform proposals in the housing sector, including the control of rents and the removal of "no error".
He would also like to give advice to larger authorities to build new homes.
Ms. May said: "Last year, I declared that I would devote my position as prime minister to the rebirth of the British dream - that every new generation would have a better life.
To do this, we need to repair our damaged housing market.
Britain will always be open to all those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is unfair that it would be as easy for individuals who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as for foreign companies to buy a house as for British residents who work hard.
For many too many people, the dream of accessing property has become remote and the misery of homeless remains too real."
Jack Ross: My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland.
Sunderland technician Jack Ross explains that his "final ambition" is to become the Scottish selector at a given time.
The 42-year-old Scottish takes pleasure in raising the challenge of reinvigorating the North-East Club, which currently occupies the third place of League 1, at three points of the leader.
He picked up the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren to the First League Scotland last season.
"I had to play for my country as a player.
I was selected for Division B and that's all," Ross told the BBC Scotland Sportsound.
"But I grew up following the Scottish games in Hampden with my father and it's something I've never forgotten.
This opportunity would be presented, however, only if I succeeded in managing the club."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland's electors are Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Alloa Athletic's former technician said he didn't hesitate to rank behind such emblematic names in such a big club, having already declined Barnsley and Ipswich Town's proposals.
"For me, the success of the moment will be measured in the light of the question "Can I bring this club back to the First League?"
From the structure and infrastructure of this club, it certainly belongs to the First League," he added.
"It's not easy to get there, but I wouldn't probably think of myself as a success here unless I could get the club back there."
Ross has only three years of career as a coach, after a period as a assistant in Dumbarton and 15 months in Hearts trainers.
He then helped Alloa to re-establish a third division and transformed St Mirren, who was on the side of the re-legation, into the great winner of the championship next season.
Ross is more comfortable now than in his career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
Alloa's support "was without a doubt a real framework," he recalls.
"I really thought that being a coach was better than playing.
This seems strange because I got out of it well, that I earned my life well and that I took advantage of some valuable summits.
But sometimes it's hard to play.
There's a lot of detail to fix every week.
I continue to live with this in terms of stress and stress at work, but being a coach is very good for me.
I've always wanted to lead and now I'm doing it, I feel more comfortable in my skin than I've been in my adult life."

The summer cannula has made British pubs' income difficult, but has increased the pressure on restaurants' chains.
The figures indicate that groups of bars and pubs recorded an increase of 2.7 per cent of their sales in July, but revenues in restaurants fell by 4.8 .
Peter Martin, of the CGA's cabinet, who compiled the data, said: "The longer permanent solarisation and participation than expected from England at the World Cup made July follow the June model, where the bars had experienced an increase of 2.8%, except for restaurants, which had suffered an even more important shock.
The fall of 1.8% recorded in June in the area of restoration only took place in July.
Pubs and bars where alcoholic drinks are served are the most expensive away, with more points of similarity than the restaurants that are down.
Food pubs have also suffered from the effects of the sun, but not as much as the restaurants.
It seems that people just wanted to take a glass.
In pubs and bars, sales of drinks increased by 6.6% over the month and food decreased by 3%."
Paul Newman, a specialist analyst at the RSM Leisure and Hotel, said: "These results follow the trend observed since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the most important factors for sales on the outside market.
It is not surprising that the restoration groups continue to experience difficulties, although a decrease in sales of 4.8 per cent on an annual average is particularly painful, in addition to continuing pressure on costs.
The long and warm time could not have been less suitable for food operators and time will tell us whether the more moderate temperatures we knew in August will give a well-deserved reputation."
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowdown in the installation.
Industry sales are monitored by the Coffer Peak Tracker for the UK pubs, bars and restaurants sector, which collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of more than 9 billion Sterling books and constitutes the standard in the established industry.
On social media, one child in five has secret accounts he hides from his parents
According to one survey, one child in five -- some of whom are only 11 years old -- has secret accounts on social media that he hides from his parents and teachers.
A survey conducted by 20,000 secondary students revealed an increase in "false Insta" pages
The news has raised concerns about the publication of sexual content
20 per cent of students reported having a "main" account to show their parents
A child in five - some of whom are only 11 years old - opens an account on social media that he keeps hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary students revealed a rapid growth of Insta's "false accounts" - a reference to the Instagram photo sharing site.
The news raised concerns about the publication of sexual content.
20 per cent of students reported managing a clean “main” account to show their parents, while having a private account.
A mother who accidentally fell on the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter discovered a teenager who encouraged others to "violent me".
According to the study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools, 40% of 11-18-year-olds have a double profile, half of students who recognize private accounts.
CSM head Mike Buchanan said: "It is worrying that so many teenagers are being tried to create online places where parents and teachers don't find them."
Elid Doyle will represent the athletes in the Scottish Athletics Board of Directors.
Eilid Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Executive Board as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated Scottish athlete in athletics and President Ian Beattie has described this choice as an excellent opportunity for the leaders of this sport to take advantage of his extensive international experience over the past ten years.
"Eilid is highly respected within the Scottish, British and World Athletics community and we are sure that athleticism in Scotland would benefit greatly from its participation in the Council," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I really want to be the voice of athletes and I really want to be able to contribute and guide this sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200-metre and 400-metre trials in 1996 at the Atlanta Olympics where he won four gold medals and is now a regular BBC commentator, was unable to walk after having suffered a transitional ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago, I had an AVC.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors said that only time would tell me if I would recover or at what point.
It was a hard work, but I recovered completely, I've learned to walk again and today I'm doing agility exercises!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Online advertising on milk milk that compares mothers and cows divides opinions
An online advertising of a company offering milk is compared to breast-feeding mothers during trafficking.
In order to mark the launch of what is known as "first silent milk shot in the world", Elvie, a large public technology company, has launched a bold advertisement inspired by a musical video clip to show the freedom that its new milk shot offers to nursing women.
In a cow farm filled with hay, four true mothers dance at the rhythm of a song whose words are: "Yes, I betray myself, but you don't see a tail" and "In case you didn't notice it, these are my breasts, not mothers."
The refrigerant continues: "I pump it, I pump it, I feed the babies, I pump it, I pump it, I pump it, I help women with milk."
However, advertising, which has been published on the Facebook page of the company, has generated an online discussion.
With 77,000 visualizations and hundreds of comments, the video received conflicting reactions from the public, many of whom say that it sheds light on the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
"A worse decision than using cows to promote this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their babies are taken away in the days following their birth," wrote one of them.
The Elvie milk shot is discreetly adapted in a milking support (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: "It is understandable traumatism for the mother and the baby.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a milk shot for mothers who keep their baby?"
Someone else added, "A advertisement so disconnected."
Others defended advertising, such as a woman who admitted that she found the song "hilarating".
"I think it's a genius idea.
I'd have bought one if I was still on the line.
Pumper gave me the impression of being a cow.
Advertising is a little tough, but I took it for what it was.
It's a great product," said someone.
Someone else commented: "It is fun advertising for mothers who milk their milk (usually at their place of work or in the toilets) and feel like cows."
It's not advertising that makes the dairy industry's slogan."
At the end of the video, women revealed that they had danced with the discrete skid milks that were hidden in their support-gorge.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the idea that many women using milk milk say they have the impression of being cows.
However, the Elvie milk shot is completely silent, with no son or pipe and discreetly inserted into a milking support, which gives women the freedom to move, hold their baby, and even get out of their milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and DPE at Mother's, commented: "Elvie milk is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By making a parallel between nursing mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to focus on the extraction of breast milk and all its challenges, while expressing in a fun and reliable way the incredible feeling of freedom that this new milk will provide.
It's not the first time Elvie milk is making one of the newspapers.
During the fashion week in London, a mother of two children appeared on the stage of designer Marta Jakubowski while she was using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children settled quietly in a camp at the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained has increased considerably, although the number of monthly crossings at the borders has remained relatively stable, partly because of the fact that the Trump administration's severe speeches and policies have made it difficult for children to be placed in respondents.
Traditionally, most respondents were themselves paper-free immigrants and were afraid to compromise their own ability to stay in the country by bringing a child back.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential respondents and adult members of their home should submit their fingerprints and that these data would be transmitted to the immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Immigration and Customs Service, testified last week before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had made an application for the sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
The Agency subsequently confirmed that 70% of the persons arrested had no legal precedent.
"About 80% of the respondents or family members are illegal here, and many of them are foreign criminals.
Therefore, we continue to pursue these people," said Albence.
According to the refugees, in order to deal with children more quickly, the authorities introduced new rules that would require some of them to appear before the court in the month following their detention, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard.
Many of them will be compared by videoconference, rather than by anyone, to appeal their case with regard to their legal status before an immigration judge.
Non-eligible persons will be expelled quickly.
According to stakeholders and reports submitted over the past few months by the refugee network, the longer children remain in detention, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which may lead to outbreaks of violence or attempts to flee.
In a large establishment such as Tornillo, these concerns are exacerbated by the fact that signs indicating that a child is in difficulty are more likely to be neglected because of its size, according to the rights defenders of the child.
They added that moving children to the camp without giving them time to prepare emotionally or to say good-bye to their friends could accentuate a trauma that many have trouble handling.
Syria calls on the American, French and Turkish "occupational forces" to withdraw from the field.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, the Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in that country is now in its eighth year.
Moulem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil, under the pretext of combating terrorism, and that they would "be treated accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said to the assembly.
Moulem argued that "the war against terrorism is almost over" in Syria, while more than 360 000 people have died since 2011 and millions of others have been evicted from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue "to carry on this sacred battle until all Syrian territories are cleansed" both of the two terrorist groups and of any "illegal foreign presence".
The United States has some 2,000 soldiers in Syria, most of whom are trained and advised by both the Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces who oppose President Bakhar al-Assad.
In this war-torn country, France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the scene.
Moulem stated that the conditions were favourable for refugees to return, and accused “some Western countries” of “promoting irrational concerns” that deter refugees from returning.
"We have called upon the international community and humanitarian organizations to ensure that these returns are facilitated," he said.
"They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have indicated that there would be no support for the reconstruction of Syria as long as a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end this war would not be concluded.
United Nations diplomats claim that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey for the establishment of a buffer zone in the last rebel fortress of Idlib has made political negotiations progress.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has prevented a large-scale attack on the province where three million people live, by the Syrian forces supported by Russia.
However, Moulem stressed that the agreement provided for "precise time" and hoped that the military measures would target the jihadists, in particular the combatants of the Nusra Front, who are linked to Al-Qaeda and will "be eliminated".
Staffan de Mistura, a representative of the United Nations, hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee to gather government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution and prepare the way for the elections in Syria.
Moualem defined the conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the committee, stating that the work of the group should be limited to "the revision of the articles of the current constitution", and called for a warning against interference.
Why Trump will receive a second mandate
According to this logic, Mr. Trump would be re-elected in 2020, unless, as many liberal television viewers have no doubt expected, the resignation and scandal led him to leave his presidency prematurely.
What would certainly be "The most spectacular final of a presidency!"
At this point, the public shows no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, scores at peak hours have more than doubled, reaching 1.05 million on CNN, and have nearly tripled, to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at large hours, compared to 1.7 million years ago, and the “Rachel Maddow Show” of MSNBC, which reaches 3.5 million viewers at large evenings, is the first cable television channel.
"It's a matter that attracts people because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, a presenter of the ABC's "designated Survival" drama series, who talks about a minister who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a famous comic author and author of "Just the Funny Parts : And some unrefutable truths about sneaking into Hollywood Boys' Club," has another theory for him.
She recalls taking a taxi to Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told him he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why did she ask him?
"He said, "Because he makes me laugh," said Mrs. Scovell.
Chaos has a funny value.
Obviously, unlike anything that happens on television, Washington's scenarios could determine the future of the Roe v. Wade case, whether immigrant families can meet together and the health of the world economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most fortunate viewers can afford.
And yet, this is far more than being an informed citizen when we look back for six hours at a panel of experts discussing how Bob Woodward has used a "deep know-how" for his book "Fear", on the 15 000-dollar leather veston of Paul Manafort ("a dress full of pride" according to Washington Post) and the consequences of the extravagant descriptions that Stormy Daniels delivered from, uh, Mr. Trump's anatomy.
On my side, I'll never see Super Mario the same way again.
"If part of what it does gives the impression of seeing a television show, it's because it makes you take advantage of something every night," said Brent Montgomery, Director General of Wheelhouse Entertainment and Creator of "Pawn Stars", about changing teams and returning to Trump's daily situation (if you fight with the NFL, congratulate Kim Jong-un).
We can't afford to miss an episode unless we're on the train.
When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, he was 26 degrees home on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was inside looking at MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not take off, not with Brett Kavanaugh, who was preparing to face the Judicial Committee of the Senate and the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
"I remember the time when we animated all these crazy shows and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," said Mr. Fleiss.
"I thought it was a kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

The money from the outside envelopes the most closed semi-mandate elections
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania is flooded with money, thanks to a re-adjustment of the Congressional districts that allowed two holders to compete in the same seat.
The district of Pittsburgh, which has recently been restructured, is the seat of the Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who has deposed his seat in another constituency during the special elections in the last spring.
Lamb is measured by another holder, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, which runs the new 17th district.
The cards were redisfied when the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that the former rounds were unconstitutionally manipulated in favour of the Republicans.
The race of the new 17th district led to a confrontation with the funding of electoral campaigns between the major sectors of party financing, the Congress Committee for the Democratic Campaign (CCCD) and the National Committee for the Republican Campaign (CNCR).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a victory of justice last March at a very popular special election in the 18th district of the Congress of Pennsylvania.
The seat was held by a Republican for over a decade and President Donald Trump won the victory in the district by 20 points.
Politologists have granted a slight advantage to the Democrats.
The United States planned to penalize the Savior for his support for China, then withdrew
The diplomats found that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, which Washington did not object to.
Mr. Trump had a friendly meeting with the Panamanian president Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the management of the Trump Organization.
Representatives of the Department of State decided to convene the heads of the American diplomatic missions in Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama to protest against "their recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, spokesperson for the Department, at the beginning of the month in a communiqué.
However, sanctions were only imposed against Salvador, which received US aid estimated at $140 million in 2017, notably to control drugs and provide development and economic support.
The sanctions envisaged, including reductions in financial assistance and visa-oriented restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high rates of unemployment and homicide.
While internal meetings continued, North American and Central American representatives delayed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity to follow up on a similar meeting held last year, perceived as progress in efforts to prevent immigrants from moving to the United States.
But in mid-September, the senior officials of the administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to continue, thus ending any consideration of sanctions against the Savior.
Vice-President Mike Pence now eight spoke at the conference, scheduled for mid-October, to show the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, informed the diplomats.
And the three American broadcasters are peacefully returned to Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without any new severe messages or punishment from Washington.
A spokesperson for Mr. Bolton at the White House refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American dignitaries, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal discussions under the cover of the anonymity.
Their speech was corroborated by an independent analyst close to the administration, who also remained anonymous.
Study history
The next floor could be the report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller on the possible obstacle to Mr. Trump's justice. The public record is now supported by substantial evidence.
Mr. Mueller would also point out his investigation into the question of a conciliation of Mr. Trump's campaign with Russia in his attack on our elections.
If Congress's control changes hands, Mr. Trump will be required to report to this body, when he is prepared to represent himself before the electors and perhaps before a jury composed of his peers.
There are many 'yes' there, and I do not claim that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable - nor that of his counterparts in Europe.
We all have decisions to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the potential duration of this struggle.
In 1938, the German officers were about to organize a coup d'état against Hitler, if only the West had held his head and dismissed the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around these milestones and the inevitable march of democracy accelerates or is delayed.
The Americans are currently facing a number of these strikes.
What will we do if Mr. Trump refers the deputy to Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a delicate situation since this paper reported that last year he proposed to register the president secretly and gave assumptions about his inability to perform his duties.
Mr. Rosenstein said the Times report was incorrect.
"What will we do if the recently requested FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not exhaustive or impartial - or if it is confirmed to the Supreme Court in spite of allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, are we going to vote in the mid-term elections for a Congress that will apply for accounts to Mr. Trump?
If we do not succeed in these trials, democracy will be a long winter.
But I am convinced that we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew deported to Auschwitz under the Nazi regime, which has occupied my ambassador's residence in the past.
She survived, immigrated to America, and, sixty years later, sent me to light candles of the Sabbath on the table that was swastika.
With this inherited heritage, I cannot be optimistic about our future."

Graham Dorans des Rangers, trusting the Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will receive the Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the victory against the Austrians, following the impressive zero match in Spain against Villarreal at the beginning of the month, will place them in a strong position to qualify for Group G in the League of Europe.
A knee injury has deprived Graham Dorrans of his first participation in the season until zero 2:2 against Villarreal, but it is convinced that Rangers are able to pull the best of such a result to realize exploits.
"It was a positive point for us because Villareal is a quality team," said the 31-year-old attacker.
“We went into the game by thinking about getting something and we’ve split it with a point.
We might have been able to bring it to an end, but, in general, a match was probably a fair result.
They were probably better at the first half and we got back in the second half and we were the best team.
Thursday is another important European evening.
With a little chance, we can hope to get three points, but it will be a difficult match because they made a good result during their last match, but I am sure we can continue and get a positive result with the crowd behind us.
Last year was really difficult, between my injuries and the changes to the club as such, but there is a satisfaction factor about this place now.
The team is good and the guys have a lot of fun; training is good.
Let's hope we can go ahead now, leave the last season behind us and triumph."
Women no longer find sleep because of this fear of their savings-retirement
Although participants in this survey knew clearly how they wanted to be taken care of, few people raised the issue with their families.
Nearly half of those who participated in the national study said they were talking to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 per cent reported speaking to their children.
"People want a member of their family to take care of them, but they don't do what they need to have this conversation," said Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the Life Insurance Branch of Nationwide.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children about this: You cannot prepare your family to provide you with care if you do not communicate your wishes well in advance.
Work with your advisor and your family to determine where and how you can receive care, as these options can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Call your financial advisor: Your advisor is also able to help you establish a way to pay these fees.
Your long-term care funding decisions can include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy that will help you cover these expenses or other insurance on your property - provided you have the means to ensure it.
Prepare your legal documents: Avoid legal battles at the pass.
Provide a health care department that will allow you to designate a trusted person who will check your medical care and will ensure that professionals respect your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Consider also a department regarding your financial resources.
You will choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and will ensure that you pay your bills if you are hit with disability.
Consider the details: Suppose your elderly parent has a medical emergency and goes to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
List these details in a written document to be well prepared.
"Is there not only the finances that are at stake, but also the doctors?" Martin asked.
"What are the medicines?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Put this plan in place. ”
A man was injured several times with a compressed air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man received several bullets fired with a compressed-air rifle when he was going to go down on a night.
The victim, aged 40 years, was in the Oxford Grove region of Ilfracombe, in Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Policemen described the incident, which took place at 2:30 p.m. as a "random act".
The victim didn't see his attacker.
His injuries do not threaten his life, and the police called witnesses.
Seismes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and a tsunami that devastated the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, announced the authorities, and the balance sheet should be updated.
As the communications were paralysed, the relief services were unable to receive any information from the Dongala Regency, a zone located in the north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the magnitude earthquake 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated as a result of the disaster.
Some essential facts about Palu and Dongala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, located at the tip of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, whose population was estimated to be 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when earthquakes and tsunamis took place.
Dongala is a regency that is located more than 300 km (180 miles) north-west of the island of Sulawesi.
The population of the regency, an administrative region located below a province, was estimated to be 299 200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main pillars of the economy of the province of central Sulawesi, and in particular of the coastal region of Dongala.
The extraction of nickel is also an important activity in the province, but it is mainly located in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongala have been affected by tsunamis several times for a century, according to the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongala.
A tsunami also hit the west of Dongala in 1996, killing nine.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Seismic Fire Circle and is regularly suffocated by earthquakes.
Here are some of the main earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake, which occurred on 26 December on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh, triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, making 226,000 victims on the Indian Ocean Coast, including more than half of them in Aceh.
2005 : Several violent earthquakes shook the west coast of Sumatra in late March at the beginning of April.
A few hundred people died on the island of Nias, off Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake reached the south of Java, Indonesia's most inhabited island, triggering a tsunami that hit the south coast and caused nearly 700 casualties.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck Padang, the capital of the province of Sumatra West.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake devastated one of the islands of Mentawai, along Sumatra, and triggered a tsunami of more than 10 metres that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: An overcrowded earthquake has shaken Pide Jaya's regency in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, reminding the inhabitants of the devastation caused by the earthquake and the deadly tsunami of 2004.
No tsunami was caused this time, but more than 100 people were killed by the collapse of buildings.
2018: Important earthquakes have shaken the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed several thousand buildings and left thousands of temporarily blocked tourists.
Sarah Palin's older son was arrested for marital violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice-President Sarah Palin, was arrested for aggression.
Palin, 29-year-old from Wasilla, Alaska, was interviewed for suspected marital violence, contrary to a report of marital and arrest-resistant violence, according to a communiqué published on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, he would have taken the phone from a female knowledge who tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is placed in temporary detention in Mat-Su's temporary detention centre and is held under an unsecured guarantee of $500, reported KTUU.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, declaring himself "not guilty, it is certain" when his complainant was asked to do so, announced the network.
Palin faces three Class A offences, which means he could be sentenced to a prison sentence of up to one year and is liable to a fine of $250,000.
He was also accused of having committed a class B minor offence, punishable by a day of imprisonment and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges are brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, contacted the police to report this alleged aggression.
The case is pending before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with marital violence, interference with the report of a crime of marital violence and possession of a weapon of drunkenness in connection with the incident.
His companion claimed he had hit him in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after linking her son's violent behavior with the PTSD resulting from her service in Iraq.
Seismic in Indonesia: several hundred deaths
At least 384 people died as a result of the earthquake that devastated the Indonesian island of Sulawesi last Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and devastated thousands of houses.
The electricity and telecommunications networks are in progress and the victims' balance should be balanced in the coming days.
The earthquake was declared just outside the centre of Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Videos broadcast on social media show the impact point.
Several hundred people had met for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami broke out on the coast.
Federal prosecutors claim a rare death penalty for a suspected terrorist attack in New York
New York federal prosecutors are calling for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the alleged rapist of New York who has committed eight victims - a rare penalty that has not been applied in this state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, a 30-year-old, would be using a truck hired at Home Depot to attack a cyclist on the West Side Highway, in Lower Manhattan, on his pedestrian road and a cyclist last October.
In order to justify a death sentence, prosecutors will have to provide evidence that Saipov "intendedly" murdered the eight victims and "intendedly" inflicted serious bodily harm, according to the statement of intention to apply for the capital punishment filed with the South District of New York.
These two charges are likely to result in the death penalty, according to the judicial document.
A few weeks after this aggression, a large federal jury sentenced Saipov to 22 heads of prosecution, including eight charges of murder for extermination of funds, usually used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases and one for crimes of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "minimum preparation and pre-meditation", said prosecutors, describing the method used by Saipov as "hate, cruel and depravity".
"Sayfull Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injuries, damage and loss to family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," says the statement of intent.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
The South District of New York had not claimed the death penalty in prosecutions for ten years.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of the murder of two drug traffickers but was subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was applied in a New York federal case, it was in 1953 in the case concerning Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed to commit conspiracy and espionage to the USSR during the two years that followed the Cold War.
Both Rosenberg were executed by electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, originating in Uzbekistan, has demonstrated a lack of remorse in the days and months that followed the tragedy, according to judicial documents.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he was pleased with his actions.
Saipov told the authorities that he had been encouraged to commit the attack after watching Daesh's videos on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to display Daesh's flag in his hospital room, the police said.
He pleaded not guilty to the 22 heads of prosecution.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, stated that he was "of course disappointed" in the decision to try to prosecute.
"We believe that the decision to apply for the death penalty rather than accept his plea of guilt and condemn him to life in prison without the possibility of release can only prolong the trauma associated with these events for all concerned," Patton said.
The defense team in Saipov had already asked the prosecutors not to claim the death penalty.
A Conservative Member claims that NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for Brexit's negotiations
Nigel Farage today promised to "mobilize the popular army" during a demonstration at the conservatives' conference.
The former UK Independence Party indicated that politicians should "sympathize with the pressure" of Eurosceptics - as one of Theresa May's Members suggested, it should be responsible for negotiating with the EU.
The Conservative Peter Bone said during the Birmingham march that the United Kingdom "would have already been released" if Mr. Farage had been secretary to Brexit.
But the dilemma with which Mrs May is confronted to reconcile her deeply divided troops has been highlighted by the Conservatives in favour of the idea of staying in the Union that have joined an isolated protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister has trouble maintaining his Cheques compromise plan despite the threats of those who want to leave and those who want to stay as well as the EU.
The Allies stressed that it would continue its efforts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite hostilities - and would oblige Eurosceptics and workers to choose between its programme and the chaos.
Mr. Bone pointed out at the Left Means Leave Assembly in Solihull that he wanted to "get rid of Cheques".
He felt that Mr Farage should have become a partner and that he should be entrusted with the task of negotiating with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we would have already been out," he said.
Wellingborough's MP added, "I will defend Brexit, but we must get rid of Chequers."
Expressing its opposition to the EU, he continued: "We have not been delivered to world wars to submit ourselves.
We want to make our own laws in our own country. ”
Mr. Bone rejected the suggestions that public opinion had evolved since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people turned the page and wanted to stay is completely false."
The conservative Andrea Jenkyns, who was in favor of the exit, was also present at the march to tell reporters: "I just say: Madam Prime Minister, listen to people.
Chequers is not appreciated by the general public, the opposition will not vote for, it is also the case of our party and our militants who walk the streets and elect us above all.
Leave the Cheques and start listening."
In a message addressed to Ms. May, she added: Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they fulfill their promises."
"Mr. Farage indicated at the meeting that politicians should be led to "smooth pressure" if they were about to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"It is now a matter of trust between us - the people - and our political class," he said.
They're trying to fool Brexit and we're telling them today, "We won't let you get away with it."
He added in a message addressed to the enthusiastic crowd: "I want you to feel pressure on our political class that is about to betray Brexit.
We mobilize the popular army of this country that has enabled us to win the victory in Brexit and we will not stop until we become an independent, autonomous and proud UK."
Meanwhile, pro-European fans walked through Birmingham before organizing a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small number of militants branded conservative banners against Brexit after the group was launched this weekend.
His working counterpart, Lord Adonis, laughed at the Conservatives because of the security issues related to the party's implementation at the beginning of the conference.
"They are the ones who assure us that they are able to put in place the computer systems and all the technology for Canada, plus, for the free border, for free trade without frontiers in Ireland," he added.
"It's a real farce.
A good Brexit, it doesn't exist," he added.
Warren intends to consider seriously the possibility of presenting himself to the presidential elections
On Saturday, Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would seriously consider presenting herself to the presidential elections after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat discussed his future on Saturday at a public assembly in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a often critical vote on President Donald Trump, is presented for the November re-election against Geoff Diehl, a representative of the GOP in the States, who was co-chaired in 2016 for the Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
It was at the centre of speculation that could face Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was its 36th meeting with voters in a public assembly since Trump took office.
One participant asked if she intended to present herself to the presidency.
Warren replied that the time had come "for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government, which involves having a woman at the head of the state."
Arrest at the death of Sims of the State University of Louisiana
On Saturday, Baton Rouge police in Louisiana announced that a suspect had been arrested in connection with the death by ball of the Wayde Sims basketball player, an LSU basketball player, Friday.
Baton Red Police Service participated in the arrest of Dieteon Simpson, 20 years old, at 11.00 H.E. Press conference.
On Friday, they posted a video of the shooting, asking for help to identify a man who was on the images.
Yes, 20 years old, he was killed by a Friday morning dance near the campus of Southern University.
"Wayde Sims received a head injury and hit his wounds," said police chief Murphy J. Paul to the media on Saturday at 247 sports.
Wayde took his friend's defense and was beaten by Simpson.
Questioned, Simpson admitted to being on the scene, in possession of a gun, and fired on Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and put in custody for police service in East Baton Rouge Paris.

Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton headed for the world title after the team's guidelines enabled him to win the victory against Sebastian Vettel
It quickly became evident from the time Valtteri Bottas qualified to take on Lewis Hamilton last Saturday that the Mercedes team's signs would play an important role in the competition.
From the pole position, Bottas took a good start and broke Hamilton on the flank while defending his place in the first two tours, and invited Vettel to attack his team partner.
Vettel entered the stands first and left Hamilton to enter the tower at the tail of the platoon, which should have been a decisive element.
Mercedes passed through the stands a later turn and found himself behind Vettel, but Hamilton took advantage after an action of wheeled wheel that saw the Ferrari pilot come across the internal part of the risk of resisting a double defense attempt in the third turn.
Max Verstappen left the last line of the grid and was the seventh at the end of the first round to celebrate his 21th birthday.
He then dominated a large part of the race, but now his tires to aim for a speedy arrival and take Kimi Raikkonen to fourth place.
He finally arrived in the stands at the 44th turn, but was not able to speed up the pace in the eight remaining turns, Raikkonen ranking fourth.
It's a hard day because Valtteri did a great job all weekend and he was a real gentleman who let me pass.
The team has done an exceptional job to get one or two," Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language
During a meeting last Saturday, President Donald Trump laughed at Senator Diane Feinstein, who stressed that she had not revealed Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing the candidate of sexual assault at the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the President did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate's judicial commission, but he argued that the events that took place in the Senate showed that people were "bad, disgusting and dishonest".
"The only thing that could happen and the good thing that has happened in the Senate these last days is when we see anger, when we see people in anger and angry and disgusting and dishonest," he said.
"When they saw the revelations and the leaks, they said, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you disclose any information?
Remember his answer... did you disclose information - "Oh, oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't reveal anything."
Well, wait a minute.
We have disclosed information... No, we have not disclosed information," he added, thinking about the senator's impression.
Feinstein received the letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh last July, and the disclosure took place at the beginning of September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his office.
"I didn't dissimulate Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't disclose his story," Feinstein told the committee, said The Hill.
"She told me to keep this confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked."
But his denial does not seem to be well received by the president, who commented Saturday night at the assembly: "I will tell you, it was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
In pursuing his defence of the candidate to the Supreme Court, accused of sexual assault by three women, the President made it clear that the Democrats used these allegations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain power by all means.
You see the wickedness, the mesmerism, they wonder who they hurt, who they need to scratch to get power and control," said the president in Mediate.
Elite League : Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars erased their defeat on Friday in Elite League against the Belfast Giants by defeating the 5-3 back match in Dundee last Saturday.
The Giants opened the score thanks to two goals of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought home equality before Dwyer won't benefit the Giants.
François Bouchard evened for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen entered two goals, guaranteeing them victory.
This was the third defeat of the season in Elite League for the players of Adam Keefe, who had fought Dundee 2-1 Friday night in Belfast after being captured.
This was the fourth confrontation of the season between the two camps, the Giants having won in the last three matches.
Dwyer gave the advantage to the fourth minute, at 3:35, thanks to a pass by Kendall McFull, while David Rutherford served Beauvillier who doubled the placement four minutes later.
During a well-loaded first period, Sullivan relaunched the local team at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt entered the service of Cownie, at 15:16, with an equalization.
Dwyer assured the Giants' advance before the first break when he hit his second goal of the evening towards the end of the first period.
The local team gathered and Bouchard once again leveled with a goal that would give a digital advantage at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran worked together to help Nielsen put Dundee in the head for the first time in the match at the end of the second period, thus ensuring the victory of his team by marking a fifth goal in the mid-term.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five matches, will welcome Milton Keynes during their next match on Friday.
An air traffic controller died helping hundreds of people on board a plane to escape the earthquake
A Indonesian air traffic controller is greeted in heroes after he died by ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of people can safely take off.
More than 800 people were killed and many others were killed after an important earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi last Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong replicas continue to destroy the region, and a large number of people are trapped under decommissionings in the city of Palu.
But despite the flight of his colleagues, Antonius Gunawan Agung, aged 21, refused to leave his post in the violently kidnapped tour at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
It remained in place to ensure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the track at that time, could safely derail.
He then jumped out of the control tower when he felt it would collapse.
He died at the hospital later.
Yohannes Sirat, spokesperson for Air Navigation Indonesia, said that this action could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian ABC News.
We have mobilized a Balikpapan helicopter in Kalimantan to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
"Our heart is broken to learn this," he added.
The authorities fear that the number of deaths could reach thousands, the disaster prevention agency in the country indicating that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The balance sheet would continue to fade because many bodies were still under the shade and a large number could not be secourted," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for the agency.
Waves measuring up to six meters have devastated Palu, which will celebrate a Sunday mass funeral.
Military and commercial aircraft provide assistance and food.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "At every minute, an ambulance brings bodies back.
The clean water is rare.
Mini-markets are pillaged everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, responsible for the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is short to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find.
This is already a tragedy, but it could worsen."
Joko Widodo, the president of Indonesia, arrived at Palu on Sunday and addressed the country's soldiers: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" said CNN.
Indonesia was rescued earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok that caused more than 550 deaths.
A plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now states that a man disappeared after the crash of a plane in the lagoon.
The airline managing the flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now claims that a man has disappeared, after the 47 passengers and crew members safely evacuated the plane that was running.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon, she was unable to find the trace of a male passenger.
The airline indicated that it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to locate the man in question.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more specific information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local ships participated in the rescue of other passengers and crew after the plane crashed by trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
The authorities stated on Friday that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline claimed on Saturday that six passengers were still in the hospital, and that they were all in a stable state.
The cause of the crash and the exact course of events remain uncertain.
The airline and the US Navy reported that the plane had landed in the lagoon near the landing track.
Witnesses thought the plane had crossed the track.
American passenger Bill Jaynes indicated that the plane had arrived too low.
"It's a very good thing," says Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and the others had been able to slide into the water until the escape from the plane was running.
He claimed that the crewmen panicked and yelled, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy stated that marines working close to the improvement of a quay had also participated in the rescue using a pneumatic boat to transport people on the ground before the plane ran in about 30 metres (100 feet) of water.
The data from the Air Safety Network indicate that 111 people have died in accidents of air carriers registered in Papua New Guinea in the last two decades, but none of them were concerned with Air Niugini.
The analyst presents the chronology of the night when the woman was burned alive
The prosecution updated its record on Saturday during the trial of a man accused of burning a woman in Mississippi in 2014.
The analysis by the Department of Justice Paul Rowlett of the United States testified for hours as an expert in the field of information analysis.
He described to the jury how he used records of phone calls made from a portable to trace the movements of the defendant of 29 years old, Quinton Tellis, and of the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers, the night that the defendant died.
Rowlett reported that he had obtained location data from several mobile phones that indicated that Telllis was with Chambers on the night of his death, which contradicted his previous statements, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his mobile phone was at Chambers while he was claiming to meet his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to Sanford.
Sanford appeared at the Saturday bar and testified that he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis had told the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford replied that he "was lying, because my truck was in Nashville".
Another inconsistency is that Tellis said he knew Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Phone records show they've known each other for a week.
Rowlett claimed that some time after Chambers died, Tellis removed the SMS, calls and coordinates of Chambers from his phone.
"He erased her from her life," Hale said.
The defense must begin its pleas Sunday.
The judge stated that he expected the trial to be held before the jury in the course of the day.
The High Breed: What is the political hip hop?
A trio hip hop wants to expose the negative vision of the genre by impregnating its music of positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that the hip hop has distanced itself from its origins of political messages and social problems.
The group wants to renew its roots and make the hip political hop popular again.
Artists such as The Escapes and Commons have experienced a recent resurrection in the United Kingdom through such artists as Akala and Lowkey.
Another Black?!
A New Yorker continues a couple in court to have licensed it after a "racist" text
A New Yorker continues a couple in court for discriminatory dismissal after receiving an error message from the mother who complained that she was "another Black".
The couple refuse to be racist, and assimilates the pursuit of "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed her confusion by finding in 2016 that Giselle Maurice, the new noun, was Black at her arrival for her first working day.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her to Ms. Maurice twice.
According to the New York Post, after understanding her pocket, "bad at ease", Plasco-Faxman referred to Ms. Maurice, explaining that their former novel, which was African-American, had done a bad job and that she was expecting a Philippine instead.
Ms. Maurice was paid for a working day, then returned to her home by a Uber.
Now, Maurice continues the couple in court in order to obtain compensation for her return and claims an allowance of $350 per day for the six-month domestic service for which she was initially hired, but without contract.
"I want them to understand, listen, we don't do this kind of thing," she explained in the Post Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple replied to the allegations of racism by saying that it was reasonable to put an end to Maurice's employment, fearing that he would not be able to trust her after she was injured.
"My wife had sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," Joel Plasco said in the Post.
"But would you trust your children to someone you've been impotent with, even if it was a mistake?
Your new baby?
Let's see! ”
Assembling the trial with a "extortion", Plasco claimed that his wife was only two months old to have a baby and was in a "very delicate situation".
"Would you follow someone like that?
This is not a very pleasant thing to do," the business banker added.
While the case is still ongoing, the public opinion court has not hesitated to denounce the couple on social media, blaming them for their behavior and logic.
The editors of Paddington were afraid that readers would not identify themselves to a bear who spoke, revealing a new letter
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, born shortly after the book was accepted, said about this letter: "It's hard to replace someone who's been reading it for the first time before her publication.
It's very fun, knowing what we know about the enormous success of Paddington."
She stated that her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before writing the book for children inspired by a small bear in a fight, would remain optimistic about the rejection of his work. She added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of books had a taste of "sweet-sweet" after his death last year.
She describes Paddington as a "very important member of our family", adding that her father was very proud of her final success.
"He was a pretty calm man, and he wasn't a pretender," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who did something: we are proud of him, even though it is not really his own achievement.
I think he saw the success of Paddington this way.
Although it is his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he has always attributed merit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye to her phone.
At the landing, his daughter had been taken urgently to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 of Nice, where the doctors tried everything to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to explain how bad the situation was, we didn't expect it to happen," said Ednan-Laperous.
"Then Nad called me to warn me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that the doctors had given him to maintain heart rate were slowly draining and getting out of his system.
She was dead a while ago and everything stopped.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that it was all going on.
I couldn't scream or cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to hold the blow."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperous, in mourning for her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, without worrying about the test she was going through.
"No one was aware," she said.
"I had my head down, and I was crying all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it's during the flight that I've experienced this immense sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and my understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Deplorable women place postcards to prevent suicides on the bridges.
Two women who lost their loved ones by suicide are trying to prevent others from losing their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys displayed, on a gallois bridge, postcards containing inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Ms. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at age 18.
"I don't want no parent to feel what I'm forced to feel about the daily," she said.
Ms. Davis, aged 45 and living in Lydney, said that her son was a promising leader with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that his smile lit any room."
However, he quit his job before he died, since he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, it was Tyler's brother, then 11 years old, who found his brother after he committed suicide.
Ms. Davis said, "I constantly fear that there is an effect of training."
Ms. Davis created the cards "to let people know that there are people you can go see and talk to, even if it is a friend.
Don’t be silent - you have to talk. ”
Mrs. Humphreys, a long-standing friend of Mrs. Davis, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after her mother died.
"He didn't say he was down, depressed or other," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed his change of attitude.
It was his lower Christmas day - when the children opened their presents, he had no visual contact with them or anything."
She pointed out that her death was an enormous trauma to them, but they had to get out of it: "It's disgusting for the family.
It destroys us.
But we all have to go ahead and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future was under way as the FBI began its investigation.
"I thought that if we could get something like what he asked - a limited investigation in time, limited in its scope - we could perhaps bring some unity," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee would "fall" into a partisan impasse.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their reticence is due to the choice of the moment.
The mid-term elections will only take place in five weeks, or 6 November. If, as planned, Republicans carry out a bad score, they will be seriously weak in their attempts to make the man they want to be elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush intercepted the phone to call the senators, asking them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and met, through his wife Ashley, who was then his personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI has submitted its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
We do not yet know if Mr. Kavanaugh can obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice-president, to separate the vote and confirm it before the Supreme Court.
North Korea: the number of deserters "fall" under Kim's direction
The number of North Korean deserters to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un's rise, seven years ago, said a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from the Department of Southern Unity, said that 1,127 deserts had taken place last year, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that strengthening border controls between North Korea and China and increasing passenger tariffs were key factors.
Pyongyang made no public comments.
The vast majority of North deserters will eventually be granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul claims that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most fled through China, which shares the longest border with North Korea and is easier to break than the very protected demilitarized zone (DMZ), located between the two Koreas.
China considers deserters as clandestine migrants rather than refugees and often rapists.
The relationship between the North and the South - which is technically still at war - has improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang in the framework of talks focused on the negotiations on denuclearization that had so far been suspended.
This occurred after the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-one in Singapore, during which they agreed, in large lines, to work for a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, the North Korean Minister for Foreign Affairs Ri Yong-ho charged US sanctions with the lack of progress since then.
"In the absence of confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under such circumstances, it is excluded that we are the first to operate unilateral disarmament," said Mr. Ri in a speech before the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi describes Brett Kavanaugh as "hysterical", and asserts that he is unable to sit at the Supreme Court
Pelosi, leader of the parliamentary minority, qualified the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh as "hysterical" and declared that he was unable to sit at the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi made these comments as part of a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I could not help but think that if a woman had acted this way, they would have treated her as "hysterical", Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Court of Justice last Thursday.
Kavanaugh, with emotion, denied the allegations that he would have sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh became very emotional and sometimes failed to scream and suffocate by talking about his family and his years of high school.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats sitting on the committee, calling for allegations of "gross murder and coordinated" organized by the Liberals who were disappointed that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi stated that according to her, Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he was unable to sit in the Supreme Court, since he showed that he was against the Democrats.
"I think he is discrediting himself with these statements and how he took them to Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when he was asked if she would try to replace Kavanaugh if he had been confirmed, and if the Democrats had obtained the majority in the House of Representatives.
"If he does not tell the truth at Congress or the FBI, he is not only unable to sit in the Supreme Court, but also unable to sit in the court where he is currently," Pelosi said.
Currently, Kavanaugh is a judge of the DC Circuit Appeals Court.
Pelosi also added that as a democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he was considered a conservative judge.
During his confirmation hearings, Mr. Kavanaugh raised the question of the possible reversal of certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It is not the time for a hysterical and partial person to go to court and wait for what we say: "is not wonderful," said Pelosi.
And women have to use it.
It's a legitimate diatribe, months and years of anger that dries up, and she can't get it out without crying.
"We'll cry when we're angry," Mrs. Steinem said 45 years later.
"I don't think that's weird, and you?"
"I was greatly helped by a woman who was in charge somewhere, who told me that she would also cry when she got angry, but she developed a technique that allowed her to tell the person she was talking to, when she got angry and cried: "You can think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she went on.
And I found this brilliant."
The tears are allowed as exuberance to anger, in part because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most remarkable memories of a first job, in an office dominated by men, where one day I found myself crying out of unexpressed rage, was that I had been caught by the skin of the neck by an elderly woman - a cold director who always had a little frightened me - who led me into a ladder.
"Don't let them at all see you cry," she said.
“They don’t know that you’re angry.
They believe you sad and they are happy because they have you."
Patricia Schroeder, then Democratic Member of Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential election.
In 1987, while Mr. Hart had been taken into an extra-conjugal case on board a boat called Monkey Business and had withdrawn from the campaign, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, said there was no reason for her not to explore the idea of presenting herself to the presidency.
"It wasn't a moderately thought-out decision," she said, laughing, 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in high school, and the last thing they missed was one more person.
Someone called it "Blanche-Neige and the Seven Nains".
As the campaign was very advanced, it had been delayed in the collection of funds, and therefore swore that it would not participate unless it had collected $2 million.
The battle was lost in advance.
She learned that some of her supporters, who usually gave $1,000 to men, would only give her $250.
"Do they think I have the right to a discount?" she asked.
When she announced in her speech that she would not launch an official campaign, she was so upset by her emotions - gratitude for the people who supported her, frustration over the system that made it so difficult to collect funds and target voters rather than delegates, and anger against sexism - that she felt ashamed of it.
"You would have thought I was a nervous depression," Mrs. Schroeder said about the press's reaction to her.
“ You would have thought Kleinex was my sponsor.
I remember wondering what they were gonna put on my tombstone.
"She'd cry?"
How the trade war between the United States and China could benefit in Beijing
The first escapes of the trade war between the United States and China have been overwhelming, and although the battle is far from over, a dispute between the countries could benefit in the long term in Beijing, according to experts.
US President Donald Trump launched the first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most important increase occurred this week with new customs duties affecting items worth $200 billion (150 billion pounds), thus paying half of all goods from China arriving in the United States.
Each time, Beijing has rescinded in kind, with all recent customs duties of 5 to 10 per cent of US$60 billion.
China has committed itself to equalizing the United States, and it is unlikely that the second largest world economy will fail.
To withdraw Washington is to surrender to the demands, but to surrender publicly to the United States would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Experts believe, however, that if Beijing can play its role properly, the pressures of the American trade war could have a positive effect on China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions conducive to economic slowdown in one or more countries is in fact much more dangerous than what observers previously recognized," said Abigail Grace, a research partner focusing on Asia, to the Center for New American Security.
Syria is "prepared" for the return of refugees, according to the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and seeks help to rebuild this country devastated by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Moualem, said that the situation in the country would improve.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The Government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normality.
All conditions are now met for the voluntary repatriation of refugees in the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have deserted the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Six other million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem stated that the Syrian regime would welcome assistance to the reconstruction of this devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from the countries sponsoring the insurrection.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The Europe team won the Ryder Cup 2018 by beating the United States team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 in the National Golf near Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe has won the title when the Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn's team broke the bar of 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who was in trouble during the major part of the tournament, sank his departure into the water at the 16th hole by 3 and moved his duel to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari excels in all its rounds, becoming one of the four players who have never reached 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament, whose first edition dates back to 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was the least well placed player of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen, Denmark.
The best golfer in the world, Dustin Johnson, has turned 2 and 1 face to English Ian Poulter, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
Veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia became Europe's champion of all time with a total of 25.5 career points.
"In general, I don't cry, but today, it's stronger than me.
It was a moving year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to recover the cut.
What matters is the team, and I am happy to have been able to help it," Garcia was excited after the European victory.
He passed the flame to his compatriot John Ram who won the American Gulf legend Tiger Woods 2-1 in simple, last Sunday.
"I feel an incredible pride, having beaten Tiger Woods, I grew up looking at this guy," said Rahm, 23 years old.
Woods lost his four matches in France and now holds a record of 13-21-3 careers in Ryder Cup.
A surprising statistics for one of the biggest golfers of all time, who has captured 14 major titles, just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had trouble finding the fairways all weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk commented after a disappointing performance regarding his team: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning, we had a moment when we put pressure on Europe.
We've left.
Hats in Thomas.
He's a great captain.
His 12 players all played very well.
We're going to group together, I'm going to work with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup committee and we're going ahead.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be captain.
We need to turn around.
We're getting over it."
